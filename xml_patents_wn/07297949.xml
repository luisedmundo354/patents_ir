<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An inspection apparatus and a semiconductor device manufacturing method using the same. The inspection apparatus is used for defect inspection, line width measurement, surface potential measurement or the like of a sample such as a wafer. In the inspection apparatus, a plurality of charged particles is delivered from a primary optical system to the sample, and secondary charged particles emitted from the sample are separated from the primary optical system and introduced through a secondary optical system to a detector. Irradiation of the charged particles is conducted while moving the sample. Irradiation spots of the charged particles are arranged by N rows along a moving direction of the sample and by M columns along a direction perpendicular thereto. Every row of the irradiation spots of the charged particles is shifted successively by a predetermined amount in a direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the sample.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As prior art inspection apparatuses in connection with the present invention, an apparatus using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) has already been launched on the market. This apparatus is designed in such a way that an electron beam converged slenderly is subjected to raster scanning at a raster width having an extremely small interval, forming a SEM image by detecting the secondary electron emitted from the object of inspection upon scanning, and extracting a defect by comparing the SEM image at the same position of different dice.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, many proposals have been made so far that a throughput can be improved by using plural electron beams, that is, multi-beams. The proposals disclosed are directed primarily to the way of forming the multi-beams and to the way of detecting the multi-beams. No proposal, however, have been yet made as to an apparatus that has completed a whole system for a defect inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to detect a defect of a mask pattern for use in manufacturing semiconductor devices or a pattern formed on a semiconductor wafer, a scanning electron microscope has been used. The scanning electron microscope requires a long time for inspection of a whole sample because the surface of the sample is scanned with one electron beam converged slenderly and the secondary electrons emitted from the sample are to be detected. In order to solve these problems, it has been proposed that the electrons from a plurality of electron sources are focused on the plane of a sample through a decelerating electron field lens and scanned to deflect the secondary electrons emitted from the surface of the sample by means of a Wien's filter, thereby guiding the deflected secondary electrons to a plurality of detectors (Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 28, No. 10, October, 1989, pp. 2058-2064).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For an apparatus for exposing a pattern of a semiconductor circuit or the like to the surface of a sample such as a semiconductor wafer or the like or for inspecting a pattern formed on the surface of such a sample by irradiating the surface of the sample with charged particle beams, such as electron beams or the like, or for an apparatus for subjecting the sample to very high precision processing by irradiating it with the charged particle beams, a stage is used that can align the sample in vacuum with high degree of precision.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When such a stage requires alignment at a very high level of precision, the stage uses a structure that it is supported in a non-contact way by means of a hydrostatic bearing. In this configuration, the vacuum level in a vacuum chamber can be sustained by forming a differential exhaust mechanism for discharging high pressure gases within the range of the hydrostatic bearing so as to prevent the high pressure gases to be supplied from the hydrostatic bearing from being emitted directly into the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An example of such a conventional stage is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>. In the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, a top end portion of a lens barrel <b>2001</b> of a charged beam apparatus for irradiating a sample with charged beams, that is, a charged beam irradiation portion <b>2002</b>, is mounted on a housing <b>2008</b> constituting a vacuum chamber C. The inside of the lens barrel is made in a vacuum state by discharging the air with a vacuum line <b>2010</b>, and the vacuum chamber C is made in a vacuum state by discharging the air with a vacuum line <b>2011</b>. Charged beams are irradiated from the top end portion <b>2002</b> of the lens barrel <b>2001</b> onto the sample S such as a wafer, etc. disposed thereunder.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sample S is detachably held on a sample table <b>2004</b> by conventional means. The sample table <b>2004</b> is mounted on top surface of a Y-directionally movable portion <b>2005</b> of an XY stage (hereinafter referred to as “the stage”) <b>2003</b>. The Y-directionally movable portion <b>2005</b> is slidably mounted on an X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b>, and the X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b> is slidably mounted on a stage table <b>2007</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The Y-directionally movable portion <b>2005</b> is installed with a plurality of hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b><i>a </i>on the surface (the left- and right-hand surfaces and the bottom surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) opposite to a guide surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>of an X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b>, and the Y-directionally movable portion is disposed so as to be movable in the Y-direction (in the left- and right-hand directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) while maintaining a fine clearance from the guide surface by means of the action of the hydrostatic bearing <b>2009</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b> is installed with a plurality of hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b><i>b </i>and is movable in the X-direction (in the left- and right-hand directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) while maintaining a fine clearance between the hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b><i>b </i>and the guide surface <b>2007</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A differential exhaust mechanism system is further mounted around the hydrostatic bearings so that no high pressure gases fed to the hydrostatic bearings leak into the inside of the vacuum chamber C. This configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Grooves <b>2017</b> and <b>2018</b> are disposed doubly around the hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b> and subjected to vacuum discharging always by means of a vacuum line and a vacuum pump (not shown). This configuration allows the Y-directionally movable portion <b>2005</b> held in vacuum in a non-contact state to be movable in the Y-direction. The grooves <b>2017</b> and <b>2018</b> of a double structure are formed on the surface with the hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b> of the movable part <b>2005</b> disposed thereon so as to encircle the hydrostatic bearings. The configuration of the hydrostatic bearings is a known one so that a detailed description will be omitted from the explanation that follows.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, the X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b> with the Y-directionally movable portion <b>2005</b> loaded thereon is a concave with the top face upwardly open. The X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b> is provided with the hydrostatic bearings and the grooves in substantially the same configuration, and it is held in a non-contact state on a stage table <b>2007</b> so as to be movable in the X direction. By combining the movement of the Y-directionally movable portion <b>2005</b> with the movement of the X-directionally movable portion <b>2006</b>, the sample S is transferred horizontally to an optional position with respect to the top end portion of the lens barrel, that is, the charged beam irradiation portion <b>2002</b>, and it is irradiated at the desired position with charged beams.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hitherto, a defect inspection apparatus for inspecting a defect of a sample such as a semiconductor wafer or the like has been used in a process for manufacturing semiconductors, the defect inspection apparatus being of a structure so as to inspect the defect of the sample by detecting a secondary electron generated by the irradiation of the sample with a primary electron.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This defect inspection apparatus uses technology designed to automate and render the inspection of defects of a sample more efficient by application of an image recognition technique. This technique is designed to subject pattern image data in a region of inspection on the surface of the sample, obtained by the detection of the secondary electrons, and pre-stored reference image data on the surface of the sample, to a matching operation with a computer and to automatically determine the presence or absence of defects on the sample on the basis of the result of the matching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Nowadays, there is a great demand in the field of manufacturing semiconductors to detect fine defects, as patterns are rendered finer. Under such circumstances, further improvements in precision of recognition are demanded for a defect inspection apparatus utilizing the image recognition technique as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hitherto, the process for scanning electron beams in the direction parallel to the direction of movement of a sample table and perpendicular thereto while continuously transferring the sample table (JP-A-10-134757, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open) has been known. Another scanning process is known which involves irradiating the surface of a sample with a primary electron beam diagonally in two-dimensions while projecting in a one-axial direction at equal intervals. It has further been known to perform inspections and so on by dividing electrons from each electron gun into a plurality of electrons and scanning each beam in one direction while continuously moving the sample table in the direction perpendicular to the scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As an electron beam apparatus for use in inspecting a defect of a mask pattern for use in manufacturing semiconductor devices or a pattern formed on a semiconductor wafer, there is known an electron beam apparatus of the type that inspects defects of a pattern on the sample, which comprises irradiating an aperture plate having a plurality of apertures with an electron beam emitted from a single electron gun to produce a plurality of images of the apertures, delivering the resulting plural images of the apertures onto a sample, and projecting the secondary electrons emitted from the sample onto the surface of a detector as an image by using a secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The conventional electron beam apparatus of that type, however, fails to take into account the dependency on the angle of the electron beam emitted from the electron gun, and it treats the magnitude of the electron beam as being uniform regardless of the angles of irradiation of the electron beam. In other words, the problem has not been taken into consideration that, in the electron beams emitted from the electron gun, an electron beam having a high magnitude of illuminance is emitted in the direction of the optical axis, however, the illuminance (magnitude) of the electron beam is gradually decreased as the electron beam becomes apart from the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, there is the problem that the rate of detection of the secondary electron emitted from the sample is high for the secondary electron emitted in the vicinity of the optical axis and that the rate of detection of the secondary electrons drops as the secondary electrons separate from the optical axis. The conventional electron beam apparatus, however, fails to take this problem into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An electron beam apparatus using a plurality of electron beams is also known, which is used for inspecting a defect in a circuit having a fine circuit pattern, such as a super LSI circuit, or measuring a line width of such a circuit pattern. Such an electron beam apparatus using multi-beams was proposed in order to solve the problem of a conventional electron beam apparatus of the type using one electron beam for forming or inspecting such a fine circuit pattern because such a conventional electron beam apparatus requires a long period of time for processing and fails to gain a sufficient degree of throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In connection with such an electron beam apparatus of the type using multi-beams, there is also known an electron beam apparatus, for example, of the type having a large number of electron emitters arranged in a matrix configuration, which is provided with an open mask between the surface of a sample and the surface of inspection in order to solve the problem that a level of precision in inspection could not be increased because intervals of a detector for detecting reflected electrons or a secondary electrons is extremely narrow so that the reflected electrons or the secondary electrons are likely to invade the detecting region from the adjacent irradiating region.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Moreover, there is known an electron beam apparatus of the type which forms a plurality of electron beams by irradiating a mask with plural apertures with an electron beam emitted from a single electron gun, in order to solve the problem that throughput is decreased due to the fact that scanning requires a long period of time if a defect of a pattern having a line width of approximately 0.1 micron is to be inspected by scanning the pattern on the sample with one electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to perform defect inspection, etc. on a sample having a device pattern having a minimal line width of 0.1 micron or smaller, the ability of a light system is in a limit of inspection from the viewpoint of resolution on the diffraction of light and, therefore it has been proposed that an inspection-evaluation apparatus that utilizes an electron beam. The use of the electron beam, however, has the problem from the viewpoint of productivity because a drastic decrease in throughput is caused, although resolution can be improved. An electron beam apparatus that is modified so as to use multi-beams to improve productivity is also known. More specifically, this known electron beam apparatus is configured in such a manner that the electron beams emitted from a single electron gun are irradiated onto a plurality of apertures and the electron beams passed through the apertures are subjected to scanning of the surface of a sample (hereinafter referred to sometimes as “sample surface”), thereby allowing the secondary electron to be emitted from each image and guiding the secondary electron to each of a plurality of detectors for inspecting the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a pattern formed on a sample surface such as a semiconductor wafer is to be evaluated with high accuracy by using result of a scanning operation of the electron beam, it is necessary to consider variation in the height of the sample. This is because differences in the height of the sample vary distances between a pattern on the surface of the sample and an objective lens by which the electron beam is to be focused on said pattern, and thereby focusing condition was not satisfied, resulting in deterioration of resolution, which make it impossible to perform an accurate evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to overcome this problem, an electron beam apparatus has been suggested that performs a focusing operation of the electronic optical apparatus in a manner whereby the light is irradiated against the sample surface at a certain angle, the reflected light thereof is utilized to measure the height of the sample, a measurement is fed back to the electronic optical system by which the electron beam is to be focused on the sample, and thereby the current and the voltage applied to the components of the electronic optical system are controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, in a method for irradiating the light against the sample at a certain angle, an optical component for reflecting the incident light, which is mainly composed of insulating material, should be disposed in a space between the sample surface and a lower surface of the electronic optical system. Thereby, the space between the sample surface and the lower surface of the electronic optical system has to be made wider than is required, while on the other hand, the wider spacing makes such problems as an aberration of the electronic optical system non-negligible. Accordingly, although it is required to perform focusing of the electronic optical system and simultaneously to solve such problems of aberration of the electronic optical system, such method by which both requirements are accomplish has not been suggested.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, since the focusing of the electronic optical system should be performed taking into account not only the distance between the sample surface and the lower surface of the electronic optical system but also a charging condition on the sample surface and a space-charge effect of the electron beam, if parameters relating to the focusing of the electronic optical system are not measured in an electronic optical manner, errors might possibly occur.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, there is another problem that, in a case that exciting current of a magnetic lens included in the electronic optical system is regulated to perform the focusing operation, a period from when the exciting current being set to a predetermined value until when a focal length of the electronic optical system is stabilized, namely settling time, must be taken rather longer, and consequently it is difficult to perform the focusing quickly. In another case where exciting voltage of an electrostatic lens is regulated to perform the focusing operation, a high voltage applied to the electrostatic lens shall be varied, which results in the same problem of longer settling time. Furthermore, there is another problem that evaluation by the electron beam results in low throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention has been made with a view solving the various problems described above, and an object of the present invention is to provide an electron beam apparatus capable of performing a focusing operation in an electronic optical system thereof in an electronic optical manner as well as in a short time, and a semiconductor device manufacturing method using the same apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a case that defects are to be inspected on a sample having a minimal line width of 0.1 micron or smaller, the inspection by means of a optical light system has a limit due to the resolution due to diffraction of light. Therefore, an inspection-evaluation apparatus using an electron beam has been proposed. The use of the electron beam has improved resolution, however, since it has an extremely decreased throughput, there is a problem from the point of view of productivity. A patent application has been made for an invention relating to an electron beam apparatus for inspecting a sample by using multi-beams with the object to improve productivity, which comprises irradiating a plurality of apertures with electron beams emitted from a single electron gun and scanning the sample with the electron beams passed through the plural apertures, thereby guiding the secondary electron beam generated from each image reciprocally to a detector without causing crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A variety of technologies have been reported on apparatuses for observing and evaluating a sample including an insulating material. Among apparatuses installed with such technology, there are known apparatuses installed with a scanning electron microscope, which has a charging detection function for evaluating charging state by measuring beam current of a primary beam, a current absorbed into a sample, amount of electrons reflected from an irradiating apparatus, an amount of secondary electrons emitted, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Hitherto, there has been known an E×B energy filter for use in conducting an analysis of energy in a field where the electric field is orthogonal to the magnetic field, which allows charged particles to move straight in the direction intersecting with both the electric field and the magnetic field at right angles. This filter allows only the charged particles having a particular degree of energy in the electron beams to travel straight by means that deflection of the electron beams by the electric field is canceled by the deflection of the electron beams by the magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the energy filter of the E×B type, one having the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is proposed.

A voltage +V is applied to the electrode <b>2</b> and a voltage −V is applied to the electrode <b>2</b>′. These voltages are equal to each other as an absolute value and variable. A charged electron can travel straight in the direction intersecting both the electric field and the magnetic field, that is, in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A stage for accurately positioning a sample in a vacuum atmosphere has been used in an apparatus in which a charged beam such as an electron beam is irradiated onto a surface of a sample such as a semiconductor wafer so as to expose the surface of the sample to a pattern of a semiconductor circuit or the like or so as to inspect a pattern formed on the surface of the sample; it has also been used in another apparatus in which the charged beam is irradiated onto the sample so as to apply an ultra-precise processing thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When said stage is required to be positioned highly accurately, there has been employed a structure in which the stage is supported by a hydrostatic bearing in a non-contact manner. In this case, a vacuum level in a vacuum chamber is maintained by forming a differential exhausting mechanism for exhausting a high pressure gas in an extent of the hydrostatic bearing so that the high pressure gas supplied from the hydrostatic bearing is not directly exhausted into the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> show one of the examples of such stage according to the prior art. In the stage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, a tip portion of a lens barrel <b>2001</b> or a charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> of a charged beam apparatus for generating and irradiating a charged beam against a sample is attached to a housing <b>8</b> which makes up a vacuum chamber C. A sample S is detachably held on a sample table <b>2004</b>. Other structures of the stage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A differential exhausting mechanism is provided surrounding the hydrostatic bearing <b>2009</b><i>b </i>so that a high-pressure gas supplied to the hydrostatic bearing does not leak into the vacuum chamber C. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Doubled grooves <b>2017</b> and <b>2018</b> are formed surrounding the hydrostatic bearing <b>2009</b><i>b</i>, and are regularly exhausted to vacuum through a vacuum pipe by a vacuum pump, though not shown. Owing to such structure, a Y directionally movable unit <b>2005</b> is allowed to move freely in the Y direction in the vacuum atmosphere while supported in non-contact manner.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Those doubled grooves <b>2017</b> and <b>2018</b> are formed in a plane of the movable unit <b>2005</b> in which the hydrostatic bearing <b>2009</b><i>b </i>is arranged, so as to circumscribe said hydrostatic bearing.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, the stage including a combination of the hydrostatic bearing and the differential exhausting mechanism as described above has a problem that the overall structure thereof becomes more complex and rather larger in comparison with a stage of hydrostatic bearing type used in the atmospheric air due to the differential exhausting mechanism included therein, resulting in lower reliability as a stage and also in higher cost.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As for methods for compensating for magnification chromatic aberration and rotation chromatic aberration in the electronic optical system, a method using a symmetric magnetic doublet lens is well known. Since no rotation chromatic aberration is generated in the electro static lens system, the magnification chromatic aberration is compensated for by using a doublet lens.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As high integration of semiconductor devices and micro-fabrication of patterns thereof advance, an inspection apparatus with higher resolution and throughput has been desired. In order to inspect a wafer substrate of 100 nm design rules for defects, a resolution corresponding to 100 nm or finer is required, and the increased number of processes resulting from high integration of the device causes an increase in an amount of inspection, which consequently requires higher throughput. In addition, as multi-layer fabrication of the devices has progressed, the inspection apparatus has been further required to have a function for detecting a contact malfunction in a via for interconnecting wiring between layers (i.e., an electrical defect). In the current trend, a defect inspection apparatus of optical method has been typically used, but it is expected that inspection apparatuses using an electron beam may soon be mainstream, substituting for optional inspection apparatuses from the viewpoint of resolution and of inspection performance for contact malfunction. Defect inspection apparatuses using electron beam methods, however, has a weak point that it is inferior to that of optical method in throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, an apparatus having higher resolution and throughput and being capable of detecting the electrical defects is desired. It is known that the resolution in the optical inspection apparatus is limited to ½ of the wavelength of the light to be used, and it is about 0.2 micrometer for an exemplary case of a visible light in practice.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the other hand, in the method using an electron beam, typically a scanning electron beam method (SEM method) has been used, wherein the resolution thereof is 0.1 μm and the inspection time is 8 hours per wafer (20 cm wafer). The electron beam method has the distinctive feature that it can inspect for electrical defects (breaking of wire in the wirings, bad continuity, bad continuity of via); however, the inspection speed (sometime also referred to as the inspection rate) thereof is very low, and so the development of an inspection apparatus with higher inspection speed is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Generally, since inspection apparatus is expensive and the throughput thereof is rather lower as compared to other processing apparatuses, therefore the inspection apparatus has been used after an important process, for example, after the process of etching, film deposition, CMP (Chemical-mechanical polishing) flattening or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A inspection apparatus of scanning electron beam (SEM) will now be described. In the inspection apparatus of SEM, the electron beam is contracted to be narrower (the diameter of this beam corresponds to the resolution thereof) and this narrowed beam is used to scan a sample so as to irradiate it linearly. On the one hand, moving a stage in the direction normal to the scanning direction allows an observation region to be irradiated by the electron beam as a plane area. The scanning width of the electron beam is typically some 100 μm. Secondary electrons emanating from the sample by the irradiation of said contracted and narrowed electron beam (referred to as the primary electron beam) are detected by a detector (a scintillator plus photo-multiplier (i.e., photoelectron multiplier tube) or a detector of semiconductor type (i.e., a PIN diode type) or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The coordinates for an irradiated location and an amount of the secondary electrons (signal intensity) are combined and formed into an image, which is stored in a storage or displayed on a CRT (a cathode ray tube). The above description demonstrates the principles of the SEM (scanning electron microscope), and defects in a semiconductor wafer (typically made of Si) being processed may be detected from the image obtained in this method. The inspection rate (corresponding to the throughput) depends on the amount of the primary electron beam (the current value), the beam diameter thereof and the speed of response of the detector. The beam diameter of 0.1 μm (which may be considered to be equivalent to the resolution), a current value of 100 nA, and the speed of response of the detector of 100 MHz are currently the highest values, and in the case using those values the inspection rate has been evaluated to be about 8 hours for one wafer having a diameter of 20 cm. This inspection rate, which is much lower compared with the case using light (not greater than 1/20), has been a serious drawback.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">On one hand, as a method for improving the inspection rate, which is a drawback of the SEM method, a multi beam SEM using a plurality of electron beams is well known. Although this method can improve the inspection rate by an amount of number of plurality of electron beams, there are other problems associated with this method that since the plurality of electron beams is irradiated from an oblique direction and a plurality of secondary electron beams from the sample is taken out in an oblique direction, only the secondary electrons emanated from the sample at the oblique direction could be captured by the detector, that a shadow is generated on an image, and that since it is difficult to separate respective secondary electrons generated by respective plural electron beams, secondary electron signals are mixed with each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It can be noted herein that the conventional defect inspection apparatuses with SEM applied thereto have a small beam dimension so that the dimension of the resulting image and raster width become small. Therefore, the conventional apparatuses have the problem that a long period of time is required for inspection of a defect of a sample. Moreover, they may present the problem that a quality SEM image cannot be obtained because a wafer with an insulating material disposed on the surface thereof is charged with electricity when the beam current is made larger in order to accomplish high throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, apparatuses using multi-beams present various problems: the overall configuration of the entire apparatus as well as the electronic-optical system are not clear; the mutual interaction between the electronic-optical system and the sub-systems is not at all clear so far; moreover, as wafers as objects of inspection become larger, sub-systems of the apparatus must be compatible with larger-sized wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention has been accomplished with the above problems taken into account, and one object of the present invention is to provide an inspection apparatus in which an electronic-optical system with multi-beams can be used, and throughput can be improved, by harmonizing the electronic-optical system with the other parts constituting the inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another object of the present invention is to provide an inspection apparatus that can inspect an object of inspection with high precision by solving the problem relating to the SEM which arises from the charging with electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for the preparation of a device at high yield by inspecting an object of inspection such as a wafer and so on by means of the inspection apparatus as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The present invention provides an inspection apparatus for inspecting a pattern formed on an object of inspection by irradiating the pattern with an electron beam. The inspection apparatus comprises an electronic-optical system having sources of electrons, an objective lens, an E×B separator and an enlarging lens of at least one stage, the electronic-optical system being adapted to shape a plurality of primary electron beams, irradiate the object of inspection with the plurality of primary electron beams, accelerate secondary electrons emitted by the irradiation with the primary electron beams by means of the objective lens, separate the secondary electrons from the primary electron beams with the E×B separator, and project an image of the secondary electrons with an enlarging lens of at least one stage after separation of the secondary electrons from a primary optical system by the E×B separator.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The inspection apparatus further comprises a plurality of detectors for detecting the image of the secondary electrons projected by the electronic-optical system, a stage device disposed for holding the object of inspection and transferring it relative to the electronic-optical system, a working chamber arranged for accommodating the stage device and controlled so as to become in a vacuum atmosphere, a loader disposed for loading the object of inspection onto the stage device inside the working chamber, a voltage application mechanism system disposed in the working chamber for applying voltage to the object of inspection, and an alignment control device for controlling the alignment of the object of inspection relative to the electronic-optical system by observing the surface of the object of inspection for the alignment of the object of inspection relative to the electronic-optical system. The vacuum chamber is supported by the aid of a vibration isolator so as to block vibration from the floor on which said inspection apparatus is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The loader of the above inspection apparatus includes a first loading chamber and a second loading chamber, each being adapted to be capable of discretely controlling its atmosphere, a first transferring unit for transferring the object of inspection between the first loading chamber and the outside thereof, and a second transferring unit disposed in the second loading chamber for transferring the object of inspection between the inside of the first loading chamber and the stage device; wherein the inspection apparatus is further provided with a mini-environment space partitioned to feed the object of inspection to the loader.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, the inspection apparatus of this invention is provided with a laser gauge interferometer for detecting coordinates of the object of inspection on the stage device, wherein the coordinates of the object of inspection are determined with the alignment control device by utilizing a pattern existing on the object of inspection. In this case, the alignment of the object of inspection may include the rough alignment to be effected within the mini-environment space and the alignments of the positions in the X- and Y-directions and in the rotating direction to be effected on the stage device.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A further invention according to this application is directed to a method for manufacturing a device, which comprises detecting a defect on a wafer on the way or subsequent to the manufacturing process by means of the inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The prior art apparatuses, however, cannot efficiently prevent crosstalk between plural electron beams and detect secondary electrons from the sample surface. On the other hand, the present invention has an object to provide a charged particle beam apparatus that can prevent the occurrence of crosstalk and guide emitted secondary electrons efficiently to the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The charged particle beam apparatus <b>1000</b> according to the present invention may comprise at least one primary optical system for irradiating a sample with a plurality of primary charged particle beams and at least one secondary optical system for leading the secondary charged particles to at least one detector, wherein the plurality of the primary charged particle beams are irradiated at positions apart from one another by the distance resolution of the secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the primary optical system is provided with a function of scanning the primary charged particle beams at an interval wider than the interval of irradiation of the primary charged particle beams.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A stage device with a combination of the hydrostatic bearings and the differential exhaust mechanism system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> is arranged so as for the guide faces <b>2006</b><i>a </i>and <b>2007</b><i>a </i>opposite to the hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b> to reciprocally move between the high pressure gas atmosphere of the hydrostatic bearing portion and the vacuum environment within the chamber, upon transferring the stage device. At this time, gases are adsorbed onto the guide faces while being exposed to the high-pressure gas atmosphere, and the gases adsorbed thereon are allowed to be discharging on exposure to the vacuum environment. These actions are repeated. Therefore, whenever the stage device is transferred, a phenomenon occurs, in which the vacuum level within the chamber C is degraded, thereby rendering it difficult to conduct various operations, including exposure, inspection, processing, etc., by the charged beams and contaminating the sample with foreign materials.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Another object to be achieved by the present invention is to provide a charged beam apparatus that can perform various operations, including inspection, processing, and so on by means of charged beams while preventing a decrease in the vacuum level.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A further object to be accomplished by the present invention is to provide a charged beam apparatus disposed so as to produce a pressure differential between the region of irradiation of the charged beams and a support portion of the hydrostatic bearing, the charged beam apparatus having a non-contact support mechanism by means of a hydrostatic bearing and a vacuum sealing mechanism system by means of the differential exhaust.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a charged beam apparatus adapted so as to reduce gases emitted from the surface of a part opposite to the hydrostatic bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a defect inspection apparatus for inspecting the surface of a sample with the charged beam apparatus as described above or an exposure apparatus for delineating a pattern on the surface of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device by using the charged beam apparatus as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The invention of this application is directed to an apparatus <b>2000</b> adapted to irradiate the surface of a sample with a charged beam by loading the sample on the XY-stage and moving the sample to a chosen position within a vacuum atmosphere. In this apparatus, the XY-stage is provided with a non-contact support mechanism by means of the hydrostatic bearing and with a vacuum sealing mechanism by means of differential exhaust; the XY-stage is further provided with a partition for rendering conductance smaller between a portion where the sample is irradiated with the charged beams and a support portion of the XY-stage for supporting the hydrostatic bearings, and a pressure differential occurs between the region of irradiation with the charged beam and the support portion for the hydrostatic bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In accordance with the present invention, the stage device can achieve alignment performance with high precision within a vacuum atmosphere by applying the non-contact support mechanism by means of the hydrostatic bearings to the support mechanism of the XY-stage with the sample loaded thereon and arranging the vacuum sealing mechanism by means of the operating exhaust around the hydrostatic bearings to prevent the high pressure gas fed to the hydrostatic bearings from leaking into the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Moreover, the pressure at the position of irradiation with the charged beams is unlikely to rise because the gases are arranged unlikely to reach the position of irradiation of the charged beams by means of the partition apart from the position of irradiation with the charged beams, by which conductance can be made smaller, even if the gases adsorbed on the surface of a sliding portion of the stage are emitted whenever the sliding portion of the stage is transferred from the high pressure gas portion into the vacuum environment. In other words, the above configuration can accomplish processing of the sample by means of the charged beams with high precision without causing any contamination on the surface of the sample because the degree of vacuum at the position of irradiation with the charged beams on the sample surface can be stabilized and the stage can be driven with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The present invention is directed to the charged beam apparatus <b>2200</b> in which the differential exhaust structure is installed in the partition. In accordance with this invention, the partition is interposed between the hydrostatic bearing support portion and the region irradiated y charged beam, and the inside of the partition is installed with a vacuum exhaust passage to provide the differential exhaust mechanism. The differential exhaust structure can prevent gases emitted from the hydrostatic bearing support portion from passing through the partition and entering the region of irradiation with the charged beams. Therefore, the degree of vacuum at the position of irradiation with the charged beams can be made further stable.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The invention is directed to the charged beam apparatus <b>2300</b> in which the partition is provided with a cold trap function. Generally, in the pressure region having 10<sup>−7 </sup>Pa or higher, the major components of the residue gases in the vacuum atmosphere and the gases emitted from the surface of a material is water molecules. Therefore, if water molecules can be emitted in an efficient manner, a high degree of stability of vacuum can be sustained. On the basis of the concept as described immediately above, this invention is configured such that a cold trap, which is chilled at approximately −100° C. to −200° C., is disposed at the partition in order to allow the cold trap to freeze the gases emitted at the side of the hydrostatic bearing and trap them. The use of the cold trap makes it impossible or difficult for the emitted gases to enter the side of the region of irradiation with charged beam so that it becomes possible to sustain the degree of vacuum in the region of irradiation therewith in a stable manner. It is also to be noted herein as a matter of course that the cold trap is effective for the elimination of gaseous organic molecules such as oils, which are a major factor for impairing clean vacuum, as well as for the removal of the water molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The invention of this application is directed to the charged beam apparatus <b>2400</b> which is provided with partitions at two locations in the vicinity of both positions of the region of irradiation with charged beam and the hydrostatic bearings. In accordance with this invention, partition that can reduce conductance is disposed at two locations nearby the position of the region of irradiation with charged beam and the hydrostatic bearings so that the vacuum chamber is eventually divided into three smaller chambers consisting of a charged beam irradiation chamber, a hydrostatic bearing chamber and an intermediate chamber, each having a smaller conductance. The pressure in each of the chambers is set such that the pressure in the charged particle beam irradiation chamber is the lowest and the pressure in the hydrostatic bearing chamber is the highest, while the pressure in the intermediate chamber is in between.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The three chambers constitute a vacuum exhaust system. The arrangement of the partition enables the control the rate of variation in pressure at a low level even if a rise in pressure would occur in the hydrostatic bearing chamber by the emitted gases, because the pressure in the hydrostatic bearing chamber is set to be higher. Therefore, a variation in pressure in the intermediate chamber can be controlled to a lower level by means of the partition, so that a variation of the pressure in the irradiation chamber can further be lowered to a lower level by means of the additional partition. This arrangement of the partition can reduce any variation in pressure to a level that does not substantially cause any problems.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The present invention is directed to a charged beam apparatus in which the gases to be fed to the hydrostatic bearings of the XY-stage are dry nitrogen gas or an inert gas of high purity. The invention is directed to the charged beam apparatus in which the XY-stage is subjected to surface processing at least on the surface facing the hydrostatic bearing in order to reduce the emitted gases.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As described above, the gas molecules contained in the high pressure gases are adsorbed on the surface of the sliding portion of the stage when exposed to the high pressure gas atmosphere at the hydrostatic bearing portion, and they are caused to be released from the surface of the sliding portion thereof and emitted as emitted gases, when the sliding portion thereof is exposed to the vacuum environment, thereby worsening the vacuum level. In order to control the lowering of the degree of vacuum, it is required to reduce an amount of the gas molecules to be adsorbed on the sliding portion of the stage and to discharge the adsorbed gas molecules as quickly as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In order to achieve this, it is effective to remove gaseous components (such as organic materials, moisture, etc.), which are likely to be adsorbed on the surface of the part yet unlikely to be eliminated therefrom, from the high pressure gas to be fed to the hydrostatic bearings by removing a sufficient amount of moisture from the high pressure gas to give dry nitrogen gas or an inert gas of high purity (e.g. highly pure nitrogen gas, etc.). The inert gas such as nitrogen is low in the rate of adsorption on the surface of the part compared with moisture and organic materials and comparatively great in the speed at which it is eliminated from the surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Therefore, when an inert gas of high purity from which moisture and organic materials are eliminated to the highest possible extent is used as the high pressure gas, the amount of gases to be emitted can be controlled to a lower level and the emitted gases can be emitted quickly, upon transferal of the sliding portion from the hydrostatic bearing portion to the vacuum environment, thereby reducing the extent to which the degree of vacuum is degraded. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the rise in pressure when the stage is transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, it is also effective to subject the structuring parts of the stage, particularly the part being transferred reciprocally between the high pressure gas atmosphere and the vacuum environment, to surface processing thereby reducing an energy of adsorption with the gas molecules. When a metal is used as a base material, the surface processing may be carried out, for example, by means of processing with TiC (titanium carbide) or TiN (titanium nitride), nickel plating, passivation treatment, electrolytic polishing, composite electrolytic polishing, glass bead shot, and so on. When SiC ceramics is used as a base material, the surface processing may be carried out, for example, by means of coating with a fine SiC layer by means of CVD. Accordingly, it is further possible to reduce the rise in pressure when the stage is transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The present invention is directed to a wafer defect inspection apparatus for inspecting a defect on the surface of a semiconductor wafer by using the apparatus as described above. This invention provides an inspection apparatus that is high in inspection precision and causes no contamination of a sample, because the invention can realize an inspection apparatus that is highly accurate in the alignment performance of the stage and stable in the degree of vacuum within the region onto which the charged beam is irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The present invention is directed to an exposure apparatus for delineating a circuit pattern of a semiconductor device on the surface of a semiconductor wafer or a reticle by using the apparatus as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present invention can provide an exposure apparatus that is high in exposure performance and causes no contamination of a sample, because this invention can realize an inspection apparatus that is highly accurate in the alignment performance of the stage and stable in the degree of vacuum within the region on which the charged beam is irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The present invention is also directed to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor by using the apparatus as described in the above. This invention can provide a high quality fine semiconductor circuit by manufacturing the semiconductor with the apparatus that has high accuracy stage alignment performance and a stable degree of vacuum in the region of irradiation with charged beam.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Conventional technology has the problem a deviation in the position may be caused between an image of a secondary electron beam obtained by irradiation of an inspecting region on the surface of a sample with a primary electron beam and a reference image prepared in advance, so that precision of the inspection of the defect is lowered. This positional deviation may cause a big problem where part of an inspecting pattern is deleted from the inspecting image of the secondary electron beam due to a deviation of the irradiation region of the primary electron beam with respect to the wafer. This problem cannot be overcome alone by technology that optimizes the matching region within the inspecting image. It is further to be noted that this problem can become a critical defect in the inspection of a highly fine pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The present invention is completed on the basis of the above findings and it has an object to provide a defect inspection apparatus that can prevent a decrease in precision of the inspection of a defect caused by the deviation in the position between the inspecting image and the reference image.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Moreover, the present invention has another object to provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, which can improve a yield of device products as well as prevent the loading of defective products by conducting inspections of a defect of samples by means of the defect inspection apparatus having the above configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In order to achieve the above objects, the defect inspection apparatus <b>3000</b> according to the present invention is concerned with a defect inspection apparatus for inspecting a defect of a sample, which is composed of an image acquisition means for acquiring an image of each of a plurality of inspecting regions which deviate from one another while overlapping partially with one another on the sample, a means for storing a reference image, and a defect determination means for determining a defect of the sample by comparing the image of each of the plurality of the inspecting regions acquired by the image acquisition means with the reference image pre-stored by the meaning means. As the sample as an object of inspection, there may be selected any sample on which a defect is to be inspected. For the present invention, a semiconductor wafer is particularly preferred because it can demonstrate excellent effects.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present invention comprises an image acquisition means that is adapted to acquire the image of each of the plural inspecting regions which are deviated from one another while overlapping partially with one another on the sample, and the defect determination means for determining the defect of the sample by comparing the acquired image of each of the plural inspecting regions a stored reference image. As described above, the present invention can selectively utilize the reference image and the inspecting images less in the positional deviation in the subsequent step and consequently control a decrease in precision of detecting a defect due to the positional deviation because the images of the inspecting regions at different locations can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Moreover, even if the sample and the image acquisition means are located in a relationship in which part of an inspecting pattern may usually be deleted from the inspecting image region, there is the extremely high probability that the entire inspecting pattern may be located in any one region in which the images of the plural inspecting regions that are deviated in their positions from one another are covered. Therefore, errors in detecting a defect which may be caused to occur due to a partial deletion of the pattern can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The comparing means may be arranged so as to determine if the sample is free from defects, for example, when the sample is subjected to a so-called matching operation between each of the acquired images of the inspecting regions and the reference image and at least one image of the plural inspecting regions has no substantial difference from the reference image. Conversely, if the image of the entire inspecting region is substantially different from the reference image, it is determined that the sample involved has a defect.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the conventional technology as described above, electrons as many as three can be generated from one electron gun so that the disposition of a number of lens barrels is required. Further, for the above apparatuses, the electronic-optical system requires a partially semi-spherical inspection electrode. Moreover, the conventional technology adopts a system of the type that inspects minute inspecting regions one after another, so that the inspecting regions on which the electron beams are irradiated have to be changed frequently. Therefore, the inspecting surface (the sample) has to be transferred at an intermittent interval so that the time required for transferal of the sample is ineffective and consequently the time required for the inspection of the entire sample is considerably long.</p>

Further specifically, each of the points of irradiation of the primary electron beams is arranged so as to scan the sample by (the distance between the adjacent rows)/(the number of the columns N)+α in the direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the sample (in which α is the width of scanning in an overlapped manner together with the point of irradiation of the primary electron beam in the adjacent row, it could be from −1% to +20% of the scanning width, and it is usually approximately 10% or smaller of the scanning width).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">This arrangement can widen a width for irradiation with an electron beam in the direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the sample and conduct a continual inspection of the sample by means of such a wide width therefor. Each of M and N is an independent integral number which is greater than or equal to one.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The secondary electron beams to be detected by the secondary electron beam detector may be used for various measurements including, for example, measurements for a defect on the surface of a sample, measurements of a wire width of an integrated circuit to be formed on the surface of a sample, voltage contrast measurements, alignment precision measurements, and so on.</p>

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">It is to be noted herein, however, that even if a conventional example of an E×B energy filter having the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> would be used as an E×B separator of an inspection apparatus adapted to evaluate a semiconductor wafer by obtaining an image data by means of electron reams, a region around the optical axis where the primary electron beams travel straight without causing any substantial aberration cannot be rendered so wide.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">One of the reasons is because a conventional E×B energy filter has a complicated structure so that symmetry is not so good. In other words, no good symmetry makes it complicated in computing an aberration because a three-dimensional analysis of the electric field or the magnetic field is required for computing the aberration. Therefore, a long period of time is required for designing the optimal aberration.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Another reason resides in the fact that a region is narrow, where the electric field and the magnetic field are crossing the optical axis at right angles and the magnitudes of the electric field and the magnetic field are substantially uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The present invention has been completed on the basis of the problems prevailing in the conventional examples of the electron beam apparatuses and has one of the objects to provide an E×B separator that has a simple configuration and permits a simple calculation of aberration as well as a region around the optical axis where the magnitudes of the electric field and the magnetic field are uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The second object of the present invention is to provide an electron beam apparatus containing the E×B separator that can achieve the first object of the present invention and a method for the preparation of a device by evaluating the semiconductor wafer by using the electron beam apparatus as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In order to achieve the first object of the present invention, there is provided the E×B separator adapted to form an electric field and a magnetic field, each of which is crossing the optical axis at right angles and separates at least two electron beams which travel in different directions; which comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">an electrostatic deflector having a pair of electrodes for generating the electric field, each being in the form of a plate, which are disposed so as for the distance between the electrodes to become shorter than the length of an electrode crossing the electric field; and</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">an electromagnetic deflector of a toroidal type or a saddle type, which can deflect the electron beams in the direction opposite to the electrostatic deflector.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Further, the E×B separator may be configured in such a manner that the electrostatic deflector is provided with six electrodes for generating the rotatable electric fields.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Moreover, the E×B separator may preferably be configured in such a manner that the electromagnetic deflector of the toroidal type or the saddle type has two sets of electromagnetic coils capable of generating the electric field and the magnetic field in both directions and that the direction of deflection caused by the electromagnetic deflector can be adjusted to become opposite to the direction of deflection caused by the electrostatic deflector by adjusting a current ratio of the two sets of the electromagnetic coils.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In addition, the E×B separator is preferably configured in such a manner that the electrostatic deflector is disposed inside the electromagnetic deflector of the toroidal type or the saddle type, thereby forming the electromagnetic deflector in two divisions. The two divisions of the electromagnetic deflector may be readily combined integrally outside the outer periphery of the electrostatic deflector. Therefore, the E×B separator can be manufactured with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Furthermore, the present invention provides an inspection apparatus with the E×B separator installed therein for use in separation of the secondary electron beams from the primary electron beams, which is configured so as to irradiate the semiconductor wafer with the plural primary electron beams and detect the secondary electron beams from the semiconductor wafer with the plural detectors to give an image data and to evaluate the processed state of the semiconductor wafer on the basis of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">An object of the present invention is to provide a charged beam apparatus having a simple structure capable of being made compact without employing a differential exhausting mechanism for an XY stage. Another object of the present invention is to provide a charged beam apparatus provided with a differential exhausting mechanism for exhausting a region on a surface of a sample to which a charged beam is to be irradiated, as well as for exhausting an inside of a housing containing an XY stage to vacuum. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a defect inspection apparatus for inspecting a surface of a sample for defects or an exposing apparatus for printing a pattern on the surface of the sample by using either of the charged beam apparatuses described above. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor manufacturing method for manufacturing a semiconductor device by using either of the charged beam apparatuses described above.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In an apparatus of the present invention for irradiating a charged beam against a sample loaded on an XY stage, said XY stage is accommodated in a housing and supported by a hydrostatic bearing in a non-contact manner with respect to said housing; said housing in which said stage is accommodated is exhausted to vacuum; and a differential exhausting mechanism is arranged surrounding a portion in said charged beam apparatus, where the charged beam is to be irradiated against a surface of said sample, so that a region on said sample to which said charged beam is to be irradiated may be exhausted to vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">According to the charged beam apparatus of this invention, a high-pressure gas supplied for the hydrostatic bearing and leaked-out into the vacuum chamber is primarily evacuated by a vacuum exhausting pipe connected to the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Further, arranging the differential exhausting mechanism, which functions to exhaust the region to which the charged beam is to be irradiated, so as to surround the portion to which the charged beam is to be irradiated, allows the pressure in the irradiation region of the charged beam to be decreased to significantly lower level than that in the vacuum chamber, thus achieving stably a vacuum level where the processing to the sample by the charged beam can be performed without any troubles. That is to say, the stage with a structure similar to that of a stage of hydrostatic bearing type commonly used in the atmospheric pressure (a stage supported by the hydrostatic bearing having no differential exhausting mechanism) may be used to stably apply the processing by the charged beam to the sample on the stage.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In a charged beam apparatus of the present invention, a gas to be supplied to said hydrostatic bearing of the XY stage is dry nitrogen or a high-purity inert gas, and said dry nitrogen or high-purity inert gas is pressurized after having being exhausted from said housing containing said stage so as to be supplied again to said hydrostatic bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">According to the present invention, since the residual gas components in the vacuum housing are the high-purity inert gas, there should be no fear that the surface of the sample or any surfaces of the structures within the vacuum chamber defined by the housing would be contaminated by water contents or oil and fat contents, and in addition, even if inert gas molecular is adsorbed onto the sample surface, once being exposed to the differential exhausting mechanism or the high vacuum section of the irradiation region of the charged beam, said inert gas molecular would be released immediately from the sample surface, so that the effect on the vacuum level in the irradiation region of the charged beam can be minimized and the processing applied by the charged beam to the sample can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The present invention also provides a wafer defect inspection apparatus for inspecting a surface of a semiconductor wafer for defects by using either of the apparatuses described above. This allows to provide an inspection apparatus which accomplishes positioning performance of the stage with high precision and also provides a stable vacuum level in the irradiation region of the charged beam with low cost. The present invention also provides an exposing apparatus for printing a circuit pattern of a semiconductor device on a surface of a semiconductor wafer or a reticle by using either of the charged beam apparatuses described above. This allows to provide an exposing apparatus which accomplishes positioning performance of the stage with high precision and also provides a stable vacuum level in the irradiation region of the charged beam with low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The present invention also provides a semiconductor manufacturing method for manufacturing a semiconductor by using either of the apparatuses described above, which allows a micro semiconductor circuit to be formed by of manufacturing a semiconductor with the apparatus which accomplishes positioning performance of the stage with high precision and also provides a stable vacuum level in the irradiation region of the charged beam.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In a symmetric doublet lens, for example, when a reduction lens system is to be fabricated, two stages of lens are required and a size ratio of respective lenses should be equal to a reduction ratio thereof. For example, when the system with a reduction ratio of 1/10 is to be fabricated, there has occurred such problems that, since a size of a lens of a smaller size cannot be made smaller than that defined by a possible processing accuracy, for example, a bore diameter thereof is determined to be 5 mmφ and a lens gap to be about 5 mm, and accordingly, a lens of a larger side has to be of rather larger size with a bore diameter of 50 mmφ and a lens gap of 50 mm, and that, when a magnification ratio is to be varied in the practical apparatus, a symmetric condition would get out of order.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In the light of the problems described above, an object of the present invention is to provide an electronic optical system capable of controlling the magnification by using a lens system with two or more stages and also capable of compensating for a magnification chromatic aberration by using a single lens. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for evaluating a wafer in order to find a possible cause of deterioration of yield in the device manufacturing as soon as possible by using the apparatus described above.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The present invention provides an electron beam apparatus in which a plurality of electron beams is focused by a lens system including a condenser lens and then is formed into an image on a sample by an objective lens, said apparatus characterized in that a crossover position of said electron beam defined by a lens of a front stage of said objective lens is set to be in a proximal position of said lens system side of said objective lens. In the concrete, said crossover position is located in said lens system side with respect to a principal plane of the objective lens. Setting the crossover position as described above allows to reduce the aberration, in particular the chromatic aberration otherwise appearing in the electron beam formed into an image on the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The above-described plurality of electron beams may be a plurality of electron beams which has been emitted from a single electron gun as a single beam and passed through a plurality of apertures to be formed into said plurality of electron beams, a plurality of electron beams emitted from a plurality of electron guns, or a plurality of electron beams emitted from a plurality of emitters formed in a single electron gun. The present invention also provides a device manufacturing method in which a wafer in the course of manufacturing process is evaluated by using the electron beam apparatus described above.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The present invention employs a plurality of primary electron beams, in which said plurality of electron beams is made to pass through an E×B filter (Wien filter) to enter a surface of a sample at right angles while making a scanning operation in one-dimensional direction (x-direction), and secondary electrons emanated from the sample are separated from the primary electron beams by the E×B filter to be introduced at an oblique direction with respect to an axis of the primary electron beam and are formed into an image or focused on a detecting system by a lens system. A stage is moved along an orthogonal direction (y-direction) with respect to a scanning direction (x-direction) of the primary electron beam and thereby a serial image can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">When the primary electron beam passes through the E×B filter, a certain condition where a force applied to the electron beam by the electric field and that by the magnetic field are equal in intensity and opposite in direction (Wien condition) is established, so that the primary electron beam can go straight ahead.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">On the other hand, since the secondary electron beam has a direction opposite to that of the primary electron beam, the force applied to the secondary electron beam by the electric field and that by the magnetic field have the same direction, so that the secondary electron beam is deflected from the axial direction of the primary electron beam. As a result, the primary electron beam and the secondary electron beam are separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">When the electron beam passes through the E×B filter, the aberration of the electron beam becomes greater in the case of being deflected in comparison with the case of straight advance, and therefore, a plurality of detectors each corresponding to each of the primary electron beams required to be of high accuracy is provided, and the secondary electrons generated by one electron beam are introduced into a corresponding detector by said image forming system without exception.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">This make it possible to prevent a mixing of signals. A scintillator plus photo-multiplier is used as a detector. A PIN diode (semiconductor detector) may also be used as a detector. The present invention employs sixteen primary electron beams each having a beam diameter of 0.1 μm and a beam current of 20 nA, and a current value three times as much as that of the apparatus available on the market could be obtained.
<br/>
Electron Gun (Electron Beam Source)
</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In the present invention, a thermal electron beam source is employed as an electron beam source. An electron emitting (emitter) member is made of LaB<sub>6</sub>. Other material may be used for the emitter member so far as it has a high melting point (low vapor pressure at high temperature) and a small work function. Two kinds of methods are employed to obtain a plurality of electron beams. One is a method where a single electron beam is derived from a single emitter (with one projection) and then is passed through a thin plate with a plurality of apertures formed therein (aperture plate) to obtain a plurality of electron beams, and the other is a method where a plurality of projections is formed in one emitter and a plurality of electron beams is derived therefrom. Either case takes advantage of the property that the projection facilitates the emission of electron beam from the tip thereof. Other types of electron beam source, for example, a thermal electric field emission type of electron beam source may be used to emit the electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">It is to be appreciated that the thermal electron beam source method is such that the electron emitting member is heated to emit electrons, while the thermal electric field emission electron beam source is such method in which a high electric field is applied to the electron emitting member to emit electrons and further the electron emitting section is heated so as to stabilize the electron emission.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Vacuum Exhausting System</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In the present invention, a vacuum exhausting system is composed of a vacuum pump, a vacuum valve, a vacuum gauge, a vacuum pipe and the like, and exhausts to vacuum an electronic optical system, a detector section, a sample chamber, a load-lock chamber and the like according to a predetermined sequence. In each of those sections, the vacuum valve is controlled so as to accomplish a required vacuum level. The vacuum level is regularly monitored, and in the case of irregularity, an interlock mechanism executes an emergency control of an isolation valve or the like to secure the vacuum level. As for the vacuum pump, a turbo molecular pump may be used for main exhaust, and a dry pump of the Roots type may be used as a roughing vacuum pump. The pressure at an inspection spot (an electron beam irradiating section) is practically in the range of 10<sup>−3 </sup>to 10<sup>−5 </sup>Pa, more preferably, in a range of 10<sup>−4 </sup>to 10<sup>−6 </sup>Pa as shifted by one digit down.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Control System</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In the present invention, a control system is mainly composed of a main controller, a controlling controller, and a stage controller. The main controller is equipped with a man-machine interface, through which an operator manipulates the controller (a variety of instructions/commands, entry of a recipe, instructions to start an inspection, switching between an automatic inspection mode and a manual inspection mode, an input of all of the commands required in the manual inspection mode and so forth). In addition, the main controller further executes communication with a host computer in a factory, a control of a vacuum exhausting system, control of carrying and positioning operations of a sample such as a wafer, an operation for sending commands and receiving information to/from the other controlling controllers and/or stage controller and so fourth.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Further, the main controller has a function to obtain an image signal from an optical microscope, and also has a stage vibration compensating function for compensating a deterioration in the image by feeding back a fluctuation signal of the stage to an electronic optical system, and an automatic focal point compensating function for detecting a displacement of the sample observation point in the Z direction (in the axial direction of the secondary optical system) and feeding back the detected displacement to the electronic optical system so as to automatically compensate the focal point. Sending and receiving operations of the feedback signal to/from the electronic optical system and sending and receiving operations of the signal to/from the stage are performed via the controlling controller and the stage controller respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The controlling controller is mainly responsible for the control of the electronic optical system (an electron gun, a lens, an aligner, a control of a high-precision power supply for a Wien filter or the like). In specific, the controlling controller performs a control operation, for example, an automatic voltage setting for each of the lens systems and the aligners in response to each operation mode (gang control), so that a constant electron current may be regularly irradiated against the irradiation region even if the magnification is changed, and voltages to be applied to each of the lens systems and the aligners may be automatically set in response to each magnification and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The stage controller is mainly responsible for control regarding the movement of the stage so that precise movement in the X and the Y directions may be on the order of μm (with tolerance of about ±0.5 μm). Further, in the present stage, control at the rotational direction (θ control) is also performed with a tolerance equal to or less than about ±0.3 seconds.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Inspection Procedure</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the present invention, an inspection procedure is conducted as described below (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>). Generally, since an inspection apparatus using an electron beam is expensive and the throughput thereof is rather lower than that provided by other processing apparatuses, this type of inspection apparatus is currently applied to a wafer after an important process (for example, etching, film deposition, or CMP (chemical and mechanical polishing) flattening process) which is considered that the inspection is required most.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">A wafer to be inspected is, after having been positioned on an ultra-precise X-Y stage through an atmosphere transfer system and a vacuum transfer system, secured by an electrostatic chucking mechanism or the like, and then a defect inspection is conducted according to a flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>. At first, if required, a position of each of dies is checked and/or a height of each location is sensed, and those values are stored. In addition, an optical microscope is used to obtain an optical microscope image in an area of interest possibly including defects or the like, which may also be used in, for example, the comparison with an electron beam image.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Then, recipe information corresponding to the kind of the wafer (for example, after which process the inspection should be applied; what the wafer size is, 20 cm or 30 cm, and so on) is entered into the apparatus, and subsequently, after a designation of an inspection place, a setting of an electronic optical system and a setting of an inspection condition being established, a defect inspection is conducted typically at real time while simultaneously obtaining the image. A fast data processing system with an algorithm installed therein executes an inspection, such as the comparisons between cells, between dies or the like, and any results would be output to a CRT or the like and stored in a memory, if desired. Those defects include a particle defect, an irregular shape (a pattern defect) and an electric defect (a broken wire or via, a bad continuity or the like), and the fast data processing system also can automatically and at real-time distinguish and categorize them according to a defect size, or whether their being a killer defect (a critical defect or the like which disables a chip).</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The detection of the electric defect may be accomplished by detecting an irregular contrast. For example, since a location having bad continuity would generally be charged positive by electron beam irradiation (about 500 eV) and thereby its contrast would be decreased, the location of bad continuity can be distinguished from normal locations. The electron beam irradiation means in that case designates an electron beam generation means (means for generating thermal electron, UV/photoelectron) with lower energy arranged in order to emphasize the contrast by a potential difference, in addition to the electron beam irradiation means used for a regular inspection. Before the electron beam for inspection is irradiated against the objective region for inspection, the electron beam having that lower energy is generated and irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In the case of a map-projecting method in which the object can be positively charged by the irradiation of the electron beam for inspection, the electron beam generation means with lower potential is not necessarily arranged separately, depending on the specification of the system for the method. Further, the defect may be detected based on the difference in contrast (which is caused by the difference in flow ability of elements depending on the forward or backward direction) created by, for example, applying a positive or negative potential relative to reference potential to a wafer or the like. This electron beam generation means may be applicable to a line-width measuring apparatus and also to an aligning accuracy measurement.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Cleaning of Electrode</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Since, while an electron beam apparatus according to the present invention is operated, a target substance is extricated by a proximity interaction (charging of particles in the proximity of a surface) and attracted to a high-voltage region, an organic substance would be deposited on a variety of electrodes used for forming or deflecting an electron beam. Since the insulating material gradually depositing on the surface of the electrodes by the electric charge affects adversely on the forming or deflecting mechanism for the electron beam, accordingly those deposited insulating material must be removed periodically. To remove the insulating material periodically, an electrode adjacent to the region where the insulating material has been deposited is used to generate the plasma of hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine or compounds including them, such as HF, O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, C<sub>M</sub>F<sub>N </sub>or the like, in the vacuum and to control the plasma potential in the space to be a potential level (several kV, for example, 20V-5 kV) where the spatter would be generated on the electrode surface, thereby allowing only the organic substance to be oxidized, hydrogenated or fluorinated and removed.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a first embodiment of the present invention will be explained in the form of a semiconductor testing apparatus for testing, as an object under testing, a substrate, i.e., a wafer which has patterns formed on the surface thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate main components of a semiconductor testing apparatus <b>1</b> according to this embodiment in elevation and a plan view, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The semiconductor testing apparatus <b>1</b> of this embodiment comprises a cassette holder <b>10</b> for holding cassettes which stores a plurality of wafers; a mini-environment device <b>20</b>; a main housing <b>30</b> which defines a working chamber; a loader housing <b>40</b> disposed between the mini-environment device <b>20</b> and the main housing <b>30</b> to define two loading chambers; a loader <b>60</b> for loading a wafer from the cassette holder <b>10</b> onto a stage device <b>50</b> disposed in the main housing <b>30</b>; and an electro-optical device <b>70</b> installed in the vacuum main housing <b>30</b>. These components are arranged in a positional relationship as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The semiconductor testing apparatus <b>1</b> further comprises a pre-charge unit <b>81</b> disposed in the vacuum main housing <b>30</b>; a potential applying mechanism <b>83</b> (see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) for applying a to a wafer; an electron beam calibration mechanism <b>85</b> (see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>); and an optical microscope <b>871</b> which forms part of an alignment controller <b>87</b> for aligning the wafer on the stage device <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The cassette holder <b>10</b> is configured to hold a plurality (two in this embodiment) of cassettes c (for example, closed cassettes such as SMIF,FOUP manufactured by Assist Co.) in which a plurality (for example, <b>25</b>) of wafers are placed side by side in parallel, oriented in the vertical direction. The cassette holder <b>10</b> can be arbitrarily selected for installation adapted to a particular loading mechanism. Specifically, when a cassette, carried to the cassette holder <b>10</b>, is automatically loaded into the cassette holder <b>10</b> by a robot or the like, the cassette holder <b>10</b> having a structure adapted to the automatic loading can be installed. When a cassette is manually loaded into the cassette holder <b>10</b>, the cassette holder <b>10</b> having an open cassette structure can be installed.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">In this embodiment, the cassette holder <b>10</b> is the type adapted to the automatic cassette loading, and comprises, for example, an up/down table <b>11</b>, and an elevation mechanism <b>12</b> for moving the up/down table <b>11</b> up and down. The cassette c can be automatically set onto the up/down table <b>11</b> in the position indicated by chain lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. After the setting, the cassette c is automatically rotated to the position indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> so that it is directed to the axis of pivotal movement of a first carrier unit within the mini-environment device <b>20</b>. In addition, the up/down table <b>11</b> is moved down to the position indicated by chain lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this way, the cassette holder <b>10</b> for use in automatic loading, or the cassette holder <b>10</b> for use in manual loading may be both implemented by those in known structures, so that detailed description on their structures and functions are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a plurality of 300 mmφ substrates W is accommodated in a slot-like pocket (not shown) fixedly mounted in a box main body <b>501</b> so as to be transferred and stored. This substrate carrier box <b>24</b> is composed of a box main body <b>501</b> of cylinder with angular section, a door <b>502</b> for carrying in/out the substrate, which is coupled with an automatic aperture/closing unit of the door for carrying in/out the substrate so as to be capable of mechanically aperture/closing an aperture in a side face of the box main body <b>501</b>, a lid body <b>503</b> disposed in an opposite side of said aperture, for covering another aperture through which filters and a fun motor are to be attached or detached, a slot-like pocket (not shown) for holding a substrate W, a ULPA filter <b>505</b>, a chemical filter <b>506</b>, and a fun motor <b>507</b>. In this embodiment, the substrate W is carried in or out by a first carrier unit <b>612</b> of robot type in a loader <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">It should be noted that substrates, i.e., wafers accommodated in the cassette c are wafers subjected to testing which is generally performed after a process for processing the wafers or in the middle of the process within semiconductor manufacturing processes. Specifically, accommodated in the cassette are substrates or wafers which have undergone a deposition process, CMP, ion implantation and so on; wafers each formed with circuit patterns on the surface thereof; or wafers which have not been formed with wiring patterns. Since a large number of wafers accommodated in the cassette c are spaced from each other in the vertical direction and arranged side by side in parallel, the first carrier unit has an arm which is vertically movable such that a wafer at an arbitrary position can be held by the first carrier unit, as described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the mini-environment device <b>20</b> comprises a housing <b>22</b> which defines a mini-environment space <b>21</b> that is controlled for the atmosphere; a gas circulator <b>23</b> for circulating a gas such as clean air within the mini-environment space <b>21</b> for the atmosphere control; a discharger <b>24</b> for recovering a portion of air supplied into the mini-environment space <b>21</b> for discharging; and a pre-aligner <b>25</b> for roughly aligning a substrate, i.e., a wafer under testing, which is placed in the mini-environment space <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The housing <b>22</b> has a top wall <b>221</b>, a bottom wall <b>222</b>, and peripheral wall <b>223</b> which surrounds four sides of the housing <b>22</b> to provide a structure for isolating the mini-environment space <b>21</b> from the outside. For controlling the atmosphere in the mini-environment space <b>21</b>, the gas circulator <b>23</b> comprises a gas supply unit <b>231</b> attached to the top wall <b>221</b> within the mini-environment space <b>21</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for cleaning a gas (air in this embodiment) and delivering the cleaned gas downward through one or more gas nozzles (not shown) in laminar flow; a recovery duct <b>232</b> disposed on the bottom wall <b>222</b> within the mini-environment space for recovering air which has flown down to the bottom; and a conduit <b>233</b> for connecting the recovery duct <b>232</b> to the gas supply unit <b>231</b> for returning recovered air to the gas supply unit <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">In this embodiment, the gas supply unit <b>231</b> takes about 20% of air to be supplied, from the outside of the housing <b>22</b> for cleaning. However, the percentage of gas taken from the outside may be arbitrarily selected. The gas supply unit <b>231</b> comprises an HEPA or ULPA filter in a known structure for creating cleaned air. The laminar downflow of cleaned air is mainly supplied such that the air passes a carrying surface formed by the first carrier unit, later described, disposed within the mini-environment space <b>21</b> to prevent dust particles, which could be produced by the carrier unit, from attaching to the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Therefore, the down flow nozzles need not be positioned near the top wall as illustrated, but is only required to be above the carrying surface formed by the carrier unit. In addition, the air need not either be supplied over the entire mini-environment space <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">It should be noted that an ion wind may be used as cleaned air to ensure the cleanliness as the case may be. Also, a sensor may be provided within the mini-environment space <b>21</b> for observing the cleanliness such that the apparatus is shut down when the cleanliness is degraded. An access port <b>225</b> is formed in a portion of the peripheral wall <b>223</b> of the housing <b>22</b> that is adjacent to the cassette holder <b>10</b>. A shutter device in a known structure may be provided near the access port <b>225</b> to shut the access port <b>225</b> from the mini-environment device <b>20</b>. The laminar downflow near the wafer may be, for example, at a rate of 0.3 to 0.4 m/sec. The gas supply unit <b>231</b> may be disposed outside the mini-environment space <b>21</b> instead of within the mini-environment space <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The discharger <b>24</b> comprises a suction duct <b>241</b> disposed at a position below the wafer carrying surface of the carrier unit and below the carrier unit; a blower <b>242</b> disposed outside the housing <b>22</b>; and a conduit <b>243</b> for connecting the suction duct <b>241</b> to the blower <b>242</b>. The discharger <b>24</b> aspires a gas flowing down around the carrier unit and including dust, which could be produced by the carrier unit, through the suction duct <b>241</b>, and discharges the gas outside the housing <b>22</b> through the conduits <b>243</b>, <b>244</b> and the blower <b>242</b>. In this event, the gas may be emitted into an exhaust pipe (not shown) which is laid to the vicinity of the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The aligner <b>25</b> disposed within the mini-environment space <b>21</b> optically or mechanically detects an orientation flat (which refers to a flat portion formed along the outer periphery of a circular wafer) formed on the wafer, or one or more V-shaped notches formed on the outer peripheral edge of the wafer to previously align the position of the wafer in a rotating direction about the axis O<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>1 </sub>at an accuracy of approximately ±one degree. The pre-aligner forms part of a mechanism for determining the coordinates of an object under testing, which is a feature of the claimed invention, and is responsible for rough alignment of an object under testing. Since the pre-aligner itself may be of a known structure, description on its structure and operation is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Although not shown, a recovery duct for the discharger <b>24</b> may also be provided below the pre-aligner such that air including dust, emitted from the pre-aligner, is emitted to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the main housing <b>30</b>, which defines the working chamber <b>31</b>, comprises a housing body <b>32</b> that is supported by a housing supporting device <b>33</b> fixed on a vibration isolator <b>37</b> disposed on a base frame <b>36</b>. The housing supporting device <b>33</b> comprises a frame structure <b>331</b> assembled into a rectangular form. The housing body <b>32</b> comprises a bottom wall <b>321</b> securely fixed on the frame structure <b>331</b>; a top wall <b>322</b>; and a peripheral wall <b>323</b> which is connected to the bottom wall <b>321</b> and the top wall <b>322</b> and surrounds four sides of the housing body <b>32</b>, and isolates the working chamber <b>31</b> from the outside. In this embodiment, the bottom wall <b>321</b> is made of a relatively thick steel plate to prevent distortion due to the weight of equipment carried thereon such as the stage device <b>50</b>. Alternatively, another structure may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">In this embodiment, the housing body <b>32</b> and the housing supporting device <b>33</b> are assembled into a rigid construction, and the vibration isolator <b>37</b> prevents vibrations from the floor, on which the base frame <b>36</b> is placed, from being transmitted to the rigid structure. A portion of the peripheral wall <b>323</b> of the housing body <b>32</b> that adjoins the loader housing <b>40</b>, later described, is formed with an access port <b>325</b> for introducing and removing a wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The vibration isolator <b>37</b> may be either of an active type which has an air spring, a magnetic bearing and so on, or a passive type likewise having these components. Since any known structure may be employed for the vibration isolator <b>37</b>, description on the structure and functions of the vibration isolator itself is omitted. The working chamber <b>31</b> is held in a vacuum atmosphere by a vacuum system (not shown) in a known structure. A controller <b>2</b> for controlling the operation of the overall apparatus is disposed below the base frame <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, the loader housing <b>40</b> comprises a housing body <b>43</b> which defines a first loading chamber <b>41</b> and a second loading chamber <b>42</b>. The housing body <b>43</b> comprises a bottom wall <b>431</b>; a top wall <b>432</b>; a peripheral wall <b>433</b> which surrounds four sides of the housing body <b>43</b>; and a partition wall <b>434</b> for partitioning the first loading chamber <b>41</b> and the second loading chamber <b>42</b> such that both the loading chambers can be isolated from the outside. The partition wall <b>434</b> is formed with an aperture, i.e., an access port <b>435</b> for passing a wafer between both the loading chambers. Also, a portion of the peripheral wall <b>433</b> that adjoins the mini-environment device <b>20</b> and the main housing <b>30</b> is formed with access ports <b>436</b>, <b>437</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">The housing body <b>43</b> of the loader housing <b>40</b> is carried on and supported by the frame structure <b>331</b> of the housing supporting device <b>33</b>. This prevents the vibrations of the floor from being transmitted to the loader housing <b>40</b> as well. The access port <b>436</b> of the loader housing <b>40</b> is in alignment with the access port <b>226</b> of the housing <b>22</b> of the mini-environment device <b>20</b>, and a shutter device <b>27</b> is provided for selectively isolating a interaction between the mini-environment space <b>21</b> and the first loading chamber <b>41</b>. The gate valve <b>27</b> has a sealing material <b>271</b> which surrounds the peripheries of the access ports <b>226</b>, <b>436</b> and is fixed to the side wall <b>433</b> in close contact therewith; a door <b>272</b> for isolating air from flowing through the access ports in cooperation with the sealing material <b>271</b>; and a driver <b>273</b> for moving the door <b>272</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Likewise, the access port <b>437</b> of the loader housing <b>40</b> is in alignment with the access port <b>325</b> of the housing body <b>32</b>, and a shutter <b>45</b> is provided for selectively isolating a interaction between the second loading chamber <b>42</b> and the working chamber <b>31</b> in a hermetic manner. The shutter <b>45</b> comprises a sealing material <b>451</b> which surrounds the peripheries of the access ports <b>437</b>, <b>325</b> and is fixed to side walls <b>433</b>, <b>323</b> in close contact therewith; a door <b>452</b> for isolating air from flowing through the access ports in cooperation with the sealing material <b>451</b>; and a driver <b>453</b> for moving the door <b>452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Further, the aperture formed through the partition wall <b>434</b> is provided with a shutter <b>46</b> for closing the aperture with the door <b>461</b> to selectively isolating a interaction between the first and second loading chambers in a hermetic manner. These gate valve <b>27</b>, <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> are configured to provide air-tight sealing for the respective chambers when they are in a closed state. Since these gate valve may be implemented by known ones, detailed description on their structures and operations is omitted. It should be noted that a method of supporting the housing <b>22</b> of the mini-environment device <b>20</b> is different from a method of supporting the loader housing <b>40</b>. Therefore, for preventing vibrations from being transmitted from the floor through the mini-environment device <b>20</b> to the loader housing <b>40</b> and the main housing <b>30</b>, a vibration-absorption cushion material may be disposed between the housing <b>22</b> and the loader housing <b>40</b> to provide air-tight sealing for the peripheries of the access ports.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Within the first loading chamber <b>41</b>, a wafer rack <b>47</b> is disposed for supporting a plurality (two in this embodiment) of wafers spaced in the vertical direction and maintained in a horizontal position. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wafer rack <b>47</b> comprises posts <b>472</b> fixed at four corners of a rectangular substrate <b>471</b>, spaced from one another, in an upright position. Each of the posts <b>472</b> is formed with supporting devices <b>473</b>, <b>474</b> in two stages, such that peripheral edges of wafers W are carried on and held by these supporting devices. Then, leading ends of arms of the first and second carrier units, later described, are brought closer to wafers from adjacent posts and grab the wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The loading chambers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> can be controlled for the atmosphere to be maintained in a high vacuum condition (at a pressure of 10<sup>−5 </sup>to 10<sup>−6 </sup>Pa) by a pumping system (not shown) in a known structure including a vacuum pump, not shown. In this event, the first loading chamber <b>41</b> may be held in a low vacuum condition as a low vacuum chamber, while the second loading chamber <b>42</b> may be held in a high vacuum condition as a high vacuum chamber, to effectively prevent contamination of wafers. The employment of such a structure allows a wafer, which is accommodated in the loading chamber and is next subjected to the defect testing, to be carried into the working chamber without delay. The employment of such a loading chambers provides for an improved throughput for the defect testing, and the highest possible vacuum condition around the electron source which is required to be kept in a high vacuum condition, together with the principle of a multi-beam type electron system, later described.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">The first and second loading chambers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> are connected to a vacuum exhaust pipe and a vent pipe for an inert gas (for example, dried pure nitrogen) (neither of which are shown), respectively. In this way, the atmospheric state within each loading chamber is attained by an inert gas vent (which injects an inert gas to prevent an oxygen gas and so on other than the inert gas from attaching on the surface). Since an apparatus itself for implementing the inert gas vent is known in structure, detailed description thereon is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In the testing apparatus according to the present invention which uses an electron beam, when representative lanthanum hexaboride (LaB<sub>6</sub>) used as an electron source for an electro-optical system, later described, is once heated to such a high temperature that causes emission of thermal electrons, it should not be exposed to oxygen within the limits of possibility so as not to shorten the lifetime. The exposure to oxygen can be prevented without fail by carrying out the atmosphere control as mentioned above at a stage before introducing a wafer into the working chamber in which the electron-optical system is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">The stage device <b>50</b> comprises a fixed table <b>51</b> disposed on the bottom wall <b>301</b> of the main housing <b>30</b>; a Y-table <b>52</b> movable in a Y-direction on the fixed table <b>51</b> (the direction vertical to the drawing sheet in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); an X-table <b>53</b> movable in an X-direction on the Y-table <b>52</b> (in the left-to-right direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); a turntable <b>54</b> rotatable on the X-table; and a holder <b>55</b> disposed on the turntable <b>54</b>. A wafer is releasably held on a wafer carrying surface <b>551</b> of the holder <b>55</b>. The holder <b>55</b> may be of a known structure which is capable of releasably grabbing a wafer by means of a mechanical or electrostatic chuck feature.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The stage device <b>50</b> uses servo motors, encoders and a variety of sensors (not shown) to operate a plurality of tables as mentioned above to permit highly accurate alignment of a wafer held on the carrying surface <b>551</b> by the holder <b>55</b> in the X-direction, Y-direction and Z-direction (in the up-down direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with respect to an electron beam irradiated from the electro-optical device, and in a direction about the axis normal to the wafer supporting surface (θ direction). The alignment in the Z-direction may be made such that the position on the carrying surface <b>551</b> of the holder <b>55</b>, for example, can be finely adjusted in the Z-direction. In this event, a reference position on the carrying surface <b>551</b> is sensed by a position measuring device using a laser of an extremely small diameter (a laser interference range finder using the principles of interferometer) to control the position by a feedback circuit, not shown. Additionally or alternatively, the position of a notch or an orientation flat of a wafer is measured to sense a plane position or a rotational position of the wafer relative to the electron beam to control the position of the wafer by rotating the turntable <b>54</b> by a stepping motor which can be controlled in extremely small angular increments.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In order to maximally prevent dust produced within the working chamber, servo motors <b>531</b>, <b>531</b> and encoders <b>522</b>, <b>532</b> for the stage device <b>50</b> are disposed outside the main housing <b>30</b>. Since the stage device <b>50</b> may be of a known structure used, for example, in steppers and so on, detailed description on its structure and operation is omitted. Likewise, since the laser interference range finder may also be of a known structure, detailed description on its structure and operation is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">It is also possible to establish a basis for signals which are generated by previously inputting a rotational position, and X-, Y-positions of a wafer relative to the electron beam in a signal detecting system or an image processing system, later described. The wafer chucking mechanism provided in the holder <b>55</b> is configured to apply a voltage for chucking a wafer to an electrode of an electrostatic chuck, and the alignment is made by pinning three points on the outer periphery of the wafer (preferably spaced equally in the circumferential direction). The wafer chucking mechanism comprises two fixed aligning pins and a push-type clamp pin. The clamp pin can implement automatic chucking and automatic releasing, and constitutes a conducting spot for applying the voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The loader <b>60</b> comprises a robot-type first carrier unit <b>61</b> disposed within the housing <b>22</b> of the mini-environment device <b>20</b>; and a robot-type second carrier unit <b>63</b> disposed within the second loading chamber <b>42</b>. The first carrier unit <b>61</b> comprises a multi-node arm <b>612</b> rotatable about an axis O<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>1 </sub>with respect to a driver <b>611</b>. While an arbitrary structure may be used for the multi-node arm, the multi-node arm in this embodiment has three parts which are pivotably attached to each other. One part of the arm <b>612</b> of the first carrier unit <b>61</b>, i.e., the first part closest to the driver <b>611</b> is attached to a rotatable shaft <b>613</b> by a driving mechanism (not shown) of a known structure, disposed within the driver <b>611</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">The arm <b>612</b> is pivotable about the axis O<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>1 </sub>by means of the shaft <b>613</b>, and radially telescopic as a whole with respect to the axis O<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>1 </sub>through relative rotations among the parts. At a leading end of the third part of the arm <b>612</b> furthest away from the shaft <b>613</b>, a grabber <b>616</b> in a known structure for grabbing a wafer, such as a mechanical chuck or an electrostatic chuck, is disposed. The driver <b>611</b> is movable in the vertical direction by an elevating mechanism <b>615</b> in a known structure.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The first carrier unit <b>61</b> extends the arm <b>612</b> in either a direction M<b>1</b> or a direction M<b>2</b> within two cassettes c held in the cassette holder <b>10</b>, and removes a wafer accommodated in a cassette c by carrying the wafer on the arm or by grabbing the wafer with the chuck (not shown) attached at the leading end of the arm.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Subsequently, the arm is retracted (in a position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and then rotated to a position at which the arm can extend in a direction M<b>3</b> toward the prealigner <b>25</b>, and stopped at this position. Then, the arm is again extended to transfer the wafer held on the arm to the prealigner <b>25</b>. After receiving a wafer from the prealigner <b>25</b>, contrary to the foregoing, the arm is further rotated and stopped at a position at which it can extend to the second loading chamber <b>41</b> (in the direction M<b>3</b>), and transfers the wafer to a wafer receiver <b>47</b> within the second loading chamber <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">For mechanically grabbing a wafer, the wafer should be grabbed on a peripheral region (in a range of approximately 5 mm from the peripheral edge). This is because the wafer is formed with device construction (circuit patterns) over the entire surface except for the peripheral region, and grabbing the inner region would result in failed or defective devices.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">The second carrier unit <b>63</b> is basically identical to the first carrier unit <b>61</b> in structure except that the second carrier unit <b>63</b> carries a wafer between the wafer rack <b>47</b> and the carrying surface of the stage device <b>50</b>, so that detailed description thereon is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">In the loader <b>60</b>, the first and second carrier units <b>61</b>, <b>63</b> each carry a wafer from a cassette held in the cassette holder <b>10</b> to the stage device <b>50</b> disposed in the working chamber <b>31</b> and vice versa, while remaining substantially in a horizontal position. The arms of the carrier units are moved in the vertical direction only when a wafer is removed from and inserted into a cassette, when a wafer is carried on and removed from the wafer rack, and when a wafer is carried on and removed from the stage device <b>50</b>. It is therefore possible to smoothly carry a larger wafer, for example, a wafer having a diameter of 30 cm. Next, how a wafer is carried will be described in sequence from the cassette c held by the cassette holder <b>10</b> to the stage device <b>50</b> disposed in the working chamber <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">As described above, when the cassette is manually set, the cassette holder <b>10</b> having a structure adapted to the manual setting is used, and when the cassette is automatically set, the cassette holder <b>10</b> having a structure adapted to the automatic setting is used. In this embodiment, as the cassette c is set on the up/down table <b>11</b> of the cassette holder <b>10</b>, the up/down table <b>11</b> is moved down by the elevating mechanism <b>12</b> to align the cassette c with the access port <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">As the cassette is aligned with the access port <b>225</b>, a cover (not shown) provided for the cassette is opened, and a cylindrical cover is applied between the cassette c and the access port <b>225</b> of the mini-environment to block the cassette and the mini-environment space <b>21</b> from the outside. Since these structures are known, detailed description on their structures and operations is omitted. When the mini-environment device <b>20</b> is provided with a shutter for aperture and closing the access port <b>225</b>, the shutter is operated to open the access port <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">On the other hand, the arm <b>612</b> of the first carrier unit <b>61</b> remains oriented in either the direction M<b>1</b> or M<b>2</b> (in the direction M<b>1</b> in this description). As the access port <b>225</b> is opened, the arm <b>612</b> extends to receive one of wafers accommodated in the cassette at the leading end. While the arm and a wafer to be removed from the cassette are adjusted in the vertical position by moving up or down the driver <b>611</b> of the first carrier unit <b>61</b> and the arm <b>612</b> in this embodiment, the adjustment may be made by moving up and down the up/down table <b>11</b> of the cassette holder <b>10</b>, or made by both.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">As the arm <b>612</b> has received the wafer, the arm <b>621</b> is retracted, and the shutter is operated to close the access port (when the shutter is provided). Next, the arm <b>612</b> is pivoted about the axis O<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>1 </sub>such that it can extend in the direction M<b>3</b>. Then, the arm <b>612</b> is extended and transfers the wafer carried at the leading end or grabbed by the chuck onto the prealigner <b>25</b> which aligns the orientation of the rotating direction of the wafer (the direction about the central axis vertical to the wafer plane) within a predetermined range. Upon completion of the alignment, the carrier unit <b>61</b> retracts the arm <b>612</b> after a wafer has been received from the prealigner <b>25</b> to the leading end of the arm <b>612</b>, and takes a posture in which the arm <b>612</b> can be extended in a direction M<b>4</b>. Then, the door <b>272</b> of the gate valve <b>27</b> is moved to open the access ports <b>223</b>, <b>236</b>, and the arm <b>612</b> is extended to place the wafer on the upper stage or the lower stage of the wafer rack <b>47</b> within the first loading chamber <b>41</b>. It should be noted that before the shutter device <b>27</b> opens the access ports to transfer the wafer to the wafer rack <b>47</b>, the aperture <b>435</b> formed through the partition wall <b>434</b> is closed by the door <b>461</b> of the shutter <b>46</b> in an air-tight state.</p>

<p id="p-0325" num="0324">As the wafer is placed into the wafer rack <b>47</b> within the first loading chamber <b>41</b> of the loader housing <b>40</b> by the first carrier unit <b>61</b>, the shutter device <b>27</b> is closed to seal the loading chamber <b>41</b>. Then, the first loading chamber <b>41</b> is filled with an inert gas to expel air.

<p id="p-0326" num="0325">The vacuum atmosphere within the loading chamber <b>41</b> may be at a low vacuum degree. When a certain degree of vacuum is provided within the loading chamber <b>41</b>, the shutter <b>46</b> is operated to open the access port <b>434</b> which has been sealed by the door <b>461</b>, and the arm <b>632</b> of the second carrier unit <b>63</b> is extended to receive one wafer from the wafer receiver <b>47</b> with the grabber at the leading end (the wafer is carried on the leading end or grabbed by the chuck attached to the leading end). Upon completion of the receipt of the wafer, the arm <b>632</b> is retracted, followed by the shutter <b>46</b> again operated to close the access port <b>435</b> by the door <b>461</b>.

<p id="p-0328" num="0327">As the shutter <b>46</b> is operated to close the access port <b>435</b>, the second loading chamber <b>42</b> is again evacuated at a higher degree of vacuum than the first loading chamber <b>41</b>.

The secondary electron image is focused on a point P<b>3</b> which is much closer to the deflector <b>725</b> than the point P<b>2</b>. This is because the primary electron beam has the energy of 500 eV on the surface of the wafer, while the secondary electron beam only has the energy of a few eV.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Each of the images of the secondary electrons focused at the point P<b>3</b> is focused by the two-stage magnifying lenses <b>741</b> and <b>742</b> onto each of the corresponding apertures <b>743</b><i>a </i>of the multi-aperture detection plate <b>743</b> to be formed into an image, so that each of the detectors <b>761</b> disposed correspondingly to each of the apertures <b>743</b><i>a </i>detects the image. Each of the detectors <b>761</b> thus detects the electron beam and converts it into an electric signal representative of its intensity. The generated electric signals are output from respective detectors <b>761</b>, and after being converted respectively into digital signals by the A/D converter <b>762</b>, they are input to the image processing section <b>763</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">The image processing section <b>763</b> converts the input digital signals into image data. Since the image processing section <b>763</b> is further supplied with a scanning signal for deflecting the primary electron beam, the image processing section <b>763</b> can display an image representing the surface of the wafer. Comparing this image with a reference pattern that has been pre-set in a setting device (not shown) allows to determine whether or not the pattern on the wafer W being inspected (evaluated) is acceptable. Further, the line width of the pattern formed on the surface of the wafer W can be measured in such a way that the pattern to be measured on the wafer W is moved by a registration to the proximity of the optical axis of the primary optical system, and the pattern is then line-scanned to extract the line width evaluation signal, which in turn is appropriately calibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">In this regard, it is required to make special arrangements in order to minimize the affection by the three aberrations, i.e., the distortion caused by the primary optical system, the axial chromatic aberration, and the filed astigmatism, when the primary electron beams passed through the apertures of the multi-aperture plate <b>723</b> in the primary optical system are focused onto the surface of the wafer W and then the secondary electrons emanated from the wafer W are formed into an image on the detector <b>761</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">It is to be noticed that, with respect to the relationship between the spacing of a plurality of primary electron beams and the secondary optical system, any space between the primary electron beams made longer than the aberration by the secondary optical system may eliminate the cross talks among the plurality of beams.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pre-charge unit <b>81</b> is disposed in a working chamber <b>31</b>, adjacent to a lens column <b>71</b> of an electronic optical apparatus <b>70</b>. Since this inspection apparatus is of a type in which an electron beam is used to scan and irradiate a substrate to be inspected or a wafer, and thereby a device pattern or the like formed on a surface of the wafer is inspected, information such as secondary electrons emitted by the irradiation of the electron beam is utilized as an information of the wafer surface, and sometimes, depending on a condition including a material of the wafer, an energy level of the irradiated electron or the like, the wafer surface may be charged-up.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Further, depending on the locations on the wafer, some locations might be more strongly charged-up than other locations. If there are non-uniform distribution in a charging amount on the wafer, the information of the secondary electron beam is made to be non-uniform, which makes it impossible to obtain an accurate information.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Accordingly, in the present embodiment, there is provided a pre-charge unit <b>81</b> having a charged particle irradiating section <b>811</b> in order to prevent this non-uniform distribution. In order to prevent a non-uniform distribution in charging, before the electrons for inspection being irradiated onto a predetermined location of the wafer to be inspected, the charged particles are irradiated from the charged particle irradiating section <b>811</b> of the pre-charge unit thereto, thus preventing the non-uniform charging. The charging on the wafer surface is detected by forming and evaluating an image of the wafer surface in advance, and based on a result of the detection, the pre-charge unit <b>81</b> is operated. Further, in this pre-charge unit, the primary electron beam may be irradiated with some gradation.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the potential applying mechanism <b>83</b> applies a potential of several kilo volts to a carrier of a stage, on which the wafer is placed, to control the generation of secondary electrons based on the fact that the information on the secondary electrons emitted from the wafer (secondary electron yield) depend on the potential on the wafer. The potential applying mechanism <b>83</b> also serves to decelerate the energy originally possessed by irradiated electrons to provide the wafer with irradiated electron energy of approximately 100 to 500 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the potential applying mechanism <b>83</b> comprises a voltage applying device <b>831</b> electrically connected to the carrying surface <b>541</b> of the stage device <b>50</b>; and a charging detection/voltage determining system (hereinafter detection/determining system) <b>832</b>. The detection/determining system <b>832</b> comprises a monitor <b>833</b> electrically connected to an image forming unit <b>763</b> of the detecting system <b>76</b> in the electro-optical device <b>70</b>; an operator <b>834</b> connected to the monitor <b>833</b>; and a CPU <b>835</b> connected to the operator <b>834</b>. The CPU <b>835</b> supplies a signal to the voltage applying device <b>831</b>. The potential applying mechanism <b>83</b> is designed to find a potential at which the wafer under testing is hardly charged, and to apply such potential to the carrying surface <b>541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">As for a method for inspecting for an electric defect on a sample to be inspected, the defect on the portion which is designed to be electrically insulated can be detected based on the fact that there is a voltage difference therein between the normal case where the portion being insulated and the defective case where the portion being under conductive condition. In this method, at first the electric charges is applied to the sample in advance, so that the voltage difference is generated between the voltage in the portion essentially insulated electrically and the voltage in another portion which is designed to be electrically insulated but is under conductive condition because of any defective reason, then the beam of the present invention is applied thereto to obtain a data with voltage difference, which is then analyzed to detect the conductive condition.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the electron beam calibration mechanism <b>85</b> comprises a plurality of Faraday cups <b>851</b>, <b>852</b> for measuring a beam current, disposed at a plurality of positions in a lateral region of the wafer carrying surface <b>541</b> on the turntable <b>54</b>. The Faraday cuts <b>851</b> is used for a fine beam (approximately φ2 μm), while the Faraday cups <b>852</b> is used for total beams (approximately φ30 μm). The Faraday cups <b>851</b> for a fine beam measures a beam profile by driving the turntable, while the Faraday cups <b>852</b> for a wide beam measure a total amount of currents. The Faraday cups <b>851</b>, <b>852</b> are mounted on the wafer carrying surface <b>541</b> such that their top surfaces are coplanar with the upper surface of the wafer W carried on the carrying surface <b>541</b>. In this way, the primary electron beam emitted from the electron gun <b>721</b> is monitored at all times. This is because the electron gun <b>721</b> cannot emit a constant electron beam at all times but varies in the emitting amount as it is used over time.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">The alignment controller <b>87</b>, which aligns the wafer W with the electron-optical system <b>70</b> using the stage system <b>50</b>, performs the control for rough alignment through wide field observation using the optical microscope <b>871</b> (a measurement with a lower magnification than a measurement made by the electron-optical system); high magnification alignment using the electron-optical system of the electron-optical system <b>70</b>; focus adjustment; testing region setting; pattern alignment; and so on. The wafer is tested at a low magnification using the optical system in this way because an alignment mark must be readily detected by an electron beam when the wafer is aligned by observing patterns on the wafer in a narrow field using the electron beam for automatically testing the wafer for patterns thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">The optical microscope <b>871</b> is disposed on the housing <b>30</b> (alternatively, may be movably disposed within the housing <b>30</b>), with a light source, not shown, being additionally disposed within the housing <b>30</b> for operating the optical microscope. The electron-optical system for observing the wafer at a high magnification shares the electron-optical systems (primary optical system <b>72</b> and secondary optical system <b>74</b>) of the electron-optical system <b>70</b>. The configuration may be generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. For observing a point of interest on a wafer at a low magnification, the X-stage <b>53</b> of the stage device <b>50</b> is moved in the X-direction to move the point of interest on the wafer into a view field of the optical microscope <b>871</b>. The wafer is viewed in a wide field by the optical microscope <b>871</b>, and the point of interest on the wafer to be observed is displayed on a monitor <b>873</b> through a CCD <b>872</b> to roughly determine a position to be observed. In this event, the magnification of the optical microscope may be changed from a low magnification to a high magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">Next, the stage device <b>50</b> is moved by a distance corresponding to a spacing δx between the optical axis of the electron-optical system <b>70</b> and the optical axis of the optical microscope <b>871</b> to move the point on the wafer under observation, previously determined by the optical microscope <b>871</b>, to a point in the view field of the electron-optical device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The distance δx between the axis O<sub>3</sub>-O<sub>3 </sub>of the electron-optical device and the axis O<sub>4</sub>-O<sub>4 </sub>of the optical microscope <b>871</b> is previously known (while it is assumed that the electron-optical system <b>70</b> is deviated from the optical microscope <b>871</b> in the direction along the X-axis in this embodiment, they may be deviated in the Y-axis direction as well as in the X-axis direction), such that the point under observation can be moved to the viewing position by moving the stage device <b>50</b> by the distance δx. The point under observation has been moved to the viewing position of the electron-optical device <b>70</b>, the point under observation is imaged by the electron-optical system at a high magnification for storing a resulting image or displaying the image on the monitor <b>765</b> through the CCD <b>761</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">After the point under observation on the wafer imaged by the electron-optical system at a high magnification is displayed on the monitor <b>765</b>, misalignment of the stage device <b>50</b> with respect to the center of rotation of the turntable <b>54</b> in the wafer rotating direction, and misalignment δθ of the stage device <b>50</b> with respect to the optical axis O<sub>3</sub>-O<sub>3 </sub>of the electron-optical system in the wafer rotating direction are detected in a known method, and misalignment of a predetermined pattern with respect to the electron-optical device in the X-axis and Y-axis is also detected.

<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Next, an embodiment of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention. Manufacturing processes of this embodiment include the following main processes:</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">(1) a wafer manufacturing process for manufacturing a wafer (or a wafer preparing process for preparing a wafer);</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">(2) a mask manufacturing process for manufacturing masks for use in exposure (or mask preparing process for preparing masks);</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">(3) a wafer processing process for performing processing required to the wafer;</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">(4) a chip assembling process for dicing one by one chips formed on the wafer and making them operable; and</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">(5) a chip testing process for testing complete chips.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">The respective main processes are further comprised of several sub-processes.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Among these main processes, the wafer fabricating process set forth in (3) exerts critical affections to the performance of resulting semiconductor devices. This process involves sequentially laminating designed circuit patterns on the wafer to form a large number of chips which operate as memories, MPUs and so on. The wafer fabricating process includes the following sub-processes:</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">(A) a thin film forming sub-process for forming dielectric thin films serving as insulating layers, metal thin films for forming wirings or electrodes, and so on (using CVD, sputtering and so on);</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">(B) an oxidation sub-process for oxidizing the thin film layers and the wafer substrate;</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">(C) a lithography sub-process for forming a resist pattern using masks (reticles) for selectively fabricating the thin film layers and the wafer substrate;</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">(D) an etching sub-process for fabricating the thin film layers and the substrate in conformity to the resist pattern (using, for example, dry etching techniques);</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">(E) an ion/impurity inplantation/diffusion sub-process;</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">(F) a resist striping sub-process; and</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">(G) a sub-process for testing the fabricated wafer;</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">As appreciated, the wafer fabrication process is repeated a number of times equal to the number of required layers to manufacture semiconductor devices which operate as designed.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the lithography sub-process which forms the core of the wafer processing process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The lithography sub-process includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">(a) a resist coating step for coating a resist on the wafer on which circuit patterns have been formed in the previous process;</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">(b) a resist exposing step;</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">(c) a developing step for developing the exposed resist to produce a resist pattern; and</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">(d) an annealing step for stabilizing the developed resist pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">Since the aforementioned semiconductor device manufacturing process, wafer fabrication process and lithography process are well known, and therefore no further description will be required.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">When the defect testing method and defect testing apparatus according to the present invention are used in the testing sub-process set forth in (G), any semiconductor devices even having submicron (sized) patterns can be tested at a high throughput, so that a total inspection can also be conducted, thereby making it possible to improve the yield rate of products and prevent defective products from being shipped.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">The present invention provides the following effects:</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">(a) Since the present invention has allowed the functional combination of the respective components of the inspection apparatus using a plurality of electron beams or a multi-beam, the apparatus may handle any objects to be inspected with high throughput;</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">(b) Arranging a sensor in the environmental space for observing the cleanness level allows to inspect the object to be inspected under monitoring dirt (or particle) within the space; and</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">(c) Since a pre-charge unit has been arranged, even those wafers made of insulating materials are hardly affected by the electric discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> A is a schematic diagram of an optical system in an electron beam apparatus <b>1000</b> of a third embodiment according to the present invention. Primary electron beams emitted from multiple emitters <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b> and <b>1003</b> are converged by a condenser lens <b>1004</b> to be projected onto an image field <b>1005</b>, which are further converged by a lens <b>1006</b> and an objective lens <b>1008</b> to be contracted and projected onto a sample surface <b>1010</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> has illustrated only one row of multiple emitters, plural rows of emitters may be arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows emitters in the array of 3×3, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> is a cross sectional view taken along the line <b>17</b>B-<b>17</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, reference numeral <b>1021</b> designates a Si substrate, <b>1022</b> is a Mo emitter, <b>1023</b> is an Au leading electrode, and <b>1024</b> is a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>insulating film. The number of emitters may be chosen appropriately. A lens unit has been constructed with a few numbers of planar electrodes each having an aperture with a diameter of 2 to 10 μm and having been aligned in the optical axial direction with the interval of 2 to 10 μm there between and have different voltages applied thereto, so that it may operates as a convex lens.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">Secondary electrons emanated from the sample surface <b>1010</b> which has been irradiated with the primary electron beam delivered from the multiple emitters <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b> and <b>1003</b> are accelerated by an accelerating electric field applied between the sample surface <b>1010</b> and the objective lens <b>1008</b>, and even the secondary electrons emitted at a great emission angle may be converged narrower by the time when they enter into the objective lens <b>1008</b>, which further pass through an aperture diaphragm <b>1007</b> to be formed into an image by the lens <b>1006</b> on the same image field <b>1005</b> as of the primary beams.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">An E×B separator <b>1009</b> is arranged at the location of the image field <b>1005</b> so as to separate the secondary electrons passed through the lens <b>1006</b> from the primary optical system. The E×B separator <b>1009</b> has such a configuration in which an electric field and a magnetic field are crossed at a right angle within a plane orthogonal to the normal of the sample surface <b>1010</b> (the upper direction on paper), and the relationship between the electric field, the magnetic field and the primary electron energy has been established to allow the primary electrons to be advanced straight forward.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">The separated secondary electrons are optically magnified with lenses <b>1011</b> and <b>1012</b> so as to be formed into a plurality of images on a detection system <b>1013</b>. The detection system <b>1013</b> is provided with detectors <b>1014</b>, <b>1015</b> and <b>1016</b> corresponding respectively to the primary electron beams from the multiple emitters <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b> and <b>1003</b>, each of which detects the secondary electrons emanated from the surface of the sample which has been irradiated with each of those electron beams. It is to be noted that the multiple emitters <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b> and <b>1003</b> are arranged such that they are slightly offset to one another in the Z-axis direction in order to compensate for the image field curvature of the primary optical system. That is, the emitter <b>1001</b> on the optical axis is arranged at the farthest location from the sample, the emitter <b>1002</b> distant from the optical axis is displaced to be closer to the sample in comparison with the location of the emitter <b>1001</b> by the value corresponding to the field curvature, and the emitter <b>1003</b> more distant from the optical axis is displaced to be much closer to the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">To irradiate overall surface of the sample, the primary electron beams from the multiple emitters are controlled to make a scanning motion by an electrostatic deflecting system <b>1017</b>. Further, in synchronism with the scanning motion of the primary electron beams, another electrostatic deflecting system <b>1018</b> arranged in the secondary optical system also controls the motion of the secondary electrons so as to enter always into the specified detectors <b>1014</b>, <b>1015</b> and <b>1016</b> regardless of their scanning position.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">That is, the secondary electrons emanated by the primary electron beams from the emitters <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b> and <b>1003</b> are controlled to enter respectively into the detectors <b>1014</b>, <b>1015</b> and <b>1016</b>. The detectors take the form of electrodes arranged on a curved surface having the same number of apertures as that of the detectors formed in front of a PIN diode with the voltage of about 20 kV applied thereto, and the voltage of about 1 kV is applied to this electrode. The convex lens effect of the electric field produced by the voltage of 20 kV leaking from those apertures affects all of the secondary electrons approaching to the vicinity of those apertures so as to go through the apertures into the detectors. The curved surface has such a shape that can compensate for the field curvature of the secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">Now, a relationship between the spacing of the irradiating positions of the plurality of primary electron beams and the secondary optical system will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the secondary optical system and an angular aperture. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, it is assumed that the secondary electrons within the acceptance angle α<b>1</b> go through the objective lens <b>1008</b>, the diaphragm <b>1007</b> and the lens <b>1006</b> to be imaged on the image field <b>1005</b>. At that time, a half-angular aperture at the image field <b>1005</b> is αi, and apparent angles α<b>0</b> and αi viewed from the objective lens <b>1008</b> will be defined as αi/α<b>0</b>=1/M, where the magnification for the secondary optical system is M. Further, the angles α<b>0</b> and αi will be also defined as (α<b>1</b>/α<b>0</b>)2=V<b>8</b>/Vini, where the beam potential at the objective lens <b>1008</b> is V<b>8</b> and the initial energy of the secondary electron is Vini.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the relationship between the aberration at the surface of the sample <b>1010</b> and the half-angular aperture αi. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, δS is defined as a spherical aberration, δcoma as a coma aberration, δC as a chromatic aberration and δtotal as the total of them.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">Now, for the acceptance of 20 μm of aberration, the half-angular aperture αi should be equal to or smaller than 5.3 mrad. Further, the initial energy Vini of the secondary electron to be inspected is sufficient to be considered as much as 0.1 eV to 10 eV, so that when the magnification M is assumed to be 5 and the beam potential V<b>8</b> at the objective lens <b>1008</b> to be 20 kV, the relationship will be denoted as α<b>1</b>=1185 mrad=67.9°.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">Since it has been found that less than 90% of the secondary electrons can be taken in for the acceptance angle of 0° to 60° (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in the specification of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,210), therefore for the half-angular aperture αi or the resolution of the secondary optical system of around 5.3 mrad and the size of the detector being about four times of 20 μm in the conversion for the sample surface, not less than 90% of the secondary electrons can be collected without any cross talks. Further, the spacing between the multiple emitters being around 100 μm can reduce the cross talks among the emitters to be negligible lam level.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">If there is no need to collect not less than 90% of the secondary electrons but the collection of 50% of the secondary electrons guarantees the sufficient S/N ratio to be obtained, then the secondary electrons emanated within an angle smaller than 45° may be sufficient to be collected into the detectors. This is because an collecting efficiency of the secondary electrons, η, is denoted by [equation 1] as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0400" num="0399">Thus, respective primary electron beams are irradiated on respective locations such that a distance between any locations may be apart more than that for the resolution of the secondary optical system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> is an enlarged top plan view of an electron beam irradiation plane, wherein a distance N represents the resolution converted to the distance on the sample after having passed through lenses <b>1008</b>, <b>1011</b> and <b>1012</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the distance N being equal to or longer than a distance between distinguishable two points allows to obtain a multi-beam without cross-talk and also allows to accomplish high throughput. The electron beam apparatus configured as described above can be used for defect inspection of semiconductor and for measurement of micro-distance.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">If the electron beam apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is used in the chip inspection process according to the flow chart illustrative of an exemplary method for manufacturing a semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the inspection with higher throughput or even a hundred percent inspection may be attained while allowing the yield of the products to be improved and preventing any faulty products from being delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">As apparent from the above description, according to the electron beam apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, since almost all of the secondary charged particles emanated from the sample can be detected without generating any cross talks, the defect inspection or the pattern line width measurement with higher S/N ratio can be attained successfully.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Further, since the aberration of the secondary optical system of about 20 μm on the sample surface also provides a satisfied detection result, the secondary optical system may not necessarily be of high precision, while the primary optical system orthogonal to the sample requires the formation of a plurality of charged particle beams to be of high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Still further, since between the sample surface and the first stage of lens in the secondary optical system, there has been applied a decelerating electric field with respect to the primary optical system or an accelerating electric field with respect to the secondary optical system, the primary charged particle beams are more easily converged and also the secondary charged particles emanated over the wide angle range are more easily formed into a narrower bundle of particles at the position of the first stage of lens so as to be detected efficiently, so that a signal with better S/N ratio can be obtained and also the accuracy in measurement can be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0407" num="0406"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref> show a charged beam apparatus of a fourth embodiment of the present invention. A division plate <b>2014</b> is attached onto an upper face of a Y directionally movable unit <b>2005</b> of a stage <b>2003</b>, wherein said division plate <b>2014</b> overhangs to a great degree approximately horizontally in the +Y direction and the −Y direction (the lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>), so that between an upper face of an X directionally movable unit <b>2006</b> and said division plate <b>2014</b> may be always provided a narrow gap <b>2050</b> with small conductance therebetween. Also, a similar division plate <b>2012</b> is attached onto the upper face of the X directionally movable unit <b>2006</b> so as to overhang in the +X direction (the lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>), so that a narrow gap <b>2051</b> may be constantly formed between an upper face of a stage table <b>2007</b> and said division plate <b>2012</b>. The stage table <b>2007</b> is fixedly secured onto a bottom wall within a housing <b>2008</b> with a known method.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">In this way, since the narrow gaps <b>2050</b> and <b>2051</b> are constantly formed wherever the sample table <b>2004</b> may move to, and the gaps <b>2050</b> and <b>2051</b> can prevent the movement of a desorbed gas even if a gas is desorbed or leaked along the guiding plane <b>2006</b><i>a </i>or <b>2007</b><i>a </i>upon movement of the movable unit <b>2005</b> or <b>2006</b>, a pressure increase can be significantly controlled to low level in a space <b>2024</b> adjacent to the sample to which the charged beam is irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">Since in a side face and an under face of the movable unit <b>2005</b> and also in an under face of the movable unit <b>2006</b> of the stage <b>2003</b>, there are provided grooves for differential pumping formed surrounding hydrostatic bearings <b>2009</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, which work for vacuum-pumping, therefore in a case where narrow gaps <b>2050</b> and <b>2051</b> have been formed, the emitted gas from the guiding planes is mainly evacuated by those differential pumping sections. Owing to this, the pressure in those spaces <b>2013</b> and <b>2015</b> within the stage are kept to be higher level than the pressure within a chamber C.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">Accordingly, if there are more portions provided for vacuum-pumping the spaces <b>2013</b> and <b>2015</b> in addition to the differential pumping grooves <b>2017</b> and <b>2018</b>, the pressure within the spaces <b>2013</b> and <b>2015</b> can be decreased, and the pressure rise of the space <b>2024</b> in the vicinity of the sample can be controlled to be further low. For this purpose, vacuum pumping channels <b>2011</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>2011</b>-<b>2</b> are provided. The vacuum pumping channel <b>2011</b>-<b>1</b> extends through the stage table <b>2007</b> and the housing <b>2008</b> to interact with an outside of the housing <b>2008</b>. On the other hand, the pumping channel <b>2011</b>-<b>2</b> is formed in the X directionally movable unit <b>2006</b> and opened in an under face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">It is to be noted that though arranging the division plates <b>2012</b> and <b>2014</b> might cause a problem requiring the chamber C to be extended so as not to interfere with the division plates, this can be improved by employing those division plates of stretchable material or structure. There may be suggested one embodiment in this regard, which employs the division plates made of rubber or in a form of bellows, and the ends portions thereof in the direction of movement are fixedly secured respectively, so that each end of the division plate <b>2014</b> is secured to the X directionally movable unit <b>2006</b> and that of the division plate <b>2012</b> to the inner wall of the housing <b>2008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a charged beam apparatus of a fifth embodiment of the present invention. In the fifth embodiment, a cylindrical divider <b>2016</b> is disposed surrounding the tip portion of the lens column or the charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b>, so that a narrow gap may be produced between an upper face of a sample S and the tip portion of the lens column. In such configuration, even if the gas is emitted from the XY stage to increase the pressure within the chamber C, since a space within the divider <b>2024</b> has been isolated by the divider <b>2016</b> and exhausted with a vacuum pipe <b>2010</b>, there could be generated a pressure deference between the pressure in the chamber C and that in the space within the divider <b>2024</b>, thus to control the pressure rise in the space within the divider <b>2024</b> to be low. Preferably, the gap between the divider <b>2016</b> and the sample surface should be approximately some ten μm to some mm, depending on the pressure level to be maintained within the chamber C and in the surrounding of the irradiating section <b>2002</b>. It is to be understood that the interior of the divider <b>2016</b> is made to communicate with the vacuum pipe by the known method.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">On the other hand, the charged beam irradiation apparatus may sometimes apply a high voltage of about some kV to the sample S, and so it is feared that any conductive materials located adjacent to the sample could cause an electric discharge. In this case, the divider <b>2016</b> made of insulating material such as ceramic may be used in order to prevent any discharge between the sample S and the divider <b>2016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">It is to be noted that a ring member <b>2004</b>-<b>1</b> arranged so as to surround the sample S (a wafer) is a plate-like adjusting part fixedly mounted on the sample table <b>2004</b> and set to have the same height with the wafer so that a micro gap <b>2052</b> may be formed throughout a full circle of the tip portion of the divider <b>2016</b> even in a case of the charged particles beam being irradiated against an edge portion of the sample such as the wafer. Thereby, whichever location on the sample S may be irradiated by the charged beam, the constant micro gap <b>2052</b> can be always formed in the tip portion of the divider <b>2016</b> so as to maintain the pressure stable in the space <b>2024</b> surrounding the lens column tip portion.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a charged beam apparatus <b>2200</b> of a sixth embodiment of the present invention. A divider <b>2019</b> having a differential pumping structure integrated therein is arranged so as to surround the charged particles beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> of a lens column <b>2001</b>. The divider <b>2019</b> is cylindrical in shape and has a circular channel <b>2020</b> formed inside thereof and an exhausting path <b>2021</b> extending upwardly from said circular channel <b>2020</b>. Said exhausting path <b>2021</b> is connected to a vacuum pipe <b>2023</b> via an inner space <b>2022</b>. A micro space as narrow as a few some tens μm to a few some mm is formed between the lower end of the divider <b>2019</b> and the upper face of the sample S.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">With such configuration, even if the gas is emitted from the stage in association with the movement of the stage resulting in an increase of the pressure within the chamber C, and eventually is to possibly flow into the space of tip portion or the charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b>, the gas is blocked to flow in by the divider <b>2019</b>, which has reduced the gap between the sample S and itself so as to make the conductance very low, thus to reduce the flow-in rate. Further, since any gas that has flown into is allowed to be evacuated through the circular channel <b>2020</b> to the vacuum pipe <b>2023</b>, there will be almost no gas remained to flow into the space <b>2024</b> surrounding the charged particles beam irradiating section <b>2002</b>, and accordingly the pressure of the space surrounding the charged particles beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> can be maintained to be a desired high vacuum level.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows a charged particles beam apparatus <b>2300</b> of a seventh embodiment of the present invention. A divider <b>2026</b> is arranged so as to surround the charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> in the chamber C and accordingly to isolate the charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> from the chamber C. This divider <b>2026</b> is coupled to a refrigeration system <b>2030</b> via a support member <b>2029</b> made of material of high thermal conductivity such as copper or aluminum, and is kept as cool as −100° C. to −200° C. A member <b>2027</b> is provided for isolating a thermal conduction between the cooled divider <b>2026</b> and the lens column and is made of material of low thermal conductivity such as ceramic, resin or the like. Further, a member <b>2028</b> is made of insulating material such as ceramic or the like and is attached to the lower end of the divider <b>2026</b> so as to prevent any electric discharge between the sample S and the divider <b>2026</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">With such configuration, any gas molecules attempting to flow into the space surrounding the charged particles beam irradiating section from the chamber C are blocked by the divider <b>2026</b>, and even if there are any molecules successfully flown into the section, they are frozen to be captured on the surface of the divider <b>2026</b>, thus allowing the pressure in the space <b>2024</b> surrounding the charged beam irradiating section to be kept low. It is to be noted that a variety type of refrigeration system may be used for the refrigerating machine in this embodiment, for example, a cooling machine using liquid nitrogen, a He refrigerating machine, a pulse-tube type refrigerating machine or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a charged particles beam apparatus <b>2400</b> of an eighth embodiment of the present invention. The division plates <b>2012</b> and <b>2014</b> are arranged on both of the movable units of the stage <b>2003</b> similarly to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, and thereby, if the sample table <b>2004</b> is moved to any locations, the space <b>2013</b> within the stage is separated from the inner space of the chamber C by those division plates communicating therewith through the narrow gaps <b>2050</b> and <b>2051</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">Further, another divider <b>2016</b> similar to that as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is formed surrounding the charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> so as to separate a space <b>2024</b> accommodating the charged beam irradiating section <b>2002</b> therein from the interior of the chamber C with a narrow gap <b>2052</b> disposed therebetween. Owing to this, upon movement of the stage, even if the gas absorbed on the stage is desorbed into the space <b>2013</b> to increase the pressure in this space, the pressure increase in the chamber C is kept to be low, and the pressure increase in the space <b>2024</b> is also kept to be much lower. This allows the pressure in the space <b>2024</b> for irradiating the charged beam to be maintained at low pressure level.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">Alternatively, employing the divider <b>2019</b> having the differential pumping mechanism integrated therein as explained with reference to the divider <b>2016</b>, or the divider <b>2026</b> cooled with the refrigerating system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> allows the space <b>2024</b> to be maintained stably with further lowered pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> schematically shows an exemplary optical system and detection system of the charged beam apparatus <b>2500</b> of a ninth embodiment according to the present invention. The optical system is arranged within the lens column, and said optical system and a detector are illustrative only, but the other optical systems and detectors may be used when required. The optical system <b>2060</b> of the charged particles beam apparatus comprises a primary optical system <b>2061</b> for irradiating a charged particles beam against the sample S loaded on the stage <b>2003</b>, and a secondary optical system <b>2071</b> to which secondary electrons emanated from the sample are introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">The primary optical system <b>2061</b> comprises; an electron gun <b>2062</b> for emitting the charged beam; lens systems <b>2063</b> and <b>2064</b> composed of two stages of electrostatic lenses for converging the charged beam emitted from the electron gun <b>2011</b>; a deflector <b>2065</b>; a Wien filter or an E×B separator <b>2066</b> for deflecting the charged beam so as for an optical axis thereof to be directed to perpendicular to the objective face; and lens systems <b>2067</b> and <b>2068</b> composed of two stages of electrostatic lenses, wherein said components of the primary optical system <b>2061</b> are disposed in order from the electron gun <b>2062</b> placed in the top so that the optical axis of the charged beam is inclined to the line orthogonal to the surface of the sample S (the sample plane), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The E×B deflecting system <b>2066</b> comprises an electrode <b>2661</b> and a magnet <b>2662</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">The secondary optical system <b>2071</b> is an optical system to which the secondary electrons emanated from the sample S are introduced, and comprises lens systems <b>2072</b> and <b>2073</b> composed of two stages of electrostatic lenses arranged in an upper side of the E×B deflecting system <b>2066</b> of the primary optical system. The detector <b>2080</b> detects the secondary electrons sent through the secondary optical system <b>2071</b>. Since respective components and structures of the above optical systems <b>2060</b> and the detector <b>2080</b> are the same as those according to the prior art, the detailed descriptions thereof should be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">The charged particles beam emitted from the electron gun <b>2062</b> is formed with a square aperture of the electron gun and contracted with the two-stage lens systems <b>2063</b> and <b>2064</b>, and after the optical axis thereof having been adjusted by the deflector <b>2065</b>, the beam is formed into a square with respective edges of 1.25 mm on the deflecting center plane of the E×B deflecting system <b>2066</b>. The E×B deflecting system <b>2066</b> is designed so that an electric field and a magnetic field are crossed within a plane orthogonal to a normal line of the sample, wherein when the relation among the electric field, the magnetic field and the energy of electrons satisfies a certain condition, the electrons are advanced straight forward, and for the case other than the above, the electrons are deflected into a predetermined direction depending on said mutual relation among the electric field, the magnetic field and the energy of electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the charged particles beam from the electron gun is directed to enter onto the sample S at a right angle, and further the secondary electrons emanated from the sample is advanced straight toward the detector <b>2080</b>.

The secondary electrons emanated from the sample S with the data for a pattern image contained therein is magnified with the lens systems <b>2067</b>, <b>2068</b> and <b>2072</b>, <b>2073</b>, so as to form a secondary electron image on the detector <b>2080</b>. These four stages of magnifying lenses, which are composed of the lens systems <b>2067</b> and <b>2068</b> forming a symmetrical tablet lens and the lens systems <b>2072</b> and <b>2073</b> forming another symmetrical tablet lens, make up the lenses of no distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">When the defect inspection apparatus and method or the exposing apparatus and method according to either of the third to the eighth embodiments of the present invention is applied to the inspection process (G) or the exposing process (c) in the flow chart illustrating an exemplary method for manufacturing a semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, any fine patterns are allowed to be inspected or exposed stably with higher accuracy, so that the yield of the products can be improved and any faulty products can be prevented from being delivered.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">According to the third to the ninth embodiments of the present invention, the following effects may be expected to obtain.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">(a) According to the fourth and the fifth embodiments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A</figref>, <b>20</b>B and <b>21</b>), the stage device can bring out a good performance of accurate positioning within vacuum atmosphere, and further the pressure in the space surrounding the charged particles beam irradiating location is hardly increased. That is, it allows the charged particles beam processing to be applied to the sample with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">(b) According to the sixth embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>), it is almost impossible for the gas emitted or leaked from the hydrostatic bearing support section to go though the divider and reach to the space for the charged beam irradiating system. Thereby, the vacuum level in the space surrounding the charged beam irradiating location can be further stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">(c) According to the seventh embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>), it is harder for the desorbed gas to go through to the space for the charged particles beam irradiating system, and it is facilitated to maintain the vacuum level in the space surrounding the charged beam irradiating location stable.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">(d) According to the eighth embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), the interior of the vacuum chamber is partitioned into three chambers, i.e., a charged particles beam irradiation chamber, a hydrostatic bearing chamber and an intermediate chamber which communicate with each other via a small conductance. Further, the vacuum pumping system is constructed to control the pressures in the respective chambers sequentially, such that the pressure in the charged particles beam irradiation chamber is the lowest, the intermediate chamber medium, and the hydrostatic bearing chamber the highest. The pressure fluctuation in the intermediate chamber can be reduced by the divider, and the pressure fluctuation in the charged beam irradiation chamber can be further reduced by another step of divider, so that the pressure fluctuation therein can be reduced substantially to a non-problematic level.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">(e) According to the fifth to seventh embodiments of the present invention, the pressure increase upon movement of the stage can be controlled to be low.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">(f) According to the eighth embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) of the present invention, the pressure increase upon movement of the stage can be further controlled to be lower.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">(g) According to the fifth to eighth embodiments of the present invention, since the defect inspection apparatus with highly accurate stage positioning performance and with a stable vacuum level in the charged beam irradiating region can be accomplished, the inspection apparatus with high inspection performance and without any fear of contamination of the sample can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">(h) According to the fifth to eighth embodiments of the present invention, since the defect inspection apparatus with highly accurate stage positioning performance and with a stable vacuum level in the charged particles beam irradiating region can be accomplished, the exposing apparatus with high exposing accuracy and without any fear of contamination of the sample can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">(i) According to the fifth to eighth embodiments of the present invention, manufacturing the semiconductor by using the apparatus with highly accurate stage positioning performance and with a stable vacuum level in the charged beam irradiating region allows to form a fine semiconductor circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0439" num="0438">It is to be noted that the present specification has designated said image as the secondary electron image, although said secondary electron image actually affected by not only the secondary electrons but also the contribution of the scattered electrons and the reflected electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">Further, between the objective lens <b>3010</b> and the wafer <b>3005</b>, there is arranged a deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> for deflecting an incident angle of the primary electron beam onto the wafer <b>3005</b> by the electric field or the like. This deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> is connected with a deflection controller <b>3012</b> for controlling the electric field of said deflecting electrode. This deflection controller <b>3012</b> is connected to the control section <b>3016</b> to control the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> so that the electric field may be generated by said deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> in response to a command from the control section <b>3016</b>. It is to be noted that the deflection controller <b>3012</b> may be a voltage controller for controlling a voltage applied to the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">The detector <b>3007</b> may have any arbitrary configuration so far as it can convert the secondary electron image formed by the electrostatic lens <b>3006</b> into a signal capable of being processed later. For example, as shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the detector <b>3007</b> may comprise a multi-channel plate <b>3050</b>, a fluorescent screen <b>3052</b>, a relay optical system <b>3054</b>, and an image sensor <b>3056</b> composed of a plurality of CCD elements. The multi-channel plate <b>3050</b> comprises a plurality of channels within the plate so as to generate more electrons during the secondary electrons formed into the image by the electrostatic lens <b>3006</b> passing through those channels. That is, the multi-channel plate <b>3050</b> amplifies the secondary electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">The fluorescent screen <b>3052</b> emits fluorescence by the amplified secondary electrons to convert the secondary electrons into light (fluorescence). The relay lens <b>3054</b> guides said fluorescence to the CCD image sensor <b>3056</b>, and then said CCD image sensor <b>3056</b> converts the intensity distribution of the secondary electrons on the surface of the wafer <b>3005</b> to an electric signal, i.e., a digital image data for each element, which in turn is output to the control section <b>3016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">The control section <b>3016</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, may be composed of a general-purpose computer or the like. This computer may comprise a control section main unit <b>3014</b> for executing various controls and operations according to a predetermined program, a CRT <b>3015</b> for displaying processed results from the main unit <b>3014</b>, and an input section <b>3018</b> such as a mouse or a keyboard used by an operator for inputting an command, and, of course, said control section <b>3016</b> may be composed of a hardware working exclusively for a defect inspection apparatus, a work station, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The control section main unit <b>3014</b> may comprises various control substrates such as a CPU, a RAM, a ROM, a hard disk, and a video substrate, which are not illustrated. A secondary electron image storage region <b>3008</b> is allocated onto the memory such as the RAM or the hard disk, for storing the electric signal received from the detector <b>3007</b>, i.e., the digital image data for the secondary electron image of the wafer <b>3005</b>. Further, on the hard disk, there is a reference image storage section <b>3013</b> for storing beforehand a reference image data of the wafer having no defect. Still further, on the hard disk, in addition to the control program for controlling the whole unit of the defect inspection apparatus, a defect detection program <b>3009</b> is stored for reading the secondary electron image data from the storage region <b>3008</b> and automatically detecting a defect in the wafer <b>3005</b> based on said image data according to the predetermined algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">This defect detection program <b>3009</b>, as will be described in more detail later, has such a function that it performs a matching of reference image read out from the reference image storage section <b>3013</b> to an actually detected secondary electron image in order to automatically detect any defective parts, so that it may indicate a warning to the operator when it determines there is the defect existing. In this regard, the CRT <b>3015</b> may be designed to also display the secondary electron image <b>3017</b> on the display section thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">Then, an operation in the defect inspection apparatus <b>3000</b> according to the tenth embodiment will be described referring to those flow charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 to 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">First of all, as shown in the flow of the main routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the wafer <b>3005</b> to be inspected is placed on the stage <b>3004</b> (step <b>3300</b>). In this regard, the way of setting the wafer <b>3005</b> may take such a form that each of a plurality of wafers <b>3005</b> contained in a loader, though not shown, is set on the stage <b>3004</b> automatically one by one.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">Then, images for a plurality of regions to be inspected are respectively obtained, which are displaces one from another while being superimposed partially one on another on the XY plane of the surface of the wafer <b>3005</b> (Step <b>3304</b>). Each of said plurality of regions to be inspected, from which the image is to be obtained, is a rectangular region as designated by reference numeral <b>3032</b><i>a</i>, <b>3032</b><i>b</i>, . . . <b>3032</b><i>k</i>, . . . , each of which is observed to be displaced relative to one another while being partially superimposed one on another around the inspection pattern <b>3030</b> of the wafer. For example, 16 pieces of images for the regions to be inspected <b>3032</b> (the images to be inspected) may be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Herein, for the image as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, each square contained in the rectangle region corresponds to one pixel (or a block, whose unit is greater than the unit of pixel), and among those squares, shaded ones correspond to the imaged area of the pattern on the wafer <b>3005</b>. This step <b>3304</b> will be described in more detail later with reference to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">Then the process compares the image data for the plurality of regions to be inspected, which have been obtained at Step <b>3304</b>, respectively with the reference image stored in the storage section <b>3013</b> to look for any matching (Step <b>3308</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and determines whether or not there is a defect existing in the wafer inspection plane encompassed by said plurality of regions to be inspected. This process performs, what is called, the matching operation between image data, which will be explained later in detail with reference to the flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">If the result from the comparing process at Step <b>3308</b> indicates that there is a defect in the wafer inspection plane encompassed by said plurality of regions to be inspected (Step <b>3312</b>, affirmative determination), the process gives a warning to the operator indicating the existence of the defect (Step <b>3318</b>). As for the way of warning, for example, the display section of the CRT <b>3015</b> may display a message noticing the operator that there is a defect, or at the same time may additionally display a magnified image <b>3017</b> of the pattern determined to have the defect. Such defective wafers may be immediately taken out of a sample chamber <b>3</b> and stored in another storage separately from those wafers having no defect (Step <b>3319</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">If the result from the comparing process at Step <b>3308</b> indicates that there is no defect in the wafer <b>3005</b> (Step <b>3312</b>, negative determination), the process determines whether or not there are remained more regions to be inspected for the wafer <b>3005</b> currently treated as the inspection object (Step <b>3314</b>). If there are more regions remained for inspection (Step <b>3314</b>, affirmative determination), the stage <b>3004</b> is driven to move the wafer <b>3005</b> so that other regions to be further inspected are positioned within the irradiative region of the primary electron beam (Step <b>3316</b>). Subsequently, the process goes back to Step <b>3302</b> to repeat the similar operations for said other regions to be inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">If there is no more regions remained to be further inspected (Step <b>3314</b>, negative determination), or after a drawing out processing of the defective wafer (Step <b>3319</b>), the process determines whether or not the current wafer treated as the inspection object is the last wafer to be inspected, that is, whether or not there are any wafers remaining for the inspection in the loader, though not shown (Step <b>3320</b>). If the current wafer is not the last one (Step <b>3320</b>, negative determination), the wafers having been inspected already are stored in a predetermined storing location, and a new wafer which has not been inspected yet is set instead on the stage <b>3004</b> (Step <b>3322</b>). Then, the process goes back to Step <b>3302</b> to repeat the similar operations for said wafer. In contrast, the current wafer is the last one (Step <b>3320</b>, affirmative determination), the wafer having been inspected is stored in the predetermined storing location to end the whole process.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">Then, the process flow of step <b>3304</b> will now be described with reference to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, first of all, an image number “i” is set to the initial value “1” (Step <b>3330</b>). This image number is an identification number assigned serially to each of the plurality of images for the regions to be inspected. Secondary, the process determines an image position (Xi,Yi) for the region to be inspected as designated by the set image number i (Step <b>3332</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">This image position is defined as a specific location within the region to be inspected for bounding said region, for example, a central location within said region. Currently, i=1 defines the image position as (X1, Y1), which corresponds, for example, to a central location of the region to be inspected <b>3032</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. The image position has been determined previously for every image region to be inspected, and stored, for example, in the hard disk of the control section <b>3016</b> to be read out at Step <b>3332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">Then, the deflection controller <b>3012</b> applies a potential to the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> (Step <b>3334</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) so that the primary electron beam passing through the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> may be irradiated against the image region to be inspected in the image position (Xi, Yi) determined at Step <b>3332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">Then, the electron gun <b>3001</b> emits the primary electron beam, which goes through the electrostatic lens <b>3002</b>, the E×B deflecting system <b>3003</b>, the objective lens <b>3010</b> and the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b>, and eventually impinges upon a surface of the set wafer <b>3005</b> (Step <b>3336</b>). At that time, the primary electron beam is deflected by an electric field generated by the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> so as to be irradiated onto the wafer inspection surface <b>3034</b> covering the whole image region to be inspected at the image position (Xi, Yi). When i=1, the region to be inspected is <b>3032</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">The secondary electrons and/or the reflected electrons (hereafter referred exclusively to as “secondary electrons” for simplification) are emanated from the region to be inspected, to which the primary electron beam has been irradiated. Then, the generated secondary electron beam is formed into an image on the detector <b>3007</b> at a predetermined magnification by the electrostatic lens <b>3006</b> of a magnifying projection system. The detector <b>3007</b> detects the imaged secondary electron beam, and converts it into an electric signal for each detecting element, i.e., a digital image data (Step <b>3338</b>). Then, the detected digital image data for the image number i is sent to the secondary electron image storage region <b>3008</b> (Step <b>3340</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">Subsequently, the image number i is incremented by 1 (Step <b>3342</b>), and the process determines whether or not the incremented image number (i+1) is greater than a constant value “iMAX” (Step <b>3344</b>). This iMAX is the number of images to be inspected that are required to obtain, which is “16” for the above example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">If the image number i is not greater than the constant value iMAX (Step <b>3344</b>, negative determination), the process goes back to Step <b>3332</b> again, and determines again the image position (Xi+1, Yi+1) for the incremented image number (i+1). This image position is a position moved from the image position (Xi, Yi) determined at the previous routine by a specified distance (ΔXi, ΔYi) in the X direction and/or Y direction. The region to be inspected in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is at the location (X2, Y2), i.e., the rectangular region <b>3032</b><i>b </i>indicated with the dotted line, which has been moved from the position (X1, Y1) only in the Y direction. It is to be noted that the value for (ΔXi, ΔYi) (i=1, 2, . . . iMAX) may have been appropriately determined from the data indicating practically and experimentally how much is the displacement of the pattern <b>3030</b> on the wafer inspection surface <b>3034</b> from the field of view of the detector <b>3007</b> and a number and an area of the regions to be inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">Then, the operations for Step <b>3332</b> to Step <b>3342</b> are repeated in order for iMAX regions to be inspected. These regions to be inspected are continuously displaced while being partially superimposed one on another on the wafer inspection surface <b>3034</b> so that the image position after k times of movement (Xk,Yk) corresponds to the inspection image region <b>3032</b><i>k</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. In this way, the 16 pieces of inspection image data exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> are obtained in the image storage region <b>3008</b>. It is observed that a plurality of images obtained for the regions to be inspected <b>3032</b> (i.e., inspection image) contains partially or fully the image <b>3030</b><i>a </i>of the pattern <b>3030</b> on the wafer inspection surface <b>3034</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">If the incremented image number i has become greater than iMAX (Step <b>3344</b>, affirmative determination), the process returns out of this subroutine and goes to the comparing process (Step <b>3308</b>) of the main routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">It is to be noted that the image data that has been transferred to the memory at Step <b>3340</b> is composed of intensity values of the secondary electrons for each pixel (so-called, raw data), and these data may be stored in the storage region <b>3008</b> after having been processed through various operations in order to use for performing the matching operation relative to the reference image in the subsequent comparing process (Step <b>3308</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">Such operations includes, for example, a normalizing process for setting a size and/or a density of the image data to be matched with the size and/or the density of the reference image data, or the process for eliminating as a noise the isolated group of elements having the pixels not greater than the specified number. Further, the image data may be converted by means of data compression into a feature matrix having extracted features of the detected pattern rather than the simple raw data, so far as it does not negatively affect to the accuracy in detection of the highly precise pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">Such feature matrix includes, for example, m×n feature matrix, in which a two-dimensional inspection region composed of M×N pixels is divided into m×n (m&lt;M, n&lt;N) blocks, and respective sums of intensity values of the secondary electrons of the pixels contained in each block (or the normalized value defined by dividing said respective sums by a total number of pixels covering all of the regions to be inspected) should be employed as respective components of the matrix. In this case, the reference image data also should have been stored in the same form of representation. The image data in the content used in the tenth embodiment of the present invention includes, of course, a simple raw data but also includes any image data having the feature extracted by any arbitrary algorithms as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">The process flow for Step <b>3308</b> will now be described with reference to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. First of all, the CPU in the control section <b>3016</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) reads the reference image data out of the reference image storage section <b>3013</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) onto the working memory such as the RAM or the like (Step <b>3350</b>). This reference image is identified by reference numeral <b>3036</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Then, the image number “i” is reset to 1 (Step <b>3352</b>), and then the process reads out the inspection image data having the image number i onto the working memory (Step <b>3354</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">Then, the read out reference image data is compared with the data of the image i for any matching to calculate a distance value “Di” between both data (Step <b>3356</b>). This distance value Di indicates a similarity level between the reference image and the image to be inspected “i”, wherein a greater distance value indicates the greater difference between the reference image and the inspection image. Any unit of amount representative of the similarity level may be used for said distance value Di.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">For example, if the image data is composed of M×N pixels, the process may consider that the secondary electron intensity (or the amount representative of the feature) for each pixel is each of the position vector components of M×N dimensional space, and then calculate an Euclidean distance or a correlation coefficient between the reference image vector and the image i vector in the M×N dimensional space. It will be easily appreciated that any distance other than the Euclidean distance, for example, the urban area distance may be calculated. Further, if the number of pixels is huge, which increases the amount of the operation significantly, then the process may calculates the distance value between both image data represented by the m×n feature vector as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">Subsequently, it is determined if the calculated distance value Di is smaller than a predetermined threshold Th (Step <b>3358</b>). This threshold Th is determined experimentally as a criteria for judging a sufficient matching between the reference image and the inspection image to be inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">If the distance value Di is smaller than the predetermined threshold Th (Step <b>3358</b>, affirmative determination), the process determines that the inspection plane <b>3034</b> of said wafer <b>3005</b> has “no defect” (Step <b>3360</b>) and returns out of this sub routine. That is, if there is found at least one image among those inspection images matching to the reference image, the process determines there is “no defect”. Accordingly, since the matching operation shall not necessarily be applied to every inspection image, the high-speed judgment becomes possible. As for the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, it is observed that the image to be inspected at the column <b>3</b> of the row <b>3</b> is approximately matching to the reference image without any offset thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">When the distance value Di is not smaller than the threshold Th (Step <b>3358</b>, negative determination), the image number i is incremented by 1 (Step <b>3362</b>), and then it is determined whether or not the incremented image number (i+1) is greater than the predetermined value iMAX (Step <b>3364</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">If the image number i is not greater than the predetermined value iMAX (Step <b>3364</b> negative determination), the process goes back to Step <b>3354</b> again, reads out the image data for the incremented image number (i+1), and repeats the similar operations.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">If the image number i is greater than the predetermined value iMAX (Step <b>3364</b>, affirmative determination), then the process determines that said inspection plane <b>3034</b> of said wafer <b>3005</b> has “a defect existing” (Step <b>3366</b>), and returns out of the sub routine. That is, if any one of the images to be inspected is not approximately matching to the reference image, the process determined that there is “a defect existing”. A defect inspection apparatus <b>3000</b> according to the present invention may use not only the electron beam apparatus of the image projective type as described above but also an electron beam apparatus of, what is called, the scanning type. This will now be explained as an eleventh embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electron beam apparatus of the eleventh embodiment according to the present invention, in which the electron beam emitted from an electron gun <b>3061</b> is converged by a condenser lens <b>3062</b> to form a crossover at a point <b>3064</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">Beneath the condenser lens <b>3062</b> a first multi-aperture plate <b>3063</b> having a plurality of apertures is disposed, thereby to form a plurality of primary electron beams. Each of those primary electron beams formed by the first multi-aperture plate <b>3063</b> is contracted by a demagnifying lens <b>3065</b> to be projected onto a point <b>3075</b>. After being focused on the point <b>3075</b>, the first electron beams are further focused onto a sample <b>3068</b> by an objective lens <b>3067</b>. A plurality of first electron beams exited from the first multi-aperture plate <b>3063</b> is deflected all together by a deflecting system <b>3080</b> arranged between the demagnifying lens <b>3065</b> and the objective lens <b>3067</b> so as to scan the surface of the sample <b>3068</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">In order not to produce any field curvature aberration by the demagnifying lens <b>3065</b> and the objective lens <b>3067</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the multi-aperture plate is provided with a plurality of small apertures located along a circle such that projections thereof in the X direction is equally spaced.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">A plurality of focused primary electron beams is irradiated onto the sample <b>3068</b> at a plurality of points thereon, and secondary electrons emanated from said plurality of points are attracted by an electric field of the objective lens <b>3067</b> to be converged narrower, and then deflected by an E×B separator <b>3066</b> so as to be introduced into a secondary optical system. The secondary electron image is focused on the point <b>3076</b> which is much closer to the objective lens <b>3067</b> than the point <b>3075</b>. This is because each of the primary electron beams has the energy of 500 eV on the surface of the sample, while the secondary electron beam only has the energy of a few eV.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">The secondary optical system has a magnifying lens <b>3069</b> and <b>3070</b>, wherein the secondary electron beam after passing through those magnifying lenses <b>3069</b> and <b>3070</b> is imaged on a plurality of apertures in a second multi-aperture plate <b>3071</b>. Then, the second electron beam passes through those apertures to be detected by a plurality of detectors <b>3072</b>. It is to be noted that the plurality of apertures formed through the second multi-aperture plate <b>3071</b> disposed in front of the detectors <b>3072</b> corresponds to the plurality of apertures formed through the first multi-aperture plate <b>3063</b> on one to one basis.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">Each of the detectors <b>3072</b> converts the detected secondary electron beam into an electric signal representative of its intensity. Such electric signals output from respective detectors, after being amplified respectively by an amplifier <b>3073</b>, are received by an image processing section <b>3074</b> so as to be converted into image data. Since the image processing section <b>3074</b> is further supplied with a scanning signal from the deflecting system <b>3080</b> for deflecting the primary electron beam, the image processing section <b>3074</b> can display an image representing the surface of the sample <b>3068</b>. This image corresponds to one of those plural images to be inspected at the different locations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) as described with reference to the tenth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">Comparing this image with the reference image <b>3036</b> allows any defects in the sample <b>3068</b> to be detected. Further, the line width of the pattern on the sample <b>3068</b> can be measured in such a way that the evaluation pattern on the sample <b>3068</b> is moved by a registration to the proximity of an optical axis of the primary optical system, and the evaluation pattern is then line-scanned to extract the line width evaluation signal, which is in turn appropriately calibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">In this regard, it is preferred to make arrangements when the primary electrons passed through the apertures of the first multi-aperture plate <b>3063</b> is focused onto the surface of the sample <b>3068</b>, and then the secondary electrons emanated from the sample <b>3068</b> are formed into an image on the detector <b>3072</b>, in order to minimize the affection by the three aberrations, i.e., the distortion caused by the primary electron optical systems, the field curvature, and the astigmatism.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">Then, regarding the relation between the spacing in the plurality of primary electron beams and the secondary electron optical system, if the space between respective primary electron beams is determined to be greater than the aberration of the secondary optical system, then the cross talk among a plurality of beams can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">Also in the scanning electron beam apparatus <b>3100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the sample <b>3068</b> is inspected according to the flow chart as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>. In this case, the image position (Xi, Yi) at Step <b>3332</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> corresponds to the central location of the two-dimensional image made by combining a plurality of line images obtained through scanning with the multi-beam. This image position (Xi, Yi) could be sequentially modified in the subsequent processes, which may be performed by, for example, changing the offset voltage of the deflecting system <b>3080</b>. The deflecting system <b>3080</b> performs the normal line scanning by changing the voltage around the set offset voltage. It is apparent that a separate deflecting means other than the deflecting system <b>3080</b> may be employed to control the image position (Xi, Yi).</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">A defect inspection apparatus described in either of the tenth or the eleventh embodiment may be applied to the semiconductor device manufacturing processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> for a wafer evaluation. Those flow charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> includes a wafer manufacturing process for manufacturing the wafer (or a wafer preparing process for preparing the wafer), a mask fabrication process for fabricating the mask to be used in the exposing process (or a mask preparing process for preparing the mask), a wafer fabrication process for performing any necessary processes for a wafer, a chip assembling process for cutting out chips formed on the wafer one by one so as to be operative, and a chip inspection process for inspecting those assembled chips.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">Among these processes, the main process that decisively affects the performance of the device is the wafer processing process. In this wafer processing process, the designed circuit patterns are printed on the wafer one on another, thus to form many chips which will work as memories or CPUs. This wafer processing process includes the following respective processes:</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">(1) A thin film deposition process for forming a dielectric thin film to be used as an insulation layer and/or a metallic thin film to form an interconnect section or an electrode section, or the likes (by using the CVD process or the sputtering);</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">(2) An oxidation process for oxidizing the deposited thin film layer and/or the wafer substrate;</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0486">(3) A lithography process for forming a pattern of the resist by using the mask (reticle) in order to selectively process the thin film layer and/or the wafer substrate;</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0487">(4) An etching process for processing the thin film layer and/or the wafer substrate in accordance with the resist pattern (e.g., by using the dry etching process);</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0488">(5) An ions/impurities implantation and diffusion process;</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489">(6) A resist stripping process; and</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">(7) An inspection process for inspecting the processed wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">It should be noted that, the wafer processing process must be performed repeatedly depending on the number of layers required thus to manufacture the semiconductor device that will be operative as designed.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">The flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the lithography process which is a core process in the wafer processing processes described above. The lithography process comprises the respective processes as described below:</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">(1) A resist coating process for coating the wafer having the circuit pattern formed thereon in the previous process, with the resist;</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">(2) An exposing process for exposing the resist;</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">(3) A developing process for developing the exposed resist to obtain the pattern of the resist; and</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">(4) An annealing process for stabilizing the developed pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0497">Any known processes may be applied to the semiconductor device manufacturing process, the wafer processing process and the lithography process described above.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0498">When the defect inspection apparatus according to either of the above described embodiments of the present invention is used in the above (7) wafer inspection process, the apparatus can inspect even a semiconductor device having a fine pattern for defect detection with high accuracy under the conditions where there is no resultant faulty image for the secondary electron image, so that a yield of the products can be improved and any defective products can be prevented from being delivered into the market.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0499">The present invention is not limited only to the above embodiments but also may be modified arbitrarily and preferably without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example, although the description has illustratively employed a semiconductor wafer <b>3005</b> as a sample to be inspected, the sample to be inspected in the present invention is not limited to this but anything may be selected as the sample so far as it can be inspected for defects by using the electron beam. For example, the object to be inspected may be a mask with an exposure pattern formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">Further, the present invention may be applied not only to an apparatus which detects any defects with charged particle beams other than electrons but also to any apparatus which allows any images to be obtained for inspecting the sample for defect detection.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">Still further, the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> may be disposed not only between the objective lens <b>3010</b> and the wafer <b>3005</b> but also at any arbitrary locations so far as the irradiation region of the primary electron beam can be controlled. For example, the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b> may be disposed between the E×B deflecting system <b>3003</b> and the objective lens <b>3010</b>, or between the electron gun <b>3001</b> and the E×B deflecting system <b>3003</b>. Further the E×B deflecting system <b>3003</b> may control the deflecting direction by controlling the field generated thereby. That is, the E×B deflecting system <b>3003</b> may function also as the deflecting electrode <b>3011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">Further, although in the above tenth and eleventh embodiments, either one of the matching between the pixels and the matching between the feature vectors has been employed for the matching operation between image data, they may be combined together for it. For example, a much faster and more precise matching process can be constructed by two-step matching, in which firstly a high-speed matching is performed with the feature vectors which requires fewer number of operations, and subsequently the more precise matching is performed with more detailed pixel data for the images to be inspected that have been found to be quite similar.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0503">Still further, although in the tenth and the eleventh embodiments according to the present invention, the position mismatch for the image to be inspected has been resolved only by displacing the irradiating region of the primary electron beam, the present invention may be combined with a process for retrieving an optimal matching region on the image data before or during the matching processes (e.g., first detecting the regions having higher correlation coefficient and then performing the matching). This can improve the accuracy in defect detection, because the major position mismatch for the image to be inspected is rectified by displacing the irradiating region of the primary electron beam, while the relatively minor position mismatch can be absorbed subsequently with the digital image processing.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">Yet further, although the configurations for an electron beam apparatus for defect detection have been illustratively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 33</figref>, the electron optical systems or the like may be preferably and arbitrarily modified so far as it functions well. For example, although each of the electron beam irradiation means (<b>3001</b>, <b>3002</b>, <b>3003</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> has been designed so as to irradiate the primary electron beam onto the surface of the wafer <b>3005</b> at a right angle from above, the E×B deflecting system <b>3003</b> may be omitted so that the primary electron beam may diagonally impinge upon the wafer <b>3005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505">Still further, the flow in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is also not limited to the illustrated one. For example, although in the embodiment the process does not further perform the defect detection in any other regions of the sample that has been determined to have a defect at Step <b>3312</b>, the flow may be modified so that the overall area can be inspected for any defects to be detected. Yet further, if the irradiating area of the primary electron beam can be expanded so as to cover almost overall area of the sample with one shot of irradiation, Steps <b>3314</b> and <b>3316</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0506">As described above in detail, according to the defect inspection apparatus of the tenth and the eleventh embodiment of the present invention, since the defect in the sample can be detected by first obtaining respective images of a plurality of regions to be inspected, which are displaced from one another while being partially superimposed one on another on the sample, and comparing those images of the regions to be inspected with the reference image, therefore an advantageous effect can be provided in that the accuracy in the defect detection can be prevented from being deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="0507">Further, according to the device manufacturing method employing the tenth and the eleventh embodiments of the present invention, since the defect detection is performed by using such a defect inspection apparatus as described above, therefore another advantageous effect can be provided in that the yield of the products can be improved and any faulty products can be prevented from being delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="0508"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> shows an electron beam apparatus <b>4000</b> of a twelfth embodiment according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0509">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, this electron beam apparatus comprises an electron gun <b>4001</b> for irradiating a primary electron beam against a sample T, and a secondary electron detector <b>4011</b> for detecting secondary electron beam from the sample T.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0510">The electron beam emitted from an electron gun <b>4001</b> is converged by a condenser lens <b>4002</b> to form a crossover on an aperture <b>4004</b> which determines NA (numerical aperture). Beneath the condenser lens <b>4002</b> is disposed a multi-aperture plate <b>4003</b> which is provided with 8 apertures <b>4014</b> in total as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. Said apertures <b>4014</b> are imaged on a deflection principal plane of an E×B deflecting system <b>4006</b> by a demagnifying lens <b>4005</b>, and further contracted by an objective lens <b>4007</b> and projected onto the sample T to form resultantly primary electron beam irradiation points E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). Those second electrons emanated from respective primary electron beam irradiation points E are deflected by the E×B deflecting system <b>4006</b> to the right hand side on paper and magnified by a secondary optical system <b>4009</b> so as to be imaged on a group of apertures of detectors <b>4010</b>. The sample T is carried on a movable stage (not shown) so as to be moved in the direction normal to paper of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> (Y direction).</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0511">Although the array of apertures <b>4014</b> of the aperture plate <b>4003</b> is designed as 3 rows×3 columns, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, preferably the apertures <b>4014</b> should be formed within only such a specific diameter that has the intensity of the electrons emitted from the electron gun (electron current density) greater than a certain level, and so in the illustrated example, the aperture on the third row at the third column has not been provided. Further, the apertures at the second and the third rows are offset respectively with respect to the apertures at the first and the second rows toward the right direction viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> by the amount of ⅓ of the distance D<b>1</b> between the columns.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0512">Still further, those distances D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> between the apertures <b>4014</b> are designed so that the spacing between the irradiation points of the primary electron beams on the sample may be sufficient. This arrangement is employed to prevent any possible cross talks of the secondary electron images among respective beams on the group of apertures of the detector <b>4010</b> since the secondary optical system has a larger angular aperture to improve the detection efficiency and accordingly has large degree of aberration which could cause the above cross talks.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0513"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35B and 35C</figref> are plan views of aperture plates <b>4050</b> and <b>4060</b>, each having apertures formed therein along a circle respectively. Projected points onto the x-axis of apertures <b>4051</b>, <b>4052</b>, . . . of the aperture plate <b>4050</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref> are equally spaced by Lx, and similarly, projected points onto the x-axis of apertures <b>4061</b>, <b>4062</b>, . . . of the aperture plate <b>4060</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35C</figref> are also equally spaced by Lx. In the electron beam apparatus <b>4000</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, each of the primary electron beams is disposed so as to minimize a maximum value of distances between any adjacent primary electron beams to be arranged two-dimensionally on a sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0514">Distance ratios between adjacent two apertures of the aperture plate <b>4050</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>, which are designated by <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, <b>50</b><i>e </i>and <b>50</b><i>f</i>, are <b>47</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>63</b> and <b>41</b> respectively, and distance ratios between adjacent two apertures of the aperture plate <b>4060</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35C</figref>, which are designated by <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>and <b>60</b><i>f</i>, are <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>41</b> respectively. By comparison between these two aperture plates, it is found that since in the aperture plates <b>4060</b>, the maximum value of the distance ratios between adjacent primary electron beams is <b>57</b>, which is smaller than <b>50</b><i>b </i>(<b>63</b>) of the aperture plate <b>4050</b>, the aperture plate <b>4060</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35C</figref> is superior to the aperture plate <b>4050</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref> in the arrangement of the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">Using the aperture plate with such a condition described above is advantageous in that the distances between actually adjacent primary beams are approximately equal, thus providing good symmetry property, that the astigmatism is not likely to occur, that since being spaced apart from each other, the primary electron beam is not likely to be made blur by the space charge effect, and that since respective primary electron beams are irradiated onto the sample at or near to symmetric positions thereon respectively, an effect of charging on the sample may be alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">The primary electron beam is separated into a plurality of beams by those small apertures <b>4014</b>, and they are imaged on the deflection principal plane of the E×B deflecting system <b>4006</b> by the demagnifying lens <b>4005</b>, further contracted by the objective lens <b>4007</b> and projected onto the sample T to resultantly form the primary electron beam irradiation points E as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517">Those second electrons emanated from respective primary electron beam irradiation points E are accelerated and converged in an electric field applied between the objective lens <b>4007</b> and the sample surface, deflected by the E×B deflecting system <b>4006</b> disposed between the objective lens <b>4007</b> and another lens on the electron gun side to the right hand side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, magnified by the lens <b>4009</b> of the secondary optical system to be imaged on the detective aperture plate <b>4010</b> having a plurality of apertures formed therethrough, and finally detected by the secondary electron detector <b>4011</b>. The sample T is carried on a movable stage (not shown) so as to be moved in the direction normal to paper of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> (Y direction).</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0518">Further, those distances D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> between the small apertures <b>4014</b> are designed so that the spacing between the irradiation points of the primary electron beams on the sample T may be sufficient. For a case where the spacing between the irradiation points is not constant, the smallest value for the spacing will be a matter of problem and said smallest value for the spacing is accordingly required to be made as large as possible. This is required to prevent any possible cross talks of the secondary electron images among respective secondary electron beams on the detective aperture plate <b>4010</b> since the secondary optical system has a larger angular aperture to improve the detection efficiency and accordingly has large degree of aberration which could cause the above cross talks.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0519">The deflecting system <b>4012</b> and <b>4013</b> for electron beam scanning have been designed so as to cause a scanning motion of the primary electron beam irradiation points E on the sample T in the direction toward the column on the right hand side (X direction) viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, and the scanning distance S should be designed so as to be equivalent to the amount of about ⅓ of the spacing H between the columns of the irradiation points E (S=H/3+α).</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0520">Then, after the sample T being moved in the Y direction by the distance encompassing the region to be detected, the stage is moved by step in the X direction to move the sample in the X direction by 400 μm, and then as similarly to the above description, the raster scanning (in the X direction by 400 μm+α) will be performed while continuously moving the stage in the −Y direction. Repeating said processes may provide the image data for every region to be inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0521">When the inspection of the sample T is carried out in said electron beam apparatus, the movable stage <b>4020</b> is moved so as to move the sample in the Y direction continuously. During this movement, the scanning deflectors <b>4012</b> and <b>4014</b> causes the scanning motion of each of the primary electron beam irradiation points E in the X direction by ⅓H+α as described above, and in an exemplary case where the spacing H between the respective primary electron beam irradiation points E is 150 μm, each of the primary electron beam irradiation points E accomplishes the scanning with the width of (150 μm×⅓)+α to obtain the image data for the range of (150 μm×⅓)×8 (points) (=400 μm+α) as a whole. When the sample is moved by the distance equivalent to the length of the sample in the Y direction, the movable stage moves the sample in the X direction by 400 μm and the scanning is carried out by the retrace movement in the Y direction as similarly to the above description.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0522">Comparing this image data with the image obtainable from a predetermined pattern data accomplishes a desired inspection. Since in the illustrated example, 8 channels have been employed to receive the signals and also the serial inspection has been carried out during the period other than the time required for the retrace movement, the processing speed will be significantly improved to be higher in comparison with that in the prior art. It is to be noted that, when the inspection region width of the sample (the width in the X direction) being assumed to be 200 mm, the number of retraces is calculated as 200 mm/0.4 mm=500 times, and this value is approximately equivalent to 4 minutes to be necessary for the retrace scanning in the overall inspection of one piece of sample with the rate of 0.5 second for each retrace, which seems to be extremely short. It is also noted that an axis-symmetrical electrode is designated by the reference numeral <b>4020</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0523">In case of the measurement of the line width, preferably each of the scanning deflectors <b>4012</b> and <b>4013</b> is made in the form of an octupole to also allow the scanning motion in the Y direction, in which the beam is moved to a location of the pattern to be measured by being deflected in the X direction, and then the Y directional scanning motion may be performed. In case of the measurement of the pattern line width in the X direction, the beam should be moved to a location of the pattern to be measured by adjusting the stage position and also by being deflected in the Y direction, and then the X directionally scanning motion and the signal processing similar to that in the prior art may be applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">In case of an alignment accuracy measurement, the pattern employable for evaluating the alignment accuracy should have been fabricated and then the scanning similar to that for the line width measurement may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0525">It is to be noted that in the 12th embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>), a single electron beam irradiating system with a single electron gun <b>4001</b> has been shown for the illustrative purpose, a plurality of electron beam irradiating systems may be employed which comprises a plurality of electron guns, and an aperture plate and a secondary electron detector which work associatively with said plurality of electron guns, wherein, in case of the above embodiment, said plurality of electron guns may be placed side by side in the X direction, so that the inspection for the width of 400 μm×(the number of the irradiating systems) may be performed with a single stroke of movement of the sample in the Y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0526">According to the 12<sup>th </sup>embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) of the present invention, since the inspection of the sample surface may be performed by moving the sample continuously in the direction orthogonal to the scanning width while covering an extended scanning width (400 μm in the above embodiment) with a plurality of primary electron beams, the scanning time for the overall surface of said sample may be significantly reduced. Further, since the plurality of primary electron beams is employed, the scanning width of each of the electron beams can be made narrower to reduce the chromatic aberration and thus to reduce the irradiation point E for the sample surface to be smaller, and the spacing between the electron beams can be kept sufficient, as well. Accordingly, this may also reduce any cross talks in the secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0527">Further, since the sample is continuously moved, there should be no time to be wasted for moving the sample in comparison with the conventional electron beam apparatus in which the sample must be held stationary for scanning the micro region and then the sample is moved for scanning another micro region. Yet further, employing a plurality of electron guns and constructing a plurality of electron beam irradiating systems may allow the inspection to be carried out more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">According to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention, since the irradiation points of the plurality of primary electron beams have been arranged two-dimensionally, the distance between the irradiations may be made greater. Also, since the distances between the irradiation points projected onto one axis (the X axis) are all equal, the scanning of the sample may be accomplished leaving no space between. Further, since the E×B has been used to allow the normal-incidence of the primary electron beam, the electron beam may be converged to be narrower.</p>

<p id="p-0537" num="0536">In this regard, since the value representative of the current density of the electron beam emitted from the electron gun <b>4101</b> is the greatest for that directed to the central aperture <b>4105</b><i>d </i>of the multi aperture plate <b>4105</b><i>d </i>and said value sequentially decreases in order of <b>4105</b><i>c</i>, <b>4105</b><i>b </i>and <b>4105</b><i>a </i>as being more distant from the optical axis, therefore there might be difference in beam currents on the surface of the sample <b>4113</b> depending on the location thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">In order to deal with this phenomenon, in one embodiment, the size of the apertures <b>4105</b><i>a</i>-<b>4105</b><i>d </i>of the multi-aperture plate <b>4105</b> may be finely adjusted such that the apertures in the vicinity of the optical axis are made smaller and the apertures are made larger gradually as they are distant from the optical axis, so that the beam currents passed through the respective apertures may be made equal for all of the beams on the surface of the sample <b>4113</b>. To accomplish this, a group of detectors for detecting each of the beam currents is mounted on the surface of the sample <b>4113</b> so as to detect the current for each of the beams.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0538">There is also suggested another method to deal with the above problem, in which the position along the optical axis of the NA aperture plate <b>4107</b> for determining the numerical aperture of said primary optical system is set to a position offset toward the electron gun <b>1</b> from the Gaussian image field (focal point of the paraxial beam) for the magnified image of the electron beam source formed by the lens of the primary optical system. This attempts to use the fact that the position of the crossover formed by the condenser lens <b>4103</b> depends on the spherical aberration of the lens, that is, the crossover position (the position along the optical axial direction) may be different for each of the beams passed through each of the apertures of the multi-aperture plate <b>4105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0539">For example, the position of the crossover to be formed by the beam from the aperture <b>4105</b><i>a </i>is equivalent to the position <b>4108</b><i>a</i>, while the position of the crossover to be formed by the beam from the aperture <b>4105</b><i>c </i>is equivalent to the position <b>4108</b><i>c</i>. That is, the Gaussian image field for the electron source formed by the lens of the primary optical system is at the farthest location from the NA aperture plate <b>4107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0540">Accordingly, if the NA aperture plate <b>4107</b> is displaced from the Gaussian image field position toward the electron gun <b>1</b> so as to be placed in a position of the crossover formed by the beam passed through the outermost aperture <b>4105</b><i>a </i>of the multi-aperture plate <b>4105</b>, then for the beam having passed through the aperture <b>4105</b><i>a</i>, the current density thereof may be greater when passing through the aperture <b>4107</b> without the passing thereof being limited, while the current density of the beam having passed through the aperture <b>4105</b><i>c </i>adjacent to the optical axis may be lower with the passing rate thereof being limited, so that the ununiformity in the intensities or beam currents on the surface of the sample <b>4113</b> could be reduced. It is to be noted that also in this case similarly to the previous embodiment, a group of detectors for detecting each of the beam currents may be disposed in a position for the sample surface in order to detect the current for each beam passed through each of the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0541">Further, the above problem may be dealt with by combining said adjustment in aperture size of the multi-aperture plate <b>4105</b> with said adjustment in position of the NA aperture plate <b>4107</b> on the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0542">Although the above embodiments have been described in the light of the common goal to uniform the beam currents entering onto the surface of the sample <b>4113</b>, there is another problem that the detection rate of the secondary electron in the secondary optical system actually varies depending on the location whether it is adjacent to or distant from the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0543">Accordingly, in still another embodiment of the present invention, the ununiformity in the detection rate of the secondary electron in the secondary optical system may be corrected by at first placing a sample having no pattern in the sample position, then detecting secondary electrons from said sample with no pattern by the group of detectors <b>4125</b>, and finally determining the location of the NA aperture plate <b>4107</b> on the optical axis so that the differences in outputs from the respective detectors are minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="0544">Further, the ununiformity in the detection rate of secondary electrons in the secondary optical system may be corrected by, as similarly to the above description, at first placing a sample having no pattern in the sample position, then detecting secondary electrons from said sample with no pattern by the group of detectors <b>4125</b>, and finally performing a fine tuning of the aperture size in the multi-aperture plate <b>4105</b> of the primary optical system in order to minimize the differences in outputs from the respective detectors, such that the aperture size is made smaller for the locations closer to the optical axis and made sequentially larger for the locations farther from the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0545">Still further, the ununiformity in the detection rate of secondary electrons in the secondary optical system may be corrected by, as similarly to the above description, at first placing a sample having no pattern in the sample position, then detecting secondary electrons from said sample with no pattern by the group of detectors <b>4125</b>, and finally performing a fine tuning of the aperture size of the multi-aperture plate <b>4123</b> of the secondary optical system in order to minimize the differences in outputs from the respective detectors, such that the aperture size is made smaller for the locations closer to the optical axis and made sequentially larger for the locations farther from the optical axis</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0546">Yet further, the above problem may be overcome by the combination of said adjustment of the aperture size in the multi-aperture plate <b>4105</b>, said adjustment in positioning the NA aperture plate <b>4107</b> along the optical axis and said adjustment of the aperture size in the multi-aperture plate <b>4123</b> of the secondary optical system. This is accomplished by utilizing the adjusting method in which the differences in the outputs from the respective detectors <b>4125</b> is minimized by a certain control and calculation techniques, though not illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0547">It is to be understood that in the thirteenth embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the evaluation between respective beams is performed in such a manner that the deflector <b>4117</b> deflects all the beams at once to scan the surface of the sample <b>4133</b> and the detector concurrently detects the signals. Also upon causing the scanning motion of the beams, the deflector <b>4121</b> has synchronized with the deflector <b>4111</b> to cause the scanning motion of the secondary electrons so that the secondary electrons from the respective incident points on the sample surface can enter the corresponding apertures of the multi-aperture plate <b>4123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0548">Applying an electron beam apparatus <b>4100</b> of the thirteenth embodiment according to the present invention to the inspection process for inspecting a wafer in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may accomplish the inspection or measurement of higher throughput and higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0549">The electron beam apparatus <b>4100</b> of the thirteenth embodiment according to the present invention is applicable to a variety of inspections or measurements including a defect inspection, a line width measurement, an alignment accuracy measurement, a voltage contrast measurement and the likes for photo mask or reticle and wafer or the likes (sample).</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0550">According to the electron beam apparatus <b>4100</b> of the thirteenth embodiment of the present invention, since an integrated cathode or a single electron gun has been employed to generate a plurality of beams, the possibility of malfunctions in the electron gun is significantly reduced in comparison with the case of a plurality of emitters being used, so that the reliability of the apparatus can be improved. Further, since the apparatus can accomplish the uniformity in the currents for the respective beams, the inspection and measurement with higher accuracy and higher throughput may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="0551">An electron gun such as the thermal field-emission electron gun that emits electrons toward a limited range may also be used in the electron beam apparatus <b>4100</b> of the thirteenth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0552">According to the electron beam apparatus <b>4100</b> of the thirteenth embodiment, since the currents of the respective beams can be made uniform, the number of beams of the multi-beam can be increased and thus the multi-beam can be irradiated to cover greater range. Accordingly, the inspection and the measurement may be performed with higher throughput. Further, the signal strengths of respective beams may be made almost equal to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0553">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 to 41</figref>, an electron beam apparatus <b>4200</b> of the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention will now be described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electron beam apparatus <b>4200</b> of one embodiment according to the present invention, in which the electron beam emitted from an electron gun <b>4201</b> is converged by a condenser lens <b>4202</b> to form a crossover at a point CO. At said crossover point CO is arranged the center of a diaphragm <b>4204</b> having an aperture for determining the NA.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0554">Beneath the condenser lens <b>4202</b> is disposed a first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> having a plurality of apertures, thereby to form a plurality of primary electron beams. Each of those primary electron beams formed by the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> is contracted by a demagnifying lens <b>4205</b> to be projected onto the deflection principal plane <b>4215</b> of an E×B separator <b>4206</b>, and after having been focused once on the point <b>4125</b>, the primary electron beams are further focused onto a sample <b>4208</b> by an objective lens <b>4207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0555">In order not to produce an image field curvature aberration possibly caused by the minifying lens <b>4205</b> and the objective lens <b>4207</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> has a stepped contour such that the smaller distance to the condenser lens <b>4202</b> at the central portion thereof is getting greater as toward the peripheral portion.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0556">Secondary electrons emanated from said plurality of points on the sample <b>4208</b> to which the plurality of focused primary electrons is irradiated are attracted by an electric field of the objective lens <b>4207</b> to be converged narrower, and then focused on a point <b>4216</b> before the E×B separator <b>4206</b>, that is, the point <b>4216</b> in the side closer to the sample with respect to the deflection principal plane of the E×B separator <b>4206</b>. This is because each of the primary electron beams has the energy of 500 eV on the surface of the sample, while the secondary electron beam only has the energy of a few eV. The plurality of secondary electron beams emanated from the sample <b>4208</b> is deflected by the E×B separator <b>4206</b> to the outside of the axis extending from the electron gun <b>4201</b> to the sample <b>4208</b> to be separated from the primary electron beams and enters into a secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0557">The secondary optical system has magnifying lenses <b>4209</b> and <b>4210</b>, and the secondary electron beam passed through those magnifying lenses <b>4209</b> and <b>4210</b> further passes through a plurality of apertures in a second multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b> to be imaged on a plurality of detectors <b>4212</b>. It is to be noted that the plurality of apertures formed through the second multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b> disposed in front of the detectors <b>4212</b> corresponds to the plurality of apertures formed through the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> on one to one basis.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0558">Each of the detectors <b>4212</b> converts the detected secondary electron beam into an electric signal representative of its intensity. The electric signals thus output from respective detectors are, after having been amplified respectively by an amplifier <b>4213</b>, received by an image processing section <b>4214</b> and converted into image data. Said image data is utilized for the evaluation of a defect or line width of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0559">That is, since the image processing section <b>4214</b> is further supplied with a scanning signal for deflecting the primary electron beam, the image processing section <b>4214</b> can display an image representing the surface of the sample <b>4208</b>. Comparing this image with the reference image allows any defects in the sample <b>4208</b> to be detected, and further, the line width of the pattern on the sample <b>4208</b> can be measured in such a way that the sample <b>4208</b> is moved by a registration to the proximity of an optical axis of the primary optical system and then line-scanned to extract the line width evaluation signal, which is in turn appropriately calibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="0560">In this regard, it is required to make special arrangements when the primary electrons passed through the apertures of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> is focused onto the surface of the sample <b>4208</b>, and then the secondary electrons emanated from the sample <b>4208</b> are formed into an image on the detector <b>4212</b>, in order to minimize the affection by the three aberrations, i.e., the distortion caused by the primary optical systems, the image field curvature, and the field astigmatism. Then the means employed in the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention in order to solve the above problem associated with the aberrations will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 to 41</figref>. It is to be noted that in those illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 to 41</figref>, the primary and secondary multi-aperture plates <b>4203</b> and <b>4211</b> have been illustrated with the size of the apertures, shapes and amounts of offset thereof being rather exaggerated for better understanding, which are all different from the actual ones.</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0561"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> shows a first embodiment of a first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> used in an electron beam apparatus according to the present invention, and the multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> of this embodiment is used when there is a distortion aberration of pin-cushion type appeared on a sample surface, and in order to compensate for the pin-cushion type distortion aberration, the first multi-aperture plate is provided with a plurality of apertures being displaced into a barrel shape. That is, each of the apertures <b>4221</b> to <b>4224</b> is formed at each of four corners of a square <b>4220</b> centered with the center X of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b>, i.e., the intersection point where the line extending from the electron gun <b>4201</b> to the sample <b>4208</b> is crossed with the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0562">The longitudinal and lateral solid lines illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> are virtually drawn so as to be parallel with respective sides of said square, and the aperture should be located at each of those intersection points when a plurality of apertures is distributed evenly over the multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b>. In practice, in order to minimize the distortion aberration in the primary optical system, each of the apertures will be designed to be located offset from the intersection point of the solid lines toward the center of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> by a certain amount depending on the distance from the center of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0563"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows an embodiment of a second multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b> used in the electron beam apparatus according to the present invention, and this multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b> is used to minimize the affection by the potential distortion of pin-cushion type that might be caused from the distortion existing in the secondary optical system. Also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, each of the apertures of the second multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b> is offset outwardly from the ideal location in case of uniform distribution thereof, by a certain amount depending on the distance from the center Y.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0564">The amount of this offset has been calculated from the simulation for the system comprising the objective lens <b>4207</b>, the magnifying lenses <b>4209</b> and <b>4210</b>, and the E×B separator <b>4206</b>. Since the outermost aperture never causes a cross talk even if it is made too large, it may be formed to be large enough. In addition, although each of the multi-aperture plates <b>4203</b> and <b>4211</b> respectively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 and 40</figref> is illustrated as an embodiment of a single plate which comprises a plurality of apertures formed therethrough, a plurality of multi-aperture plates, i.e., two or more pieces of plates may be employed in the viewpoint of designing the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0565">Concerning to the image field curvature, the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> may be made into a shape of stepped contours in sectional view so as to compensate for the field curvature caused by the primary optical system, as described above. The field curvature may possibly be caused even by the secondary optical system, but because of the larger size of the aperture of the second multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b> disposed in front of the detectors <b>4212</b>, the field curvature by the secondary optical system could be actually ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0566">The aberration of field astigmatism occurs because the refractive index of the lens in the radial direction is different from that in the circumferential direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A and 41B</figref> show respectively a second embodiment of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> used in the electron beam apparatus according to the present invention in order to correct this aberration of field astigmatism, and in the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref>, each of the apertures are elongated in the radial direction with respect to the center of the first multi-aperture plate <b>2403</b> by a certain amount depending on the distance from said center. Alternatively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref>, each of the apertures is designed to have a specified shape so that its size in the radial direction and that in the circumferential direction with respect to the vertical circle centered with the center of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b> vary depending on the distance from the center.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0567">Reference numeral <b>4217</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> designates a blanking deflector, and applying a pulse of narrow width to said blanking deflector <b>4217</b> may form an electron beam having a narrow pulse width. Using thus formed pulse with narrow width allows the potential of the pattern formed in the sample <b>4208</b> to be measured with high time-resolution, and this implies that the electron beam apparatus may be added with another function of, what is called, a strobe SEM (scanning electron microscope).</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0568">On the other hand, reference numeral <b>4218</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> designates an axis-symmetrical electrode, and applying to said axis-symmetrical electrode <b>4218</b> a certain level of potential lower by some 10V than that of the sample <b>4208</b> may drive the secondary electrons emanated from the sample <b>4208</b> to flow toward the objective lens <b>4207</b> or to return toward the sample, depending on the potential pertaining to the pattern of the sample <b>4208</b>. Thereby, the potential contrast on the sample <b>4208</b> may be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="0569">The electron beam apparatus <b>4200</b> according to the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 to 40</figref> is applicable to a defect inspection apparatus, a line width measuring apparatus, an alignment accuracy measuring apparatus, a potential contrast measuring apparatus, a defect review apparatus, and a strobe SEM apparatus. Further, the electron beam apparatus according to the present invention may be used to evaluate the wafer in the course of processing. Then, the evaluation of the wafer in the course of processing will be described. The manufacturing process of the semiconductor device has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0571" num="0570">The lithography process, which is a core process in the wafer processing process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, comprises the resist coating process for coating with a resist the surface of the wafer having a circuit pattern formed therein in the previous process, the exposing process for exposing the resist, the developing process for developing the exposed resist to obtain the pattern of resist, and the annealing process for stabilizing the developed pattern of the resist.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="0571">The electron beam apparatus <b>4200</b> of the fourteenth embodiment according to the present invention may be further used in the wafer inspection process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for inspecting the processed wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0573" num="0572">The present invention is not limited to those embodiments. For example, in order to accomplish synchronous irradiation against different locations on the sample <b>4201</b>, the apparatus may includes a plurality of electron beam irradiation and detection systems each comprising the electron gun <b>4201</b>, the first multi-aperture plate <b>4203</b>, the primary and the secondary optical systems, the second multi-aperture plate <b>4211</b>, and the detector <b>4212</b>, so that a plurality of primary electron beams emitted from a plurality of electron guns may be irradiated against the sample and a plurality of secondary electron beams emanated from the sample may be received by a plurality of detectors. Thereby, the time necessary for the inspection or measurement could be significantly shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0574" num="0573">As will be understood from the above description, the electron beam apparatus of the fourteenth embodiment according to the present invention may provide the particular effects as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0575" num="0574">1. Since the apparatus can compensate for the distortion aberration by the primary optical system and reduce the field astigmatism as well, therefore extended region may be irradiated with a plurality of beams thus to carry out the defect inspection or the like of the sample with higher throughput;</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="0575">2. Since the apparatus can compensate for the distortion by the secondary optical system, as well, therefore there would be no cross talk even when a plurality of electron beams is used with narrow pitch therebetween for irradiating and scanning the sample, and further, since it can increase the transmittance of the secondary electrons thus to allow the signal having higher S/N ratio to be obtainable, a highly reliable line width measurement or the like may be provided; and</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0576">3. Since the primary optical system can form an image on the deflection principal plane of the E×B separator <b>4206</b>, the chromatic aberration of the primary electron beam may be reduced, and when the primary electron beam is formed into a multi-beam, the multi-beam may be converged narrower.</p>
<p id="p-0578" num="0577">An electron beam apparatus <b>4300</b> of a fifteenth embodiment according to the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> schematically shows an electron beam apparatus <b>4301</b> of the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0587" num="0586">The secondary electrons emanated from the sample surface SF are accelerated and converged by an accelerating electric field for the secondary electron applied between the electrostatic objective lens <b>4321</b> and the sample surface SF, pass through the electrostatic objective lens <b>4321</b>, and then image the crossover just at a front side of the deflection principal plane FP<b>2</b> of the second E×B separator <b>4320</b>. This imaged secondary electron is deflected by the second separator <b>4320</b> to move along the optical axis B and to enter the electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4331</b>.

<p id="p-0589" num="0588">A space between each of said plurality of electron beams and the electron beam adjacent thereto can be scanned by controlling the electron beam so as to cause a deflecting scanning motion exhibiting a principal beam trajectory shown by symbol E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, using the electrostatic deflector <b>4319</b> and the second E×B separator <b>4320</b>. To cause the deflecting scanning motion by the second E×B separator, such a voltage waveform may be applied thereto that satisfies a Wien filter requirements of the second E×B separator <b>4320</b> and is formed by superimposing the scanning voltage onto the dc voltage Vw as a center voltage, wherein the voltage to allow the electron beam to advance forward is defined as Vw and a magnetic field as Bw, and thereby the two-dimensional scanning could be performed when an eight poles type electrostatic deflector is employed as the electrodes used to generate the electric field of the second E×B separator <b>4320</b>. Therefore it is unnecessary to install a new deflector on an upper side of the electrostatic object lens <b>4321</b>, and in addition, both of the E×B separator and the electrostatic deflector can be disposed at their optimum positions respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0590" num="0589">Then, a problem of so-called a beam blur due to a chromatic aberration which is possibly caused by using a single E×B separator in the prior art, and the solution thereof will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0591" num="0590">Generally, in the electron beam apparatus using the E×B separator, the degree of aberration is the lowest when the position of an image of the aperture coincides with the deflection principal plane of the E×B separator for the electron beam. Furthermore, the deflection principal plane of the E×B separator and the sample surface are in a conjugate relationship. Accordingly, when an electron beam with a certain energy width enters into the E×B separator, the quantity of deflection of the electron beam with low energy caused by an electric field increases inversely proportional to the energy, but the quantity of deflection caused by the magnetic field increases inversely proportional only to the ½th power of the energy.</p>
<p id="p-0592" num="0591">On the other hand, in case of the electron beam with high energy, a quantity of deflection of the electron beam along the direction caused by the magnetic field is more than that along the direction caused by the electric field. In this case, if the electrostatic lens is disposed under the E×B separator and said lens had no aberration, there would occur no beam blur, but actually the beam blur occurs because the lens has its aberration. Therefore, with only a single E×B separator being used, it is impossible to avoid causing the beam blur due to the chromatic aberration when the electron beam has a certain energy width.</p>
<p id="p-0593" num="0592">The present invention comprises both of the first and the second E×B separators <b>4317</b> and <b>4320</b>, and coordinates the electric fields of said two E×B separators so that the directions of the deflection caused by the electric fields of the first E×B separator <b>4317</b> and second E×B separator <b>4320</b> would be reversed each other on the sample surface, and their absolute values of the magnitude of deflections would be equal. Accordingly, even when the electron beam has a certain energy width, the chromatic aberration due to the E×B separator can be compensated for between the first and the second E×B separators <b>4317</b> and <b>4320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0594" num="0593">When the electron beam apparatus <b>4301</b> configured as above is used to inspect the sample surface for defects, to measure the line width of the pattern formed on the sample surface and so on, a sample to be inspected is to be set therein and the electron beam apparatus <b>4301</b> is to be operated as described above. In this case, the inspection for defects can be performed by producing an image data with a scan signal waveform provided for the electrostatic deflector <b>4319</b> and the second E×B separator <b>4320</b> and also with an output signal from the detector <b>4341</b> for the secondary electron, and by comparing said image data with the other image data produced from another pattern data. Also, the line widths of the pattern can be measured by the use of signal waveform of the secondary electron obtained by scanning the measured pattern at the right angle with the electrostatic deflector <b>4319</b> and the second E×B separator <b>4320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="0594">Furthermore, the alignment accuracy can be evaluated, by forming a pattern produced with a second layer of lithography in the vicinity of a pattern produced with a first layer of lithography so as for these two patterns to have the same distance therebetween as that of the electron beams in a plurality of electron beams of the electron beam apparatus <b>4301</b>, by measuring the distance between these two patterns, and finally by comparing the measured value with the design value.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0595">In addition, the image obtained by a scanning type electron microscope (SEM) can be displayed on the CRT monitor by connecting the CRT monitor to a part or all of the detector <b>4341</b> for the secondary electrons and by inputting the data therefrom together with the scanning signal waveform. This makes it possible for the checker to watch this SEM image to observe defects for determining the types thereof and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0597" num="0596">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, since the electrostatic deflector <b>4322</b> is disposed co-axially between the electrostatic objective lens <b>4321</b> and the sample surface SF, a potential contrast can be measured by applying negative voltage to this electrostatic deflector <b>4322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0597">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the short pulse electron beam can be obtained by providing the electrostatic deflector <b>4314</b> with the voltage so as not to deflect the electron beam only for a short period and to deflect the electron beam for the rest period in order to make a blanking of the electron beam so that the deflected electron beam is removed by the aperture <b>4315</b>. When this short pulse electron beam is entered onto the sample surface SF, so the device on the sample surface is made to be in an operating state, then the potential of the pattern is measured with good time-resolution, the operation analysis of the device on the sample surface can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0599" num="0598"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a plan view illustrating a condition where a plurality of pairs of the primary and the secondary optical systems in the electron beam apparatus configured as described above is arranged on the sample S, in which six pairs of the primary and the secondary optical systems <b>4310</b> and <b>4330</b> are arranged in an array of 2 rows×3 columns in this embodiment. The circles <b>4310</b><i>a </i>to <b>4310</b><i>f </i>shown with solid line represent the maximum outer diameter of the primary optical systems, while the circles <b>4330</b><i>a </i>to <b>4330</b><i>f </i>shown with chain line represent the maximum outer diameter of the secondary optical systems respectively. In the present embodiment, the apertures of the multi-aperture plate <b>4313</b> in the primary optical system <b>4310</b> are arranged in an array of 3 rows×3 columns, and similarly the apertures of the multi-aperture plate <b>4332</b> in the secondary optical system <b>4330</b> are arranged also in an array of 3 rows×3 columns.</p>
<p id="p-0600" num="0599">A plurality of pairs of respective optical systems is disposed such that the optical axis B of each secondary optical system <b>4330</b> heads toward the outside of the sample along the alignment direction of the column in order not to interfere with each other. The number of the column is preferably three or four, but it may be less than these values, for example, two, or may be four or more.</p>
<p id="p-0601" num="0600">The electron beam apparatus <b>4300</b> of the fifteenth embodiment according to the present invention also can be used in the wafer inspection process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for inspecting the processed wafers. When the defect inspection method and apparatus of the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention is used in the inspection process, even a semiconductor device having a fine pattern can be inspected with higher throughput, so that a hundred percent inspection may be carried out while allowing the yield of the products to be improved and preventing any faulty products from being delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="0601">According to the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention, the following effects may be expected to obtain.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0602">(1) Since a plurality of electron beams is employed, the throughput can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0603">(2) Since a plurality of E×B separators is employed and arranged such that the positions of the image of the apertures in the aperture plate coincide with respective positions of the E×B separators and the directions of the electron beams deflected by the electric fields of respective E×B separators are reversed each other on the sample surface, the chromatic aberration possibly caused by the E×B separators can be compensated for and the electron beam can be converged narrower, so that higher inspection accuracy can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0604">(3) Since the electron beam is controlled to make a scanning motion by superimposing the scanning voltage on the electric field of the second E×B separator, the second E×B separator is allowed to work also as an electrostatic deflector, which means that there is no necessity to install a new electrostatic deflector above the electrostatic objective lens <b>4321</b> and both of the E×B separator and the electrostatic deflector can be disposed in their optimum positions respectively. This makes it possible both to improve the inspection efficiency for the secondary electron and to reduce the deflection aberration, and further to greatly shorten the paths of the secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0605">(4) Since a plurality of pairs of the primary and the secondary optical systems in the electron beam apparatus is arranged on the sample, a plurality of samples can be inspected at one time, and thereby the throughput can be improved more.</p>
<p id="p-0607" num="0606">(5) since the electrostatic deflector <b>4322</b> is disposed co-axially between the electrostatic objective lens <b>4321</b> and the sample surface SF, a potential contrast can be measured by applying negative voltage to this electrostatic deflector <b>4332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0608" num="0607">(6) When a function for blanking the electron beam is provided to control the voltage of the electrostatic deflector <b>4314</b>, to generate a short pulse electron beam, to make the device on the sample surface in an operating state, and to measure the potential of the pattern with good time-resolution, thereby the operation analysis of the device on the sample surface can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0609" num="0608"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an electron beam apparatus <b>4400</b> according to a sixteenth embodiment of the present invention, wherein an electron beam emitted from an electron gun <b>4401</b> is focused by a condenser lens <b>4402</b> to form a cross-over at a point <b>4404</b>. A first multi-aperture plate <b>4403</b> having a plurality of small apertures is disposed beneath the condenser lens <b>4402</b>, and thereby a plurality of primary electron beams is formed. Each of the plurality of primary electron beams formed by the first multi-aperture plate <b>4403</b> is contracted by a demagnification lens <b>4405</b> to be projected onto a point <b>4415</b>. After having been focused onto the point <b>4415</b>, the primary electron beam is focused by an objective lens <b>4407</b> onto a sample <b>4408</b>. The plurality of primary electron beams emitted through the first multi-aperture plate <b>4403</b> is deflected by a deflector <b>4419</b> disposed between the demagnification lens <b>4405</b> and the objective lens <b>4407</b> so as to simultaneously scan a surface of the sample <b>4408</b> loaded on an x-y stage <b>4420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0609">In order to eliminate an effect of field curvature aberration possibly caused by the reduction lens <b>4405</b> and the objective lens <b>4407</b>, the first multi-aperture plate <b>4403</b> is provided with a plurality of small apertures <b>4433</b> disposed therein along a circle such that projected points thereof onto x-axis may be equally spaced by Lx, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0610">A plurality of spots on the sample <b>4408</b> is irradiated by the plurality of focused primary electron beams, and secondary electron beams emanated from the plurality of irradiated spots are attracted by an electric field of the objective lens <b>4407</b> to be focused narrower, deflected by an E×B separator <b>4406</b>, and then introduced into a secondary optical system. A secondary electron image is focused on a point <b>4416</b> which is closer to the objective lens <b>4407</b> than the point <b>4415</b>. This is because the secondary electron beam has only a few eV of energy while each of the primary electron beams has 500 eV of energy on the sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0611">The secondary optical system includes magnifying lenses <b>4409</b> and <b>4410</b>, and the secondary electron beam, after having passed through these magnifying lenses, passes through a plurality of apertures <b>4443</b> formed on a second multi-aperture plate <b>4411</b>, and is focused on a plurality of electron detectors <b>4412</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>, each of the plurality of apertures <b>4443</b> formed on the second multi-aperture plate <b>4411</b> disposed in front of the detectors <b>4412</b> corresponds to each of the plurality of apertures <b>4433</b> formed on the first multi-aperture plate <b>4403</b> in a manner of one-by-one basis. Each of the plurality of detectors <b>4412</b> is disposed so as to face to each of the plurality of apertures of the second multi-aperture plate <b>4411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0612">The detector <b>4412</b> converts a detected secondary electron beam into an electric signal representative of intensity thereof. The electric signal output from each of the detectors <b>4412</b>, after having been amplified respectively by an amplifier <b>4413</b>, is converted into an image data by an image processing section <b>4414</b>. Since the image processing section <b>4414</b> is further supplied with a scanning signal SS for deflecting the primary electron beam, the image processing section <b>4414</b> can generate an image representative of the surface of the sample <b>4408</b>. Comparing this image with a reference pattern allows any defects of the sample <b>4408</b> to be detected. Although being separated during process, a build-up width detecting section <b>4430</b> operates in a stage for determining an excitation voltage for initial focusing. The operation thereof will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0614" num="0613">Further, a line width of a pattern on the sample <b>4408</b> can be measured in such a way that the pattern to be measured of the sample <b>4408</b> is moved by a registration to a proximity of an optical axis of the primary optical system, and the pattern is line-scanned to extract a line width evaluation signal, which is in turn appropriately calibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0615" num="0614">In this regard, when the primary electron beams passed through the apertures <b>4433</b> of the first multi-aperture plate <b>4403</b> are focused on the surface of the sample <b>4408</b>, and the secondary electron beams emanated from the sample <b>4408</b> are formed into an image on the detectors <b>4412</b>, much attention should be paid in order to minimize the affection by the three aberrations, i.e., a distortion caused by the primary optical system, an on-axis chromatic aberration and an astigmatism in the field of view. As for a relation between the spacing among the plurality of primary electron beams and the secondary optical system, if the space between respective primary electron beams is determined to be greater than the aberration of the secondary optical system, then the crosstalk among a plurality of beams can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0615">The objective lens <b>4407</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44C</figref>, a uni-potential lens, wherein a positive high voltage V<sub>0 </sub>volt is applied to a center electrode of the objective lens <b>4407</b> from a power supply <b>4428</b> and an excitation voltage ±ΔV<sub>0</sub>, which is low voltage near to earth potential, is applied to an upper and an under electrodes of the objective lens <b>4407</b> from a power supply <b>4429</b> in order to focus the primary electron beam onto the surface of the sample <b>4408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0616">Each of the electron gun <b>4401</b>, the deflector <b>4417</b> for aligning the axes, the first aperture plate <b>4403</b>, the condenser lens <b>4402</b>, the deflector <b>4419</b>, the Wien filter or the E×B separator <b>4406</b>, the objective lens <b>4407</b>, an axisymmetric electrode <b>4423</b>, and the secondary electron detector <b>4412</b> is accommodated in an optical column <b>4426</b> of appropriate size to configure a complete electron beam scanning/detecting system. It is to be noted that the initial focusing of the electron beam scanning/detecting system may be executed by fixing the excitation voltage ΔV<sub>0 </sub>to be −10 Volts while varying the positive voltage V<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0617">AS described above, the electron beam scanning/detecting system in the optical column <b>4426</b> scans a chip pattern on the sample, detects the secondary electron beam emanated from the sample as a result of scanning, and outputs the electric signal representative of the intensity thereof. In practice, since a plurality of chip patterns is formed on the sample surface, a plurality of electron beam scanning/detecting systems (though not shown) each having the same configuration as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref> is arranged in parallel so as for the respective systems to be spaced by integer times of a chip size on the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0618">To further describe the electron beam scanning/detecting system, the electric signal output from the electron detector <b>4412</b> is converted in the image processing section <b>4414</b> into a binary information, which is then converted into the image data. As a result, the image data of a circuit pattern formed on the sample surface is obtained, and the obtained image data is stored in an appropriate storage means and compared with a reference circuit pattern. Thereby the defect of the pattern formed on the sample or the like can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0619">As the reference circuit pattern used to be compared with the image data representative of the circuit pattern on the sample surface, various kinds of data may be employed.

<p id="p-0621" num="0620">In the electron beam apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref>, a value of the excitation voltage ±ΔV<sub>0 </sub>to be applied to the upper or the under electrode of the objective lens <b>4407</b> is determined under control of a control device such as CPU (though not shown) as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0621">At first, a location where a pattern edge parallel with a first direction and another pattern edge parallel with a second direction orthogonal to said first direction exist on a single arbitrary circuit pattern formed on the surface of the sample <b>4408</b> is read out, for example, from the pattern data and is identified.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0622">Then, the primary electron beam is used by the deflector <b>4419</b> and the E×B separator <b>4406</b> to scan the pattern edge parallel with the first direction in the second direction; the electric signal representative of the intensity of the secondary electron beam emanated as a result of the scanning operation is obtained from the electron detector <b>4412</b>; and then a build-up width p(μm) of said electric signal is measured in the build-up width detection section <b>4430</b>. Similarly, the primary electron beam is used by the deflector <b>4419</b> and the E×B separator <b>4406</b> to scan the pattern edge parallel with the second direction in the first direction; the electric signal representative of the intensity of the secondary electron beam emanated as a result of the scanning operation is obtained from the electron detector <b>4412</b>; and then the build-up width p of said electric signal is measured in the build-up width detection section <b>4430</b>.

<p id="p-0628" num="0627">It is to be apprehended that there is no need to make a measurement for a number of ±ΔV<sub>0 </sub>values, but only −ΔV(<b>1</b>), +ΔV(<b>1</b>) and +ΔV(<b>3</b>) should be set as the three voltage values of ±ΔV<sub>0 </sub>to measure the build-up width p so as to determine the curves A and B by hyperbolic approximation, and thereby to determine the minimum values of the build-up width, i.e., −ΔV<sub>0</sub>(x) and +ΔV<sub>0</sub>(y).

<p id="p-0633" num="0632">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45A</figref> by the curves A and B, the build-up width obtained when the pattern edge extending along the first direction is scanned in the second direction is typically different from that obtained when the pattern edge extending along the second direction is scanned in the first direction. In this case, it is necessary to perform an astigmatic correction by further installing an eight-pole astigmatic correcting lens <b>4421</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>) and adjusting the voltage to be applied to said lens <b>4421</b> so that the build-up of the electric signal from the electron detector <b>4415</b> generated by scanning the pattern edges in the first and the second directions may be made further smaller. When there are little astigmatism, since either of ΔV<sub>0</sub>(x) or ΔV<sub>0</sub>(y) is required to be determined, only either of curve A or B may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0634" num="0633">As described above, after the focusing operation of the electron beam scanning/detecting system having been finished, the process for evaluating the sample <b>4408</b> will be set about. In the present method, since the focusing condition is determined by using not an optical Z sensor but the electronic optical system, it is advantageous in that the correct focusing condition may be determined even if the sample is charged with electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="0634">When other optical column (not shown) each having the similar configuration to that of the optical column <b>4426</b> including the electron beam scanning/detecting system are arranged parallel with the optical column <b>4426</b> so as for each of them to be spaced from each other by a distance of integer times of the chip size on the sample <b>4408</b>, it is necessary to perform the focusing operation in each optical column so as for the primary electron beam to be focused on the sample. Such a focusing operation, however, can be performed almost simultaneously, so the throughput budget does not take much.</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0635">Then a semiconductor device manufacturing method according to the present invention will now be described. The semiconductor device manufacturing method according to the present invention is performed by using the electron beam apparatus described above in the semiconductor device manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0636">In the semiconductor device manufacturing method according to the present invention, any defects on the wafer can be surely detected since an image with reduced distortion and blur may be obtained even for the semiconductor device with finer pattern by using the electron beam apparatus having described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> not only in a process in the course of processing (wafer inspection process) but also in a chip inspection process for inspecting the finished chip.</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0637">Using the electron beam apparatus according to the present invention in the wafer inspection process and the chip inspection process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> allows even the semiconductor device with finer pattern to be inspected with high throughput, which allows a hundred percent inspection and an improvement in yield of the products, and also allows to prevent the defective product from being delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0638">The electron beam apparatus <b>4400</b> according to the sixteenth embodiment of the present invention provides such operational effects as below:</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0639">(1) Since no optical sensor is necessary for measuring a height of the sample surface, spacing between the objective lens and the sample can be designed under optimum conditions with only electronic optical system;</p>
<p id="p-0641" num="0640">(2) Since the focusing operation of the electron beam scanning/detecting system can be performed only with the adjustment in low voltage, the setting time may be made shorter, that is, the focusing operation can be performed in short time;</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0641">(3) If desired, the astigmatic correction may be performed in short time during focusing operation; and</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0642">(4) Since the sample in the course of process can be evaluated in short time, the yield of the device manufacturing may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0643">Now, a description will be given regarding an electron beam apparatus <b>4500</b> of Embodiment 18 with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> schematically illustrates an electron beam apparatus <b>4501</b> of Embodiment 18. The electron beam apparatus <b>4501</b> comprises a primary optical system <b>4510</b>, a secondary optical system <b>4530</b>, and a detection device <b>4540</b>. The primary optical system <b>4510</b> is composed of an optical system for irradiating the surface of a sample S with an electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0644">This optical system comprises an electron gun <b>4511</b> for emitting electron beams, an electrostatic lens <b>4513</b> for demagnifying the electron beams emitted from the electron gun, a first aperture plate <b>4514</b> with a plurality of small apertures formed in a two-dimensional arrangement (only small apertures <b>4514</b><i>a </i>to <b>4514</b><i>i</i>, inclusive, being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>), an open aperture <b>4515</b>, an electrostatic lens <b>4516</b> for demagnifying the electron beams passed through the first aperture plate, an electrostatic deflector <b>4517</b>, an E×B separator <b>4518</b>, and an electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, these components are arranged in such a manner that the electron gun <b>4511</b> is disposed on top of all the other components in the order as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> and that the optical axis A of the electron beams emitted from the electron gun is disposed so as to extend in the direction perpendicularly to the sample S. Inside the electron gun <b>4511</b>, there is formed a projection portion <b>4512</b> that is made of a single crystal, LaB<sub>6 </sub>cathode, polished into a form having a number of projections.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="0645">The first aperture plate <b>4514</b> is provided with a plurality of the small apertures on its circumference, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, so as for the images projected in the X-direction to be disposed at an equal interval Lx, in order to undergo no influence of an aberration caused by a curvature of the image plane of the electrostatic lenses <b>4513</b> and <b>4516</b> as well as the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="0646">The secondary optical system <b>4530</b> includes a first electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4531</b>, an open aperture <b>4532</b>, a second electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4533</b>, and a second aperture plate <b>4534</b> with a plurality of small apertures (only small apertures <b>4534</b><i>a</i>-<b>4534</b><i>i</i>, inclusive, being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>) disposed in a two-dimensional arrangement. These components are arranged in the above order along the optical axis B inclined with respect to the optical axis A in the vicinity of the E×B separator <b>4518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="0647">The detection device <b>4540</b> is provided with a detector <b>4541</b> for each aperture of the second aperture plate <b>4534</b>. The number and arrangement of the small apertures (as indicated by broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>), e.g., <b>4534</b><i>a </i>to <b>4534</b><i>e</i>, of the second aperture plate <b>4534</b> are adjusted so as to agree with the number and arrangement of the small apertures (as indicated by solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>), e.g., <b>4514</b><i>a </i>to <b>4514</b><i>e</i>, of the first aperture plate <b>4514</b>. Each of the structuring elements may be known and its detailed description will be omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0648">Then, a description will be given regarding a standard mode in the electron beam apparatus <b>4500</b> having the configuration as described above. In this electron beam apparatus, electron beams C emitted from the number of the projection portions <b>4512</b> of the single electron gun <b>4511</b> are converged with the electrostatic lens <b>4513</b> and then irradiated on the first aperture plate <b>4514</b>. The electron beams C are formed into multi-beams by allowing the electron beams C to pass through the small apertures (e.g., <b>4514</b><i>a </i>to <b>4514</b><i>e</i>) formed in the first aperture plate <b>4514</b>. The multi-beams form each a crossover image C<b>1</b> by means of the open aperture <b>4515</b>. The crossover multi-beams travel toward the sample S and converged with the electrostatic intermediate lens <b>4516</b> disposed on the way, followed by forming an image on the main plane of the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b> so as to meet with Keller's illumination conditions. The multi-beams with the image formed then produce a reduced image on the sample and the surface of the sample is then scanned with the electrostatic deflector and a deflector of the E×B separator <b>4518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0649">The secondary electron beams emitted from the sample S are accelerated and converged by the accelerating electric field for the secondary electrons, applied between the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b> and the sample S, followed by passing through the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b> and entering into the first electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4531</b> after being deflected with the E×B separator <b>4518</b> so as to travel along the optical axis B. The secondary electron beams are then magnified with the first electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4531</b> and form a crossover image C<b>2</b> on the open aperture <b>4532</b>. The secondary electron beams that formed the image are then magnified with the electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4533</b> and form an image at each of the small apertures (e.g., <b>4534</b><i>a </i>to <b>4534</b><i>e</i>) of the second aperture plate <b>4534</b>. The magnification factor of the secondary optical system can be decided by the two electrostatic magnifying lenses <b>4531</b> and <b>4533</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0650">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the secondary electron beams emitted at the surface of the sample by means of the electron beams scanning are delivered to the detector <b>4541</b> after passage through each of the small apertures of the second aperture plate <b>4534</b> corresponding to the respective small apertures of the first aperture plate <b>4514</b>. More specifically, for example, the secondary electron beams emitted from the sample S by means of the electron beams passed through the small aperture <b>4514</b><i>a </i>of the first aperture plate <b>4514</b> is delivered to the detector <b>4541</b> through the corresponding small aperture <b>4534</b><i>a </i>of the second aperture plate <b>4534</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0651">Likewise, the secondary electron beams emitted from the sample S by means of the electron beams passed through the small aperture <b>4514</b><i>b </i>of the first aperture plate <b>4514</b> is then delivered on the detector <b>4541</b> through the corresponding small aperture <b>4534</b><i>b </i>of the second aperture plate <b>4534</b>. The electron beam emitted from the sample S by means of the electron beams passed through the small aperture <b>4514</b><i>c </i>of the first aperture plate <b>4514</b> is likewise delivered to the detector <b>4541</b> in substantially the same manner as the secondary electron beams emitted from the sample S by means of the electron beams passed through the corresponding small aperture <b>4514</b><i>a </i>or <b>4514</b><i>b </i>of the first aperture plate <b>4514</b>. The remaining secondary electron beams can be said true.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0652">In order to allow changes from the standard mode to the high resolution mode, it is required to alter a scanning width and a magnification of an image. The scanning width can be altered by adjusting a degree of sensitivity to deflection per bit of the electrostatic deflector <b>4517</b> and the deflector of the E×B separator <b>4518</b>. If the scanning width would become narrower than that of the standard mode, however, a gap of scanning may be caused to happen between each of the beams of the multi-beams. Further, in the secondary optical system, the intervals of the beam images result in disagreement with the intervals of the detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0653">The problem with the formation of the scanning gap between the beams can be solved by varying the rate of reduction from the first aperture plate <b>4514</b> to the sample S so as to correspond with a variation in a dimension of a pixel by subjecting the electrostatic lens <b>4516</b> and the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b> to zoom operation. The Keller's illumination conditions to form the crossover image C<b>1</b> on the principal plane of the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b> are adjusted so as to be satisfied in the standard mode only, but not in the high-resolution mode.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0654">As the measure against the problem that the interval of the beam images fails to agree with the dimension of the interval between the detectors in the secondary optical system, the principal ray of the secondary electrons emitted from each of the multiple beams from the sample is delivered to the corresponding small aperture of the secondary aperture plate by fixing the position and dimension of the aperture <b>4532</b> of the secondary optical system and varying an excitation voltage of the electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4533</b>. In other words, the magnification factor is adjusted by the electrostatic magnifying lens <b>4533</b> of the secondary optical system so as to comply with the conditions for focusing the crossover image on the aperture <b>4532</b>. Further, the sample can be evaluated on the basis of two kinds of dimensions of the image by subjecting the rate of reduction of the multi-beams to zoom operations of the electrostatic lens <b>4516</b> and the electrostatic objective lens <b>4519</b> as well as by altering the rate of magnification of the electrostatic magnifying lenses <b>4531</b> and <b>4533</b> of the secondary optical system in association with the zoom operations.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0655">As to the relation between a demagnification ratio of the multi-beam in the primary optical system and a magnification ratio in the electrostatic lens of the secondary optical system, in specific, assuming that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, a dimension between the apertures (for example, the distance between <b>4514</b><i>a </i>and <b>4514</b><i>b</i>) is 1 mm and the demagnification ratio of the multi-beam in the primary optical system is 1/100, the distance between the beam going out of the aperture <b>4514</b><i>a </i>and that out of the aperture <b>4514</b><i>b </i>is 10 μm. When the magnification ratio of the secondary optical system is <b>500</b>, the distance between the apertures <b>4534</b><i>a </i>and <b>4534</b><i>b </i>is 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0656">When the demagnification ratio of the multi-beam in the primary optical system is changed to be 1/200, the distance between the apertures <b>4534</b><i>a </i>and <b>4534</b><i>b </i>may be kept to be 5 mm by setting the magnification ratio of the secondary optical system to be 500×2=1000, and thereby the secondary electron can be detected without changing the distance between the apertures <b>4534</b><i>a </i>and <b>4534</b><i>b</i>. This feature is advantageous in that the beam dimensions, the beam current or the scanning width can be changed by varying the demagnification ratio of the multi-beam in the primary optical system. This allows to perform the evaluation with high resolution at the sacrifice of low throughput, or the evaluation with high throughput at the sacrifice of low resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0657">Further, the cross-over image is formed on the principal plane of the objective lens in a mode with high throughput and low resolution. In specific, for example, in the apparatus having a mode with the resolution of 50 nm and the throughput of 8.8 min/cm<sup>2 </sup>and another mode with the resolution of 100 nm and the throughput of 33 sec/cm<sup>2</sup>, the cross-over image is set on the principal plane of the objective lens in the former mode.</p>
<p id="p-0659" num="0658">The electron beam apparatus <b>4500</b> according to the seventeenth embodiment of the present invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>) may be preferably applied to the semiconductor device manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. That is, using the defect inspection method and apparatus according to the eighteenth embodiment of the present invention in the inspection process of the present manufacturing method allows even the semiconductor device with finer pattern to be inspected with high throughput, which allows a hundred percent inspection and an improvement in yield of the products, and also allows to prevent the defective product from being delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0660" num="0659">The electron beam apparatus <b>4500</b> of the embodiment 17 according to the present invention can demonstrate the effects as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0660">(1) As an image of an optional magnification can be formed without causing any scanning gap, both of the standard mode and the high-resolution mode can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0661">(2) Even if the rate of magnification would be changed, the image dimension can be adjusted so as to substantially correspond to the beam dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0663" num="0662">(3) In the standard mode, the Keller illumination conditions of the primary optical system can be met. On the other hand, even in the high-resolution mode, a deviation from the Keller's illumination conditions of the primary optical system can be rendered small and an increase in aberration is not caused so much.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0663">(4) As the aperture is disposed in the position in which the secondary electrons emitted from the sample in the direction perpendicular to the sample plane crosses the optical axis of the secondary optical system, the secondary electrons having no difference in strength between the multi-beams can be detected even if the mode would be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0665" num="0664">Then, a description will be given regarding the electron beam apparatus <b>5000</b> according to Embodiment 19 of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</figref>, which schematically illustrate an electron beam apparatus <b>5001</b> of Embodiment 19.

<p id="p-0666" num="0665">The primary optical system <b>5010</b> is an optical system that irradiates the surface of an object of evaluation (hereinafter referred to as “the sample”) S such as a wafer or the like with an electron beam, which comprises an electron gun <b>5011</b> for emitting electron beams, or electron beams, a condenser lens <b>5012</b> for converging the primary electron beams emitted from the electron gun <b>5011</b>, a first multi-aperture plate <b>5013</b> with a plurality of apertures formed therein, a reducing lens <b>5014</b>, an E×B separator <b>5015</b>, and an objective lens <b>5016</b>.

<p id="p-0667" num="0666">The secondary optical system <b>5020</b> comprises magnifying lenses <b>5021</b> and <b>5022</b> and a second multi-aperture plate <b>5023</b>, which are disposed along the optical axis inclined with respect to the optical axis of the primary optical system.

Moreover, the apertures <b>5131</b> of the first multi-aperture plate <b>5013</b> are formed so as to correspond to the apertures <b>5231</b> of the second multi-aperture plate <b>5023</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the apertures <b>5131</b> as indicated by solid line are illustrated to be smaller in size than the apertures <b>5231</b> as indicated by broken line.</p>

Further, the CPU <b>5063</b> is arranged to supply a signal to the applying device <b>5050</b> and the deflector <b>5017</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0670" num="0669">Then, a description will be given regarding the operations of the electron beam apparatus of embodiment 20. The primary electron beam emitted from the electron gun <b>5011</b> is converged with the condenser lens <b>5012</b> forming a crossover image at a point P<b>1</b>. The electron beam passed through the aperture <b>5131</b> of the first multi-aperture plate <b>5013</b> is converted into plural primary electron beams by means of the plural apertures <b>5131</b>. The primary electron beams formed by the first multi-aperture plate <b>5013</b> are reduced with the reducing lens <b>5014</b> and projected on a point P<b>2</b>. After focused on the point P<b>2</b>, the primary electron beams are then focused on the surface of the sample S with the objective lens <b>5016</b>. The plural primary electron beams are then deflected with the deflector <b>5018</b> disposed between the reducing lens <b>5014</b> and the objective lens <b>5016</b> so as to concurrently scan the top surface of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0671" num="0670">In order to eliminate the influences from the aberration caused by the field curvature of each of the reducing lens <b>5014</b> and the objective lens <b>5016</b>, the plural apertures <b>5131</b> and <b>5231</b> of the first and second multi-aperture plates <b>5013</b> and <b>5016</b> are disposed on the circumference around the optical axis of the optical system, respectively, and the distance Lx of each of the adjacent apertures is arranged so as to become equal to each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, when projected in the X-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0672" num="0671">The plural primary electron beams focused are irradiated on the points on the sample S, and the secondary electrons emitted from the points thereof are converged slenderly by the attraction of the electric field of the objective lens <b>5016</b> and then deflected with the E×B separator <b>5015</b>, followed by entering into the secondary optical system <b>5020</b>. The images of the secondary electrons are focused on a point P<b>3</b> closer to the objective lens than the point P<b>2</b>. This is because the secondary electron beam has only the energy of several eV, compared with each of the primary electron beams having an energy as high as 500 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0673" num="0672">The image of the secondary electron is allowed to form an image on the detector <b>5031</b> disposed for each of the apertures <b>5231</b> of the second multi-aperture plate <b>5023</b> by means of the magnifying lenses <b>5021</b> and <b>5022</b>. Therefore, the secondary electron image is detected with the respective detectors <b>5031</b>. Each of the detectors <b>5031</b> converts the secondary electron image detected into an electric signal representative of its intensity. The electric signal generated from each of the detectors is amplified with the corresponding amplifier <b>5032</b> and delivered to the image forming portion <b>5033</b> where the electric signal is converted into an image data. To the image forming portion <b>5033</b> is fed a scanning signal for deflecting the primary electron beams, and an image forming portion displays an image representing the plane of the sample S. This image is compared with the reference pattern to detect a defect of the sample S.</p>
<p id="p-0674" num="0673">Further, the sample S is transferred to the position close to the optical axis of the primary optical system <b>5010</b> by means of registration and the line scanning, or scanning, is performed on the surface of the sample to extract a signal for use in evaluating the line width of the pattern formed on the surface thereof. By calibrating the signals in an appropriate way, the line width of the pattern can be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0675" num="0674">It is to be noted herein that it is necessary to draw a special attention to minimize the influences caused by three aberrations including distortion caused by the primary optical system, axial chromatic aberration, and field astigmatism, when the primary electron beams passed through the apertures of the first multi-aperture plate <b>5013</b> are focused on the top surface of the sample S and the secondary electron beams emitted from the sample S are focused to form an image on the detector <b>5031</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0676" num="0675">Moreover, a crosstalk among the plural beams can be eliminated by bringing the distance between the primary electron beams to be irradiated on the sample into a relationship with the secondary optical system in such a manner that each the distances among the primary electron beams to be irradiated on the sample is apart by the distance larger than the aberration of the secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0677" num="0676">The image data converted with the image forming portion <b>5033</b> is displayed as an image with a display unit <b>5061</b> of the investigating and determining device <b>5060</b>. The image displayed can be evaluated by the operator <b>5062</b>. The operator <b>5062</b> constitutes a charging state investigating unit in this embodiment adapted to investigate a charging state on the basis of the image. The result of investigation is inputted into the CPU <b>5063</b> to set the retarding voltage to an optimal value. The CPU constitutes a retarding voltage determining unit in this embodiment.</p>

In other words, (1) distortion amounts <b>5103</b> and <b>5104</b> of a pattern of a memory cell boundary <b>5102</b> at the corner portion may be measured or (2) a contrast of the signal intensity obtained upon scanning the pattern at the corner portion of the memory cell in a way of crossing the pattern (as indicated by arrows A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>) may be compared with contrasts <b>5106</b> and <b>5108</b> (as indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50B</figref>) of the strength of the signals obtained by displaying solid lines <b>5105</b> and <b>5107</b>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50B</figref>, and scanning the pattern at the central portion of the chip in the directions as indicated by arrows A<b>3</b> and A<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0679">Voltage of plural values is applied to the retarding voltage applying device <b>5050</b> while measuring the distortion amounts <b>5103</b> and <b>5104</b> or the contrasts <b>5105</b>, <b>5107</b> and <b>5106</b>, <b>5108</b> whenever the voltage is applied, thereby conducting evaluations to the effect that the distortion amount <b>5103</b> or <b>504</b>, whichever smaller, has a smaller influence from the charging state. Likewise, it is evaluated that the contrast value <b>5105</b> or <b>5107</b> at the corner portion, whichever closer to the contrast value at the central portion, has a smaller influence of the charging state.</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="0680">If the retarding voltage having a good charging state could be found, the value is applied to the applying device <b>5050</b> through the CPU <b>5063</b> and the sample, i.e., the wafer, is evaluated on the basis of this value. Moreover, a beam current may be made small when using a sample that can reduce its charging state at a small beam current.</p>
<p id="p-0682" num="0681">Thus, an image-forming around the boundary where the pattern density on the sample greatly changes emphasizes an effect of charging, which facilitates an evaluation of charging, and makes it easy to find the landing voltage for hardly causing the charging.</p>
<p id="p-0683" num="0682">The electron beam apparatus <b>5000</b> of Embodiment 19 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>) of the present invention can be preferably used for the method for the manufacturing of the semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. When the defect inspection method and the defect inspection apparatus according to Embodiment 19 of the present invention are used for the inspection step of the manufacturing method, the semiconductor device having a fine pattern can also be inspected at a high throughput so that all the number of products can be inspected. Further, a yield of products can be improved and a shipment of defective products can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0684" num="0683">The Embodiment 19 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>) of the present invention can demonstrate the effects as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0685" num="0684">(a) A high throughput can be achieved at a value close to the multiple proportional to the number of electron beams, and the value of the throughput may be improved by several times.</p>
<p id="p-0686" num="0685">(b) An evaluation at a higher reliability can be achieved because the evaluation of the wafer can be performed in a state in which the charging state is smallest.</p>
<p id="p-0687" num="0686">(c) A more accurate result of evaluation can be obtained because the charging performance can be evaluated on the basis of an actual image, without measurements of various currents.</p>
<p id="p-0688" num="0687"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> shows an E×B separator <b>6020</b> of Embodiment 20 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The E×B separator <b>6020</b> comprises the electrostatic deflector and the electromagnetic deflector. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is a view in section, as taken along an x-y plane crossing the optical axis (the axis perpendicular to the plane of this drawing: z-axis) at a right angle. Further, the x-axial direction intersects with the y-axial direction at a right angle.</p>
<p id="p-0689" num="0688">The electrostatic deflector is provided with a pair of electrodes (electrostatically deflecting electrodes) <b>6001</b> in a vacuum container to create the electric field in the x-axial direction. The electrostatically deflecting electrodes <b>6001</b> are mounted on a vacuum wall <b>6003</b> of the vacuum container through an insulating spacer <b>6002</b>. The distance D between these electrodes is set to become smaller than the y-axial length 2 L of the electrostatically deflecting electrode <b>6001</b>. This setting can make the range of the uniform strength of the electric field formed around the z-axis relatively large. Ideally, the range where the strength of the electric field is uniform can be made larger if the distance D is smaller than L, i.e., D&lt;L.</p>
<p id="p-0690" num="0689">In other words, as the electric field strength is irregular in the range of D/2 from the edge of the electrode, the range where the electric field strength is nearly uniform is located in the range of 2 L−D at the central portion, excluding the irregular edge region. Therefore, in order to allow the range of the uniform electric field strength to exist, it is necessary to make 2 L larger than D, i.e., 2 L&gt;D. Moreover, by setting to be L&gt;D, the range of the uniform electric field strength can be rendered larger.</p>
<p id="p-0691" num="0690">Outside the vacuum wall <b>6003</b> is disposed the electromagnetically deflecting device for forming a magnetic field in the y-axial direction. The electromagnetically deflecting device is provided with electromagnetic coils <b>6004</b> and <b>6005</b>, which can form the magnetic field in the x-axial and y-axial directions, respectively. Although only the magnetic coil <b>6005</b> can create the y-axial magnetic field, the magnetic coil <b>6004</b> for forming the x-axial magnetic field may be additionally disposed in order to improve the orthogonality between the electric field and the magnetic field. In other words, the orthogonality between the electric field and the magnetic field can be made better by offsetting the magnetic field component in the +x-axial direction formed by the magnetic coil <b>6005</b> for the magnetic field component in the −x-axial direction formed by the magnetic coil <b>6004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0692" num="0691">As the magnetic coils <b>6004</b> and <b>6005</b> for forming the magnetic fields are mounted outside the vacuum container, each of them may be divided into two sections which may be mounted on the vacuum wall <b>6003</b> from the both sides and integrally fastened at portions <b>6007</b> with screws or other fastening tools.</p>
<p id="p-0693" num="0692">The outermost layer <b>6006</b> of the E×B separator may be composed of a permalloy or ferrite yoke.

<p id="p-0694" num="0693"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> shows a section of an E×B separator of Embodiment 21 according to the present invention, the section extending in the direction orthogonal to the optical axis (z-axis) thereof. The E×B separator of Embodiment 21 differs from that of Embodiment 20, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, that six electrostatically deflecting electrodes <b>6001</b> are disposed. To the electrostatically deflecting electrodes <b>6001</b> are fed voltage, k×θi (where k is constant and θi is an optional angle) proportional to cos θi, when the angle of the line connecting the center of each of the electrodes and the optical axis (z-axis) with respect to the direction of the electric field (x-axial direction) is set to θi (where i=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).</p>
<p id="p-0695" num="0694">In Embodiment 21 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, too, the electric field can be formed in the x-axial direction only, so that the coils <b>6004</b> and <b>6005</b> for forming the magnetic fields in the respective x-axial and y-axial directions are disposed to correct the orthogonality.</p>
<p id="p-0696" num="0695">Embodiment 21 can make the range of the uniform electric field strength larger than Embodiment 20 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0697" num="0696">In Embodiments 20 and 21 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51 and 52</figref>, respectively, a coil of a saddle type may be used for forming the magnetic field. It is also possible to use a coil of a toroidal type as a coil for forming the magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0698" num="0697"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref> is a schematic view of an electron apparatus <b>6000</b> (a defect inspection apparatus) for which the E×B separator of Embodiments 20 and 21 can be adopted to separate the secondary electron beams from the primary electron beams. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>, the electron beams emitted from an electron gun <b>6021</b> are converged with a condenser lens <b>6022</b> to form a crossover image at a point <b>6024</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0699" num="0698">Beneath the condenser lens <b>6022</b> is disposed a first multi-aperture plate <b>6023</b> having a plurality of apertures to form a plurality of primary electron beams. The plural electron beams formed are each reduced with a reducing lens <b>6025</b> and projected on a point <b>6035</b>. After focused on the point <b>6035</b>, the primary electron beams are then focused with an objective lens <b>6027</b> on a wafer <b>6028</b> as a sample. The primary electron beams from the first multi-aperture plate <b>6023</b> are then deflected with a deflector disposed between the reducing lens <b>6025</b> and the objective lens <b>6027</b> so as to simultaneously scan the surface of the wafer <b>6028</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0700" num="0699">In order to cause no aberration due to the curvature on an image plane of the reducing lens <b>6025</b> and the objective lens <b>6027</b>, the first multi-aperture plate <b>6023</b> may be provided with a plurality of small apertures on the circumference, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53B</figref>, thereby arranging the points projected on the x-axis so as to assume an equally spaced relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0701" num="0700">The plural primary electron beams focused are irradiated at plural points of the wafer <b>6028</b>, and the secondary electron beams emitted from the plural points irradiated are then converged by means of attraction of the electric field of the objective lens <b>6027</b> and deflected with the E×B separator <b>6026</b> to deliver them to the secondary optical system. The image formed by the secondary electron beams is focused on a point <b>6036</b> closer to the objective lens <b>6027</b> than the point <b>6035</b>. This is because the secondary electron beam has energy of several eV only, while each of the primary electron beams has energy of approximately 500 eV on the surface of the wafer <b>6028</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0702" num="0701">The secondary optical system has magnifying lenses <b>6029</b> and <b>6030</b>. The secondary electron beams passed through the magnifying lenses form images on the plural apertures of the second multi-aperture plate <b>6031</b>. The secondary electron beams are detected with a plurality of detectors <b>6032</b> after passage through the apertures thereof. Each of the plural apertures of the second multi-aperture plate <b>6031</b> are arranged so as to correspond to each of the plural apertures of the first multi-aperture plate <b>6023</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0703" num="0702">Each of the detectors <b>6032</b> converts the secondary electron beams into an electric signal representing its intensity. The electric signal is then amplified with an amplifier <b>6033</b> and converted into an image data with an image processing unit <b>6034</b>. To the image processing unit <b>6034</b> is fed a scanning signal for deflecting the primary electron beams from a deflector <b>6039</b>, and the image processing unit <b>6034</b> obtains an image data for displaying an image on the surface of the wafer <b>6028</b>. The image data obtained is then compared with the reference pattern to detect a defect of the wafer <b>6028</b>. Further, a pattern for evaluation on the wafer <b>6028</b> is transferred to a position in the vicinity of the optical axis of the primary optical system by means of registration, and a signal for use in the evaluation of a line width is extracted by line scanning. The appropriate calibration of the signal permits a measurement for a line width of the pattern on the wafer <b>6028</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0704" num="0703">Upon focusing the primary electron beams passed through the apertures of the first multi-aperture plate <b>6023</b> on the surface of the wafer <b>6028</b> and then forming an image on the second multi-aperture plate <b>6031</b> for use in detecting the secondary electron beams emitted from the wafer <b>6028</b>, it is preferred to take necessary measures to minimize the influences due to three aberrations, that is, distortion caused by the primary optical system and the secondary optical system, curvature of an image plane, and field astigmatism.</p>
<p id="p-0705" num="0704">Further, a crosstalk among the plural beams can be eliminated if the minimal value of the interval of the positions of irradiation with the plural primary electron beams is arranged so as to be separated apart by the distance longer than the aberration of the secondary optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0706" num="0705">For the E×B separator <b>6020</b> of Embodiment 19 of the present invention, there may be used an electrode of a parallel plate type as a pair of electrodes for the electrostatic deflector for forming an electric field, the electrode of the parallel plate type being configured such that the magnitude of the direction perpendicular to the optical axis is set to be longer than the distance between the electrodes. Therefore, the use of the electrode of the parallel plate type can make the range larger, in which the electric field having a uniform and parallel strength around the optical axis is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0707" num="0706">Further, in the E×B separators of Embodiments 19 and 20, there is used the coil of the saddle type for the electromagnetic deflector, and a calculated angle of the coil from the optical axis on one side is set to be 2π/3, so that no 3θ component is caused to be formed. Therefore, this configuration can make the range larger, in which the magnetic field having a uniform and parallel strength is formed around the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0708" num="0707">Moreover, the electromagnetic coil forms the magnetic field, so that a deflecting current can be superimposed on the coil, thereby providing a scanning function.</p>
<p id="p-0709" num="0708">The E×B separator of Embodiments 19 and 20 is composed of a combination of the electrostatic deflector with the electromagnetic deflector, so that the aberration of the optical system can be obtained by computing the aberration of the electrostatic deflector and the lens system, computing the aberration of the electromagnetic deflector and the lens system separately, and totaling the computed aberrations.</p>
<p id="p-0710" num="0709">A charged beam apparatus <b>7000</b> according to a twenty-second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55 and 56</figref>. In the present embodiment, a term “vacuum” means a vacuum as referred to in this field of art.</p>
<p id="p-0711" num="0710">In the charged beam apparatus <b>7000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, a tip portion of a optical column <b>7001</b> or a charged beam irradiating section <b>7002</b>, which functions to irradiate a charged beam against a sample, is mounted to a housing <b>7014</b> defining a vacuum chamber C. The sample “S” loaded on a table of an XY stage <b>7003</b> movable in the X direction (the lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>) is positioned immediately below the optical column <b>7001</b>. The XY stage <b>7003</b> of high precision allows the charged beam to be irradiated onto this sample S accurately in any arbitrary location of the sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0711">A pedestal <b>7006</b> of the XY stage <b>7003</b> is fixedly mounted on a bottom wall of the housing <b>7014</b>, and a Y table <b>7005</b> movable in the Y direction (the vertical direction on paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>) is loaded on the pedestal <b>7006</b>. Convex portions are formed on both of opposite sidewall faces (the left and the right side faces in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>) of the Y table <b>7005</b> respectively, each of which projects into a concave groove formed on a side surface facing to the Y table in either of a pair of Y-directional guides <b>7007</b><i>a </i>and <b>7007</b><i>b </i>mounted on the pedestal <b>7006</b>. The concave groove extends approximately along the full length of the Y directional guide in the Y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0713" num="0712">A top, a bottom and a side faces of respective convex portions protruding into the grooves are provided with known hydrostatic bearings <b>7011</b><i>a</i>, <b>7009</b><i>a</i>, <b>7010</b><i>a</i>, <b>7011</b><i>b</i>, <b>7009</b><i>b </i>and <b>7010</b><i>b </i>respectively, through which a high-pressure gas is blown out and thereby the Y table <b>7005</b> is supported by the Y directional guides <b>7007</b><i>a </i>and <b>7007</b><i>b </i>in non-contact manner so as to be movable smoothly reciprocating in the Y direction. Further, a linear motor <b>7012</b> of known structure is arranged between the pedestal <b>7006</b> and the Y table <b>7005</b> for driving the Y table <b>7005</b> in the Y direction. The Y table is supplied with the high-pressure gas through a flexible pipe <b>7022</b> for supplying a high-pressure gas, and the high-pressure gas is further supplied to the above-described hydrostatic bearings <b>7009</b><i>a </i>to <b>7011</b><i>a </i>and <b>7009</b><i>b </i>to <b>7011</b><i>b </i>though a gas passage (not shown) formed within the Y table. The high-pressure gas supplied to the hydrostatic bearings blows out into a gap of some microns to some ten microns formed respectively between the bearings and the opposing guide planes of the Y directional guide so as to position the Y table accurately with respect to the guide planes in the X and Z directions (up and down directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0714" num="0713">The X table <b>7004</b> is loaded on the Y table so as to be movable in the X direction (the lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>). A pair of X directional guides <b>7008</b><i>a </i>and <b>7008</b><i>b </i>(only <b>7008</b><i>a </i>is illustrated) with the same configuration as of the Y directional guides <b>7007</b><i>a </i>and <b>7007</b><i>b </i>is arranged on the Y table <b>7005</b> with the X table <b>7004</b> sandwiched therebetween. Concave grooves are also formed in the X directional guides on the sides facing to the X table and convex portions are formed on the side portions of the X table (side portions facing to the X directional guides). The concave groove extends approximately along the full length of the X directional guide. A top, a bottom and a side faces of respective convex portions of the X table <b>7004</b> protruding into the concave grooves are provided with hydrostatic bearings (not shown) similar to those hydrostatic bearings <b>7011</b><i>a</i>, <b>7009</b><i>a</i>, <b>7010</b><i>a</i>, <b>7011</b><i>b</i>, <b>7009</b><i>b </i>and <b>7010</b><i>b </i>in the similar arrangements. A linear motor <b>7013</b> of known configuration is disposed between the Y table <b>7005</b> and the X table <b>7004</b> so as to drive the X table in the X direction.</p>
<p id="p-0715" num="0714">Further, the X table <b>7004</b> is supplied with a high-pressure gas through a flexible pipe <b>7021</b>, and thus the high-pressure gas is supplied to the hydrostatic bearings. The X table <b>7004</b> is supported highly precisely with respect to the Y directional guide in a non-contact manner by way of said high-pressure gas blowing out from the hydrostatic bearings to the guide planes of the X-directional guides. The vacuum chamber C is evacuated through vacuum pipes <b>7019</b>, <b>7020</b><i>a </i>and <b>7020</b><i>b </i>coupled to a vacuum pump of known structure. Those pipes <b>7020</b><i>a </i>and <b>7020</b><i>b </i>penetrate through the pedestal <b>7006</b> to the top surface thereof to open their inlet sides (inner side of the vacuum chamber) in the proximity of the locations to which the high-pressure gas is ejected from the XY stage <b>7003</b>, so that the pressure in the vacuum chamber may be prevented to the utmost from rising up by the blown-out gas from the hydrostatic bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0716" num="0715">A differential exhausting mechanism <b>7025</b> is arranged so as to surround the tip portion of the optical column <b>7001</b> or the charged particles beam irradiating section <b>7002</b>, so that the pressure in a charged particles beam irradiation space <b>7030</b> can be controlled to be sufficiently low even if there exists high pressure in the vacuum chamber C. That is, an annular member <b>7026</b> of the differential exhausting mechanism <b>7025</b> mounted so as to surround the charged beam irradiating section <b>7002</b> is positioned with respect to the housing <b>7014</b> so that a micro gap (in a range of some microns to some-hundred microns) <b>7040</b> can be formed between the lower face thereof (the surface facing to the sample S) and the sample, and an annular groove <b>7027</b> is formed in the lower face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0717" num="0716">That annular groove <b>7027</b> is coupled to a vacuum pump or the like, though not shown, through an exhausting pipe <b>7028</b>. Accordingly, the micro gap <b>7040</b> can be exhausted through the annular groove <b>7027</b> and the exhausting pipe <b>7028</b>, and if any gaseous molecules from the chamber C attempt to enter the space <b>7030</b> circumscribed by the annular member <b>7026</b>, they may be exhausted. Thereby, the pressure within the charged beam irradiation space <b>7030</b> can be maintained to be low and thus the charged beam can be irradiated without any troubles. That annular groove may be made doubled or tripled, depending on the pressure in the chamber and the pressure within the charged beam irradiation space <b>7030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0718" num="0717">Typically, dry nitrogen is used as the high-pressure gas to be supplied to the hydrostatic bearings. If available, however, a much higher-purity inert gas should be preferably used instead. This is because any impurities, such as water contents or oil and fat contents, included in the gas could stick on the inner surface of the housing defining the vacuum chamber or on the surfaces of the stage components leading to the deterioration in vacuum level, or could stick on the sample surface leading to the deterioration in vacuum level in the charged beam irradiation space.</p>
<p id="p-0719" num="0718">It should be appreciated that though typically the sample S is not placed directly on the X table, but may be placed on a sample table having a function to detachably carry the sample and/or a function to make a fine tuning of the position of the sample relative to the XY stage <b>7003</b>, an explanation therefor is omitted in the above description for simplicity due to the reason that the presence and structure of the sample table has no concern with the principal concept of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0720" num="0719">Since a stage mechanism of a hydrostatic bearing used in the atmospheric pressure can be used in the above-described charged beam apparatus <b>7000</b> mostly as it is, a high precision stage having an equivalent level of precision to those of the stage of high-precision adapted to be used in the atmospheric pressure, which is typically used in an exposing apparatus or the likes, may be accomplished for an XY stage to be used in a charged beam apparatus with equivalent cost and size. It should be also appreciated that in the above description, the configuration and arrangement of the hydrostatic guide and the actuator (the linear motor) have been explained only as an example, and any hydrostatic guides and actuators usable in the atmospheric pressure may be applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0721" num="0720"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> shows an example of numeric values representative of the dimensions of the annular grooves formed in the annular member <b>7026</b> of the differential pumping mechanism <b>7025</b>.

<p id="p-0722" num="0721">The flow rate of the high-pressure gas supplied to the hydrostatic bearing is typically in the order of about 20 L/min (in the conversion into the atmospheric pressure). Assuming that the vacuum chamber C is evacuated by a dry pump having a function of pumping speed of 20000 L/min through a vacuum pipe with an inner diameter of 50 mm and a length of 2 m, the pressure in the vacuum chamber will be about 160 Pa (about 1.2 Torr). At that time, with the applied size of the annular member <b>7026</b>, the annular groove and others of the differential pumping mechanism as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the pressure within the charged particles beam irradiation space <b>7030</b> can be controlled to be 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa (10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr).</p>

Further, those gaseous molecules having invaded into the differential pumping mechanism and/or the charged particles beam irradiation space are sucked from the annular groove <b>7027</b> or the tip portion of the optical column <b>7001</b> through the exhaust ports <b>7028</b> and <b>7018</b> to be exhausted by the turbo molecular pumps <b>7051</b> and <b>7052</b>, and then those gaseous molecules, after having been exhausted by the turbo molecular pumps, are further exhausted by the dry vacuum pump <b>7053</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="0725">In this way, the high-purity inert gas supplied to the hydrostatic bearing is collected into the dry vacuum pump and then exhausted away.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="0726">On the other hand, the exhaust port of the dry vacuum pump <b>7053</b> is connected to a compressor <b>7054</b> via a pipe <b>7076</b>, and an exhaust port of the compressor <b>7054</b> is connected to flexible pipes <b>7021</b> and <b>7022</b> via pipes <b>7077</b>, <b>7078</b> and <b>7079</b> and regulators <b>7061</b> and <b>7062</b>. Owing to this configuration, the high-purity inert gas exhausted from the dry vacuum pump <b>7053</b> is compressed again by the compressor <b>7054</b> and then the gas, after being regulated to an appropriate pressure by regulators <b>7061</b> and <b>7062</b>, is supplied again to the hydrostatic bearings of the XY stage.</p>
<p id="p-0728" num="0727">In this regard, since the gas to be supplied to the hydrostatic bearings is required to be as highly purified as possible in order not to have any water contents or oil and fat contents included therein, as described above, the turbo molecular pump, the dry pump and the compressor are all required to have such structures that prevent any water contents or oil and fat contents from entering the gas flow path. It is also considered effective that a cold trap, a filter <b>7060</b> or the like is provided in the course of the outlet side piping <b>7077</b> of the compressor so as to trap the impurities such as water contents or oil and fat contents, if any, included in the circulating gas and to prevent them from being supplied to the hydrostatic bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0729" num="0728">This may allow the high purity inert gas to be circulated and reused, and thus allows the high-purity inert gas to be saved, while the inert gas would not remain desorbed into a room where the present apparatus is installed, thereby eliminating a fear that any accidents such as suffocation or the like would be caused by the inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0730" num="0729">A circulation piping system is connected with a high-purity inert gas supply source <b>7063</b>, which serves both to fill up with the high-purity inert gas all of the circulation systems including the vacuum chamber C, the vacuum pipes <b>7070</b> to <b>7075</b>, and the pipes in compression side <b>7076</b> to <b>7080</b>, prior to the starting of the gas circulation, and to supply a deficiency of gas if the flow rate of the circulation gas decreases by some reason. Further, if the dry vacuum pump <b>7053</b> is further provided with a function for compressing up to the atmospheric pressure or more, it may be employed as a single pump so as to serve both as the dry vacuum pump <b>7053</b> and the compressor <b>7054</b>. As the ultra-high vacuum pump to be used for evacuating the optical column, other pumps including an ion pump and a getter pump may be used instead of the turbo molecular pump. Further, instead of the dry vacuum pump, a dry pump of other type, for example, a dry pump of diaphragm type may be used.</p>

The charged beam apparatus <b>7100</b> includes an optical system <b>7160</b> and a detector <b>7180</b>, each applicable to the charged particles beam apparatus <b>7000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>. The optical system <b>7160</b> comprises a primary optical system <b>7161</b> for irradiating the charged particles beam against the sample S loaded on the stage <b>7003</b> and a secondary optical system <b>7171</b> into which the secondary electrons emanated from the sample are to be introduced.</p>

The E×B separating system <b>7166</b> comprises an electrode <b>7661</b> and a magnet <b>7662</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0733" num="0732">The secondary optical system <b>7171</b> is another optical system to which the secondary electrons emanated from the sample S are introduced, which comprises a lens system composed of two stages of electrostatic lenses <b>7172</b> and <b>7173</b> disposed in an upper side of the E×B type separating system of the primary optical system. The detector <b>7180</b> detects the secondary electrons sent through the secondary optical system <b>7171</b>. Since the structures and functions of respective components of said optical systems <b>7160</b> and said detector <b>7180</b> are similar to those in the prior art, a detailed description thereof should be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0734" num="0733">The charged particles beam emitted from the electron gun <b>7162</b> is appropriately shaped in a square aperture of the electron gun, contracted by the lens system of two stages of lenses <b>7163</b> and <b>7164</b>, and then, after the optical axis thereof being adjusted by the deflector <b>7165</b>, the charged beam is formed into an image of 1.25 mms square on a deflection principal plane of the E×B separating system <b>7166</b>. The E×B separating system <b>7166</b> is designed such that an electric field and a magnetic field are crossed at a right angle within a plane orthogonal to a normal line of the sample, wherein when the relationship among the electric field, the magnetic field and the energy of electrons satisfies a certain condition, the electrons are advanced straight forward, and for the case other than the above, the electrons are deflected into a predetermined direction depending on said mutual relationship among the electric field, the magnetic field and the energy of electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0735" num="0734">The relationship has been set such that the charged beam from the electron gun is deflected to enter the sample S at a right angle and the secondary electrons emanated from the sample can be advanced straight ahead toward the detector <b>7180</b>. The shaped beam, after having been deflected by the E×B deflecting system, is contracted to ⅕ in size with the lens system composed of the lenses <b>7167</b> and <b>7168</b> to be projected onto the sample S.</p>
<p id="p-0736" num="0735">The secondary electrons emanated from the sample S, which have the information of a pattern image, are magnified by the lens systems composed of the lenses <b>7167</b> and <b>7168</b> and the lenses <b>7172</b> and <b>7173</b> so as to form the secondary electron image on the detector <b>7180</b>. These four stages of magnifying lenses, which are composed of the lens system of the lenses <b>7167</b> and <b>7168</b> forming a symmetrical tablet lens and the lens system of the lenses <b>7172</b> and <b>7173</b> also forming another symmetrical tablet lens, make up the lenses of no distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0737" num="0736">The charged particles beam apparatus <b>7000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55 to 58</figref> may be applied to the semiconductor device manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>.

<p id="p-0744" num="0743"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an electron beam apparatus <b>8000</b> according to a twenty-fifth embodiment of the present invention, wherein an electron beam emitted from an electron gun <b>8001</b> is focused by a condenser lens <b>8002</b> to form a cross-over at a point <b>8004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0745" num="0744">A first multi-aperture plate <b>8003</b> having a plurality of apertures <b>8003</b>′ is disposed beneath the condenser lens <b>8002</b>, and thereby a plurality of primary electron beams is formed. Each of the plurality of primary electron beams formed by the first multi-aperture plate, after having been contracted by a demagnification lens <b>8005</b> to be focused onto a point <b>8015</b>, is focused by an objective lens <b>8007</b> onto a sample <b>8008</b>. The plurality of primary electron beams emitted through the first multi-aperture plate <b>8003</b> is deflected by a deflector disposed between the reduction lens <b>8005</b> and the objective lens <b>8007</b> so as to simultaneously scan different locations on a surface of the sample <b>8008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0746" num="0745">In order to eliminate an effect of field curvature aberration possibly caused by the reduction lens <b>8005</b> and the objective lens <b>8007</b>, the multi-aperture plate <b>8003</b> is provided with a plurality of apertures <b>8003</b>′ arranged along a circle on said multi-aperture plate <b>8003</b> such that projected points of centers of said apertures <b>8003</b>′ onto x-axis may be equally spaced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0747" num="0746">In the electron beam apparatus <b>8000</b> of the twenty-fifth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, from a plurality of spots on the sample <b>8008</b> irradiated by the plurality of primary electron beams, a plurality of secondary electron beams is emanated, attracted by an electric field of the objective lens <b>8007</b> to be focused narrower, deflected by an E×B separator <b>8006</b>, and then introduced into a secondary optical system. A secondary electron image is focused on a point <b>8016</b> which is closer to the objective lens <b>8007</b> than the point <b>8015</b>. This is because the secondary electron beam has only a few eV of energy while each of the primary electron beams has 500 eV of energy on the sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0748" num="0747">The secondary optical system includes magnifying lenses <b>8009</b> and <b>8010</b>, and the secondary electron beam, after having passed through these magnifying lenses <b>8009</b> and <b>8010</b>, passes through a plurality of apertures formed on a second multi-aperture plate <b>8011</b>, and is focused on a plurality of electron detectors <b>8012</b>. It is to be noted that each of the plurality of apertures formed on the second multi-aperture plate <b>8011</b> disposed in front of the detectors <b>8012</b> corresponds to each of the plurality of apertures <b>8003</b>′ formed on the first multi-aperture plate <b>8003</b> in a geometric relationship therebetween in a manner of one-by-one basis.</p>
<p id="p-0749" num="0748">Each of the detectors <b>8012</b> converts a detected secondary electron beam into an electric signal representative of intensity thereof. The electric signal output from each of the detectors, after having been amplified respectively by an amplifier <b>8013</b>, is received by an image processing section <b>8014</b> to be converted into an image data. Since the image processing section <b>8014</b> is further supplied with a scanning signal for deflecting the primary electron beam, the image processing section <b>8014</b> can display an image representative of the surface of the sample <b>8008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0750" num="0749">Comparing this image with a reference pattern allows any defects of the sample <b>8008</b> to be detected, and also a line width of a pattern on the sample <b>8008</b> can be measured in such a way that the pattern to be measured of the sample <b>8008</b> is moved by a registration to a proximity of an optical axis of the primary optical system, and the pattern is line-scanned to extract a line width evaluation signal, which is in turn appropriately calibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0751" num="0750">In this regard, when the primary electron beams passed through the apertures of the first multi-aperture plate <b>8003</b> are focused on the surface of the sample <b>8008</b>, and the secondary electron beams emanated from the sample are formed into an image on the detectors <b>8012</b>, much attention should be paid in order to minimize the affection by the three aberrations, i.e., a distortion caused by the primary optical system, a field curvature and a astigmatism field.</p>
<p id="p-0752" num="0751">As for a relation between the spacing among the plurality of primary electron beams and the secondary optical system, if the space between respective primary electron beams is determined to be greater than the aberration of the secondary optical system, then the crosstalk among a plurality of beams can be eliminated.</p>

<p id="p-0754" num="0753"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> shows a simulation model for the objective lens <b>8007</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>. Reference numeral <b>8021</b> is an optical axis, <b>8022</b> is an upper electrode of the objective lens <b>8007</b>, which is set to 0 volt, <b>8023</b> is a center electrode of the objective lens, to which high voltage is to be applied, <b>8024</b> is an under electrode of the objective lens, which is set to earth voltage, and a sample surface <b>8025</b> is set to −4000 volts. Reference numerals <b>8026</b>, <b>8027</b> and <b>8028</b> are insulator spacers for supporting the electrodes. An image of the multi-beam in a position of z=0 mm was focused on the sample surface <b>8025</b> by varying a position of the cross-over produced by the demagnification lens <b>8005</b> and also by varying the voltage of center electrode in the objective lens, and the aberration generated thereby was calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0755" num="0754"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> is a graph illustrating a result of the above simulation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>, the values of aberration (nm, y-axis) are shown as a function of varied cross-over positions (mm, x-axis). An upper surface of the center electrode <b>8023</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>) was located at z=144 mm. An r position of the multi-beam and a half angular aperture were set to 50 μm and 5 mrad respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0756" num="0755">In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>, a curve <b>8031</b> indicates a coma-aberration, <b>8032</b> a magnification chromatic aberration, <b>8033</b> an astigmatism, <b>8034</b> an on-axis chromatic aberration, <b>8035</b> an field curvature, <b>8036</b> a distortion, and <b>8037</b> indicates a blur.</p>
<p id="p-0757" num="0756">When the multi-beams are arranged along a circle centering around the optical axis, the blur <b>8037</b> is determined substantially by the magnification chromatic aberration <b>8032</b> and the on-axis chromatic aberration <b>8034</b> since the field curvature is zero. Hereupon, the energy spread of the electron beam is set to 5 eV. When the cross-over position is set to 140 mm, the magnification chromatic aberration is reduced to almost non-problematic level. That is, according to this simulation, it is found that the cross-over position produced by the front stage lens should be formed in the electron gun side of the position of the center electrode of the objective lens (144 mm).</p>
