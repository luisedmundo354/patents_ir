<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of measuring light reflections of an object, a light-source illumination-observation assembly, a diffuser light-source assembly, an apparatus for measuring light reflections of an object comprising such a light-source illumination-observation assembly, such an apparatus further comprising a diffuser light-source assembly, and use of such an apparatus for measuring reflection, retroreflection, or both, preferably the object being a reflective material, a reflective device, a retroreflector material, and a retroreflector device, or a combination thereof, in particular a road marking, a road surface, a raised pavement marking, or all.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">THE TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Road markings are typically provided by application of marking materials such as paint, thermoplastic materials, cold hardening materials, preformed lines, and symbols onto the surface of the road. Road marking materials can be applied with or without addition of colors, e.g. white, yellow, or other colors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Road markings are often profiled to produce a certain surface textures to enhance special properties, e.g. for enhancing retroreflectivity under conditions of wet or rainy weather, or to produce a signal to the driver of a vehicle in the form of an acoustistic signal or vibration when crossed at speed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular road markings may comprise addition of retro-reflective materials such as glass beads, in particular road markings intended for illumination by vehicle headlamp illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The coefficient of retroreflected luminance R<sub>L </sub>(unit mcd·m<sup>−2</sup>·lx<sup>−1</sup>) is a characteristic measure for the retroreflection of road markings and road surfaces in vehicle headlamp illumination at night.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to current European (CEN) and American (ASTM) standards, road marking performance is measured by the coefficient of retroreflected luminance, R<sub>L</sub>, determined as the ratio between the retroreflected luminance L of a measured field of the road marking in the direction of observation by the illuminance E<sub>1 </sub>at the measured field perpendicular to the direction of the incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Illumination and observation are at specified geometrical conditions involving directions at predefined small angles relative to the surface of the road marking to be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It depends on the marking material used, age and wear thereof. A high retroreflected luminance corresponds to a high level of visual performance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Adequate visibility of road markings in night driving conditions is generally assured by minimum requirements for the R<sub>L </sub>values of the road markings. Requirements are included in national legislation and national road standards and serve as the basis for warranties and contracts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The luminance coefficient under diffuse illumination Q<sub>d </sub>(unit mcd·m<sup>−2</sup>·lx<sup>−1</sup>) is a characteristic measure for the reflection of road markings and road surfaces in daylight and under road lighting. Adequate visibility of road markings in day driving conditions is generally assured by minimum requirements for the Q<sub>d </sub>values of the road markings. Requirements are included in national legislation and national road standards and serve as the basis for warranties and contracts.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For testing purposes, portable retroreflectometers and reflectometers are known for the measurement of the R<sub>L </sub>and Q<sub>d </sub>of road markings in situ conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Illumination and observation involves particular illumination and observation fields on the surface of the road marking to be measured. In order to reduce influence of any misalignment of the retroreflectometer, when placed on a road for measuring under real conditions of debris and small particles on the road marking, or of texture, profiled road markings, or vertical curves of the road marking, either of the illumination field or the observation field is smaller than the other field and enclosed within that field, in particular the illumination field is chosen as the smaller of the two.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Consequently, there is a need for improved portable reflectometers that are compact, simple to manufacture, robust against misalignment in operation, and simple to use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DISCLOSURES</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,389 discloses a method and apparatus for measuring retroreflectivity of a reflective layer on a surface, such as a roadway markings, said method and apparatus comprising steps and means for illuminating a portion of the reflective layer with a laser beam of a predetermined wavelength at an angle of incidence and steps and means for observing the reflected laser beam in an observation angle, filtering the observed reflected laser light, and detecting the filtered reflected laser light in a photometer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">American Society for Testing Materials, ASTM Designation: E1710-97, “Standard Test Method for Measurement of Retroreflective Pavement Marking Materials with CEN-prescribed Geometry Using a Portable Retroreflectometer” discloses a test method for measurement of retroreflective properties of horizontal pavement marking materials containing retroreflecting spheres.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">European Committee for Standardization, CEN EN1436:1997, “Road marking materials—road marking performance for road users” discloses standard specifications and test methods for the performance for road users of white and yellow road markings.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0077">The optical arrangement of a portable retroreflectometer comprises two light channels, one for illumination and one for observation, separated by a wall <b>110</b> which wall reduce generation of “false” signals by preventing illumination light of the illumination channel in reaching the observation channel.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0078">The illumination channel comprises a light source <b>101</b> emitting light through an illumination aperture stop <b>103</b> from which light propagates as an illumination beam <b>105</b> through an illumination field stop <b>107</b>. The illumination beam is collimated by a collimating lens <b>109</b>. A beam splitter <b>1111</b> reflects the collimated beam to provide an illumination field <b>113</b> on a surface <b>112</b> of a road marking or road surface on which the reflectometer is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0079">The observation channel comprises a mirror <b>111</b> reflecting light from an observation field <b>114</b> originated from the surface <b>112</b> and received through the beam splitter <b>1111</b> of the illumination channel.

A receiver <b>102</b> collects light of the observation beam through an observation aperture stop <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0080">The observation field <b>114</b> comprises the illumination field <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows another illustration of an apparatus for measuring light retroreflection according to prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0082">The optical arrangement of a portable retroreflectometer does not include a separation between channels for illumination and observation.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0083">An illumination-receiver unit <b>200</b> comprises a light source <b>201</b>, an illumination aperture stop <b>203</b>, a receiver <b>202</b>, an observation aperture stop <b>204</b> and optics, which define an illumination beam <b>205</b> and an observation beam <b>206</b>, both with limited angular extensions in the same way as would have been the case using field stops.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0084">The illumination beam <b>205</b> passes through a collimating lens <b>209</b>. A mirror <b>211</b> reflects the collimated beam onto an illumination field <b>213</b> on the surface <b>212</b> of a road marking or road surface on which the reflectometer is placed. The mirror <b>211</b> reflects an observation beam <b>206</b> from an observation field <b>214</b> via the collimating lens <b>209</b>, here functioning as a focusing lens, onto the receiving part of illumination-receiver unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0085">The illumination field <b>213</b> is enclosed within the observation field <b>214</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0088">Such false signals can be avoided by tilting the collimating lens <b>209</b> which, however, makes the illumination beam <b>205</b> and the observation beam <b>206</b> pass the collimating lens <b>209</b> at a considerable larger angle to the lens axis <b>2091</b> at which the collimating property of the collimating lens is reduced.</p>

Other confined luminous fields includes an exit of an optical fibre, or the optical image of a luminous field of a different shape or size.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0093">The non-stopped, transmitted light from said confined luminous field propagates in an illumination beam <b>305</b> defined by an illumination field stop <b>307</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0100">This can be accomplish in any suitable way, e.g. the receiving parts of the light receiver itself can define the confined receiving field, so that the aperture stop is not required. Other confined receiving fields includes an entrance of an optical fibre, or the optical image of a receiving field of a different shape or size.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0101">Generally, the light receiver is adapted to the illumination light source. In an embodiment, a long pass absorbtion filter, e.g. an OG 590 from Schott, is used in the light path between the light source and the light receiver, preferably in front of the light receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0102">In a preferred embodiment, the observation field comprises the illumination field so that variations of the illumination field occur within the observation field whereby variations in the measuring signal, e.g. due to surface variations of the object, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0103">In another preferred embodiment, the illumination field comprises the observation field</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">“Common Optical Element”</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0104">The illumination-observation assembly further comprises at least one common optical element, said at least one common optical element being arranged to overlap said illumination beam and said observation beam, here said common optical element is the collimating lens <b>309</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0105">The illumination-observation assembly further comprises a unit separation stop, or channel separation stop, here a wall <b>310</b> that prevents light from the illumination channel or other light sources to enter into the observation channel thereby avoiding and/or reducing generation of false signals.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0106">Generally, the unit separation stop is adapted to stop light from the illumination channel, e.g. either direct light or indirect light from light reflections, in reaching the light receiver of the observation channel. Further the unit separation stop does not influence the extent of the observation field defined with respect to the illumination field.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0107">It is preferred that said unit separation stop is adapted to stop light reflections, including stopping light reflections from unwanted external light source as well as reflections from the illumination unit.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0123">Further reduction of false signal from ambient light can be obtained by a two step measuring and calibration procedure known in the art, see description below.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0124">Additional reduction of false signal may be obtained by use of a flash light source, whose illumination for a short measuring period includes a flash that dominates over even full daylight.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0125">In the optical arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the collimating design does not involve a beam splitter as is the case with prior art; similar to the collimating optics illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>of ASTM E 1710-97 for a portable road marking apparatus wherein a beam splitter is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0126">An advantage of this optical arrangement is avoidance of a beam splitter and the consequent loss of effective measuring signal and reduced use of the collimating lens <b>309</b> as in prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0127">An additional advantage is avoidance of additional optics in order to shape the illumination and observation beams as in prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0128">The position of the illumination field stop <b>307</b> in a position above the lens cause the illuminated field <b>313</b> to become slightly less sharp, but not to an extent that has any significant influence on the performance of the apparatus according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0129">The partly separation between the two channels by a wall <b>310</b> extending part of the way down to the collimating lens <b>309</b> ensures adequate prevention of spill over of light from the illumination into the observation channel.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0130">A large signal and a large observation field is obtained with a simple optical arrangement without any significant disadvantage.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0131">In order to eliminate completely the influence of light penetrating from the illumination to the observation channel, the calibration of the apparatus includes a “zero calibration”. A measurement is performed into a light trap of virtually no reflection, or into open air with a sufficient distance to objects, and the reading is adjusted to zero. After this, calibration is done by measurement of a calibration standard with a known light retroreflection value, and the reading is set to this value. The user is guided through this procedure in an automated sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0132">After calibration the apparatus is ready for measurement. The procedure includes a measurement of any ambient signal, and subtraction of this signal. For improved performance, the output of the light source is monitored independently, all in an automated procedure.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">“Diffuser Light-source Assembly”</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an illustration of an embodiment of a diffuser light-source assembly according to the invention; here a diffuser <b>516</b> and a light source <b>515</b> combination.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0134">In another embodiment the light source is integrated in the diffuser, preferably in the cavity wall.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0135">The diffuser light-source assembly comprises a light source <b>515</b>, e.g. a Super-Quiet Xenon Flash lamp from Hamamatsu or an 8 V 20 W halogen incandescent lamp type 64255 from Osram; and a diffuser <b>516</b>, said diffuser comprising: a diffusive reflecting cavity wall <b>510</b>, said diffusive reflecting cavity wall comprising partly or wholly reflective surface elements, providing multiple reflections of said light received through said light receiving aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0136">Further, said diffuser comprises a plurality of light emitting apertures <b>517</b>, said light emitting apertures being arranged in said cavity wall and being adapted to emit diffused light.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0137">The diffuser comprises a wall having a reflective interior surface, e.g. in form of a white finish applied to interior walls thereof. The reflective interior surface provides multiple reflections of light received therein thereby on average creating an essentially uniform luminance over the interior surface of the diffuser.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0138">Further, the diffuser comprises means for receiving light from said light source, here an aperture in the wall thereof, e.g. an aperture in a side face of the diffuser.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0139">Still further, the diffuser comprises means for emitting diffused light, here a plurality of apertures <b>517</b> arranged in the wall thereof, e.g. in form of a thin perforated plate <b>517</b> arranged as a bottom face of the diffuser, the thickness of the plate being selected so that conditions of diffused light is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0140">In operation, the diffuser light source is positioned at a height above the surface of a road, in particular a road marking <b>512</b>, which ensures conditions of diffused illumination—not necessary in each point of the illuminated surface—but on average.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0143">The apparatus further comprises means for determining a reflection coefficient of the measured reflection of the object, e.g. retroreflection measurements providing RL values.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0144">The diffuser cavity <b>616</b> is positioned so that it is as close to the surface of the road marking <b>612</b> on which the reflectometer is placed, as possible, without obstructing the observation beam <b>606</b>, and so that the illumination from the diffuser cavity <b>616</b> falls within the observation field <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0145">In this embodiment the apparatus has two light sources, one light source for light retroreflection measurement <b>601</b> and an additional light source <b>615</b> for light reflection measurement by illumination of the diffuser cavity <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0146">The observation channel functions so that the receiver <b>602</b> collects light from the observation beam <b>606</b> via the observation aperture stop <b>604</b>. The collimating lens <b>609</b> collimates the light originated from an observation field <b>614</b> of the surface <b>612</b> and reflected by the mirror <b>611</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0147">With the normal light source for light retroreflection measurement <b>601</b> turned on and the additional light source <b>615</b> turned off, the apparatus measures the light retroreflection of the road marking.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0148">With the light source for light retroreflection measurement <b>601</b> turned off and the additional light source (<b>615</b>) turned on, the apparatus measures the light reflection of the road marking.
