<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an image printing system which outputs a photographic image which was photographed with an image pickup apparatus such as digital camera, and stored in a recording media as an image datum, and input Into the printing system by reading the image datum with an equipped media reader, or by reading the out-put photograph directly with an equipped image reader such as scanner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention also relates to an image printing system which outputs a specified scene in the dynamic image digital data which was photographed with an image pickup apparatus such as a digital camcorder, and stored In a recording media, and input into the printing system by reading the image datum with an equipped media reader.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention further relates to the individual service and information offer service at the time of printing service of the image data which a customer demands.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the image taken by the digital camera etc. is recorded as digital data, without using a lab, it can print out by using the personal computer and printer at a home.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, a relatively compact Image outputting apparatus capable of reading and outputting image digital data photographed by a digital camera or the like as well as capable of being installed at a relatively small space of a corner in a shop or on the street has been proposed (hereinafter referred to as the “post type image outputting apparatus”). For example, JP-A-10-341303 discloses a post type Image outputting apparatus comprising various kinds of interfaces corresponding to a plurality of different kinds of recording media, capable of reading and outputting image digital data from the various kinds of the recording media. The post type image output apparatus provides the handiness to be operated freely by customers so that they can print out desired photograph images instantaneously and take them back with them.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, it is well-known to change a scale and a position by carrying out digital processing of the original image, or to edit the original image to synthesize other material images, or to do so, in order to obtain the image having additional value of high quality. For example, with a personal image printing system built on another personal computer as an axis, the digital processing of a image can perform comparatively easily even in an advanced image edition. Moreover, a different type image printing system called “Print Club” has been also put on the street or other places, wherein a photographed portrait can be synthesized with a frame image.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the advantage of using the image printing system put on these streets etc. has been decreased gradually, by improvement in functional of a personal computer and a printer for home use, and thus, a development of the image printing system which can offer a more additional value to the printed article would be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Next, in order to print out one scene (hereinafter, it may be called “dynamic-shot” or a “shot image” may be called below) included in the dynamic image photographed with the digital camcorder, the digital camera, etc. as a still picture, a digital datum to be recorded as the desired scene for static image from the dynamic image digital data is specified, and a still image is printed out based on this static image data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such work can be done using the personal computer and printer at a home. Alternatively, once one scene included in a dynamic image is specified by using the personal computer at a home, it is possible for the data of the specified shot image to be recorded on a recording medium, and to be brought to a processing laboratory (lab) in order to be printed as a still picture.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in order to print a shot image from a dynamic image data using a lab, it is necessary to specify the scene of wishing to print out as a still picture from the countless scenes included in the dynamic image, and to tell the clerk of the lab about it. For that purpose, a shot Image to be printed should be specified by using a personal computer at home and the datum of shot image should be digitalized to be recorded on a recording medium in order to carry it into the lab. Alternatively, the dynamic image data on a recording medium should be carried into the lab, then the dynamic image data should be reproduced on a monitor in front of the clerk of the lab in order to point out the scene to be printed to the clerk. These are inconvenient anyway.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although the post type image outputting apparatus as described above can be operated freely by a customer, in order to print out a desired photograph image instantaneously and with ease, it does not have the function which prints out such a shot image.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the shopping center etc. does some unique services offered to customer, such as an information service of the recommended goods by insertion of a newspaper etc., a point service wherein points are given to the customer in proportion to the customer's usage of the shopping center, and any service such as reduction in price, etc., is made according to the given points. These services are not restricted to such a shopping center, but are performed in various types of industry. For example, such service is made on the DPE print store which develops a photograph. In a DPE print store, if a customer orders a print, points will be given to him according to the fee of print. Once the points accrued by the customer attains a fixed point, the print fee will be discounted according to the fixed point. Alternatively, as the service, an enlarged photograph etc. would be given with no charge.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, in recent years, by using the Internet etc., while performing advertisement of stores (shopping center etc.), a service where a coupon (discount ticket) etc. can be issued by a operation on the browsing screen is offered.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, when a customer uses the mentioned image printing apparatus, in the present condition, such additional service is not given. Thus, there is a large service gap between the case of using such image printing system and the case of using DPE print store, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, the printing apparatus has the advantage that it can install anywhere, even In a small space. Therefore, once the printing apparatus is installed in a shop, and it uses for performing advertisement of the shop to the customer using printing apparatus, it is expected that it can perform timely and effective advertisement.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Now, this invention will be described in detail with referring to the preferred embodiments. However, this invention is not limited to the following preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Image Plus Event Information Printing System</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The image plus event information printing system according to this invention comprises at least following means, that is:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0150">(1) an image data inputting means for inputting original image data,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0151">(2) an event information database which memorizes the data of current and/or passing events information being sorted with one or more items, wherein one of the items consists of the occurrence time of the event,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0152">(3) an event information retrieval means for extracting any event information within a predetermined range being in correlation to the time which is related to the original image, by retrieving from the sorted data in the event information database with using one or more of the items,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0153">(4) an image editing means for preparing a datum of an image plus event information, from the datum of original image and the extracted event information, and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0154">(5) a printing means for printing the image plus current events information in accordance with the datum prepared by the image editing means.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0155">However, the system may have other means optionally, such as a means for inputting order contents, a material database which memorizes material images other than events information, and a means for collecting a charge. Moreover, the image plus event information printing system of this invention may be constructed as the stand-alone type which stored all the means in one apparatus, or may be constructed by some apparatuses which carried out distributed storing of each means and which are connected each other by the line. Furthermore, distributed storing of each means may be carried out at terminal apparatus and a server, and a client/server type system may be constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0156">In order to print the image plus event information with the image plus event information printing system of this invention, at first a image datum which recorded an original image is input in a system by the image data inputting means. Then, the event information which shows a famous current/passing event occurred at a date near to the time being related to the input original image (for examples famous event occurred at the same day with the photographed day of the original image, or within about one month before and after the photographed day) is searched and extracted from the events information database by using a event information retrieval means, and the extracted event information is synthesized with an original image by using the image editing means. Finally, the synthesized image may be printed by the printing means.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0157">The outline of this invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an constructive embodiment of the printing system according to this invention (<b>1</b>A). The print system <b>1</b>A comprises a terminal part <b>2</b> which can receive an order and can output a printed article, and a events information service part (events information distribution server) <b>3</b> which offers events information in response to the demand from a terminal part, and the above mentioned terminal part <b>2</b> and the above mentioned events information service part <b>3</b> are connected through a line <b>6</b>. The line <b>6</b> may be an exclusive or open network line of various scales such as Internet, intranet, LAN. Alternatively, it may be a line which simply connects one main body with one backyard print part.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0158">In addition, in the illustrated printing system <b>1</b>A, the terminal part <b>2</b> is constituted by the post type image outputting apparatus which is a commercial image output system, on the other hand, the events information service part <b>3</b> is constituted by the events information distribution server which an entrepreneur other than that of the post type image outputting apparatus manages, and both are connected by the Internet as a line <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0159">The terminal part <b>2</b> is equipped with an image data inputting means <b>7</b>, an order inputting means <b>8</b>, an image editing means <b>9</b>, an other material databases <b>10</b>, an printing means <b>11</b>, and a fee collecting means <b>12</b>. On the other hand, the events information service part <b>3</b> is equipped with an events information database <b>13</b>, an event information retrieval means <b>14</b>, an event information selecting means <b>15</b>, and the fee collection means <b>16</b> of the events Information service part.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0160">In order to print the image plus event information using printing system <b>1</b>A, the print mode which can print the image plus event information is first chosen by using the order inputting means <b>8</b> and the mode is started. The order contents which should be outputted may be input optionally by using the order inputting means <b>8</b>. However, it is possible to set up the system so that a standardized procedure may be performed automatically after starting the printing system, without receiving no order from the user, up to the final step where the image plus event information is printed. Thus, the order inputting means is not essential to the system of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0161">several alternatives for order contents may be beforehand prepared by the image printing system side in order that the customer can decide his order content with ease by selecting freely from the alternatives. It is desirable to show the customer the alternatives for order contents which can be chosen on a display means (not shown), and to guide input operation of order contents. As the display means, a CRT, a liquid crystal display or the like, are used commonly, but it can be a simpler device. For example, when applying the printing system of this invention to the post type image outputting apparatus mentioned above, it is possible to stand a bulletin board which itemized the operation method by the side of the terminal part. In addition thereto, a substitute display device such as various kinds of screen panels, plasma displays or the like, can be used as well. As the order contents, for example, the selection In case there are two or more print modes the selection of specifying which frame image should be used in case two or more image data for plural frames are input, specification of the time (image related time) relevant to an original image, designation of a retrieval item which should be directed for a event information retrieval means in addition to the image related time, directions of the contents of edit Including the synthesis with the event information and other material image, expansion or reduction of the image, etc. designation of print number of sheets, the determination of size, etc. may be exemplified.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0162">As the order content inputting device <b>8</b>, for example, various kinds of pointers such as a touch panel provided integrally with a display device such as a CRT, and a liquid crystal panel, a keyboard, a mouse, and a track ball, can be used. Moreover, the DPOF function (digital print order format) provided in a digital camera can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0163">Next, an image datum <b>17</b> which recorded the original image is input by using the image data inputting means <b>7</b>. The image data to be inputted are mainly a photograph image taken by a digital camera or the like, and recorded in a recording medium as digital data, but it is not limited thereto. For example, a computer graphic image produced by a personal computer, digital image data of a synthesized image produced by the editing process of a photography by a personal computer, or any articles which have already printed out, such as those of photograph image, synthesized image, computer graphic image, a handwritten illustration or the like, can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0164">As the image data inputting means <b>7</b>, for example, reading machines corresponding to each recording medium, such as a compact flash memory (CF), a smart medium, a compact disc (CD), a magneto-optic disc (MO), a flexible disc (FD), and a PC card, a connector to be connected with a digital camera, capable of reading image data from a memory of the digital camera, can be used As the image data inputting means <b>7</b>, a reading device such as a scanner for reading an image from a hard copy, a film, or another printed article so as to convert the same to digital data, can be used as well. By including an image reading device capable of directly scanning an image together with a recording medium reading device in the Image data inputting means <b>7</b>, even in case the digital image data are not provided, the image printing apparatus according to the present invention can be utilized. For example, in case the negative film is lost, additional prints can be provided easily from the printed photograph. Furthermore, a communication apparatus which can receive an original image from an external server may be used as an image data inputting means <b>7</b>. It is preferable to include a plurality of reading devices of different kinds in the image data inputting means <b>7</b> in order to improve the applicability of the image printing apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0165">Next, the events information which shows the occurrence generated at a time near to the time relevant to the input original Image is searched and extracted from the data of the events information memorized in the events information database <b>13</b> by using the event information retrieval means <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0166">In the events information database <b>13</b>, for example, the events information data which specify socially famous occurrences are accumulated. The “socially famous occurrence” would refer to the occurrence which is expected to be remembered and recognized with the exact or about occurrence time thereof by many members in a society, or refer to the occurrence which comes to be a common knowledge in the society, wherein the society may be that organized in a predetermined area, for example, an administrative district region of a prefecture level such as Tokyo, a larger region level such as Kanto, a nation level such as Japan, or worldwide level. The socially famous occurrence may include a historical incident, a large calamity, a topic about a famous entertainer, etc. Event information denotes an information capable of identifying the content of event, such as a socially famous occurrence, on a printed matter, and it can be constituted by words, text, photograph, or picture which each indicate the event, singly or in arbitrary combination thereof. Moreover, since any pattern like a bar code which can reproduce a sound when it Is read with a certain reader, it can be used as event information and thus the contents of a socially famous occurrence can be attached on a printed matter as this pattern and it can be identified with a sound. As a concrete example, the event information may comprise a combination of some brief words which show the socially famous occurrence, a description for the date of the occurrence, and a thumb nail image which indicates one scene of the occurrence.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0167">In the events information database <b>13</b>, the data of the events information which specify events, such as the socially famous occurrences are sorted or classified by the generating time of occurrence, and preferably, they are pluralistically sorted or classified by two or more items containing the generating time of an occurrence, and memorized. Therefore, an event information <b>18</b> regarding the famous occurrence which was generated at the time near the time relevant to the input original image (image related time) can be searched and extracted from the data In the events information database by using the event generating time as the search item at the event information retrieval means <b>14</b>. Moreover, a priority may be assigned to each events Information accumulated in a database so that the search result can display the events information extracted in preferential order from when many events information are extracted by the search.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0168">The time which is related to the original image is typically the photographed day of the original image. By searching and extracting the events information which shows the famous occurrence generated at the same day as or the near time of the photographed day of original image, and synthesizing the extracted event information with the original image, those who looked at the synthesized image can grasp the photographed time of an original image intuitively from the contents of events information, or can recognize the time background at the time of original image photographed. However, the image related time is not limited to a photographed day. That is, those who perform image edit using this system can choose a certain time related to the original image arbitrarily, and can specify as the image related time. The image related time may be input into the event information retrieval means <b>14</b> by using the order inputting means (numeral <b>21</b>), or may read automatically the data of the photographed day which is recorded along with image data, and transmitted to the event information retrieval means <b>14</b> (numeral <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0169">In the event information retrieval means <b>14</b>, a proper time range is set up on the basis of the image related time for searching, and events information for events each of which occurrence time belongs within the time range are extracted. The time range may be set as a proper time range which includes some future from the image related time, and/or some bygone days from the image related time. Alternatively, it may be set to a predetermined period wherein the image related time belongs in arbitrary time units on a calendar(for example, year, month, or day). In accordance with the former method, for example, the events information which indicates the events generated less than <b>3</b> months before the image related time, or the events generated within six months each before or after image related time may be searched. In accordance with the latter method, the events information which indicates events generated in the same A.D. annual as the image related time belonging year may be searched Since the events information after the image related time would be not amply accumulated in the system of this invention when using the system at a time relatively close to the image related time, it is desirable to set up and search the range of a proper period before the image related time. On the other hand, when using the printing system of this invention after passing to some extent from image related time, it is desirable to set up and search the range of a relatively extended period before and after the image related time, or the range of the same year or the same month that the image related time belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0170">As far as it is convenient on the operation of this printing system, arbitrary units can be adopted as the time unit for sorting the events by the occurrence time in the events information database <b>13</b>, as the time unit for specifying the image related time, and as the time unit for setting a searching time range in correlation with the image related time, and the respective time units may be set independently by using separate units. Usually, the occurrence time and the image related time are specified per day unit, and the searching time is set and fixed to one of a day unit, a month unit, and a year unit, or set so that the customer can select one of these unit arbitrarily. For example, then image related time is specified with Mar. 3, 1999, the event information whose generating day is on March 3 can be hit even then using any of year unit (1999), month unit (March, 1999), day unit (Mar. 3, 1999). The event information whose generating day is on March 10 can not be hit when using the day unit, while can be hit with the month unit and with the year unit The event information whose generating day is on May 3 can be hit only with the year unit.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0171">In the events information database <b>13</b>, when other classification items is adopted in addition to the occurrence time of the event, and events information are pluralistically classified or sorted with these items, events information can be pluralistically searched using two or more searching items corresponding to the classification items. Therefore, the event information whose occurrence time corresponds at image related time can be searched in each genre or categories. For example, even if the image related time to be used is the same, it is possible to extract only the event information in the entertainments category, or alternatively, only event information in the international political field. Further, it is possible to extract any events information regardless the genre, in spite of being classified pluralistically. Namely, searching with non genre can be performed in expectation of a result that two or more events information over a different field would be extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0172">When there are much hit number of events in searching, according to the priority assigned to events information individually in advance or according to the predetermined method for deciding priority of the extracted events information, one or several event information may be selected for image synthesis. Moreover, in order to cope with the case that there are much hit number of events in searching, an event information selecting means <b>15</b> can be provided to the system. When two or more events information is hit by the event information retrieval means <b>14</b>, the all of hit events information are displayed on the display means (not shown) or only several of hit events information are displayed by a selection according to the priority assigned to events information individually in advance or according to the predetermined method for deciding priority of the retrieved events information. The customer can choose freely 1 or two or more events information that he wishes to synthesize with his original image, from the displayed events information by using the event information selecting means <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0173">It is desirable to make the customer recognize the event information <b>18</b> which is extracted from the events information database <b>13</b> by the retrieval means <b>14</b>, and further optionally chosen by the event information selecting means <b>15</b>, by displaying the events information <b>18</b> on the display means (not shown), and it is more desirable to obtain the customer's confirmation of using the events information extracted or chosen to the image synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0174">The events information database <b>13</b> can be built in memory storage, such as a hard disk in a computer. Moreover, the event information retrieval means <b>14</b> and the event information selecting means <b>15</b> are realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory device and a hard disk, with the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0175">The event information <b>18</b> which is extracted by the event information retrieval means <b>14</b>, and optionally further chosen by the event information selecting means <b>15</b> is transmitted to the image editing means <b>9</b> (numeral <b>23</b>), and is synthesized with the original image. In the illustrated printing system <b>1</b>A, the image editing means <b>9</b> can perform various edits, such as synthesis with material images other than the event information such as a frame, expansion and reduction of image, besides addition of events information. That is, in this printing system <b>1</b>A, when the print mode which performs addition of events information or other image edits is chosen by the order inputting means (numeral <b>24</b>), or when being set up so that addition of events information or other image edits may be performed at anytimes, while the image data <b>17</b> of an original image is transmitted to the image editing means <b>9</b> (numeral <b>25</b>), the events information <b>18</b> (numeral <b>23</b>) and the other contents of edit (numeral <b>26</b>) are also transmitted to the image editing means <b>9</b> according to print mode and order contents. In the other material databases <b>10</b>, the data of material images other than events information, such as frame, are accumulated, and when a direction for synthesizing any material image other than event information with the original image is included in the edit contents, a material image is read from the other material database <b>10</b>, and transmitted to the image editing means <b>9</b> (numeral <b>27</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0176">The edit work by the image editing means <b>9</b> can be done with displaying the image in the middle of edit on the display means (not shown), and being checked The synthesizing position of the events information to the original image in the synthesized image is not particularly limited. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, the events information <b>31</b> can be given to the lower end (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) of the original image <b>30</b>, an upper end (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), right side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>), left side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>), the lower right side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>), etc. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, it is possible to synthesize events information with a frame so as to surround all the circumferences of an original image.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0177">Thus, the image data <b>19</b> as an edit image is generated by the image editing means <b>9</b>, and especially when the direction for adding events information is included in the print mode or order contents, the image data of the image plus event information is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0178">The image synthesizing means <b>9</b> is realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory and a hard disk, with the computer. Moreover, the other material databases <b>10</b> can be built in memory storage, such as a hard disk in the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0179">Next, the image data <b>19</b> of the edit image generated by the image editing means <b>9</b> is transmitted to the printing means <b>11</b>. However, when printing an original image as it is, not the image data <b>19</b> of an edit image but the image data <b>17</b> of an original image is transmitted to the printing means <b>11</b> as image data which should be output. Furthermore, other print conditions required in addition to the image data which specifies the image to be output, such as number of sheets, size, and paper to bee used are transmitted to the printing means <b>11</b> (numeral <b>28</b>). And the edited image or original image is printed as order by the printing means. Especially, when the direction of synthesizing the original image <b>30</b> and the events information <b>31</b> is included in print mode or order contents, according to the image data of the edit image generated with the image editing means <b>9</b>, the printed article <b>29</b> of the image plus event information is printed by the printing means <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0180">As a concrete outputting method of the printing device <b>11</b>, for example, an outputting method suitable for printing based on digital image data, such as the sublimation type thermal transfer method, the melting type thermal transfer method, and the ink jet, can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0181">In the image printing system of the present invention, a fee charging means <b>12</b> may be provided for collecting the fee for outputting and providing an image. In case the fee charging means is provided, the fee charging means is driven after driving the order content inputting device, more preferably after driving the Image editing means if the image editing is performed and before outputting a printed article by the drive of the printing means. While the fee collection means <b>12</b> of the terminal part <b>2</b> totals and collects the basic fee of print service, and the option service charge generated by the image editing means <b>9</b> or the printing means <b>11</b> which can be performed in the terminal part <b>2</b>, the charge of access to the event information retrieval means <b>14</b> currently installed in the events information service part <b>3</b> separated physically to the terminal part <b>2</b>, the charge of sort fee thereof, the data rental fee of the events information chosen by the event information selecting means <b>15</b>, etc. are managed and collected. The fee collection means <b>12</b> of the terminal part <b>2</b> may manage directly the expense generated by management of the events information service part <b>3</b>, and may collect it from the customer. Alternatively it is possible to establish the fee collection means <b>16</b> separately in the events information service part <b>3</b>, and the expense generated from the events information service part <b>3</b> is managed by the fee collection means <b>16</b> in the events information service part <b>3</b>. The fee collection means <b>12</b> of the terminal part <b>2</b> may be indirectly managed in response to directions from the fee collection means <b>16</b> about the expense generated within the events information service part <b>3</b>, and may carry out package collection of the expense generated within the terminal part <b>2</b> to the user, and the expense generated within the events information service part <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0182">It is preferable to show the amount to be collected by the fee charging means to a user on the display device (not shown) together with the order content. Particularly, at the printing system <b>1</b>A illustrated, since the events information service part <b>3</b> is constituted by the events information distribution server which an entrepreneur different from that of the post type image outputting apparatus as a terminal part <b>2</b> manages, after accessing the events information service part <b>3</b>, searching events information and events information's coming to hand, even if the customer stops edit of a image and the work of a print on the way, it is necessary to ask the customer for the expense generated in the events information service part <b>3</b>. Therefore, it is desirable to tell the customer about the information of the expense which will be charged even when a procedure is stopped on the way, while performing the procedure of this printing system at any time by the display means (not shown). The case where a user demands addition of events information, It is displayed that “the charge of access to a database, the charge of retrieval, and a data rental fee are needed separately. And, such expense generated by this option is charged even when you discontinue the print work.” or so. Further, it Is possible to display, “The charge of access occurred” etc., when a database is accessed, to display “The charge of retrieval occurs” etc., when starting retrieval, and to display “A data rental fee occurs” etc., when taking in events information in the terminal part <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0183">When the customer inserts a bill and/or a coin in the fee charging means according to the guide of the amount display by the display device, the fee charging means calculates the accepted amount and returns the change if any.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0184">The fee collection means <b>12</b> of the terminal part <b>2</b> can be constituted combining suitably a coin and bill discernment device, change return device, the computer that manages a fee collection state. Since the fee collection means <b>16</b> of the events information service part <b>3</b> functions only for managing the total of a charge and the collection situation by the fee collection means <b>12</b>, and it is not necessary to do collection work, it is realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory and a hard disk, with the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0185">A receipt producing means may be provided in the fee charging means. The receipt producing means automatically produces the receipt having the collected amount and the order content printed thereon after completing the fee collection by the fee charging means. The receipt producing means may further comprise a receipt producing eliminating means so that the producing of the receipt can be eliminated selectively in case the customer does not need the receipt. In this case, after completing the collection of the fee, an operation guidance “Would you like a receipt published?” or the like is displayed on the display device (not shown) so that the user presses a corresponding touch panel button or keyboard for executing the choice of producing or not producing.</p>

When there are no directions of edit in order contents as image datum to be output, the static image datum <b>121</b> is recognized as image datum <b>124</b> to be output as it is. When directions of edit are included in order contents, according to the concrete contents of edit, the static image datum <b>121</b> synthesizes with materials, such as a frame, or two or more static images are arranged on the screen of one sheet for synthesizing a preview image, and expansion, movement, rotation, modification, or other processings of image are performed. Thus, the image data <b>124</b> to be output is edited. As conditions which accompany to the image data to be output, directions for use of print number of sheets and use of the mount for pre-cut seals etc. are included, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0285">The generated output content designation data <b>123</b> is transmitted to the printing means <b>115</b>, the print of a image is performed here, and the printed article <b>119</b> of a shot image is obtained.</p>

The enjoyableness of this printing system may increase when including the image pick-up apparatus which can photograph a dynamic image in addition to the reading apparatus of recording media in the image data inputting means <b>126</b>. It is preferable to include a plurality of reading devices of different kinds in the image data inputting means <b>126</b> in order to improve the applicability of the dynamic shot printing apparatus of the present invention. Moreover, the image data inputting means <b>126</b> may be equipped with the function of both a dynamic image data inputting means and a static image data inputting means. That is, an image data inputting means enables not only to receive the input of a dynamic image, but also to receive the input of a static image such as the photograph image photographed by a digital camera, an illustration created by computer graphics, and to process them like the static image data specified from the dynamic image in the subsequent process, and may enable it to create a printed article.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0305">The order contents about the image to be output are input into this printing system <b>102</b> by using the order inputting means <b>113</b>. The alternatives of order contents are prepared in advance at the printing system side, the customer can choose freely any order from the prepared items. It is desirable to show a customer the order contents which can be chosen on a display means (not shown), and to guide input operation of order contents. As a display means, although CRT, a liquid crystal panel, etc. are used commonly, it may be simpler one like the bulletin board which itemized the operation method.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0306">In the alternatives of order contents, for example, those of specifying the image to be output, such as an option for which scene in a dynamic image to be printed, an option for which the specified scene (static image) should be printed as it is or should be further processed, or an option for how the static image should be processed, and those of appertained to the image datum when shot image is printed, such as decisions of the print number of sheets, print size, or using or not using a particular print like a pre-cut seal, etc., may be included.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0307">Order contents may be input at any time according to advance of operation after starting operation of this printing system until print-out is completed. For example, since the indication about the printing the read image as it is, or after processing, and the indication about the particular printing such as pre-cut seal, etc., would belong to the alternatives in the main menu, they would be input at the time of starting of this printing system operation. The determination of which scene in a dynamic image to print would be input after reading a dynamic image data into this printing system. The direction of how to process the specified static image data would be input after specifying static image data. Further, the setting of print number of sheet would be input after processing of static image data and the image datum to be output is produced or after the static image datum itself is recognized as the datum to be output Therefore, the order inputting means <b>113</b> is performed at any time if needed in the operation process of this printing system.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0308">As the order content inputting device <b>113</b>, for example, various kinds of pointers such as a touch panel provided integrally with a display device such as a CRT, and a liquid crystal panel, a keyboard, a mouse, and a track ball, can be used. Moreover, the DPOF function (digital print order format) provided in a digital camera can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0309">When a dynamic image data <b>120</b> is input, the static image data specifying means <b>112</b> is performed in this printing system <b>102</b>, and the static image datum <b>121</b> which records the image used as a shot image to be output or to be used as its material is specified from of the countless scene included in a dynamic image. The static image data specifying means <b>112</b> is operated by inputting any required directions from the order inputting means <b>113</b>. The static image data specifying means <b>112</b> is equipped with the dynamic image viewing means <b>128</b> for reproducing a dynamic image normally to display the contents on a dynamic image display part (not shown), and the static image selection means <b>129</b> which can choose any desirable scene arbitrarily while checking the contents of a dynamic image with the dynamic image viewing means <b>128</b>. In addition, when there is no reference especially in this description and claims, reproduction of a dynamic image should be understood as a concept also including reverse reproduction (reproduction with rewinding).</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0310">The dynamic image viewing means <b>128</b> may be provided with a playback speed control means <b>128</b><i>a </i>which can change playback speed into a slow motion or frame-by-frame advance to arbitrary timing during reproduction of a dynamic image. A best shot can be easily chosen by reducing the playback speed of a dynamic image by the playback speed control means when the dynamic image reaches a little before the best shot, and pushing the selection button as a static image selection means <b>129</b> when the image of a best shot is displayed on a dynamic image display part. It is further desirable that the playback speed control means further has a fast-forward and/or fast-rewind functions since the reproduction time of an unnecessary portion can be omitted or shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0311">Moreover, the dynamic image viewing means <b>128</b> may be provided with a photographic playback producing means <b>128</b><i>b </i>which can change the dynamic image under reproduction into photographic playback at a choice timing. When the button as photographic playback producing means <b>128</b><i>b </i>is pushed at the arbitrary times while reproducing the dynamic image, the dynamic image stops at the time when the button is pushed, and a photographic playback is displayed by package at the dynamic image display part (not shown). The photographic playback includes a series of picture frames within a predetermined time range or of a predetermined number of frames which starting point, middle point, or end point is based on the time when the button is pushed. Each picture frame of the photographic playback displayed at the dynamic image display part serves as a touch panel, and after the customer touches and specifies a position to be desired, by pushing the button as a static image selection means <b>129</b>, a best shot can be chosen easily.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0312">Moreover, the dynamic image viewing means <b>128</b> may be provided with an pausing means <b>128</b><i>c </i>which can stop the dynamic image under reproduction to arbitrary timing. If the button as pausing means <b>128</b><i>c </i>was pushed when a best shot was displayed on the dynamic image display part(not shown), a dynamic image stops at the time when the button is pushed, and a best shot is fixed. Thus, a best shot can be easily chosen by pushing the selection button as a static image selection means <b>129</b> in the state.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0313">Static image data can be more easily chosen now by combining any two or all of playback speed control means <b>128</b><i>a</i>, photographic playback producing means <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and the pausing means <b>128</b><i>c</i>. The case where playback speed control means <b>128</b><i>a </i>and pausing means <b>128</b><i>c </i>are combined is especially preferable, since a best shot can be particularly easily chosen by reducing the playback speed of a dynamic image by the playback speed control means <b>128</b><i>a </i>when the dynamic image reaches a little before the best shot, and then the best shot was hold by pushing the pausing means <b>128</b><i>c </i>so as to pause the replay of a dynamic image, and the hold best shot is fixed by pushing the selection button as a static image selection means <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0314">In addition, when the timing which operates the static image selection means <b>129</b> shifts, it is possible to redo any number of times and the static image data of a best shot is able to be chosen until it canceled the static image data chosen accidentally and went satisfactorily, it can specify as static image data which should be delivered to a output content designation data producing means to mentioned below. In this case, after rewinding a dynamic image to a suitable scene, the same operation as the above may be repeated, or reverse reproduction, an reverse slow motion, or frame-by-frame back is performed, and a best shot may be displayed, optionally by making it stop by the pausing means, and it can be chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0315">As for the static image data specifying means <b>112</b>, it is desirable to have further the static image data accumulation means <b>130</b> which can accumulate two or more static image data When the static image data specifying means <b>112</b> is equipped with the static image data accumulation means <b>130</b>, the candidate of the static image to be output as the shot image, or used as its material can be chosen one after another, it accumulates temporarily, and after that, each candidate Is fully compared and, finally the most desirable static image datum can be specified. Moreover, the package print of the shot image of two or more scenes can also be carried out in one procedure by accumulating two or more static image data in the static image data accumulation means <b>130</b>, and processing whole accumulated data in parallel at the editing means and the printing means mentioned below. Moreover, it can arrange on one screen all static image data accumulated in the static image data accumulation means <b>130</b>, then the preview image are edited, and the edited preview image can be printed by the printing means.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0316">It is desirable to prepare preview display means <b>130</b><i>b </i>which displays the image of the accumulated static image data on the static image data accumulation means <b>130</b>, and to enable it to check an accumulation situation easily.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0317">Usually, the static image data accumulation means <b>130</b> accumulates two or more static image data with attaching accumulation ranking which is given according to the ascending order of the specific time of static image data It becomes easy to access each accumulated static image data by attaching accumulation ranking according to the specific time of static image data. Moreover, while reproducing a dynamic image, when two or more static image is specified one after another and are accumulated in order according to the ascending order of the specific time of the static image, each scene in a dynamic image comes to arrange along time series. Thus, it is possible to prepare a playback photography by arranging the static images in order of accumulation.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0318">The static image data accumulation means <b>130</b> may be provided with an accumulation adjustment means <b>130</b><i>a </i>which can delete some or all of static image data or change the accumulation ranking. By establishing such an accumulation adjustment means, substitution of the accumulated static image data becomes easy. Particularly, since only a static image with a bad relation condition with the scene of order can be easily substituted when editing the preview image of playback photography, it is far efficient rather than it redoes the selection work of static image data from the start. Furthermore, according to the accumulation adjustment means, since it is possible to arrange each static image in an order which is not related to a motion of an actual dynamic image, it is possible to produce a preview image which has an unique characteristic distinct from the playback photograph of dynamic image wherein each scene is arranged along the time series.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0319">It is desirable to add to the accumulation adjustment means <b>130</b><i>a </i>a function which can give arbitrary accumulation ranking when choosing new static image data. When accumulation adjustment means <b>130</b><i>a </i>has such a function, the newly chosen static image data can be directly inserted in arbitrary accumulation ranking in a relation with 1 or more static image data which have already been accumulated.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0320">The static image data specifying means <b>112</b> containing the dynamic image viewing means <b>128</b>, the static image selection means <b>129</b>, and static image data accumulation means <b>130</b> are realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory and a hard disk, with the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0321">If required order contents are input into this printing system <b>102</b> by the order inputting means <b>113</b> while 1 or more static image data <b>121</b> are specified by the static image data specifying means <b>112</b>, the output content designation data producing means <b>114</b> will be performed. Consequently, based on some of static image data <b>121</b> and order contents <b>122</b>, the output content designation data <b>123</b> which comprises the image data <b>124</b> to be output and the data <b>125</b> which recorded the other appendix conditions would generate.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0322">Here, as the additional new order content which are input in order to generate the output content designation data, there are the concrete contents of edit for processing print number of sheets and static image data, for example. The directions about the trimming of a image, expansion/reduction, synthesis with the material of a frame or others, the whole layout, etc. are included in the contents of edit. The appendix conditions <b>125</b> which accompany the image data to be output are contents which is necessary for directing with image data to a printing means so that a printed article is outputted as order, and for example, items, such as a kind of print number of sheets, size, and paper, are included.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0323">The static image data <b>121</b> and the order contents <b>122</b> transmitted to the output content designation data producing means <b>114</b>, when the directions which should process a static image are included in order contents, are delivered to the editing means <b>131</b> with which the output content designation data producing means <b>114</b> was equipped, and edition is performed, and the image data <b>124</b> recorded in the image to be output generates. When the directions which should print the static image recorded on the static image data specified as order contents by the above mentioned static image data specifying means <b>112</b> as it is are included, the static image data <b>121</b> itself is recognized as image data <b>124</b> which records the image to be output at the output content designation data producing means <b>114</b>. Moreover, some order contents are recognized as conditions <b>125</b> which accompany the image data <b>124</b> to be output.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0324">The editing means <b>131</b> is realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory and a hard disk, by computer. Moreover, the materials, such as a frame design which is synthesized with the a static image in edition, can accumulate in a material database which can construct in memory storage, such as a hard disk of a computer. When an advanced edit function is not required to the dynamic image shot printing system of this invention, and only to choose a best shot from a dynamic image, and to print it as it is required, the editing means <b>131</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0325">The output content designation data <b>123</b> generated by the output content designation data producing means <b>114</b> is transmitted to the printing means <b>115</b>, and a shot image is printed as order. As the concrete output method of the printing means <b>115</b>, for example, an outputting method suitable for printing based on digital image data, such as the sublimation type thermal transfer method, the melting type thermal transfer method, and the ink jet, can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0326">In the image printing system <b>102</b> of the present invention, a fee charging means <b>132</b> may be provided for collecting the fee for outputting and providing an image. In case the fee charging means is provided, the fee charging means is driven after driving the order content inputting device, more preferably after driving the image editing means <b>131</b> if the image editing is performed and before outputting a printed article by the drive of the printing means <b>115</b>. It is preferable to show the amount to be collected by the fee charging means to a user on the display device (not shown) together with the order content.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0327">When the customer inserts a bill and/or a coin in the fee charging means according to the guide of the amount display by the display device, the fee charging means calculates the accepted amount and returns the change if any.</p>

In the pre-cut seal, a plurality of small screens (frames) of the same image are printed, with each small screen divided by half cut.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0356">In case the “certification photograph” is selected, an image for the certification photograph is taken by a digital camera in the store so as to be stored In a flexible disc, and then, the stored image data are read out by the main body so that they can be printed out after selecting the size from the driver's license size, the curriculum vitae size, the passport size, and the visa size, and selecting color or monochrome.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0357">In case the “post card print” is selected, a print can be provided by reading the dynamic or static image data from a smart medium, a CF card, a flexible disc (FD), a PC card, or a CD-ROM, or reading the image data from a printed article such as a photograph using a scanner, producing the postcard data by processing the read out image, and reading the postcard data from the recording medium storing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0358">First, the procedure in case the “digital photo” is selected will be explained. In the main menu screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.9</figref>, if the “digital photo” position is touched by a hand, the “digital photo” procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</figref> is started (S<b>201</b>), In each operation screen to be indicated after the start of the “digital photo” procedure, in principle, a “cancel” button and a “return to the previous screen” button are provided so that it can return to the start screen by pressing the “cancel” button, and it can return to the operation screen of the previous step by pressing the “return to the previous screen” button so as to enable change of the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0359">In case the “digital photo” procedure is started, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the operation screen which designates the kind of original data is displayed, and either a static image or the dynamic images can be designated (S<b>202</b>). The message of “please designate the kind of data to be input” is shown laterally in the uppermost row in the operation screen at this time, and therebelow each touch-panel button of a “static image” and an “dynamic image” are perpendicularly arranged, and “cancel” button and the button “return to previous menu” are provided in the lowermost row.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0360">When a dynamic image data is designated in this screen, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, the operation screen of the sub menu which asks which shall be created between a standard print and a preview print will be displayed (S<b>203</b>). In the operation screen at this time, the message of “Standard print or preview print?” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and therebelow, each touch-panel button of a “standard print”, “preview print (quadrisection screens)”, and “a preview print (16 section screens)” are arranged perpendicularly, and “cancel” button and the “return to previous menu” button are provided in the lowermost row.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0361">Here, a standard print prints one shot image on one screen On the other hand, a preview print prints two or more shot images on one screen wherein the images are put in order, and for example, the continuation photographic playback showing a decomposed swing operation of golf may correspond to this type. Although a preview print are used as 4 section screen or 16 section screen as shown in the operation screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, the number of section screen can be arbitrarily changed into a printing system by setup.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0362">In this screen, if one of print form is designated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, an operation screen with the image data reading sources shown is indicated so that a reading source can be selected (S<b>204</b>). In the operation screen at the time, the message “please select the medium for input from those shown below” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and therebelow, the touch panel buttons each with the name of the smart medium, the compact flash card (CF card), the flexible disc, the PC card, and the CD-ROM are shown. In the operation screen shown in FIG. <b>53</b>., when a static image is chosen as original data, the touch-panel button which attached the name of a photograph (scanner) is displayed further In the operation screen, in case a touch panel button is touched by a hand, the corresponding reading source is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0363">If any of the reading sources is selected from the smart medium, the CF card, the flexible disc, the PC card, and the CD-ROM, the operation screen showing the inserting method corresponding to the selected recording medium is indicated so that the recording medium can be inserted and the dynamic image can be read out (S<b>205</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0364">In the operation screen in case the smart medium is selected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the message “please set the smart medium and press the reading start” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and a “reading start” button is provided in the lowermost row together with the “cancel” button and the “return to the previous screen” button. Similarly, in case the CF card is selected, the operation screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> appears. In case the flexible disc is selected, the operation screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> appears. In case the PC card is selected, the operation screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> appears. And in case the CD-ROM is selected, the operation screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> appears.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0365">In case a recording medium is inserted in the predetermined insertion port according to the guidance of the operation screen and the reading start button on the touch panel is touched by a hand, the insertion port with the recording medium inserted Is closed by the shutter so as to start the reading operation of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0366">After reading of a dynamic image data is completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the operation screen which specifies a best shot from the countless scene included in the dynamic image appears, and static image data can be chosen (S<b>206</b>). The operation screen at this time is divided into right and left. On the left-hand side of the operation screen, the dynamic image display screen which replays a dynamic image, the scale in which the display position (relative lapsed time to all reproduction time) of a dynamic image, and the touch-panel button group for directing reproduction of a dynamic image and selection of static image data was perpendicularly arranged, and on the right-hand, the preview screen which indicates by list the scene (static image) and touch-panel button group for performing choice of selected static image data and making a change of accumulation ranking is perpendicularly arranged. The “Determination” button, as well as the “return to the previous screen” button and the “cancel” button is provided to the lowermost row of an operation screen.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0367">In this operation screen, if the replay button is pushed, the dynamic image will be reproduced on a dynamic image display screen, and if the reverse button will be pushed, reverse play will be carried out. The slow button makes playback speed late and the reverse slow button makes reverse play speed late The frame-advance button playback each scene of a dynamic image frame-by-frame, the frame-back button returns each scene of a dynamic image frame-by-frame. The fast-forward button playback the dynamic image at high speed and the fast-rewind button reverse the dynamic image at high speed. The pause button makes a dynamic image temporary stop, and fixes one scene, and displays it on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0368">The photographic playback button make a display of photographic playback which displays several frames of scene continuously wherein a scene reproduced when the button concerned Is pushed becomes the basal frame, namely, as the starting point, the middle point, or the terminal point and it is in the form of continuation photographic playback. The usual reproduction will be resumed if the replay button is operated after operating the photographic playback button and displaying the photographic playback. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, when the scene of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> is reproduced by the dynamic image display screen, the photographic playback button is operated, and several scenes before and after the scene of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> are displayed by making the scene of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> into a middle point.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0369">When a best shot appears on a dynamic image display screen, the static image data of a best shot can be chosen by operating the selection button. Usually, after pushing a pause button and fixing the image of a wish when it is made a slow motion and frame-by-frame advance and a best shot appears further if a reproduction button and a fast forward button are pushed, a dynamic image is reproduced and the scene of a best shot is approached, the static image data of a best shot can be easily chosen by pushing a selection button. When the reproduction screen has passed the best shot, it can wait to rewind by the inversion button or the rewind button, to make inversion speed late with a reverse slow button or a top return button if needed, and for a best shot to return. Moreover, when continuation photographic playback as shown in a dynamic image display screen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> is displayed, the surface of each photographic playback is a touch panel, and after touching and specifying a hand to be a favorite top, static image data can be chosen by touching a selection button.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0370">A list of the static image which are selected by the operation of the selection button, chose and was accumulated is given on the preview screen in right-hand side. Early accumulation ranking is given to the selected order and each static image data is arranged in the direction of the right from the left in the uppermost row of a preview screen, henceforth, lowers the stage and is arranged rightward from the left one by one. In printing a preview image, the arrangement displayed on this preview screen turns into arrangement of each picture frame in a preview image as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0371">Each static image data which the selection button was operated and was chosen is in the state still accumulated temporarily. The frame of each static image arranged on the preview screen is in function to a touch-panel button, and can be deleted by touching and specifying a hand to be the frame of a static image which is not pleased, and touching a deletion button (S<b>207</b>, S<b>208</b>, S<b>209</b>). Moreover, by touching and specifying a hand to be a frame to make it move, touching an insertion button and touching the frame in the ranking of a change place with a hand after that changing an accumulation order, other frame advance according to movement of the specified frame by the ability making it move to the change place of a wish of the specified frame, or it winds and falls (S<b>210</b>, S<b>211</b>, S<b>212</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0372">Moreover, after making the deletion and ranking change of static image data which are accumulated, additional selection of the still newer static image data can be carried out (S<b>213</b>). The direct addition of the static image data can be carried out at the accumulation ranking of a wish by pushing an insertion button first, touching the frame in ranking adding to the next with a hand, and specifying an additional position, and operating a selection button, and choosing new static image data to add static image data to predetermined accumulation ranking directly.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0373">Thus, if choice of static image data and correction of accumulation ranking end, a determination button is pushed and static image data is specified (S<b>214</b>). Although static image data can be accumulated until fill the preview screen, it is not necessary to accumulate until it fills. Even when a standard print is specified in the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, two or more static image data can be specified, in that case, the parallel processing of two or more static image data is carried out in a following process, and the shot image from which a scene differs can be printed as an independent printed article. Moreover, when a preview print (four section screens) or a preview print (16 section screens) is specified in the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, several number of the specified static image data can be accumulated. For example, when a preview print (four split screens) is specified, static image data can be accumulated to four.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0374">When static image data is specified, operation screens as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> appear and being able to check the image to be output, print number of sheets is specified (S<b>301</b>, S<b>302</b>). When a standard print Is designated in the operation screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, the operation screen which indicated the thumb nail image of all the specified static images by the list appears.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0375">In the operation screen at the time, the message “please select the image to be printed, and input the number of prints” is shown laterally In the uppermost row, and therebelow, total 6 thumb nail images are shown in the two rows laterally, with the column for inputting the number of prints provided to each thumb nail image. Below the thumb nail images, “+” and “−” buttons for increasing or reducing the number of prints, and “+” and “−” buttons for the total images are provided. By selecting a thumb nail image on the screen for selecting the image, and touching the “+” and “−” buttons for the “selected image”, the number of prints for the selected image can be increased or reduced individually. In contrast, by touching the “+” and “−” buttons for the total images, the number of prints can be increased or reduced for all the images displayed on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0376">In case the number of the thumb nail images so large than they cannot be shown on one screen, all the thumb nail images are shown, divided in a plurality of pages. The page number currently appearing on the screen and triangular scroll buttons for moving forward or backward among the pages are displayed on the screen in the same row as the buttons for increasing or reducing the number of prints. Moreover, in the lowermost row of the operation screen at the time, a “determination” button is provided together with the “cancel” button and the “return to the previous stage” button. By selecting the images to be printed in the operation screen, setting the number of prints for each image, and pressing the determination button, the order content is set.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0377">On the other hand, when a preview print is specified in the operation screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, as shown In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, the preview image to be output is displayed. In addition, the preview image of four split screens is displayed in this example. In the operation screen at the time, the message “please input the number of prints” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and therebelow, a preview screen of 4 section screen are shown, and below the 4 section screen, “+” and “−” buttons for increasing or reducing the number of prints, and the column for inputting the number of prints is provided. In the lowermost row of the operation screen at the time, a “determination” button is provided together with the “cancel” button and the “return to the previous stage” button. By setting the number of prints, and pressing the determination button, the order content is set.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0378">When the order content is set, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the guidance screen for charging the fee appears for executing the fee charging process (S<b>303</b>). In the guidance screen for the fee charging process, the message “please insert money” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and therebelow, the number of order, the fee for one sheet (unit price), the total amount (sum of the charged amount), and the inserted fee (inserted amount) are shown laterally from above successively in fourth rows. When the amount inserted in the coin insertion port and/or the bill insertion port according to the explanation on the guidance screen reaches or exceeds the total charged amount, in case it is a mode for only confirming the total amount, the change is discharged from the change discharging port as needed, and the guidance screen for requesting the fee charge content appears as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. In the guidance screen at the time, the message “if it is okay, please press the confirmation button” Is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and therebelow, the number of order, the fee for one sheet, and the total amount are shown laterally from above successively in three rows. In the lowermost row, the “confirmation” button is provided together with the “cancel” button and the “return to the previous screen” button. In the guidance screen, in case the confirmation button is touched, the fee charging process is completed so as to move to the next step.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0379">When the fee charging process is completed, the fee receipt is published so as to be discharged from the receipt outlet port (S<b>304</b>). After producing the receipt, the operation screen for removing the recording medium, which is the reading source of the image data, appears, and furthermore, in case the recording medium is inserted In the reading machine, the shutter of the insertion port is opened (S<b>305</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, in the operation screen in case the smart medium Is inserted, the message “please remove the smart medium and press the printing start” is shown laterally, and the “printing start” button is provided in the lowermost row. Similarly, in case the CF card is inserted, the operation screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> appears. In case the flexible disc is inserted, the operation screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> appears. In case the PC card is inserted, the operation screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> appears. And in case the CD-ROM is inserted, the operation screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> appears.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0380">In case the recording medium inserted in the reading machine is removed and the printing start button is touched according to the guidance on the operation screen, the printing is started by the printer installed in the post type image output means (S<b>306</b>). During the printing process, the guidance screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> appears. In the guidance screen at the time, the message “now printing” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, therebelow, the image being printed is shown, and below the image, a time line roughly indicating the proceeding state of the printing process is lit. When the printing process is finished, the printed article of the shot image is discharged from the printed article outlet port (standard printing) of the main body, and the finish screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> appears. The finish screen in the meantime returns to the start screen.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0381">In addition, when a static image is specified as original data in the operation screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, all the static images currently recorded on recording media are read, and an operation screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> appears, it is indicated by list in the form of the thumb nail image, a image to print is chosen, and print number of sheets can be specified for every image.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0382">Next, the procedure at the time of choosing “frame synthesis” is explained. If the position of “frame synthesis” is touched with a hand in the main menu screen of above mentioned view <b>9</b>, the procedure of “frame synthesis” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> will start (S<b>401</b>). In addition, if the button will return to a start screen and “will return to a before screen” if “cancel” button and the button “return to the previous screen” are prepared for each operation screen displayed after the procedure of “frame synthesis” started in principle and “cancel” button is pushed is pushed, it can return to the operation screen in front of 1 stage, and operation can be redone.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0383">If the procedure of “frame synthesis” starts, as shown in the view <b>53</b> as stated above, the operation screen which specifies the kind of original data is displayed, and either a static image or the dynamic images can be specified (S<b>402</b>). If a dynamic image data is specified in this screen, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, the operation screen which enumerated image data's reading origin is displayed, and either reading origin can be chosen (S<b>403</b>). In addition, although the operation screen of view <b>54</b> is omitted in this example since only a standard print can be performed in the procedure of “frame synthesis”, it can also set up so that a preview image can be edited in the procedure of frame synthesis. In this operation screen, if one of touch-panel buttons is touched, reading origin will be chosen, recording media can be inserted and reading of a dynamic image data will be performed (S<b>404</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0384">After reading of a dynamic image data is completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the operation screen which specifies a best shot from the countless scene included in the dynamic image appears, and static image data can be chosen (S<b>405</b>-S<b>413</b>). The process which specifies this static image data is the same in the procedure of a digital photograph.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0385">If static image data is specified, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the operation screen which enumerated frames is displayed, and one of frames can be chosen (S<b>414</b>). In the operation screen at this time, the message of “please choose a favorite frame design” is laterally written by the uppermost row, below this massage, the frame designs are enumerated, and “cancel” button, the button “return to previous screen”, the “expansion display” button, and “determination” button are provided in the lowermost row. A frame design is called from a material database and displayed on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0386">In case the enlarged display button is touched after touching one of a frame displayed on the screen, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the enlarged image of the selected frame is shown. In the operation screen at the time, the message “if it is okay, please press the confirmation button” is shown laterally in the uppermost row, and below the message, the enlarged frame design is shown. In the lowermost row, the “confirmation button” is provided together with the “cancel” button, and the “return to the previous screen” button. In case the customer does not like the enlarged frame, by touching the return to the previous screen button, the screen with the frames listed can be shown so that another frame can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0387">In case the determination button is touched immediately after selecting the frame in the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, or in case the confirmation button is touched after indicating the enlarged image in the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the frame to be used is set. In addition, when “no frame” is chosen in the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, since it becomes the procedure of performing the usual print of a digital photograph,the screen immediately shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0388">If a frame is decided, while an operation screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> will appear and the synthesized image will be displayed, the size and the position of a static image and a frame can be adjusted (S<b>415</b>, S<b>416</b>). The operation screen at this time is divided into right and left, on the left-hand side of the operation screen concerned, the message of “please adjust the position and size of a image according to a design” is laterally written in the uppermost row, the edit screen which displays the synthesized image of the static Image data and the frame which have been set as the object of edit on the message bottom is prepared, and the touch-panel button group of expansion reduction and movement is prepared in the bottom of it. On the other hand, the preview screen of a synthesized image is displayed on the right-hand side of an operation screen Furthermore, “cancel” button, the “return to the previous screen” button, the button “reset”, and the “confirmation” button are prepared in the lowermost row.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0389">In this operation screen, each frame of a preview screen serves as a touch panel, if hands are touched and specified to be one of frames, it can be displayed on an edit screen, and the size of the read image can be changed by touching expansion or reduction button can be changed. Thus, the image can fit with a frame, and the position of a image can be adjust with a frame by touching each vertical and horizontal move button. If the reset button Is touched, it will return to original image size and an original position. By repeating similar operation. The edition work can be separately done about each static image data. However, it is also possible to set up so that any one may be made into representation and Image edition may be performed thereto, when two or more static image data is accumulated. Such a setup is effective when synthesizing a frame for each frame of a preview image including the seal print mentioned especially later.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0390">If a synthesized image is decided, while the operation screen same with being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> appears and being able to check the image to be output, print number of sheets can be set up (S<b>301</b>, S<b>302</b>). After this, the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> similarly in the procedure of a digital photograph is performed, and the printed article of the shot image which synthesized the frame is obtained (S<b>303</b>-S<b>306</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0391">Next, the procedure at the time of choosing a “seal” is explained. If the position of a “seal” is touched with a hand in the above mentioned main menu screen, the procedure of a “seal” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> will start (S<b>501</b>), and the pre-cut seal divided into two or more small screens will be obtained. In addition, in each operation screen to be indicated after the start of the “seal” procedure, in principle, a “cancel” button and a “return to the previous screen” button are provided so that it can return to the start screen by pressing the “cancel” button, and it can return to the operation screen of the previous step by pressing the “return to the previous screen” button so as to enable change of the operation.</p>
