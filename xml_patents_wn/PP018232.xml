<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Title: Poinsettia Plant Named ‘PER <b>1904’. Application: Ruth Kobayashi; filed concurrently (U.S. Plant patent application Ser. No. </b>11/483,222).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Poinsettia plant, botanically known as <i>Euphorbia pulcherrima </i>Willd., and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘PER2004’.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The new Poinsettia a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Encinitas, Calif. The objective of the breeding program is to create new Poinsettia cultivars having flower bracts with desirable colors, uniform plant habit and excellent post-production longevity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The new Poinsettia is a naturally-occurring branch mutation of the <i>Euphorbia pulcherrima </i>Willd. cultivar PER1072, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 15,883. The cultivar PER2004 was discovered and selected by the Inventor from within a population of plants of ‘PER1072’ in a controlled environment in Encinitas, Calif. in December, 2003.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Asexual reproduction of the new Poinsettia by terminal vegetative cuttings in a controlled environment in Encinitas, Calif. has shown that the unique features of this new Poinsettia are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cultivar PER2004 has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, daylength and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘PER2004’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘PER2004’ as a new and distinct cultivar of Poinsettia:

    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">1. Uniform, upright and mounded plant habit.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">2. Freely branching habit.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">3. Recurved dark green-colored leaves.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">4. Mid-season flowering response; under natural season conditions, plants flower in about 7.5 weeks in Encinitas, Calif.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0014">5. Inflorescences with pink and creamy white bi-colored flower bracts that are recurved.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0015">6. Excellent post-production longevity.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Encinitas, Calif., plants of the new Poinsettia differed from plants of the parent, the cultivar PER1072, primarily in flower bract color as plants of the cultivar PER1072 had dark red-colored flower bracts.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Encinitas, Calif., plants of the new Poinsettia differed from plants the cultivar PER1904, primarily in flower bract color as plants of the cultivar PER1904 had pink-colored flower bracts.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">Plants of the new Poinsettia can be compared to plants of the Poinsettia cultivar Eckaddis, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 12,782. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Encinitas, Calif., plants of the new Poinsettia differed from plants of the cultivar Eckaddis in the following characteristics:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">1. Plants of the new Poinsettia were more compact than plants of the cultivar Eckaddis.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">2. Plants of the new Poinsettia flowered about two weeks earlier than plants of the cultivar Eckaddis grown under natural season conditions.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0021">3. Plants of the new Poinsettia and the cultivar Eckaddis differed in flower bract coloration as plants of the cultivar Eckaddis had pink-colored flower bracts.</li>

<p id="p-0017" num="0025">In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe plants grown in Encinitas, Calif. during the winter in a polyethylene-covered greenhouse and under conditions and practices which approximate those generally used in commercial Poinsettia production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures averaged 24° C., night averaged 19° C. and light levels were about 4,000 foot-candles. Measurements and numerical values represent averages for typical flowering plants. Single plants were grown in 16.5-cm pots and pinched one time. Plants were about 19 weeks old when the photographs and the detailed description were taken.
