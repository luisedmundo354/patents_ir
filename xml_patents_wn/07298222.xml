No. 11/096,214, entitled “Systems and Methods for Automatic Quadrature Phase Imbalance Compensation Using a Delay Locked Loop,” filed Mar. 31, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,123,103, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The device and methods described herein relate generally to transceivers requiring precision quadrature local oscillator (LO) signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many communications standards, for example, 802.11a/b/g for WLAN and DVBS2 for Digital Satellite TV, demand fully integrated transmitter and receiver architectures offering high performance at low cost. Direct conversion receivers and image-reject receivers are examples of such architectures. In these architectures, excellent phase and amplitude balance are critical to prevent quadrature inaccuracy from limiting the overall performance. In particular, inaccuracy in the phase and amplitude balance can result in poor image rejection.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a receiver, image rejection refers to the receiver's ability to reject signals at its image frequency. In a transmitter, poor image rejection can produce an image signal that falls within the receive band of adjacent channels, which will interfere with devices operating on the adjacent channels. The image and desired inputs both mix with the Local Oscillator (LO) signal and are downconverted to the same frequency. This poses a problem in conventional double-balanced mixers because the two downconverted products interfere with each other, since they exit at the Intermediate Frequency (IF) output port together. Image rejection is thus defined as the ratio of the downconverted image signal power exiting at the IF output port, to that of the desired signal, exiting the same IF output port. For example, if the downconverted image and desired signal levels at are −30 dBm and −10 dBm respectively, then the image rejection is 20 dB. As mentioned, good image rejection requires close amplitude and phase matching.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional double-balanced mixers use filters to block the image from entering the mixer. This prevents the mixer from generating a down-converted image signal. It will be understood, however, that as the IF is reduced, the desired and image signals move closer together in frequency, converging on the LO frequency, which limits the effectiveness of filtering and/or increases the complexity and cost of filtering solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In comparison to conventional double-balanced mixers, image-rejection mixers, for example, achieve image-rejection through phase cancellation, not filtering, so the frequency spacing between the image and desired inputs can be negligible. Conventional image rejection receivers can achieve an image rejection ratio in the range of approximately 20-30 dB, which corresponds to a phase imbalance that can be as high as 10°. The standards referred to above, however, can require a phase accuracy of better than 1°. For example, such standards can require 60 dB of image rejection, which can require a phase imbalance that is as precise as 0.1°.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Phase accuracy in conventional receivers is often limited by the on-chip matching of devices within the quadrature generation circuit. Careful layout can help minimize phase inaccuracy; however, typical performance with good matching is still typically limited to ±3°. This corresponds to an Image Rejection Ratio (IRR) of less than 30 dB, which often results in a corrupted signal constellation and high bit error rate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Given the mismatch limitations of conventional designs, successful implementation of the architectures referred to above requires additional phase calibration either inside the tuner included in the RF front end or inside the baseband demodulator circuit. Many conventional designs use the later approach to address the phase imbalance issue. The problem with such solutions, however, is that the RF front end and the baseband demodulator circuit are often produced by two different entities. As a result, the designer of the RF front end is faced with a dilemma. The designer can assume that the baseband circuit will include the requisite compensation and not include any compensation in the RF front end. But if the baseband circuit does not include sufficient compensation, then the receiver will not perform adequately. Thus, it can be preferable for the RF front end to include the requisite compensation, because it makes the RF front end independent of the baseband circuit. Alternatively, the system design may be forced to purchase both the baseband circuit and RF front end form the same supplier as part of a chip set solution, in order to ensure that the chip set has adequate compensation, which limits the designers' options. Further in an implementation of an RF frequency translation modular based on an RF-Analog Baseband-RF conversion architecture for emerging digital satellite TV broadcasting systems, it is imperative to have an analog method to generate an accurate quadrature LO signals for both RF to analog baseband conversion (receiver portion of the FTM modular) and analog baseband to RF conversion (transmitter portion of the FTM modular).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A few analog-based, front-end solutions have been proposed; however, none have implemented continuous phase error correction with &lt;1° performance. One such solution is based on least-mean squared (LMS) algorithm. The main drawbacks of such solutions are increased power consumption, increased design complexity, and a one-time only calibration run at startup. Therefore, such designs require additional startup time and phase error performance may drift with temperature variation after power-up.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another solution provides programmable amplitude and phase. The main drawback of such a solution is that they do not include an on-chip sense circuit or calibration engine. Therefore, such solutions still require support from the baseband circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still another solution generates N harmonics of the LO frequency using a high frequency delay locked loop. The main drawbacks of such an architecture are 1) it uses a frequency doubler for LO generation, 2) it increases phase noise on the LO, 3) it is not optimized for quadrature accuracy with phase error measured at ±5°. As a result, the performance can actually be worse than that achievable without a phase compensation system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An automatic quadrature phase compensation system comprises an on-chip analog sense circuit capable of detecting small differences in quadrature phase error and providing a corresponding DC voltage, a voltage-controlled or programmable phase delay circuit to implement quadrature phase error correction, and a feedback system or compensation engine used to process the sensed error voltage and apply a corresponding correction signal to the adjustable phase delay.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect, the automatic quadrature phase compensation system comprises a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) in which the quadrature phase difference between I and Q local oscillator signals is locked to 90°. Other aspects of the embodiments of the invention are further described in Exhibit A, appended to this application and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, since the compensation PLL requires only phase adjustment and is not required to generate a frequency output, it can be simplified further into a Delay-Locked Loop (DLL). A DLL is a specific type of PLL used to synchronize clock edges, where the VCO is replaced by a voltage controlled delay line (VCDL).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other features, aspects, and embodiments of the disclosed are described below in the section entitled “Detailed Description.”</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The systems and method described below relate to various embodiments and implementations for an automatic quadrature phase compensation system. The systems and methods described herein can apply equally to receivers and transmitters. While certain embodiments are described below, this should not be seen as limiting the systems and methods described herein to any particular embodiment, or implementation as it will be apparent that many variations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>100</b> configured in accordance with the systems and methods described herein. As can be seen, system <b>100</b> comprises a quadrature LO signal generator <b>102</b> configured to generate In-phase (I) and Quadrature phase (Q) signals, a voltage-controlled, or programmable phase delay circuit <b>104</b> configured to implement quadrature phase error correction on the quadrature signals generated by quadrature signal generator <b>102</b>, an analog phase sense circuit <b>106</b> that is configured to receive phase information related to the I and Q signals and to produce a Direct Current (DC) voltage (V<sub>OUT</sub>) that is representative of the sensed phase error, and a feedback system or compensation engine <b>108</b> configured to process the sensed error voltage (V<sub>OUT</sub>) and apply a corresponding correction signal (Vdelay_CTL) to the phase delay circuit <b>104</b>. Analog phase sense circuit <b>106</b> should be capable of detecting small phase errors, e.g., &lt;0.5°, between the I and Q signals. As a result, the image rejection ratio can be above 50 dB for low IF receiver architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Feedback system <b>108</b> can comprise an analog feedback system or a digital feedback system. Analog feedback systems are described in the embodiments below. A digital feedback system <b>108</b> can comprise a filter for filtering a signal generated by phase sense circuit <b>106</b>, a sampling circuit, and an Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter. The filtered signal can then be sampled by the sampling circuit and converted to a digital representation using an A/D converter. The generated digital representation can then be processed by a digital controller to set switches on a programmable delay circuit to adjust the delay accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One continuous implementation of phase compensation system <b>100</b> is equivalent to a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) in which the expected phase difference between I and Q local oscillator signals is locked to 90°. Thus, any variation from the expected 90° phase difference between I and Q local oscillator signals will be detected as a phase error by sense circuit <b>106</b>. Since system <b>100</b> is only designed for phase adjustment and is not required to generate a varying frequency output, it can be simplified further into a Delay-Locked Loop (DLL). A DLL is a specific type of PLL used to synchronize clock edges, where a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), needed to produce such a varying frequency output, can be replaced by a Voltage Controlled Delay Line (VCDL). Certain DLL implementations are described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, quadrature local oscillator signal generation performed in accordance with the systems and methods described herein can be broken down into two parts: a coarse quadrature signal generation; and a refinement, or compensation, of the coarse quadrature signals to produce finely compensated quadrature signals. Coarse quadrature signal generation is accomplished via quadrature signal generator <b>102</b>, which can, depending on the embodiment, be implemented in the form of a conventional divide-by-two circuit and corresponding PLL. Such divide-by-two circuits inherently generate I and Q outputs with phase accuracy approximately limited to the range of ±3°, based upon the matching of certain time delays associated with latches that comprise part of the divide-by-two circuit. The fine tune, calibration circuit can be implemented by loop <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that some or all of the components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be combined into common circuits or blocks and can be packaged as part of the same integrated circuit or device, or can comprise separate circuits or devices. For example, analog sense circuit <b>106</b> and feedback system, or compensation engine <b>108</b> can, in certain embodiments, comprise part of a combined circuit or device. This combined circuit can then be on the same chip as the other components or can be on a separate chip interfaced with a chip, or chips, comprising the other components. Obviously, integration concerns can make it preferable to include all, or most of the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> onto a single chip, or to integrate them within a single integrated circuit package.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Implementing the fine tune calibration circuit in the RF front end as an analog solution allows the RF front end to work with a variety of baseband demodulators as a stand alone product without a full chip set solution. Further, it makes re-transmission of the signal possible before demodulation. This makes possible potential applications in the implementation of a frequency translation module (FTM) for digital satellite television broadcast. Further, an analog solution configured in accordance with the systems and methods described herein can be configured to continuously correct for phase imbalance. Therefore, compensation provided is valid over temperature, supply voltage, mismatch, process variation, and LO frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned, loop <b>110</b> can take the form of a DLL. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>200</b> that comprises a DLL <b>110</b> configured in accordance with one embodiment of the systems and methods described herein. DLL <b>110</b> comprises a pair of VCDLs <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>, a phase detector <b>214</b>, and a loop filter <b>212</b>. In this instance, phase detector <b>214</b> comprises an Exclusive-OR (XOR) device, but clearly, other phase detector implementations are possible and the use of an XOR device in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> should not be seen as limiting the systems and methods described herein to any particular implementation of a phase detector.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">XOR <b>214</b> can be configured to provide a pulse width modulated (PWM) error voltage signal corresponding to the quadrature phase error between I and Q signals. Loop filter <b>212</b> can then translate the PWM error signal into a DC voltage corresponding to the phase error. Loop filter <b>212</b> can, for example, be implemented as a low pass filter; however, it will be clear that other implementations for loop filter <b>212</b> are also possible. The DC voltage generated by loop filter <b>212</b> can then be provided as the control voltage for VCDLs <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>. As will be explained below, the control voltage controls VCDLs <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> so as to reduce the quadrature phase error between the I and Q signals.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plot illustrating the average value of the DC error voltage produced by loop filter <b>212</b> versus the phase difference between the I and Q signals. As can be seen, the calibration point for the phase difference is locked at 90°. Thus, the absolute value of the DC error voltage (VDC) is zero when the phase error is zero and the phase difference between I and Q is exactly 90°. With DLL <b>110</b> locked at precisely 90°, the transient waveforms of the I and Q signals as well as VDC are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic illustrating an example implementation of XOR <b>214</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, XOR <b>214</b> comprises a transconductor <b>502</b> and a switching pair <b>504</b>. Transconductor <b>502</b> comprises device Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b> that are configured to receive, in this case, a differential Q signal input, and to generate a current signal therefrom. The current signal is fed to switching pair <b>504</b>, which comprises devices Q<b>1</b>-Q<b>4</b>. Switching pair <b>504</b> is driven by a differential I signal input to produce a voltage output (V<sub>OUT</sub>) from the current signal provided by transconductor <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the signal inputs and outputs are differential signals. Conversely, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, all signals are illustrated with a single line; however, the single line representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may or may not indicate that a given signal is a single ended signal. In fact, depending on the embodiment, all or some of the signals can be differential signals as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Differential signals can be preferred, because their use eliminates, or reduces, the effect of any common mode errors, or noise. Specific implementations of DLL <b>110</b> that use differential signals and/or single ended signals are described more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Many circuit topologies can be used for implementing VCDLs <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of VCDL implementation based on a phase interpolated circuit topology. VCDL <b>600</b> comprises a slow signal path <b>612</b> and a fast signal path <b>610</b>. VCDL <b>600</b> is configured to generate a voltage controlled phase delay by interpolating between phases of the signals generated by slow signal path <b>612</b> and fast signal path <b>610</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, V<sub>IN </sub>represents an I or Q signal, which is fed to both slow signal path <b>612</b> and fast signal path <b>610</b>. The interpolated delay is created by Vdelay_CTL which scales the gain coefficients of buffer <b>604</b> and <b>608</b>. For the maximum delay, the gain of buffer <b>804</b> is equal to one while the gain of buffer <b>608</b> is zero. For the minimum delay, the gain of slow path buffer <b>604</b> is set to zero, while the fast gain path buffer is set to one. Interpolation of delays between the maximum and the minimum is achieved with analog scaling of the gain coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The output of delay controlled, slow signal path <b>612</b> is then combined with the output of fast signal path <b>610</b> in combiner <b>606</b>. Therefore, the overall interpolated phase delay of the combined signal (V<sub>OUT</sub>) can be controlled via the control of the gain coefficient on the buffers <b>604</b> and <b>608</b>. In one embodiment, the delay can be adjusted from 35 ps to 85 ps for an input control voltage swing of 400 mV as illustrated by the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the signals are illustrated as single ended signals; however, some or all of the signals can in fact be differential signals, depending on the implementation. To illustrate this further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is schematic depicting an example implementation of VCDL <b>600</b> that uses differential signals.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, XOR <b>214</b> can be configured to detect even very small phase differences between the I and Q signals and to generate a DC voltage signal that is proportionate to the phase error detected. Loop filter <b>212</b> can be configured to filter the DC voltage and generate a corresponding tuning voltage (Vdelay_CTL) that is sent to VCDL <b>208</b> and/or <b>210</b>. V<sub>TUNE </sub>is then used by VCDL <b>208</b> and/or <b>210</b> to control the phase of the corresponding I or Q signal so as to eliminate the phase error. In other words, V<sub>TUNE </sub>can be used to push or pull the phase of one or both of the I or Q signals in a manner that eliminates the phase error between the two.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>800</b> in which the tuning voltage is only supplied to one of the VCDLs. Automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>800</b> comprises a quadrature signal generator <b>102</b> and a differential DLL <b>110</b>. Differential DLL <b>110</b> comprises a differential error detector <b>802</b> configured to sense the phase error between the I and Q signals and to generate a differential tuning voltage that is supplied to VCDL <b>806</b> in order to push and/or pull the phase of the Q signal as need to eliminate the phase error relative to the I signal. Meanwhile, VCDL <b>804</b> is simply biased at a set point, e.g., in the middle of the tuning range and remains unchanged. In other words, all of the tuning occurs on the Q signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be clear that in other embodiments, all of the tuning can be allowed to occur on the I signal, while the Q signal remains unchanged, i.e., VCDL <b>806</b> is biased to a specified set point. Further, while not shown, DLL <b>110</b> can comprise a loop filter, such as loop filter <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, on the other hand, is a diagram illustrating an example automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>900</b>, in which DLL <b>110</b> is implemented as a differential DLL and in which the phase of both the I and Q signals are controlled via error detector <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>1000</b> in which DLL <b>110</b> is implemented as a single ended DLL. Thus, error detector <b>1002</b> is configured to sense the phase error between the I and Q signals and generate a single ended tuning signal (Vdelay_CTL). The single ended tuning signal is fed to CTL circuit <b>1008</b>, which converts the single ended tuning signal into a differential tuning signal that can be applied to VCDL <b>1006</b> in order to control the phase of the Q signal. It will be clear that in other implementations, the single ended tuning signal can be used to control the phase of the I signal, via VCDL <b>1004</b>, or both the Q and I signals.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An analog solution configured in accordance with the systems and methods described herein requires very low current, as the only extra blocks consuming current are the phase detector and an extra stage of the I/Q buffer(s) for implementing the VCDLs. Moreover, the solutions described can implement phase imbalance compensation directly on the quadrature circuit of the LO, thereby preventing any degradation in the quadrature amplitude matching of the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An automatic quadrature phase compensation system <b>100</b>, such as described herein, can be included in a variety of devices. Such devices can include a settop box, television, satellite receiver, or a tuner, to name just a few.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While certain embodiments and/or implementations of the inventions have been described above, it will be understood that the embodiments described are by way of example only. Accordingly, the inventions should not be limited based on the described embodiments. For example, it will be clear that the systems and methods can be applied to any communication architecture that requires a precision quadrature LO, whether in the receiver or the transmitter. Rather, the scope of the inventions described herein should only be limited in light of the claims that follow when taken in conjunction with the above description and accompanying drawings.</p>
