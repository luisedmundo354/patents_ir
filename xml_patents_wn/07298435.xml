<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A color filter <b>40</b> has a light-transmissive substrate <b>2</b>, a reflecting layer <b>3</b> formed on the back substrate <b>2</b> and provided with openings <b>4</b>, boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b> formed on the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, and a plurality of coloring layers <b>6</b> enclosed by the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>. A transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is provided between the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>. A step is formed between the openings <b>4</b> and the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>. The coloring layers <b>6</b> are formed by applying the droplets <b>150</b> of colored fluid to the openings <b>4</b> first, and then to the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>. The difference in color saturation of the color filter <b>40</b> in a reflective display mode and a transmissive display mode is reduced. Also, a liquid material is appropriately applied to the color filter <b>40</b>, to enhance color balance.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a color filter that functions both in a reflective display mode and a transmissive display mode, a method of manufacturing such color filter, a method of depositing a liquid material to manufacture such color filter, a display device having such color filter, a method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display device having such color filter, an electro-optic device having such color filter, an electronic instrument having such color filter, and to a method of manufacturing such electronic instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A liquid crystal display device is known to be equipped with a color filter that functions both as a reflective display by using external light and a transmissive display by using a backlight. When such conventional liquid crystal display device functions as a reflective display, colored light is obtained when the incoming light from outside passes through coloring layers that are provided for color-display purposes. Accordingly, the display is inevitably darkened because the incoming light is partially absorbed by the coloring layers. To prevent this problem, it has been known to provide in portions of the coloring layers colorless openings and reflecting films that correspond to the openings, such that part of the incoming light passes through the openings to be reflected at the reflecting films as colorless light without being absorbed by the coloring layers. By mixing the colorless light with the colored light, it is possible to obtain a brighter display than the case where all incoming light passes through the coloring layers and becomes colored. For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. H11-183892 (FIG. 1) shows such structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display device is also known to be able to switch between the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode as needed, as seen in, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2001-33778 (FIGS. 1 and 2).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the known arrangements described above, in the reflective display mode, the light entering from outside is reflected after passing through the coloring layers and again passes through the coloring layers, thus passing through the coloring layers twice, such that the outputted colored light has enough color saturation. On the other hand, in the transmissive display mode, the light from the light source passes through the coloring layers only once, resulting in different degrees of color saturation in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode. More specifically, the colored light in the reflective display mode is perceived as being more saturated. In other words, the display device has a different color balances in the reflective display mode and in the transmissive display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, since each coloring layer has a reflective portion and a transmissive portion and the transmissive portion is an opening within the reflective portion, a step portion at the boundary between the reflective portion and the transmissive portion is inevitably formed. When a color filter element is formed on such step portion using an inkjet device or other discharging device, the area near the step portion is sometimes not covered by the color filter material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that there exists a need for an improved a color filter, a method for manufacturing a color filter, a display device having such color filter, a method of discharging a liquid material to manufacture such color filter, an electro-optic device having such color filter, an electronic instrument having such color filter; a method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display device, and a method of manufacturing an electronic instrument, that overcome the problems of the aforementioned known art. This invention addresses this need in the art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Selected embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the following descriptions of the embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Furthermore, not all of the configurations described in these embodiments are necessarily indispensable as a means of embodying the inventions as defined in the claims. This liquid crystal display device is a low-energy, so-called semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device for performing a display function in an optimal display mode, which is selected based on the brightness of the surrounding from a reflective display mode in which external light is collected to display images with reflected light, and a transmissive display mode in which images are displayed with light from a backlight. The liquid crystal display device has a color filter provided with coloring layers for color display.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In this cross-sectional view, the side of the liquid crystal <b>15</b> on which the light source (backlight) <b>20</b> is disposed is referred to as the back side, and the opposite side as the front side. The display is usually viewed from the front side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram in which the positioning of boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b> with the colored layers <b>6</b> of the present invention is depicted from the front side. A grid is formed with light-transmissive colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> that extend in the direction of the Y-axis at a plurality of locations, and non light-transmissive colored boundary layers <b>21</b> that extend at a plurality of locations in the direction of the X-axis, which is orthogonal to the Y-axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram depicting a cross section (I-I′) of the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram depicting a cross section (III-III′) of the colored boundary layers <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> includes a light-transmissive back substrate <b>2</b> and a front substrate <b>11</b> which are disposed facing each other, and a color filter <b>40</b> for enabling color display. The color filter <b>40</b> includes a reflecting layer <b>3</b> that is formed on the front side of the back substrate <b>2</b> and has openings <b>4</b>; a light-transmissive transparent coat layer <b>25</b> that is formed on the reflecting layer <b>3</b>; colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> and colored boundary layers <b>21</b> that are formed in a grid so as to define the openings <b>4</b> above the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>; a plurality of deposit portions <b>7</b> that are defined by the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> and the colored boundary layers <b>21</b> to allow a prescribed colored liquid to be deposited by a discharging device described hereinafter; coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B that are layers of the colored liquid applied to the deposit portions <b>7</b>; and an overcoat layer <b>8</b> for entirely covering the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, the colored boundary layer <b>21</b>, and the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> further includes pixel electrodes <b>12</b> disposed opposite the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B; an orientation film <b>13</b> for covering the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>; and counter electrodes <b>9</b> disposed opposite the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>, and an orientation film <b>10</b> for covering the counter electrodes <b>9</b>. The pixel electrodes <b>12</b> and the orientation film <b>13</b> are formed on the back side of the front substrate <b>11</b>, while the counter electrodes <b>9</b> and the orientation film <b>10</b> are formed on the overcoat layer <b>8</b> described above. A seal <b>14</b> is formed along the external periphery of the front substrate <b>11</b> between the orientation film <b>10</b> and the orientation film <b>13</b>, such that liquid crystal <b>15</b> is sealed in the space defined by the seal <b>14</b>, the orientation film <b>10</b>, and the orientation film <b>13</b>. Also provided are a front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> attached to the front side of the front substrate <b>11</b>, a back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b> attached to the back side of the back substrate <b>2</b>, an optical waveguide plate <b>19</b> provided via a buffer <b>18</b> so as to cover the entire back side of the back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b>, and a light source <b>20</b> for supplying light to the optical waveguide plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B are arranged in an orderly fashion in a grid, with coloring layers <b>6</b> of the same color forming a row in the Y-axis direction. Coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B of different colors are lined up in sequence in the X-axis direction. The colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> are arranged at borders between coloring layers <b>6</b> of differing colors, while the colored boundary layers <b>21</b> are arranged at borders between coloring layers <b>6</b> of the same color. In other words, the coloring layers <b>6</b> are compartmentalized by the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent such drawbacks as poor color contrast due to colors overlapping one another, and gaps being formed between the coloring layers <b>6</b>. Thus, sharp display can be obtained. The colorless boundary layers <b>5</b>, the counter electrodes <b>9</b>, the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>, the orientation films <b>10</b> and <b>13</b>, the overcoat layer <b>8</b>, and the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> are also light-transmissive.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Reflective Display Mode</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The reflective display in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> thus configured will first be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Among various lights that enter the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b>, only the external lights Q and S that enter the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> in the transmission direction (transmission axis direction) of the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> are allowed to pass through, and the lights entering in other directions are absorbed by the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b>. The external lights Q and S that passed through the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> pass through the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> through: the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>→the orientation film <b>13</b>→the liquid crystal <b>15</b>→the orientation film <b>10</b>→the counter electrodes <b>9</b>→the overcoat layer <b>8</b>, in this order. Thereafter, the external light S in this arrangement passes through any one of the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B (the coloring layer <b>6</b>B in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and reaches the reflecting layer <b>3</b> via the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, is reflected by the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and again passes through the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> and the coloring layer <b>6</b>, becomes a colored light that is colored by the colored layer <b>6</b> twice, and exits from the front side of the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> in a reverse order through the pathway through which the external light S entered. On the other hand, the external light Q passes through the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> and the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> and reaches the reflecting layer <b>3</b> after passing through the counter electrodes <b>9</b>, is reflected by the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and again passes through the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> and the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, and exits from the front side of the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> as colorless light, passing through in a reverse direction the pathway through which the external light Q entered.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As the external light S passes through the coloring layer <b>6</b>, the coloring layer <b>6</b> absorbs lights that are included in the external light S and have a wavelength other than that of the color of the coloring layer <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the brightness of the external light S is reduced as the external light S passes through the coloring layer <b>6</b>. The brightness of the external light S is reduced further due to the fact that the external light S passes through the coloring layer <b>6</b> twice. The brightness tends to be even further reduced if the thickness of the coloring layers <b>6</b> is increased in order to increase color saturation. However, because the colorless external light Q passes through the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> without passing through the coloring layers <b>6</b>, the external light Q exits while preserving its original brightness. Consequently, in order to increase the brightness of the external light S, the external lights Q and S are caused to exit simultaneously from the front. Accordingly, the external lights Q and S in combination maintain the overall brightness of the display. The brightened mixture of the colored light and the colorless light is perceived as colored light by human eyes, since human eyes cannot distinguish colored light from colorless light.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> as described above are made of an acrylic resin or an epoxy resin that has good transparency, and are aligned in an orderly fashion at the boundaries of coloring layers <b>6</b> of different colors. Accordingly, the overall brightness of the coloring layers <b>6</b> is balanced and an easily readable display is obtained. The colored boundary layers <b>21</b> formed at the boundaries between colored layers <b>6</b> of the same color are black and yield good color contrast. Also, even when a colored liquid is deposited onto the colored boundary layers <b>21</b> during the formation of the colored layers <b>6</b> by a hereinafter described discharging device, there is no effect on the resulting display. Accordingly, it is possible to deposit the colored liquid in a continuous manner. Both of these boundary layers are usually formed by a dispenser, screen printing, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The reflecting layer <b>3</b> formed on the back substrate <b>2</b> is made of a thin film of silver, aluminum, nickel, chrome, or another metal to reflect light. The overcoat layer <b>8</b> flattens the irregular surface that was formed during the formation of the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, the colored boundary layer <b>21</b>, and the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B. In this manner, the overcoat layer <b>8</b> facilitates the formation of the counter electrodes <b>9</b>. The orientation films <b>10</b> and <b>13</b> cover and protect the counter electrodes <b>9</b> and pixel electrodes <b>12</b> respectively, and are designed to prevent organic ingredients and the like from exuding into and degrading the liquid crystal <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the liquid crystal <b>15</b>, the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is varied according to the electric field applied between the counter electrodes <b>9</b> and the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>, which sandwich the liquid crystal <b>15</b> from both sides. In this manner, the orientation of the transmitted light can be controlled. Each pair of the counter electrode <b>9</b> and the pixel electrode <b>12</b> is arranged at positions opposite each of the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B and its bordering colorless boundary layers <b>5</b>, such that the transmission and blockage of light and the brightness of each color are controlled to depict the prescribed display. Where the counter electrodes overlap with the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b>, each of adjacent counter electrodes <b>9</b> is arranged to cover half the width of each colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>. Specifically, the transmission, blockage, and the like of the external light Q and S are controlled for each area in which the pair of the counter electrode <b>9</b> and pixel electrode <b>12</b> is disposed. The external light Q and S also pass through the liquid crystal <b>15</b> twice.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Transmissive Display Mode</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A brief description of the transmissive display mode will next be given still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the transmissive display mode, transmission light P emitted from the light source <b>20</b> is used instead of the external lights Q and S which are used in the reflective display mode. The transmission light P is guided to the back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b> by the optical waveguide plate <b>19</b>, such that only light in the transmission direction (transmission axis direction) of the back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b> is allowed to pass through the back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b>. The resultant light then passes through the back substrate <b>2</b> and enters the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B through the openings <b>4</b>. The light P that enters the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B is colored in the color of the coloring layer <b>6</b> in which the light P entered (green in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and is emitted from the front side passing through: the overcoat layer <b>8</b>→the counter electrodes <b>9</b>→the orientation film <b>10</b>→the liquid crystal <b>15</b>→the orientation film <b>13</b>→the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>→the front substrate <b>11</b>→the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b>, in this order. Usually, the transmission light P passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b> and the liquid crystal <b>15</b> once. Accordingly, if the external light S that enters the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> from the front face and the transmission light P that enters from the light source <b>20</b> are of the same brightness, the transmission light P will be brighter when it exits from the front face. The present invention is designed so that the brightness of the display in the reflective display mode is increased by adding the bright external light Q to the external light S, such that the difference in brightness between the transmissive display mode and the transmissive display mode is extremely small.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In contrast, when there is no transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, the external light S passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b> and is colored twice, while the transmission light P passes through the coloring layer <b>6</b> of the same thickness and is colored only once. The thickness of the coloring layers <b>6</b> through which the light passes can be considered to be substantially equal to or less than the thickness of the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, which is a thin metal film having a thickness of 0.2 μm. Since the external light S passes through the coloring layer <b>6</b> by a distance that is twice as long as the distance by which the transmissive light P passes, the color saturation of the external light S is proportionately higher than that of the transmissive light. Specifically, when the same color is displayed in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode, human eyes can perceive the difference in color saturation. Although the difference in color saturation may be difficult to perceive when the viewer singularly views the display either in the reflective display mode or in the transmissive display mode, the difference in color saturation is more evident when two displays, one in the transmissive display mode and one in the reflective display mode, are viewed together in a darkened environment.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the arrangement of the present embodiment, the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> reduces the distance by which the external light S passes through the coloring layer <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the difference in the color saturation in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode, which is a result of the difference in the number of times the light passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b>, is cancelled out. Therefore, the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> of the present embodiment has little difference in the brightness of display in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">More specifically, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is provided between the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>, such that portions <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the coloring layers <b>6</b> above the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, through which the external light S passes, are made half as thick as portions <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the coloring layers <b>6</b> through which the transmission light P passes. By this arrangement, the external light S passing twice through the portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the coloring layers <b>6</b> and the transmission light P passing once through the portion <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the coloring layers <b>6</b> travel the same distance through the coloring layers <b>6</b>, and colored to the same degree of color saturation. The transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is composed of acrylic resin, epoxy resin, or the like having good transparency. The transparent layer <b>25</b> is formed on the reflecting layer <b>3</b> so as to entirely cover the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, and is set so that all of the external light Q and S passing through the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is reflected by the reflecting layer <b>3</b>. Although the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is formed between the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transparent layer <b>25</b> can be alternatively formed between the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and the back substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, by forming the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> as described above, the thickness of the coloring layers <b>6</b> in the area above the reflecting layer <b>3</b> can be reduced by a factor equivalent to the thickness of the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>. Specifically, the thickness of the portions <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the coloring layers <b>6</b> above the reflecting layer <b>3</b> becomes thinner than the thickness of the other portions <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the coloring layers <b>6</b> by a factor equivalent to the thickness of the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>. Consequently, by adjusting the thickness of this transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, it is possible to freely adjust the balance between the color saturation in the reflective display mode, in which external light is reflected by the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and passes twice through the coloring layers <b>6</b>, and the color saturation in the transmissive display mode, in which light passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b> only once. In the embodiment above, the distance that the external light S and the transmission light P pass through in the coloring layer <b>6</b> is made substantially equal, and therefore the color saturation of the colored light can be made substantially equal. By also forming a colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> whereby bright, colorless light is obtained, a display device can be provided having good visibility and substantially the same level of brightness in the a reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, by providing a light-transmissive boundary layer <b>5</b>, bright, colorless light can be obtained that does not pass through the coloring layers <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the brightness in the reflective display mode can be enhanced. The color contrast is also enhanced by the colored boundary layer <b>21</b>, which is a non light-transmissive boundary layer. Furthermore, by using a discharging device to form the coloring layers <b>6</b> that are enclosed by the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>, droplets <b>150</b> can be uniformly applied and a boundary layer with uniform coating thickness and coating surface area can be obtained.</p>

The overcoat layer <b>8</b>′ includes a first overcoat layer <b>8</b><i>a</i>′ for directly and completely covering the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b>, the colored boundary layers <b>21</b>, and the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B, and a second overcoat layer portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>′ formed only on portions of the first overcoat layer portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>′ that correspond to the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Pixel electrodes <b>12</b> disposed opposite the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B, and an orientation film <b>13</b> for covering the pixel electrodes <b>12</b> are formed on the back side of the front substrate <b>11</b>. Counter electrodes <b>9</b>′ disposed in a concave shape opposite the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>, and an orientation film <b>10</b>′ for covering the counter electrodes <b>9</b> are formed on the overcoat layer <b>8</b>′ described above. Seals <b>14</b> are formed along the external periphery of the front substrate <b>11</b> between the orientation films <b>10</b> and <b>13</b>, such that liquid crystal <b>15</b> is sealed in the space formed by the seals, <b>14</b> and the orientation films <b>10</b> and <b>13</b>. Also, the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>30</b> has a front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> attached to the front side of the front substrate <b>11</b>, a back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b> attached to the back side of the back substrate <b>2</b>, an optical waveguide plate <b>19</b> provided on the back of the back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b> via a buffer <b>18</b> so as to cover the entire back side of the back-face polarizing plate <b>16</b>, and a light source <b>20</b> for supplying light to the optical waveguide plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B are aligned in an orderly fashion in a grid. Coloring layers <b>6</b> of the same color form a row in the Y-axis direction, while coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B of different colors are lined up next to one another in the X-axis direction. The colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> are arranged at the borders between coloring layers <b>6</b> of different colors; while the colored boundary layers <b>21</b> are arranged at the borders of coloring layers <b>6</b> of the same color. The colorless boundary layers <b>5</b>, the counter electrodes <b>9</b>′, the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>, the orientation films <b>10</b>′ and <b>13</b>, the overcoat layer <b>8</b>′, the resin scattering layer <b>32</b>, and the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> are also light-transmissive.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Reflective Display Mode</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The reflective display in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>30</b> thus configured will first be described. Among various lights that enter the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b>, only the external lights Q and S that enter the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> in the transmission direction (transmission axis direction) of the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> are allowed to pass through, and the lights entering in other directions are absorbed by the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b>. The external lights Q and S that have passed through the front-face polarizing plate <b>17</b> pass through the liquid crystal display device <b>30</b> through: the pixel electrodes <b>12</b>→the orientation film <b>13</b>→the liquid crystal <b>15</b>→the orientation film <b>10</b>′→the counter electrodes <b>9</b>→the overcoat layer <b>8</b>′ in this order. The external light S in this arrangement passes through any one of the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B (the coloring layer <b>6</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), reaches the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> via the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, is reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>, again passes through the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> and the coloring layer <b>6</b>, becomes a colored light that is colored in the color of the coloring layer <b>6</b>, and exits from the front side of the liquid crystal display device <b>30</b> in a reverse order through the pathway through which the external light S entered. On the other hand, the external light Q passes through the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> and the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, reaches the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>, is reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>, again passes through the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> and the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, and exits from the front side as a colorless light in a reverse order through the pathway through which the external light S entered reverse pathway from which the external light S entered.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this arrangement, the external light Q and S are scattered in various directions by the irregular surface of the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> when reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>. Reflection of a viewer's eyes, face, or the like from the front surface that occurs when there is no irregular surface is thereby prevented, and a clearer display is obtained. This scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> uses silver, aluminum, nickel, chrome, or another thin film to reflect light. Irregularities are also formed on the surface of the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> by oxygen plasma treatment or the like to scatter light. Furthermore, almost none of the external light entering the openings <b>4</b> is reflected, and irregularities are provided to the front face of the resin scattering layer <b>32</b> in order to prevent slight reflections and to yield a clear display.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The external light S, which is now a colored light, reduces its brightness when it passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b> and is colored with a prescribed color up to prescribed color saturation. The external light Q, which is a colorless light, passes through the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> without passing through the coloring layers <b>6</b>, and exits with no change in its original brightness. The external light Q and the external light S are caused to exit from the front face simultaneously, such that the overall brightness is maintained. The second overcoat layer portions <b>8</b><i>b</i>′ of the overcoat layer <b>8</b>′ that correspond to the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> is formed thick in order to maintain the brightness of the external light Q and S that are scattered and reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>. In the mean time, the thickness of portions of the liquid crystal <b>15</b> above the reflecting layer <b>31</b>, through which the external light Q and S that are reflected by the, scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> are transmitted, is set smaller than other portions of the liquid crystal <b>15</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the degree if brightness that is lost due to passage through the liquid crystal <b>15</b>, and the brightness of light emitted from the front can be enhanced. The colored boundary layers <b>21</b> formed from resin at the boundaries between coloring layers <b>6</b> of the same color are black and yield good color contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Transmissive Display Mode</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The transmissive display mode is the same as the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> already described in the foregoing. The length of the portion of the liquid crystal <b>15</b> where the external light Q and S are transmitted is shortened to minimize reduction in brightness in the liquid crystal display device <b>30</b> of the second embodiment. If it is assumed that the brightness of the mixture of the incoming external lights Q and S is the same as the brightness of the transmission light P that comes from the light source <b>20</b>, there will be substantially no difference in brightness between the transmission light P emitted at the front face and the external light Q and S. Specifically, the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>30</b> is a display device having a good display balance whereby the variance in brightness of the transmission light P and the external light Q and S is reduced significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, due to the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> of the present embodiment, a display can be obtained having substantially no difference in color saturation between the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode. If there were no transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, the thickness of each of the coloring layers <b>6</b> through which the light passes can be considered to be substantially the same because the reflecting layer <b>3</b> is a thin film of metal. Consequently, when light is emitted from the front face, the color saturation of the external light S, which passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b> twice, is greater than that of the transmission light P, which passes through the coloring layers <b>6</b> once.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present embodiment, however, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is provided between the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> and the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>, and the coloring layers <b>6</b> through which the external light S passes are made about half as thick as the coloring layers <b>6</b> through which the transmission light P passes. By this arrangement, the external light S and the transmission light P travel the same distance through the coloring layers <b>6</b>, and become colored to the same color saturation. The transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is made of acrylic resin, epoxy resin, or other highly light-transmissive material. The transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is formed on the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> so as to entirely cover the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>, such that all of the external light Q and S passing through the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> are reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>. The transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is formed between the reflecting layer <b>3</b> and the boundary layers <b>5</b> and <b>21</b>, but the same effects can be obtained by forming the coat layer between the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> and the back substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, by partially forming the second overcoat portions <b>8</b><i>b</i>′ over the first overcoat portions <b>8</b><i>a</i>′ such that the overcoat layer <b>8</b>′ has different thicknesses in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device <b>30</b>, the thickness of the liquid crystal <b>15</b> in the area above the reflecting layer <b>31</b> is reduced by a factor equivalent to the thickness of the second overcoat layer <b>8</b><i>b</i>′. In this manner, the distance traveled by the external light Q and S and the transmission light P through the liquid crystal <b>15</b> is adjusted, such that the color brightness of the mixture of the external light Q and S and that of the transmission light P are equal. Accordingly, a display also has good visibility whereby reflections of external objects are prevented by the irregularity of the surfaces of the resin scattering layer <b>32</b> and the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Also in this embodiment, light is scattered and reflected due to the irregular surface of the reflecting layer <b>31</b>, it is possible to prevent a reflection of, for example, eyes, face, or the like of the viewer on the display.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The method of manufacturing the color filter <b>40</b> of the first embodiment, which includes the back substrate <b>2</b>, the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, the openings <b>4</b>, the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, the colored boundary layer <b>21</b>, the deposit portions <b>7</b>, the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B, and the overcoat layer <b>8</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. First, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>a</i>), an organic resist film <b>27</b> for forming the openings <b>4</b> is formed on the back substrate <b>2</b>. Then, a thin metallic film of aluminum, chrome, or other metal is formed on the resist film <b>27</b> and the back substrate <b>2</b> by vapor deposition or the like to form the reflecting layer <b>3</b>. The metallic thin film is bonded to the back substrate <b>2</b>, but not to the resist film <b>27</b>. The resist film <b>27</b> and the metallic thin film on the resist film <b>27</b> are removed by a solvent after the metallic thin film is formed, whereupon the reflecting layer <b>3</b> is formed as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>b</i>). The transparent coat layer <b>25</b> made of an acrylic or other light-transmissive resin, the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> made of a similar type of light-transmissive resin, and the colored boundary layer <b>21</b> made of a black resin are applied to the reflecting layer <b>3</b> to form a grid as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by screen printing or the like. The deposit portions <b>7</b> in the areas enclosed by the back substrate <b>2</b>, the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, and the colored boundary layer <b>21</b> are also formed as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The method whereby the droplets <b>150</b> of colored liquid are discharged by the droplet-discharging device <b>100</b> onto the deposit portions <b>7</b> to form the coloring layers <b>6</b> will be described using an example in which red colored liquid is discharged to form the coloring layers <b>6</b>R. First, the back substrate <b>2</b> on which the reflecting layer <b>3</b>, transparent coat layer <b>25</b>, colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, and colored boundary layer <b>21</b> are formed is mounted on the mounting platform <b>121</b> as the work <b>120</b>. The mounting direction is such that the direction in which the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> extend is the Y-axis, and the direction in which the colored boundary layers <b>21</b> extend is the X-axis, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Droplets <b>150</b> of red colored liquid are discharged from the nozzle <b>117</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and the droplets <b>150</b> are dropped in an order from one end of a row of deposit portions <b>7</b> of a red colored layer, working its way up in the Y-axis direction to the other end of the row of the deposit portions <b>7</b>, with the discharge head <b>116</b> moving in a relative fashion in the Y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The coloring layers <b>6</b> are formed by applying the droplets <b>150</b> of colored fluid to the openings <b>4</b> first, and then to the transparent coat layer <b>25</b>. More detailed explanation of how the droplets <b>150</b> are deposited onto each of the deposit portions <b>7</b> will be given below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Droplets <b>150</b> can also be simultaneously deposited at this time by another nozzle <b>117</b> onto another row of deposit portions <b>7</b> of the red coloring layers <b>6</b>R. The red coloring layers <b>6</b>R are completed by repeating this operation as necessary. The number of times this operation needs to be repeated is determined by the number of rows of deposit portions <b>7</b> that are to become the red coloring layers <b>6</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this case, the boundaries of the red coloring layers <b>6</b>R that are lined up in the Y-axis direction become the non-light-transmissive colored boundary layer <b>21</b> that extend in the X-axis direction. Accordingly, there is no effect on performance of the display device even if droplets <b>150</b> are inadvertently dropped on the colored boundary layer <b>21</b>. Therefore, droplets <b>150</b> can be discharged continuously and efficiently in the Y-axis direction without having to avoid the colored boundary layer <b>21</b>. On the other hand, the boundary between the row of green coloring layers <b>6</b>G and the row of red coloring layers <b>6</b>R is the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, so droplets <b>150</b> must be prevented from landing thereon. However, since the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> is parallel to the Y-axis, and the nozzles <b>117</b> move only in the Y-axis direction relative to the work <b>120</b>, it is easy to prevent the droplets <b>150</b> from being accidentally deposited onto the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>. In a conventional structure, however, a colorless portion that performs the functions of the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> is provided in an area inside each of the deposit portions <b>7</b>. Accordingly, it is necessary to prevent the droplets <b>150</b> from being deposited to the colorless portion each time the droplets <b>150</b> are deposited to the deposit portion <b>7</b>. Therefore, control of the discharge operation becomes complicated. The arrangement of the colorless boundary layers <b>5</b> of the present invention is effective in this regard. The description of method of forming the coloring layer <b>6</b>R described above also applies to formation of the coloring layers <b>6</b>G and <b>6</b>B. After the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B are formed as described above, the overcoat layer <b>8</b> is provided so as to cover the coloring layers <b>6</b>R, <b>6</b>G, and <b>6</b>B, the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b>, and the colored boundary layer <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>d</i>)). In this manner, the color filter <b>40</b> is completed.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Method of Manufacturing Color Filter <b>45</b></heading>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The method for manufacturing the color filter <b>45</b> according to the second embodiment is basically the same as that of the color filter <b>40</b> of the first embodiment. Accordingly, only the main differences between the two methods will be described. A light-transmissive resin scattering layer <b>32</b> having an irregular front face is affixed over the entire front side of the back substrate <b>2</b>, and a resist film <b>27</b> and a scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> are formed on the resin scattering layer <b>32</b>. Since the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> is a metallic thin film, the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> is formed so as to conform to the surface irregularity of the resin scattering layer <b>32</b>. More over, further irregularity is provided to the surface of the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> by oxygen plasma treatment or the like to enhance its scattering effects. The resist film <b>27</b> is then removed and the transparent coat layer <b>25</b> is formed on the scattering and reflecting layer <b>31</b> by screen printing or the like. The subsequent process is the same as manufacturing the color filter <b>45</b> of the first embodiment.</p>

Specifically, the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> is positioned in a space defined by a plurality of spacers between the orientation film <b>338</b>A and the orientation film <b>338</b>B, and is in contact with the orientation film <b>338</b>A and orientation film <b>338</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Each of the overlapping portions between the plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> and the plurality of electrodes <b>342</b> corresponds to a pixel area G. Each pixel area G also corresponds to one of the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The light source <b>316</b> is provided so that the color filter substrate <b>310</b> is positioned between the light source <b>316</b> and the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b>. The light source <b>316</b> of the present embodiment is also referred to as a backlight. The light source <b>316</b> includes a light source <b>316</b>A for emitting white light, and an optical waveguide <b>316</b>B. The optical waveguide <b>316</b>B acts as an optical guide while diffusing the light from the light source <b>316</b>A so as to evenly illuminate the substrate <b>332</b> from behind. The rear surface of the substrate <b>332</b> is the opposite surface from the surface on which the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB, the black matrix <b>317</b>, the reflective portions <b>326</b>, and the transmissive portions <b>328</b> are formed. Therefore, the substrate <b>332</b> can also be described as being positioned between the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB and the light source <b>316</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, a reflective portion <b>326</b> and a transmissive portion <b>328</b> are each positioned on the color filter substrate <b>310</b> opposite each of the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB. The liquid crystal display device <b>300</b> having this type of color filter substrate <b>310</b> functions in the manner described below.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">When the backlight (light source <b>316</b>) is used, a light beam P passes through the transmissive portion <b>328</b> after being transmitted through the polarizing plate <b>320</b>A and the substrate <b>332</b>. The light beam that has passed through the transmissive portion <b>328</b> then enters the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB, and a light beam of the corresponding wavelengths exits from the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB. The light beam (colored light) from the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB is transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> and the opposing substrate <b>312</b> and exits from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B. The intensity of the exiting light beam that originates in the backlight <b>316</b>A can be adjusted by adjusting the voltage applied between the electrodes <b>336</b> and the electrodes <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">On the other hand, when external light is used, the external light beam S is transmitted through the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B, the opposing substrate <b>312</b>, and the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b>, and is directed to the corresponding filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB. From among the light beams transmitted through the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB, only light beams that are reflected by the reflective portion <b>326</b> are transmitted again through the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB, and are colored in the corresponding color. Each type of colored light is again transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> and the opposing substrate <b>312</b>, and is emitted from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B. The intensity of the light beam that originates as the external light beam and exits from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B is adjusted by adjusting the voltage applied between the electrodes <b>336</b> and the electrodes <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">With the configuration described above, the first light beam that enters from the first side (upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) of the black matrix <b>317</b> and passes through the corresponding filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB is reflected back to the first side by the reflective portion <b>326</b>. On the other hand, the second light beam that enters from the second side (bottom side if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) of the black matrix <b>317</b> exits to the first side via the transmissive portion <b>328</b> and corresponding filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB. The first side of the black matrix <b>317</b> is defined as the side on which the flattening layer <b>334</b> and liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> are positioned. The second side of the black matrix <b>317</b> is defined as the side on which the light source <b>316</b> is positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Thus, the liquid crystal display device <b>300</b> is capable of displaying an image using both external light as well as light from a backlight. The liquid crystal display device <b>300</b> having this type of functionality is referred to as a semi light-transmissive reflective display device.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB in the color filter substrate <b>310</b> are formed on the opening surfaces <b>317</b>A of the black matrix <b>317</b> by discharging a color filter material from an inkjet device or other discharging device.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the present embodiment, the color filter substrate <b>310</b> prior to being provided with the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB is sometimes referred to as the “substrate <b>310</b>A.” The areas in which the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB are to be provided are also referred to as the “deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B” in the present embodiment.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the discharging device <b>400</b>R includes a tank <b>401</b>R containing the liquid color filter material <b>305</b>R therein and a discharge scanning unit <b>402</b> to which the color filter material <b>305</b>R is supplied via a tube <b>410</b>R from the tank <b>401</b>R.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The liquid color filter material <b>305</b>R in the present embodiment is an example of the “liquid material” of the present invention. The term “liquid material” refers to a material having a viscosity that can be discharged from a nozzle. In this case, the material may be water-based or oil-based. It is sufficient if the material is provided with fluidity (viscosity) whereby it can be discharged from a nozzle, and a solid substance may be intermixed therein as long as the mixed material has enough viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The first position control device <b>404</b> is provided with a linear motor and moves the carriage <b>403</b> in the X-axis direction and the Z-axis direction, which is orthogonal to the X-axis direction, according to a signal from the controller <b>412</b>. The second position control device <b>408</b> is provided with a linear motor and moves the stage <b>406</b> along the Y-axis direction, which is orthogonal to both the X-axis direction and the Z-axis direction, according to a signal from the controller <b>412</b>. The stage <b>406</b> has a flat surface that is parallel to both the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction and is configured such that the substrate <b>310</b>A can be fixedly supported on this flat surface. The stage <b>406</b> fixedly supports the substrate <b>310</b>A, so that the stage <b>406</b> can determine the positions of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B. The substrate <b>310</b>A in the present embodiment is also an example of a recipient substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The first position control device <b>404</b> also has functionality of rotating the carriage <b>403</b> about a prescribed axis parallel to the Z-axis direction. The Z-axis direction is the direction parallel to the vertical direction (in other words, the direction of gravitational acceleration). The X-axis and the Y-axis in the coordinate system of the recipient substrate can be made respectively parallel to the X-axis direction and Y-axis direction relative to the discharging device <b>400</b> through the first position control device <b>404</b>, by being rotated about an axis parallel to the Z-axis direction of the carriage <b>403</b>. In the present embodiment, the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction are both directions in which the carriage <b>403</b> moves relative to the stage <b>406</b>. The first position control device <b>404</b> and the second position control device <b>408</b> are also referred to as “scanning units” in the present specification.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The carriage <b>403</b> and the stage <b>406</b> are also free to move in other ways besides the parallel and rotational movements described above. However, in the present embodiment, disclosure regarding movement of the carriage <b>403</b> and the stage <b>406</b> in directions other than those described above is omitted to simplify description.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The controller <b>412</b> is adapted to receive from an external information-processing device discharge data that indicate relative position at which the color filter material <b>305</b>R is to be discharged. A detailed description of the functioning of the controller <b>412</b> is given hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the carriage <b>403</b> contains a plurality of heads <b>414</b> each having the identical structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram depicting the carriage <b>403</b> viewed from the stage <b>406</b>. In other words, the direction perpendicular to the paper surface of the diagram is the Z-axis direction. Two rows of six heads <b>414</b> are arranged on the carriage <b>403</b> in the present embodiment. The heads <b>414</b> are each fixedly coupled to the carriage <b>403</b> such that the longitudinal direction of the heads <b>414</b> is at an angle AN with respect to the X-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, each of the heads <b>414</b> for discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R has two nozzle rows <b>416</b> extending in the longitudinal direction of the head <b>414</b>. Each nozzle row <b>416</b> has 180 nozzles <b>418</b> lined up in a row. The interval between the nozzles <b>418</b> along the nozzle row direction HX is approximately 140 μm. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the two nozzle rows <b>416</b> in a single head <b>414</b> are arranged with a half-pitch offset (approximately 70 μm). Furthermore, the diameter of the nozzles <b>418</b> in this embodiment is approximately 27 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, the longitudinal direction of the heads <b>414</b> is at an angle AN with respect to the X-axis direction. Accordingly, the nozzle row direction HX, in which the 180 nozzles <b>418</b> are lined up, is also at an angle AN with respect to the X-axis direction. The ends of the plurality of nozzles <b>418</b> are also arranged on an imaginary plane defined by the above-mentioned X-axis direction and Y-axis direction. Each of the plurality of nozzles <b>418</b> is also shaped so that the heads <b>414</b> can discharge the material in a direction substantially parallel to the Z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The angle AN is appropriately set such that at least two of the nozzles <b>418</b> simultaneously face some of the plurality of deposit portions <b>350</b>R lined up in the X-axis direction. By so doing, deposit can be performed on two rows at the same time in one depositing scan. The two nozzles <b>418</b> in this case need not be adjacent to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), each of the heads <b>414</b> is an inkjet head. More specifically, each of the heads <b>414</b> is provided with a diaphragm <b>426</b> and a nozzle plate <b>428</b>. A fluid reservoir <b>429</b> that is continuously filled with the color filter material <b>305</b>R fed from the tank <b>401</b>R via a hole <b>431</b> is positioned between the diaphragm <b>426</b> and the nozzle plate <b>428</b>. A plurality of barriers <b>422</b> is also positioned in the space between the diaphragm <b>426</b> and the nozzle plate <b>428</b>. The area enclosed by the diaphragm <b>426</b>, the nozzle plate <b>428</b>, and a pair of barriers <b>422</b> defines a cavity <b>420</b>. The cavities <b>420</b> are provided for each of the nozzles <b>418</b>, so the number of cavities <b>420</b> is the same as the number of nozzles <b>418</b>. The color filter material <b>305</b>R is fed to the cavities <b>420</b> from the fluid reservoir <b>429</b> via a feeding port <b>430</b> positioned between the pair of barriers <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A transducer <b>424</b> is positioned opposite each of the cavities <b>420</b> on the diaphragm <b>426</b>. The transducer <b>424</b> is composed of a piezoelement <b>424</b>C and a pair of electrodes <b>424</b>A and <b>424</b>B that sandwich the piezoelement <b>424</b>C. The color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged from corresponding nozzles <b>418</b> by a drive voltage being applied to the pair of electrodes <b>424</b>A and <b>424</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The controller <b>412</b> includes a processing unit <b>455</b>, a storage device (RAM), an input buffer memory <b>451</b>, a scanning driver <b>456</b>, and a head driver <b>458</b>. The processing unit <b>455</b> outputs various signals via the drivers <b>456</b> and <b>458</b> on the basis of the data in the storage device <b>452</b> and the input buffer memory <b>451</b>, and selectively controls each component operatively connected to the controller <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The controller <b>412</b> is configured so as to give an independent signal to each of the plurality of transducers <b>424</b> selectively. The volume of color filter material <b>305</b>R to be discharged from the nozzles <b>418</b> is thereby controlled for each of the nozzles <b>418</b> according to the signal from the controller <b>412</b>. Furthermore, the volume of color filter material <b>305</b>R to be discharged by each of the nozzles <b>418</b> can be varied between 0 pL to 42 pL (pico liters). It is therefore possible to configure the nozzles <b>418</b> such that only some of the nozzles <b>418</b> perform the discharge during application scanning operation, but not others.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The portion including one nozzle <b>418</b>, the cavity <b>420</b> corresponding to the nozzle <b>418</b>, and the transducer <b>424</b> corresponding to the cavity <b>420</b> is also sometimes referred to in the present specification as the discharging portion <b>427</b>. According to this notation, a single head <b>414</b> has a number of discharging portions <b>427</b> equivalent to the number of nozzles <b>418</b>. Alternatively, the discharging portion <b>427</b> may have an electrothermal conversion element instead of the piezoelement. In other words, the discharging portion <b>427</b> may have a configuration whereby the material is discharged using thermal expansion of the material by an electrothermal conversion element.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As described above, the carriage <b>403</b> is moved in the X-axis direction and the Z-axis direction by the first position control device <b>404</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). On the other hand, the stage <b>406</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) is moved in the Y-axis direction by the second position control device <b>408</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). As a result, the positions of the heads <b>414</b> can be moved relative to the stage <b>406</b> with the first position control device <b>404</b> and the second position control device <b>408</b>. More specifically, the plurality of heads <b>414</b>, the plurality of nozzle rows <b>416</b>, or the plurality of nozzles <b>418</b> is moved, and therefore the scanning is performed, in a relative fashion in the X-axis direction and in the Y-axis direction while a prescribed distance is maintained in the Z-axis direction in relation to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R positioned on the stage <b>406</b>. In further detail, the heads <b>414</b> scan in a relative fashion in the X-axis direction and in the Y-axis direction with respect to the stage <b>406</b>, and the material is discharged from the plurality of nozzles <b>418</b>. In the present invention, the nozzles <b>418</b> may be scanned relatively with respect to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B, and the material may be discharged from the nozzles <b>418</b> onto the deposit portions <b>350</b>R. The term “relative scanning” includes scanning by moving at least one of the discharging member or the member on which the discharged substance lands (the deposit portions <b>350</b>R or the like). “Application and scanning” is also used to refer to the combination of relative scanning and material discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The configuration of the controller <b>412</b> will next be described. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the controller <b>412</b> is provided with an input buffer memory <b>451</b>, a storage device <b>452</b>, a processing unit <b>454</b>, a scanning driver <b>456</b>, and a head driver <b>458</b>. The input buffer memory <b>451</b> and processing unit <b>454</b> are connected so as to be able to communicate with each other. The processing unit <b>454</b> and storage device <b>452</b> are connected so as to be able to communicate with each other. The processing unit <b>454</b> and scanning driver <b>456</b> are also connected so as to be able to communicate with each other.

The head driver <b>458</b> is connected so as to be able to communicate with each of the plurality of heads <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The input buffer memory <b>451</b> receives discharge data for discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R from an external information-processing device. The discharge data include data indicating the relative positions of all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R on the substrate <b>310</b>A; data indicating the positions at which the color material <b>305</b>R is to be discharged or the positions on which the color filter material <b>305</b>R is to land; data indicating the number of relative scans needed until a prescribed thickness of color filter material <b>305</b>R is applied to all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R; and data specifying which of the nozzles <b>418</b> should discharge the color filter material <b>305</b>R and which of the nozzles <b>418</b> should not. The input buffer memory <b>451</b> feeds the discharge data to the processing unit <b>454</b>, and the processing unit <b>454</b> stores the discharge data in the storage device <b>452</b>. The storage device <b>452</b> includes a RAM (Random Access Memory) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The processing unit <b>454</b> presents the scanning driver <b>456</b> with data indicating the relative position of the nozzle rows <b>416</b> with respect to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R on the basis of the discharge data in the storage device <b>452</b>. The scanning driver <b>456</b> gives a drive signal to the first position control device <b>404</b> and the second position control device <b>408</b> in accordance with these data. Accordingly, the nozzle rows <b>416</b> scan the deposit portions <b>350</b>R. On the other hand, the processing unit <b>454</b> presents the head driver <b>458</b> with data indicating the discharge timing from corresponding nozzles <b>418</b> on the basis of the discharge data stored in the storage device <b>452</b>. The head driver <b>458</b> presents the heads <b>414</b> with the drive signal needed to discharge the color filter material <b>305</b>R on the basis of these data. Accordingly, the liquid color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged from the corresponding nozzles <b>418</b> in the nozzle rows <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The controller <b>412</b> is preferably a computer that includes a CPU, ROM, and RAM.

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The method for manufacturing the liquid crystal display device <b>300</b> will next be described.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">First, the reflective portion <b>326</b> and the transmissive portion <b>328</b> are formed on a light-transmissive member. Specifically, an aluminum (Al) film is formed by sputtering or the like so as to substantially cover the entire surface of a glass substrate or other light-transmissive substrate <b>332</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>a</i>). The substrate <b>332</b> herein corresponds to the above-mentioned “light-transmissive member.” As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>b</i>), the above-mentioned Al film is then patterned so that a reflective portion <b>326</b> and a transmissive portion <b>328</b> are formed for each pixel area G. Specifically, the Al film is patterned so that the shape of the transmissive portion <b>328</b> is substantially rectangular. The Al film remaining on the substrate <b>332</b> after the patterning is the reflective portion <b>326</b>, and the portion from which the Al film is removed is the transmissive portion <b>328</b>. The reflective portion <b>326</b> and the transmissive portion <b>328</b> are thereby formed on the light-transmissive member.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The reflective portion <b>326</b> is provided directly on the substrate <b>332</b> in the present embodiment. However, a protective film or other layer may be provided between the light-transmissive member and the reflective portion <b>326</b>. The term “substrate <b>332</b>” as used in the present specification includes the light-transmissive member as well as a protective film or other layer that is provided between the reflective portion <b>326</b> and the light-transmissive member.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">A layer of first material is then formed covering the reflective portion <b>326</b> and the transmissive portion <b>328</b>. In this embodiment, a thermosetting acrylic resin in which a black pigment is dispersed (resin black) is applied as the first material to a thickness of about 3 μm over the reflective portion <b>326</b> and the substrate <b>332</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>c</i>). As a result, a resin black layer <b>317</b>′ is obtained. The resin black layer <b>317</b>′ in this case is an example of the “first material layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The second material layer is then formed by applying a resist on the first material layer. Specifically, a chemically sensitized negative-type acrylic photosensitive resist in which a fluorinated polymer is blended is applied so as to cover the entire surface of the resin black layer <b>317</b>′ as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>c</i>). As a result, a resist layer <b>330</b>′ is obtained on the resin black layer <b>317</b>′. The resist layer <b>330</b>′ herein is an example of the “second material layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Patterning is then performed on the resist layer <b>330</b>′ and the resin black layer <b>317</b>′. Specifically, the resist layer <b>330</b>′ is irradiated with light hν via a photomask. The photomask has light-blocking portions at positions that correspond to the pixel areas G. A plurality of portions of the resist layer <b>330</b>′ and the resin black layer <b>317</b>′ not irradiated with the light hν; in other words the portions corresponding to the plurality of pixel areas G, is then removed by etching using a prescribed etching fluid. In this manner, a black matrix <b>317</b> and banks <b>330</b> that enclose the subsequently formed filter layer are obtained simultaneously on the substrate <b>332</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>d</i>). In other words, opening surfaces <b>317</b>A that correspond to the reflective portion <b>326</b> and transmissive portion <b>328</b> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As described above, the areas defined or enclosed by the black matrix <b>317</b>, the banks <b>330</b>, the reflective portions <b>326</b>, and the transmissive portions <b>328</b> are the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B. The banks <b>330</b> are also light-transmissive. The black matrix <b>317</b> is also an example of the “first layer” of the present invention; and the banks <b>330</b> are an example of the “second layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Areas (in other words, the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B) compartmentalized by the black matrix <b>317</b> and the banks <b>330</b> are thus provided in the substrate <b>310</b>A by forming the black matrix <b>317</b> and the banks <b>330</b> positioned on the black matrix <b>317</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Method of Discharging Color Filter Material</heading>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The method by which the discharging device <b>400</b>R discharges the color filter material <b>305</b>R onto the deposit portions <b>350</b>R will next be described.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the substrate <b>310</b>A depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the row direction and column direction of the matrix formed by the plurality of deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B are the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction, respectively. Furthermore, the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, the deposit portions <b>350</b>G, and deposit portions <b>350</b>B are lined up in the X-axis direction in this order with prescribed intervals therebetween. On the other hand, the deposit portions <b>350</b>R are lined up at prescribed intervals in the Y-axis direction, deposit portions <b>350</b>G are lined up at prescribed intervals in the Y-axis direction, and the deposit portions <b>350</b>B are lined up at prescribed intervals in the Y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The interval LRX at which two deposit portions <b>350</b>R are arranged along the X-axis direction is about 237 μm. This interval LRX is the same as the interval LGX at which two deposit portions <b>350</b>G are arranged along the X-axis direction, and also the interval LBX at which two deposit portions <b>350</b>B are arranged along the X-axis direction. The length in the X-axis direction and the length in the Y-axis direction of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B are approximately 50 μm and approximately 120 μm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In the present embodiment, the transmissive portion <b>328</b> is concavity formed on the reflective portion <b>326</b> in each of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, and a step is therefore formed between the transmissive portion <b>328</b> and the reflective portion <b>326</b> within the deposit portions <b>350</b>R (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>d</i>)). This is because the transmissive portion <b>328</b> is an opening on the reflective portion <b>326</b> and is formed by removing a portion of the reflective portion <b>326</b>. Consequently, the size of the step corresponds to the thickness of the reflective portion <b>326</b>. Similarly, the transmissive portions <b>328</b> are also formed as concavities on the reflective portions <b>326</b> in the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The transport device <b>470</b> first positions the substrate <b>310</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>R.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Before the first scanning period begins, the discharging device <b>400</b>R causes the X-coordinates of the nozzles <b>418</b> to match the X-coordinates of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R. Specifically, the X-coordinate of the leftmost nozzle <b>418</b> among the nozzles <b>418</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is caused to match the X-coordinate X1 of the leftmost column among the columns of deposit portions <b>350</b>R depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In the mean time, the X-coordinate of the rightmost nozzle <b>418</b> among the nozzles <b>418</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is caused to match the X-coordinate X2 of the rightmost column among the columns of deposit portions <b>350</b>R depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The nozzles <b>418</b> corresponding to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R are also referred to as the first nozzles <b>418</b>A. The nozzles <b>418</b> that do not correspond to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R are also referred to as the second nozzles <b>418</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The term “scanning period” in the present embodiment refers to the period in which one end of the carriage <b>403</b> moves along the Y-axis direction from one end E<b>1</b> (or the other end E<b>2</b>) of the scanning range <b>434</b> to the other end E<b>2</b> (or the one end E<b>1</b>) relatively in order to apply the material to all the deposit portions <b>350</b>R that are aligned in the Y-axis direction, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Furthermore, the term “scanning range <b>434</b>” in the present embodiment refers to the range that one end of the carriage <b>403</b> moves relative to the matrix <b>18</b>M until the color filter material <b>305</b>R is applied to all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R of the matrix <b>18</b>M. However, the term “scanning range” may also refer to the range of relative travel of a single nozzle <b>418</b>, the range of relative travel of a single nozzle row <b>416</b>, or the range of relative travel of a single head <b>414</b>. The term “matrix <b>18</b>M” refers to the matrix constituted by the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The relative travel of the carriage <b>403</b>, the heads <b>414</b>, or the nozzles <b>418</b> refers to the change in the relative positions of these components with respect to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R. Therefore, the carriage <b>403</b>, the heads <b>414</b>, or the nozzles <b>418</b> are said to travel in relative fashion even when the carriage <b>403</b>, the heads <b>414</b>, or the nozzles <b>418</b> are absolutely still and only the deposit portions <b>350</b>R are moved by the stage <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, when the first scanning period begins, the carriage <b>403</b> moves in a relative fashion in the positive Y-axis direction (upward in the drawing) from the end E<b>1</b> of the scanning range <b>434</b>. When first nozzles <b>418</b>A enter the area that corresponds to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, the color filter material <b>305</b>R is then discharged into the corresponding deposit portions <b>350</b>R from the first nozzles <b>418</b>A during the first scanning period. More specifically, when the nozzles <b>418</b>A enter the area that corresponds to the transmissive portion <b>328</b> in the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, the first nozzles <b>418</b>A discharge the color filter material <b>305</b>R. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged once for each of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R during the first scanning period. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the positions or the landing positions BD, at which the nozzles <b>418</b>A discharge the color filter material <b>305</b>R, are indicated with black circles.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the second scanning period begins following the first scanning period, whereupon the carriage <b>403</b> begins to move in relative fashion from one end E<b>2</b> of the scanning range <b>434</b> in the negative Y-axis direction (downward in the drawing). When the first nozzles <b>418</b>A enter the area that corresponds to the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, the color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged into the corresponding deposit portions <b>350</b>R from the first nozzles <b>418</b>A during the second scanning period. More specifically, when the nozzles <b>418</b>A enter the area opposite the transmissive portion <b>328</b> in the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, the first nozzles <b>418</b>A discharge the color filter material <b>305</b>R. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged twice onto each of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R during the second scanning period. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the positions at which the nozzles <b>418</b>A discharge the color filter material <b>305</b>R, or, the landing positions BD, are indicated with black circles.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>a</i>), the color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged onto the transmissive portion <b>328</b> during the first scanning period. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>b</i>), when the color filter material <b>305</b>R lands in the transmissive portion <b>328</b>, the color filter material <b>305</b>R covers not only the transmissive portion <b>328</b> but also spreads out to cover the step positions at the boundary between the transmissive portion <b>328</b> and the reflective portions <b>326</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>c</i>), the color filter material <b>305</b>R is discharged into the portions substantially corresponding to the reflective portions <b>326</b> during the second scanning period. In this case, the droplets of the color filter material <b>305</b>R may be caused to land such that a portion thereof overlaps the transmissive portion <b>328</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>d</i>), the solvent is then evaporated from the color filter material <b>305</b>R discharged in the first and second scanning periods, and a layer of color filter material <b>305</b>R is formed in the deposit portion <b>350</b>R. The filter layer <b>305</b>FR is formed by further drying the layer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">With the discharging method described above, a liquid material is first discharged onto the concaved transmissive portion, and then onto the reflective portion. Accordingly, the liquid material not only covers the concaved transmissive portion and the reflective portion, but also the vicinity of the step between the reflective portion and the concaved transmissive portion. As a result, the color filter substrate <b>310</b> of the semi light-transmissive reflective display device <b>300</b> can easily be manufactured with an ink-jet device or other discharging device.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The discharging method described above is also applicable in discharging droplets <b>150</b> to form the color filters <b>40</b> and <b>45</b> of the first and second embodiments.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In the method described above, the discharging device <b>400</b>R discharges the color filter material <b>305</b>R into the deposit portion <b>350</b>R. The series of methods by which the color filter substrate <b>310</b> is manufactured by the manufacturing apparatus <b>400</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the substrate <b>310</b>A on which the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B are formed is transported to the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>R by the transport device <b>470</b>. The manufacturing apparatus <b>400</b> then discharges the color filter material <b>305</b>R from the discharging portion <b>427</b> of the head <b>414</b> so that a layer of color filter material <b>305</b>R is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25(</figref><i>a</i>). The method whereby the discharging device <b>400</b>G discharges the color filter material <b>305</b>R was described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. When a layer of color filter material <b>305</b>R is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R of the substrate <b>310</b>A, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>310</b>A in the drying device <b>450</b>R. The filter layer <b>305</b>FR is obtained on the deposit portion <b>350</b>R by completely drying the color filter material <b>305</b>R on the deposit portions <b>350</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>310</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>G.

The method whereby the discharging device <b>400</b>G discharges the color filter material <b>305</b>G is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. When a layer of the color filter material <b>305</b>G is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>G of the substrate <b>310</b>A, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>310</b>A in the drying device <b>450</b>G. The filter layer <b>305</b>FG is obtained on the deposit portion <b>350</b>G by completely drying the color filter material <b>305</b>G on the deposit portions <b>350</b>G.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>310</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>B.

The method whereby the discharging device <b>400</b>B discharges the color filter material <b>305</b>B is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. When the layer of color filter material <b>305</b>B is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>350</b>B of the substrate <b>310</b>A, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>310</b>A in the drying device <b>450</b>B. The filter layer <b>305</b>FB is obtained on the deposit portion <b>350</b>B by completely drying the color filter material <b>305</b>B on the deposit portions <b>350</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The banks <b>330</b> in the present embodiment possess a liquid repellency against the liquid color filter materials <b>305</b>R, <b>305</b>G, and <b>305</b>B. Furthermore, the liquid repellency of the black matrix <b>317</b> against the color filter materials <b>305</b>R, <b>305</b>G, and <b>305</b>B is smaller than the liquid repellency of the banks <b>330</b> against the color filter materials <b>305</b>R, <b>305</b>G, and <b>305</b>B. The black matrix <b>317</b> rather possesses lyophilic properties toward the liquid color filter materials <b>305</b>R, <b>305</b>G, and <b>305</b>B. This is because a fluorinated polymer is blended into the banks <b>330</b>, whereas the black matrix <b>317</b> does not contain a fluorinated polymer. Generally, a surface of a resin that contains fluorine demonstrates a higher liquid repellency against a dispersion medium contained in a liquid color filter material than a surface of a resin that does not contain fluorine therein. On the other hand, most resins that do not contain fluorine are lyophilic toward the above-mentioned liquid material.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">According to the present embodiment, the banks <b>330</b> have a relatively high liquid repellency. Therefore, droplets of color filter material that have just landed on the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B flow out towards the black matrix <b>317</b>, instead of flowing over the banks <b>330</b> and out of the deposit portions <b>350</b>R, <b>350</b>G, and <b>350</b>B. Furthermore, since both a layer having the desired liquid repellency and a lyophilic layer are formed, there is no need to perform a surface modification process for making the black matrix <b>317</b> and the banks <b>330</b> liquid repellent or lyophilic. For instance, there is no need to perform a plasma treatment that uses tetrafluoromethane as a treatment gas or an oxygen plasma treatment, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>310</b>A inside the oven <b>460</b>. The oven <b>460</b> reheats (post-bakes) the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>310</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>C.

After the flattening layer <b>334</b> is formed to cover the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB and the banks <b>330</b>, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>310</b>A inside the drying device <b>450</b>C. The drying device <b>450</b>C completely dries the flattening layer <b>334</b>, and then the curing device <b>465</b> heats and completely cures the flattening layer <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">A plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> is then formed on the flattening layer <b>334</b>, and an orientation film <b>338</b>A is provided for covering the plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> and the flattening layer <b>334</b>.

In view of the similarities between the third and fourth embodiments, the same referential numerals are used for constituent elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> that are the identical to the constituent elements described of the third embodiment. Furthermore, descriptions of the identical elements will be omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The liquid crystal display device <b>500</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is provided with a polarizing plate <b>320</b>A, a polarizing plate <b>320</b>B, a color filter substrate <b>380</b>, an opposing substrate <b>312</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>314</b>, and a light source <b>316</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> is positioned between the color filter substrate <b>380</b> and the opposing substrate <b>312</b>. The color filter substrate <b>380</b> is also positioned between the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> and the light source <b>316</b>. The color filter substrate <b>380</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b>, and the opposing substrate <b>312</b> are positioned between the polarizing plates <b>320</b>A and <b>320</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The color filter substrate <b>380</b> includes a light-transmissive substrate <b>372</b>; a resin scattering layer <b>371</b>; a reflective portion <b>366</b>; a transmissive portion <b>368</b>; a transparent coat layer <b>365</b>; a plurality of filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB; a black matrix <b>357</b>; banks <b>370</b>; a flattening layer <b>374</b>; a plurality of electrodes <b>336</b>; and an orientation film <b>338</b>A. In the present embodiment, the light-transmissive substrate <b>372</b> is positioned between the polarizing plate <b>320</b>A on the one side, and the reflective portions <b>366</b> and transmissive portions <b>368</b> on the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The resin scattering layer <b>371</b> is provided so as to cover the substrate <b>372</b>. Furthermore, the reflective portion <b>366</b> and the transmissive portion <b>368</b> are positioned on the resin scattering layer <b>371</b>. The reflective portion <b>366</b> and the transmissive portion <b>368</b> are both positioned in areas opposite the plurality of filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB, respectively. In the present embodiment, the reflective portions <b>366</b> are formed by an aluminum film, while the transmissive portions <b>368</b> are openings formed on the aluminum film.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The resin scattering layer <b>371</b> is provided with an irregular surface. The reflecting surface of the reflective portions <b>366</b> formed on the resin scattering layer <b>371</b> is therefore also formed with an irregular, rugged surface. The reflecting surface of the reflective portion <b>366</b> has an irregular shape, and thereby functions to reflect light in random directions.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The transparent coat layer <b>365</b> provided positioned on the reflective portion <b>366</b>. The transparent coat layer <b>365</b> is patterned in the same shape as the reflective portion <b>366</b>. One object of providing the transparent coat layer <b>365</b> is to reduce the color purity of the reflected light.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The black matrix <b>357</b> is positioned on a portion of the transparent coat layer <b>365</b>. The black matrix <b>357</b> has a plurality of opening surfaces <b>357</b>A. Specifically, the black matrix <b>357</b> is a light-blocking portion having a shape that defines the plurality of opening surfaces <b>357</b>A. The plurality of opening surfaces <b>357</b>A is arranged in a matrix, such that each of the opening surfaces <b>357</b>A corresponds to a pixel area G. The black matrix <b>357</b> is an example of the “first layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Each of the plurality of filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB corresponds to one of the three colors. Specifically, the filter layer <b>505</b>FR is a filter corresponding to red, the filter layer <b>505</b>FG is a filter corresponding to green, and the filter layer <b>505</b>FB is a filter corresponding to blue. The plurality of filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB is positioned on each of the plurality of opening surfaces <b>357</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The banks <b>370</b> are formed on the black matrix <b>357</b>. The planar shape of the banks <b>370</b> is the same as the planar shape of the black matrix <b>357</b>. As described in detail hereinafter, the liquid repellency of the banks <b>370</b> against the liquid color filter material for forming the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB is higher than the liquid repellency of the black matrix <b>357</b> against the color filter material. The banks <b>350</b> are an example of the “second layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The flattening layer <b>374</b> is positioned so as to cover the plurality of filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB and the banks <b>370</b>. Specifically, the flattening layer <b>374</b> covers a step formed between the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB and the banks <b>370</b>, such that a substantially flat surface is obtained. A plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> is positioned on the flattening layer <b>374</b>. The electrodes <b>336</b> are arranged in stripes that extend in the Y-axis direction (the direction perpendicular to the plane of paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) and are parallel to each other. The orientation film <b>338</b>A is positioned so as to cover the plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> and the flattening layer <b>374</b>. A rubbing treatment is performed on the orientation film <b>338</b>A in a prescribed direction.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As described above, reflective portions <b>366</b> and a transmissive portion <b>368</b> are each positioned in the color filter substrate <b>380</b> opposite one of the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB. The liquid crystal display device <b>500</b> having this type of color filter substrate <b>380</b> functions in the manner described below.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">When the backlight (light source <b>316</b>) is used, a light beam P from the backlight passes through the transmissive portion <b>368</b> after being transmitted through the polarizing plate <b>320</b>A and the substrate <b>372</b>. The light beam that passed through the transmissive portion <b>368</b> then enters one of the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB, such that a light beam of the corresponding wavelength exits from the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB. The light beam (colored light) from the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB is further transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> and the opposing substrate <b>312</b> and exits from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B. The intensity of the light beam that exits from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B can be adjusted by adjusting the light beam from the backlight according to the voltage applied between the electrodes <b>336</b> and the electrodes <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">On the other hand, when external light is used, the external light S is transmitted through the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B, the opposing substrate <b>312</b>, and the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b>, and is directed to one of the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB. From among the light beams transmitted through the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB, the light beam that is reflected by the reflective portion <b>326</b> is transmitted again through the filter layers <b>305</b>FR, <b>305</b>FG, and <b>305</b>FB, and is colored in the corresponding color. Each type of colored light is again transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> and the opposing substrate <b>312</b>, and is emitted from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B. The intensity of the light beam that originates as the external or other light beam and exits from the polarizing plate <b>320</b>B is adjusted by adjusting the voltage applied between the electrodes <b>336</b> and the electrodes <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">With the configuration described above, the first light beam that enters from the first side (upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) of the black matrix <b>357</b> and passes through one of the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB is reflected to the first side by the reflective portion <b>366</b>. On the other hand, the second light beam that enters from the second side (bottom side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) of the black matrix <b>357</b> exits to the first side via the transmissive portion <b>368</b> and one of the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB. The first side of the black matrix <b>357</b> is defined as the side on which the flattening layer <b>374</b> and liquid crystal layer <b>314</b> are positioned. The second side of the black matrix <b>357</b> is defined as the side on which the light source <b>316</b> is positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Thus, the liquid crystal display device <b>500</b> is capable of displaying an image using both external light and light from a backlight. The liquid crystal display device <b>500</b> having this type of functionality is referred to as a semi light-transmissive reflective display device.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB in the color filter substrate <b>380</b> are formed on the opening surfaces <b>357</b>A of the black matrix <b>357</b> by discharging a color filter material from an inkjet device or other discharging device.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In the present embodiment, the color filter substrate <b>380</b> prior to being provided with the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB is referred to as the “substrate <b>350</b>A.” The areas in which the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB are to be provided are also referred to as the “deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B” in the present embodiment. According to this notation, the concave portions in the substrate <b>380</b>A enclosed by the banks <b>370</b>, the black matrix <b>357</b>, the transparent coat layer <b>365</b>, and the transmissive portion <b>368</b> correspond to the deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B, in the present embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Method of Manufacturing Liquid Crystal Display Device <b>500</b></heading>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The method for manufacturing the liquid crystal display device <b>500</b> will next be described.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">First, the reflective portion <b>326</b> and the transmissive portion <b>328</b> are formed on a light-transmissive member. Specifically, a polyimide or other light-transmissive resin layer is formed by spin coating or other method so as to substantially cover the entire surface of a glass substrate or other light-transmissive substrate <b>372</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>a</i>), such that the surface of the resin layer is given an irregular rugged shape by blasting or other method. As a result, a resin scattering layer <b>371</b> is obtained. The resin scattering layer <b>371</b> herein corresponds to the above-mentioned “light-transmissive member.” An aluminum (Al) film is then formed on the resin scattering layer <b>371</b> by sputtering or other method. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>b</i>), the above-mentioned Al film is then patterned so that reflective portions <b>366</b> and a transmissive portion <b>368</b> are formed for each pixel area G. The Al film remaining on the resin scattering layer <b>371</b> after patterning is the reflective portions <b>366</b>, and the portions from which the Al film is removed are the transmissive portions <b>368</b>. The reflective portions <b>366</b> and the transmissive portion <b>368</b> are thereby formed on the light-transmissive member.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The transparent coat layer <b>365</b> is then applied to cover the reflective portion <b>366</b> and the resin scattering layer <b>371</b>, and is patterned in the same shape as the reflective portion <b>366</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>c</i>). As a result, the light-transmissive coat layers <b>365</b> are obtained on the reflective portions <b>366</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">A layer of first material is then formed covering the reflective portions <b>366</b> and the transmissive portions <b>368</b>. In this embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>d</i>), a thermosetting acrylic resin in which a black pigment is dispersed (resin black) is applied, up to a thickness of about 3 μm, as the first material over the light-transmissive coat layers <b>365</b> as well as over the substrate <b>372</b> that is exposed between the light-transmissive coat layers <b>365</b> (in other words, between the reflective portion <b>366</b>). As a result, a resin black layer <b>357</b>′ is obtained. The resin black layer <b>357</b>′ in this case is an example of the “first material layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The second material layer is then formed by applying a resist on the first material layer. Specifically, a chemical amplification-type acrylic photosensitive resist in which a fluorinated polymer is blended is applied so as to cover the entire surface of the resin black layer <b>357</b>′ as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>d</i>). As a result, a resist layer <b>370</b>′ is obtained on the resin black layer <b>357</b>′. The resist layer <b>370</b>′ herein is an example of the “second material layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Patterning is then performed on the resist layer <b>370</b>′ and the resin black layer <b>357</b>′. Specifically, the resist layer <b>370</b>′ is irradiated with light hν via a photomask. The photomask has light-blocking portions in positions that correspond to pixel areas G. A plurality of portions of the resist layer <b>370</b>′ and the resin black layer <b>357</b>′ not irradiated with light hν, which are the portions corresponding to the plurality of pixel areas G, are then removed by etching using a prescribed etching fluid. A black matrix <b>357</b> and banks <b>370</b> that enclose the subsequently formed filter layer are thus obtained simultaneously on the substrate <b>372</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>e</i>). In other words, the opening surfaces <b>357</b>A opposite the reflective portion <b>366</b> and t the ransmissive portion <b>368</b> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">As described previously, the areas defined or enclosed by the black matrix <b>357</b>, the banks <b>370</b>, the light-transmissive coat layers <b>365</b>, and the transmissive portions <b>368</b> are the deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B. The banks <b>370</b> are also light-transmissive. As described previously, the black matrix <b>317</b> is also an example of the “first layer” of the present invention; and the banks <b>330</b> are an example of the “second layer” of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Areas (in other words, the deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B) compartmentalized by the black matrix <b>357</b> and the banks <b>370</b> are thus provided in the substrate <b>380</b>A by forming the black matrix <b>357</b> and the banks <b>370</b> positioned on the black matrix <b>357</b> on the substrate <b>372</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Method of Manufacturing Color Filter Substrate <b>380</b></heading>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The substrate <b>380</b>A on which the deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B are formed is transported to the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>R by the transport device <b>470</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). The discharging device <b>400</b>R then discharges the color filter material <b>505</b>R from the head <b>414</b> so that a layer of color filter material <b>505</b>R is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>550</b>R as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>a</i>). The method whereby the discharging device <b>400</b>R discharges the color filter material <b>505</b>R is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R in the previous embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. When a layer of color filter material <b>505</b>R is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>550</b>R of the substrate <b>380</b>A, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>380</b>A in the drying device <b>450</b>R. The filter layer <b>505</b>FR is obtained on the deposit portion <b>550</b>R by completely drying the color filter material <b>505</b>R on the deposit portions <b>550</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>380</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>G. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>b</i>), the discharging device <b>400</b>G discharges the color filter material <b>505</b>G from the head <b>414</b> so that a layer of color filter material <b>505</b>G is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>550</b>G. The method whereby the discharging device <b>400</b>G discharges the color filter material <b>505</b>G is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R in the third embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. When a layer of color filter material <b>505</b>G is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>550</b>G of the substrate <b>380</b>A, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>380</b>A in the drying device <b>450</b>G. The filter layer <b>505</b>FG is obtained on the deposit portion <b>550</b>G by completely drying the color filter material <b>505</b>G on the deposit portions <b>550</b>G.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>380</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>B. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>c</i>), the discharging device <b>400</b>B discharges the color filter material <b>505</b>B from the head <b>414</b> so that a layer of color filter material <b>505</b>B is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>550</b>B. The method whereby the discharging device <b>400</b>B discharges the color filter material <b>505</b>B is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material <b>305</b>R in the previous embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>. When a layer of color filter material <b>505</b>B is formed in all of the deposit portions <b>550</b>B of the substrate <b>380</b>A, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>380</b>A in the drying device <b>450</b>B. The filter layer <b>505</b>FB is obtained on the deposit portions <b>550</b>B by completely drying the color filter material <b>505</b>B on the deposit portions <b>550</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The banks <b>370</b> in the present embodiment possess a liquid repellency against the liquid color filter materials <b>505</b>R, <b>505</b>G, and <b>505</b>B. Furthermore, the liquid repellency of the black matrix <b>357</b> against the color filter materials <b>505</b>R, <b>505</b>G, and <b>505</b>B is smaller than the liquid repellency of the banks <b>370</b> against the color filter materials <b>505</b>R, <b>505</b>G, and <b>505</b>B. The black matrix <b>357</b> rather possesses lyophilic properties toward the liquid color filter materials <b>505</b>R, <b>505</b>G, and <b>505</b>B. This is because a fluorinated polymer is blended into the banks <b>370</b>, whereas the black matrix <b>357</b> does not contain a fluorinated polymer. Generally, the surface of a resin that contains fluorine demonstrates a higher liquid repellency against the above-mentioned liquid material than the surface of a resin that does not contain fluorine. On the other hand, most resins that do not contain fluorine are lyophilic toward the above-mentioned liquid material.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">According to the present embodiment, the banks <b>370</b> have a relatively high liquid repellency. Therefore, droplets of color filter material that have just landed on the deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B flow out towards the black matrix <b>357</b>, instead of flowing over the banks <b>370</b> and out of the deposit portions <b>550</b>R, <b>550</b>G, and <b>550</b>B. Furthermore, since a layer having the desired liquid repellency and a lyophilic layer are formed, there is no need to perform a surface modification process for making the black matrix <b>357</b> and the banks <b>370</b> liquid repellent or lyophilic. For instance, there is no need for a plasma treatment that uses tetrafluoromethane as a treatment gas or an oxygen plasma treatment, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>380</b>A inside the oven <b>460</b>. The oven <b>460</b> then reheats (post-bakes) the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The transport device <b>470</b> then positions the substrate <b>380</b>A on the stage <b>406</b> of the discharging device <b>400</b>C. The discharging device <b>400</b>C discharges a liquid material so that the flattening layer <b>374</b> is formed covering the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB and the banks <b>370</b>. After the flattening layer <b>374</b> is formed covering the filter layers <b>505</b>FR, <b>505</b>FG, and <b>505</b>FB and the banks <b>370</b>, the transport device <b>470</b> positions the substrate <b>380</b>A inside the drying device <b>450</b>C. The drying device <b>450</b>C completely dries the flattening layer <b>374</b>, and then the curing device <b>465</b> heats and completely cures the flattening layer <b>374</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">A plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> is then formed on the flattening layer <b>374</b>, and an orientation film <b>338</b>A is provided for covering the plurality of electrodes <b>336</b> and the flattening layer <b>374</b>. In this manner, the substrate <b>380</b>A becomes a color filter substrate <b>380</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The color filter substrate <b>380</b> and the separately fabricated opposing substrate <b>312</b> are then bonded to each other such that the orientation film <b>338</b>A and the orientation film <b>338</b>B face each other across an intervening spacer. Liquid crystal material is then filled into the space between the orientation films <b>338</b>A and <b>338</b>B. Polarizing plates <b>320</b>A and <b>320</b>B are then provided, and then a light source <b>316</b> is provided. In this manner, a liquid crystal display device <b>500</b> is obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The organic EL unit <b>52</b> includes an EL substrate <b>55</b>, a plurality of switching elements <b>56</b> formed on the EL substrate <b>55</b>, an insulating film <b>57</b> formed on the switching elements <b>56</b>, a plurality of EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b> formed on the insulating film <b>57</b>, banks <b>58</b> each having an inorganic bank <b>58</b><i>a </i>and an organic bank <b>58</b><i>b </i>and formed between the plurality of EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b>, a positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b> formed on the EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b>, a white luminescent layer <b>61</b> formed on the positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b>, and an EL counter electrode <b>62</b> provided so as to cover the luminescent layer <b>61</b> and the banks <b>58</b>. Furthermore, the shared substrate <b>64</b> of the color filter unit <b>51</b>, which is attached to the EL substrate <b>55</b> at its periphery, is arranged on the EL counter electrode <b>62</b>. An inert gas <b>63</b> is inserted between the shared substrate <b>64</b> and the EL counter electrode <b>62</b>, thus forming the electro-optic device <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The EL substrate <b>55</b>, the shared substrate <b>64</b>, and the front substrate <b>11</b>″ in the electro-optic device <b>600</b> thus configured are light-transmissive glass substrates, for example. The coloring layers <b>6</b>R″, <b>6</b>G″, and <b>6</b>B″ of the color filter unit <b>51</b> are arranged in a grid such as the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The luminescent layer <b>61</b>, the EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b>, the positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b>, the luminescent layer <b>61</b>, and the EL counter electrode <b>62</b> of the organic EL unit <b>52</b> are each arranged opposite the coloring layers <b>6</b>″. The positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b> is positioned between the EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b> and the luminescent layer <b>61</b>, and is designed to increase the efficiency of light emission by the luminescent layer <b>61</b>. The EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b> and EL counter electrode <b>62</b> may, for example, be light-transmissive ITO electrodes. Each of the EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b> and the EL counter electrode <b>62</b> is electrically connected to the switching elements <b>56</b> to control the luminescence of the luminescent layer <b>61</b>. The luminescent layer <b>61</b> emits white light. This white light is colored by either of the red, green, and the blue coloring layers <b>6</b>″ to be converted to colored light, and is emitted from the front substrate <b>11</b>″. Specifically, the organic EL unit <b>52</b> acts as a light source that corresponds to each of the coloring layers <b>6</b>R″, <b>6</b>G″, and <b>6</b>B″.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b> and the luminescent layer <b>61</b>, which are essential components of the organic EL unit <b>52</b>, can be efficiently formed by the droplet-discharging device <b>100</b>. First, the EL substrate <b>55</b>, on which the switching elements <b>56</b>, the insulating film <b>57</b>, the EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b>, and the banks <b>58</b> are formed, is mounted on the mounting platform <b>121</b> as the work <b>120</b>. The X-axis direction and Y-axis direction of the mounting direction are determined so as to correspond with those of the coloring layers <b>6</b>R″, <b>6</b>G″, and <b>6</b>B″ as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Droplets of material for forming the positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b> are discharged from the nozzles <b>117</b> while the discharge heads <b>116</b> move in a relative fashion in the X-axis direction. Accordingly, droplets are deposited in the concave portions that are defined by the banks <b>58</b> and the EL pixel electrodes <b>59</b> and are lined up in the X-axis direction. The positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b> is completed by repeating this relative movement several times as necessary. The number of times this depositing operation must be performed is determined according to the arrangement of the nozzles <b>117</b> and the number of rows of the concave portions in the Y-axis direction. After the droplets of the positive-hole transport layer-forming material are dried, droplets of an EL luminescent material are discharged onto the positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b>, and a luminescent layer <b>61</b> is formed in the same manner as the manner by which the positive-hole transport layer <b>60</b> was formed. After the process involving the droplet-discharging device <b>100</b> is completed, the luminescent layer <b>61</b> is dried, the EL counter electrode <b>62</b> is formed, and both components are bonded together so as to provide a match between the coloring layers <b>6</b>″ of the color filter unit <b>15</b> and the luminescent layer <b>61</b> of the organic EL unit <b>52</b>. Lastly, an inert gas <b>63</b> is filled into the space between the EL counter electrode <b>62</b> and the shared substrate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">With this electro-optic device <b>600</b>, the luminescent layer <b>61</b> of the organic EL unit <b>52</b> is arranged opposite the coloring layers <b>6</b>R″, <b>6</b>G″, and <b>6</b>B″ of the color filter unit <b>51</b>. Only parts of the luminescent layer <b>61</b> that correspond to coloring layers <b>6</b>″ of the necessary color emit light. Therefore, it is possible to obtain an extremely low-power display device. Due to the colorless boundary layer <b>5</b> of the color filter unit <b>51</b>, colorless bright light exits from the front substrate <b>11</b>″, and the overall display is brightened and made easier to see. Alternatively, the organic EL unit <b>52</b> may also include an electronic emission element FED (Field Emission Display) and a SED (Surface-Conduction Electron-Emitter Display).</p>
