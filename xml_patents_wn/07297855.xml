<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a keyboard apparatus having mass bodies that pivotally move in accordance with a key operation and a method for producing the keyboard apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3060938, a keyboard apparatus is known in which mass bodies corresponding to each key are provided to apply an appropriate inertial force when the key is depressed. This keyboard apparatus is arranged such that mass bodies are pivotally disposed in a key frame or the like, so that the mass bodies pivotally move in accordance with a pivotal movement of the corresponding keys. Each key is provided with a driving part, and a driven part that corresponds to the driving part is provided in the mass body. In response to depression of the key, the driving part drives the driven part such that the mass body turns in association with the key.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the above described conventional keyboard apparatus, in order to attach each key to the key frame, the rear end part of the key must be pivotally engaged with a key pivot part, and the driving part of the key must be engaged with the driven part of the corresponding mass body by fitting or the like. It is also necessary to engage the front end part of the key with a key movement guide.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, in the process of attaching a key, know-how is required to carry out appropriate alignment and the like in order to engage all the places that should be engaged appropriately, and this work requires skill and experience. For example, it is necessary to carry out an operation to engage the rear end part of a key with a key pivot part while, at substantially the same time, engaging a driving part of the key with a driven part of a mass body. This operation must be carried out for each key, and thus it takes a long time to attach all the keys. Consequently, a problem with a keyboard apparatus provided with mass bodies that pivotally move in accordance with a key operation has been that operations for attaching the keys, in particular, are not easily carried out.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings showing preferred embodiments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First, a first embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of a keyboard apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. This keyboard apparatus <b>1</b> is configured as an electronic keyboard musical instrument. Hereafter, the player side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b> is referred to as “the front.”</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b>, a key frame <b>10</b> is disposed inside a casing that is comprised of an upper case <b>60</b> and a lower case <b>70</b>. A plurality of key units KU which are comprised of a plurality of white keys <b>20</b> and a plurality of black keys <b>40</b> are disposed in the key frame <b>10</b>. A common base end part <b>30</b> of each key unit KU is fixedly held by the key frame <b>10</b>, and respective free ends of the white keys <b>20</b> and the black keys <b>40</b> are provided such that they pivotally move (or swing) in a vertical direction. The configuration of the key unit KU is described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The key frame <b>10</b> is joined to the lower case <b>70</b> by a plurality of screws <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> and <b>74</b>. The lower case <b>70</b>, the upper case <b>60</b> and the key frame <b>10</b> are joined at the respective front parts thereof by securing these parts together with a plurality of screws <b>71</b>. Further, the lower case <b>70</b> and the upper case <b>60</b> are joined by a plurality of screws at appropriate positions in their respective rear parts (not shown in the figure). At a lower part of the lower case <b>70</b> is formed a concave part <b>18</b> for housing a battery or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereafter, the same symbols may be used for elements corresponding to the white keys <b>20</b> and the black keys <b>40</b> and elements of the same kind among the constituent elements of the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b>. However, when it is necessary to distinguish between elements corresponding to the white keys <b>20</b> and elements corresponding to the black keys <b>40</b>, a distinction is made by adding the reference character “W” or “B”, respectively, after the relevant symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Mass bodies <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>W, <b>50</b>B) are provided in the key frame <b>10</b> in a manner corresponding to the white keys <b>20</b> and black keys <b>40</b> respectively. Each of the mass bodies <b>50</b>W, <b>50</b>B are supported by respective bearings <b>51</b> such that the mass bodies <b>50</b>W, <b>50</b>B can pivotally move in a vertical direction about a pivot <b>14</b> (<b>14</b>W, <b>14</b>B; described later in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that is provided in mass body support ribs <b>13</b> (<b>13</b>W, <b>13</b>B; described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) formed in the key frame <b>10</b>. The mass of each of the mass bodies <b>50</b>W, <b>50</b>B is mainly concentrated on rear end parts <b>52</b> (<b>52</b>W, <b>52</b>B) of the mass bodies <b>50</b>W, <b>50</b>B. Each mass body <b>50</b> pivotally moves in accordance with movement of the corresponding key (described in detail later), and whereby the mass body <b>50</b> applies an appropriate inertial force to the corresponding key to realize a touch feeling that is similar to that of an acoustic piano.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An upper limit stopper <b>83</b> is provided on the upper side of the rear part of the key frame <b>10</b>, and a lower limit stopper <b>84</b> is provided on the lower side of the rear part of the key frame <b>10</b>. Although the upper limit stopper <b>83</b> and the lower limit stopper <b>84</b> may be provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the keys, in the present embodiment the upper limit stopper <b>83</b> and the lower limit stopper <b>84</b> are commonly provided for a plurality of keys (for example, for all keys or for all keys in a single key unit KU). A non-depressed position (initial position) of the mass body <b>50</b> and the key corresponding thereto is defined by the rear end part <b>52</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> being held in contact against the lower limit stopper <b>84</b>. In contrast, a key depression end position (pivotal movement end position) of the mass body <b>50</b> and the key corresponding thereto is defined by contact of the rear end part <b>52</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> against the upper limit stopper <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Key-on switches <b>81</b> are provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the white keys <b>20</b> and the black keys <b>40</b> on a base plate <b>80</b> provided in the key frame <b>10</b>. These key-on switches <b>81</b> detect depression operations for the corresponding keys. Musical sound is generated by an unshown musical sound generating part based on the results of detection by the key-on switches <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Key guide parts <b>12</b> that guide a key depression operation are provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the white keys <b>20</b> at the front part of the key frame <b>10</b>. A key guided part <b>33</b> (described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that engages with the key guide part <b>12</b> is formed at a front end part <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the white key <b>20</b>, and by engagement of the key guide part <b>12</b> and the key guided part <b>33</b> with each other, horizontal movement of the front end part <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the white key <b>20</b> is limited such that the front end part <b>20</b><i>a </i>moves appropriately in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of the single key unit KU. The key unit KU is comprised of two white key units KUW (KUW<b>1</b>, KUW<b>2</b>) and one black key unit KUB. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the key unit KUB is shown by a phantom line. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of the rear half of the key unit KU.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, according to the present embodiment each key unit KU is configured by taking one octave as a unit, the present embodiment is not limited thereto and any configuration may be adopted as long as it includes a plurality of keys, and the configuration may be one in which keys of two octaves or more are combined. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the white key unit KUW consists of a first white key unit KUW<b>1</b> in which white keys <b>20</b> for the pitch names “D, F, and A” are integrally connected at a base end part <b>21</b> and a second white key unit KUW<b>2</b> in which white keys <b>20</b> for “C, E, G, and B” are integrally connected at the base end part <b>21</b>. In the black key unit KUB, the black keys <b>40</b> for the pitch names “C#, D#, F#, G#, and A#” are integrally connected at a base end part <b>41</b>. The common base end part <b>30</b> is composed of the base end part <b>21</b> and the base end part <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">White key main bodies <b>23</b> are coupled to the base end parts <b>21</b> of the first white key unit KUW<b>1</b> and the second white key unit KUW<b>2</b>, respectively, through vertical hinge parts <b>24</b> and horizontal hinges <b>22</b> that are each in the form of a thin plate. The vertical hinge part <b>24</b> that is joined to the base end part <b>21</b> can bend easily in the horizontal direction, and in a free state it allows swinging of the free end of the white key main body <b>23</b> in a key-alignment direction (horizontal direction). By synergistic action of the vertical hinge part <b>24</b> with the key guided part <b>33</b> and key guide part <b>12</b> that are described later, displacement of the white key main body <b>23</b> in the key-alignment direction due to a production error or assembly error or the like can be appropriately corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The horizontal hinge <b>22</b> that connects to the front side of the vertical hinge part <b>24</b> bends easily in the vertical direction, and in a free state it allows the free end of the white key main body <b>23</b> to pivotally move in a key depression/release direction (vertical direction) with respect to the base end part <b>21</b> and the vertical hinge part <b>24</b>. In a strict sense, a part connecting the horizontal hinge <b>22</b> and the vertical hinge part <b>24</b> constitutes a pivot part of the white key main body <b>23</b>. At an upper part of the rear part of the white key main body <b>23</b>, a recess portion <b>25</b> is formed to prevent interference with the black key <b>40</b> when the black key <b>40</b> pivotally moves (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the black key unit KUB, the black key main bodies <b>43</b> are coupled to the base end part <b>41</b> through laminated horizontal hinges <b>42</b>. As shown by chain double-dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two of the horizontal hinges <b>42</b> are provided for each of the black key main bodies <b>43</b>, and are formed at positions in which they are spaced from each other. Similarly to the horizontal hinge <b>22</b>, the horizontal hinge <b>42</b> allows the free end of the black key main body <b>43</b> to pivotally move in the key depression/release direction with respect to the base end part <b>41</b>. In a strict sense, a part connecting the horizontal hinge <b>42</b> and the base end part <b>41</b> constitutes a pivot part of the black key main body <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The base end part <b>21</b> of the second white key unit KUW<b>2</b>, the base end part <b>21</b> of the first white key unit KUW<b>1</b>, and the base end part <b>41</b> of the black key unit KUB are fitted in a layered manner in that order from the bottom, and these base end parts <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>41</b> constitute the common base end part <b>30</b>. A plurality of screw fastening holes <b>26</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>44</b> are formed in the base end parts <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>41</b>, respectively. At the lower part of the base end part <b>21</b> of the second white key unit KUW<b>2</b>, which is also the lower part of the common base end part <b>30</b>, contact surfaces <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> are formed in mutual opposition. The contact surfaces <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> serve as positioning references in the front-to-rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At an upper part that is slightly rear of the center in the front-to-rear direction in the key frame <b>10</b>, securing parts <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> for securing the common base end part <b>30</b> are formed in correspondence to the contact surfaces <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> (refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The securing parts <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are formed by a front end surface and a rear end surface, respectively, of a portion protruding upward from the key frame <b>10</b>. At intermediate positions between the securing parts <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> in the front-to-rear direction in the key frame <b>10</b>, a plurality of screw holes <b>17</b> are formed in correspondence to the screw fastening holes <b>26</b> and <b>44</b> (refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The common base end part <b>30</b> can be tightly secured to the key frame <b>10</b> by bringing the contact surfaces <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> of the common base end part <b>30</b> into contact with the securing parts <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and screwing the screw <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) into the screw hole <b>17</b> through the screw fastening holes <b>26</b> and <b>44</b> of the common base end part <b>30</b>. The white keys <b>20</b> and black keys <b>40</b> thereby enter a state in which the white and black keys <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> pivotally move in response to a performance operation. In this connection, the fixing state of the common base end part <b>30</b> is not limited to the above described state.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the unified key unit KU, the horizontal hinges <b>42</b> of the black keys <b>40</b> are positioned further rearward that the horizontal hinges <b>22</b> of the white keys <b>20</b>. Thus, the distance from the free end of the black keys <b>40</b> to the above described pivot part is made as long as possible to enhance the performance operability of the black keys <b>40</b>. Further, the positions in the front-to-rear direction of the vertical hinge parts <b>24</b> and the horizontal hinges <b>42</b> substantially match, and thus the vertical hinge parts <b>24</b> of the white keys <b>20</b> are positioned almost directly below the horizontal hinges <b>42</b> of the black keys <b>40</b>. More specifically, the vertical hinge parts <b>24</b> are disposed in a manner that effectively utilizes the space below the horizontal hinges <b>42</b>. The upper end surface of the vertical hinge part <b>24</b> forms a sloping surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>that slopes slightly downward towards the front (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As a result, interference between the vertical hinge parts <b>24</b> and the horizontal hinges <b>42</b> of the black keys <b>40</b> can be avoided when the black keys <b>40</b> pivotally move in the downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a sectional view of the front half of the white key <b>20</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a view of a back side surface of the front half of the white key <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view (partial sectional view) of a front half of the black key <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a fragmentary plan view showing a state in which the mass bodies <b>50</b> are arranged in the key frame <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a fragmentary front view of the key frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the above described mass body support ribs <b>13</b> are formed in the key frame <b>10</b>. The key frame <b>10</b> is made of resin, and is injection molded using a metal mold. The mass body support ribs <b>13</b> are formed such that they are integrated with the key frame <b>10</b> on the top surface of the key frame <b>10</b>, and the mass body support ribs <b>13</b> extend in the shape of a thin plate along the front-to-rear direction and vertical direction. Mass body support ribs <b>13</b>W and <b>13</b>B are provided in pairs, respectively, in one-to-one correspondence with the white keys <b>20</b> and black keys <b>40</b>, respectively. All the mass body support ribs <b>13</b>W and all the mass body support ribs <b>13</b>B are provided at the same position in the front-to-rear direction. The mass body support ribs <b>13</b>B are positioned further rearward than the mass body support ribs <b>13</b>W, and there is only a small overlapping portion between the mass body support ribs <b>13</b>W and the mass body support ribs <b>13</b>B in the front-to-rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The above described pivot <b>14</b>W and the above described pivot <b>14</b>B extend across each pair of mass body support ribs <b>13</b>W and each pair of mass body support ribs <b>13</b>B, respectively. The pivot <b>14</b>B is positioned further rearward than the pivot <b>14</b>W, and these two pivots do not overlap in the front-to-rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A sloping surface <b>19</b> is formed at the front part of the key frame <b>10</b>. As described later, the sloping surface <b>19</b> fulfills a mounting guide function when attaching the mass bodies <b>50</b> to the key frame <b>10</b> and when attaching the key unit KU thereto. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, horizontally parallel ribs <b>11</b> are formed at positions corresponding to the white keys <b>20</b> at the most frontward part of the key frame <b>10</b>. The above described key guide parts <b>12</b> that extend vertically are integrally formed such that the key guide parts <b>12</b> connect to the front surface of the ribs <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bearing <b>51</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> opens to the rear. By fitting the bearing <b>51</b> into the pivot <b>14</b> from the open side thereof, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mass bodies <b>50</b>W and <b>50</b>B pivotally move around the pivots <b>14</b>W and pivots <b>14</b>B, respectively. When the mass body <b>50</b> is in a free state in which the mass body <b>50</b> can pivotally move on the pivot <b>14</b> (state in which the key is not yet disposed), a rear end part <b>52</b> contacts against the lower limit stopper <b>84</b> due to its own weight (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such that the front end part is positioned upward and the rear end part <b>52</b> is positioned downward.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Tongues <b>56</b> (<b>56</b>W, <b>56</b>B) are provided in a condition extending toward the rear from the underside of the bearing <b>51</b> of the mass body <b>50</b>. The tongues <b>56</b> are made from soft resin or the like and are flexible. The tongues <b>56</b> fulfill a guide function when fitting the bearing <b>51</b> into the pivot <b>14</b>. In the open part of the bearing <b>51</b>, the area in the vicinity of the base of the tongue <b>56</b> is narrower than in the vicinity of the tip of the tongue <b>56</b>, and it is thus difficult for the pivot <b>14</b> that was fitted into the bearing <b>51</b> to fall out.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the front end parts of the mass bodies <b>50</b>W and <b>50</b>B are provided with upper engaging pieces <b>54</b>W and <b>54</b>B and lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>W and <b>53</b>B as driven parts that are driven by the white keys <b>20</b> and the black keys <b>40</b>, respectively. Fitting concave parts <b>55</b>W and <b>55</b>B are formed between these upper engaging pieces <b>54</b>W, <b>54</b>B and lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>W, <b>53</b>B, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this case, the positional relationships in the front-to-rear direction and vertical direction is the same for the upper engaging pieces <b>54</b>W and the upper engaging pieces <b>54</b>B, and the same for the lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>W and the lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>B. By providing the pivot <b>14</b>B further rearward than the pivot <b>14</b>W, the distance between the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>B and the pivot <b>14</b>B is longer than the distance between the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>W and the pivot <b>14</b>W (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Thus, considering that the mass bodies <b>50</b>, for which the mass of the rear end part <b>52</b> is the same, pivotally move individually, due to the leverage relationship, when the lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>W and <b>53</b>B are driven, the mass body <b>50</b>B is pivotally moved by a weaker driving force than the mass body <b>50</b>W.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, at a lower part of the front half of the white key <b>20</b>, a driving hanging piece <b>29</b> is integrally provided in a condition in which the driving hanging piece <b>29</b> hangs downward. An elastic member <b>31</b>W such as rubber or the like is secured at the lower end portion of the driving hanging piece <b>29</b>. The (lower end of the) elastic member <b>31</b>W functions as a driving part that directly drives the corresponding mass body SOW. More specifically, after the key unit KU has been appropriately attached to the key frame <b>10</b>, the elastic member <b>31</b>W engages between the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>W and the upper engaging piece <b>54</b>W in the fitting concave part <b>55</b>W of the mass body <b>50</b>W such that the elastic member <b>31</b>W constantly contacts with an upper surface <b>53</b>Wa of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>W and a lower surface <b>54</b>Wa of the upper engaging piece <b>54</b>W.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, when the white key <b>20</b> is depressed, the elastic member <b>31</b>W of the driving hanging piece <b>29</b> of the white key <b>20</b> in question drives the upper surface <b>53</b>Wa of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>W of the corresponding mass body <b>50</b>W, such that the mass body <b>50</b>W pivotally moves in the key depression direction (direction in which the front end part of the mass body <b>50</b>W moves downward) in response to the movement of the white key <b>20</b>. In contrast, when the white key <b>20</b> is released from the key depression, due to the self weight of the mass body <b>50</b>W and the return force caused by the elasticity of the horizontal hinge <b>22</b> of the white key <b>20</b>, the mass body <b>50</b>W pivotally moves in the key release direction (direction in which the front end part of the mass body <b>50</b>W moves upward) together with the white key <b>20</b>. Accordingly, in a performance operation, the white key <b>20</b> and the mass body <b>50</b>W always pivotally move in accordance with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The configuration of the front end part of the mass body <b>50</b>B and the engaging relationship between the black key <b>40</b> and the mass body <b>50</b>B are the same as those between the white key <b>20</b> and the mass body <b>50</b>W. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at a lower part of the front half of the black key <b>40</b>, a driving hanging piece <b>45</b> is integrally provided in a condition in which the driving hanging piece <b>45</b> hangs downward (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). An elastic member <b>31</b>B that is secured at the lower end of the driving hanging piece <b>45</b> engages between the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>B and the upper engaging piece <b>54</b>B in the fitting concave part <b>55</b>B of the mass body <b>50</b>B such that the elastic member <b>31</b>B constantly contacts against an upper surface <b>53</b>Ba of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>B and a lower surface <b>54</b>Ba of the upper engaging piece <b>54</b>B. The action and movement between the black key <b>40</b> and the mass body <b>50</b>B during a performance operation are also the same as those between the white key <b>20</b> and the mass body <b>50</b>W.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the above described key guided part <b>33</b> is formed in the front end part <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the white key <b>20</b>. The key guided part <b>33</b> is a long slit in a substantially vertical direction, and has a slightly larger width than the key guide part <b>12</b>. A guide part <b>32</b> that connects to the front part of the key guided part <b>33</b> is integrally formed on both the left and right sides of the key guided part <b>33</b>. When attaching the key unit KU to the key frame <b>10</b>, the guide part <b>32</b> fulfills a guiding function such that the key guide part <b>12</b> appropriately engages with the key guided part <b>33</b>. A lubricant is coated on a sliding surface of the key guide part <b>12</b> and the key guided part <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the above described sloping surface <b>19</b> provided at the front part of the key frame <b>10</b> slopes downward towards the rear. When the mass body <b>50</b> is moved rearward from the front to be attached to the key frame <b>10</b>, the sloping surface <b>19</b> contacts against lower surfaces <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the front end part of the mass body <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to limit their positions in the vertical direction, and acts in cooperation with the tongue <b>56</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> to guide the mass body <b>50</b> so that the bearing <b>51</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> fits appropriately on the pivot <b>14</b>. In a state in which the mass body <b>50</b> is attached to the key frame <b>10</b>, when the key unit KU is moved rearward from the front to be attached to the key frame <b>10</b>, the sloping surface <b>19</b> contacts against the elastic member <b>31</b> of each key to restrict the position of the elastic member <b>31</b> in the vertical direction, and to guide the key unit KU so that the elastic member <b>31</b> of each key fits in the fitting concave part <b>55</b> of the corresponding mass body <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this case, with respect to the sloping surface <b>19</b>, the sectional form in a side view direction of each portion that fulfills the mounting guide function by contacting against the lower surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>of each mass body <b>50</b> or the elastic member <b>31</b> of each key is the same. More specifically, although the sloping surface <b>19</b> need not necessarily have a uniform flat surface across the entire width of the keyboard, and a concave part or the like may be present at some locations, all of the sections that fulfill the guide function are flush with respect to each other. Thus, the processing of a metal mold that is used to form the key frame <b>10</b> is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the position of the sloping surface <b>19</b> in the vertical direction is adjacent to the upper end position of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b> of the attached mass body <b>50</b>. As a result, when attaching the key unit KU, the elastic member <b>31</b> moves by smoothly sliding on the sloping surface <b>19</b>, and easily rides on the upper surface <b>53</b>Wa of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b>W to thereby engage easily into the fitting concave part <b>55</b> of the mass body <b>50</b>. Further, a clearance C<b>1</b> between the rear end of the sloping surface <b>19</b> and the front end of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> is less than the smaller one of the widths in the front-to-rear direction of the driving hanging pieces <b>29</b> and <b>45</b> of the white keys <b>20</b> and the black keys <b>40</b> (for example, the width of the driving hanging piece <b>45</b>). Thus, when attaching the key unit KU, the driving hanging pieces <b>29</b> and <b>45</b> are smoothly guided without falling down from the clearance C<b>1</b>. Further, in attaching the key unit KU, the slope of the sloping surface <b>19</b> allows the key unit KU to be moved rearward by utilizing the self weight of the key unit KU when the key unit KU is merely pushed lightly or released at an appropriate position. Thus, the attachment is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The method of attaching the mass bodies <b>50</b> and the key unit KU to the key frame <b>10</b> according to this configuration will now be described in further detail. Here, conventionally the position of a driven part that corresponds to the lower engaging piece <b>53</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> is clearly different in the front-to-rear direction and vertical direction between a driven part corresponding to a white key and a driven part corresponding to a black key. Therefore, it has been difficult for an ordinary worker to attach a plurality of keys at the same time, and in practice a work method has been employed in which each key is attached individually. However, as described below, according to the present embodiment it is possible to easily attach the key unit KU having the plurality of keys integrated therein.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, all of the mass bodies <b>50</b> are attached one-by-one to the key frame <b>10</b>. More specifically, with the open side of the bearing <b>51</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> facing the pivot <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the mass body <b>50</b> is moved rearward while sliding the lower surfaces <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the front end part of the mass body <b>50</b> on the sloping surface <b>19</b>. The bearing <b>51</b> is then fitted into the pivot <b>14</b> so that the mass body <b>50</b> pivotally moves around the pivot <b>14</b>. When attachment of all the mass bodies <b>50</b> has been completed in a similar manner and the mass bodies <b>50</b> are in a free state, all the mass bodies <b>50</b> are in a pivot movement initial state. More specifically, the front end parts of all the mass bodies <b>50</b> are aligned in the same position in the vertical and key-alignment directions, and the fitting concave part <b>55</b> is in a state in which the fitting concave part <b>55</b> opens toward the front (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Meanwhile, a necessary number of the key units KU (for one octave) in which the white key units KUW<b>1</b> and KUW<b>2</b> and the black key unit KUB are overlaid and integrated are constructed, separately. Thereafter, the elastic members <b>31</b>W and <b>31</b>B of all the white keys <b>20</b> and black keys <b>40</b> in a key unit KU are brought into contact with the top of the sloping surface <b>19</b> while adjusting the position in the key-alignment direction of the key unit KU. Subsequently, the key unit KU is moved rearward by sliding the key unit KU on the sloping surface <b>19</b> with using the self weight of the key unit KU, all of the elastic members <b>31</b> in the key unit KU then simultaneously enter a state in which all the elastic members <b>31</b> contact against (the top surfaces <b>53</b>Wa and <b>53</b>Ba of) the lower engaging pieces <b>53</b> of the corresponding mass bodies <b>50</b>. When the key unit KU is moved further rearward, all of the elastic members <b>31</b> simultaneously engage in a fitted state between the lower engaging pieces <b>53</b> and the upper engaging pieces <b>54</b> (fitting concave parts <b>55</b>) of the corresponding mass bodies <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Thus, by merely sliding the key unit KU to move it rearward, the elastic members <b>31</b> can be easily engaged in the fitting concave parts <b>55</b> of the mass bodies <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Concurrent with the elastic members <b>31</b> engaging in the fitting concave parts <b>55</b>, the key guided parts <b>33</b> of the white keys <b>20</b> in the key unit KU naturally engage with the corresponding key guide parts <b>12</b> of the key frame <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Although the positions of the free ends of the white keys <b>20</b> in the key-alignment direction are not limited to the normal positions in the course of the attachment operation, because of the presence of the vertical hinge parts <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), the key guide parts <b>12</b> are guided by the guide parts <b>32</b> to suitably engage with the key guided parts <b>33</b>. Thus, the positions in the key-alignment direction of the free ends of the white keys <b>20</b> can be simply and appropriately defined. In this connection, as the exact sequence of operations, in the attachment process, the engagement of the key guide parts <b>12</b> and the key guided parts <b>33</b> starts slightly prior to the fitting of the elastic members <b>31</b> in the fitting concave parts <b>55</b> of the mass bodies <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When all the elastic members <b>31</b> have been engaged with the fitting concave parts <b>55</b> of the mass bodies <b>50</b>, the common base end part <b>30</b> of the key unit KU is positioned directly above the securing parts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of the key frame <b>10</b>, i.e. in a position in which the common base end part <b>30</b> can be immediately secured. Accordingly, thereafter, pressing down the common base end part <b>30</b> from an upward direction causes the contact surfaces <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> of the common base end part <b>30</b> to fit in contact against and facing the securing parts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. By subsequently fastening with the screw <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the common base end part <b>30</b> can be easily secured to the key frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Although a plurality of the key units KU are used, the method of attachment is the same for the other key units KU. In this connection, an operation to secure the common base end part <b>30</b> to the key frame <b>10</b> may be performed after the elastic members <b>31</b> of all the key units KU have been engaged with the fitting concave parts <b>55</b> of the mass bodies <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to the present embodiment, the configuration is adopted, in which, by means of an operation that moves the key unit KU rearward, all of the elastic members <b>31</b> are simultaneously engaged between the lower engaging pieces <b>53</b> and the upper engaging pieces <b>54</b> of the mass bodies <b>50</b>, and at that time the common base end part <b>30</b> is positioned in a position in which the common base end part <b>30</b> can be secured to the key frame <b>10</b>. Thus, in a keyboard apparatus having the mass bodies <b>50</b>, an operation to attach a plurality of keys can be made easier in comparison to a configuration in which keys are attached individually. Further, since the sloping surface <b>19</b> fulfills the function as a mounting guide for the key unit KU, mounting of the key unit KU is simplified further. Also, since the key guided parts <b>33</b> of the white keys <b>20</b> automatically engage with the key guide parts <b>12</b> when the elastic members <b>31</b> engage with the fitting concave parts <b>55</b>, an operation to engage the key guided parts <b>33</b> with the key guide parts <b>12</b> is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, operations to attach the key unit KU to the key frame <b>10</b> can be made simpler and smoother by setting a slope of the sloping surface <b>19</b>, setting a vertical position of the sloping surface <b>19</b>, and setting the clearance C<b>1</b> between the rear end of the sloping surface <b>19</b> and the front end of the lower engaging piece <b>53</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> and the like as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the sloping surface <b>19</b> also functions as a mounting guide for the mass bodies <b>50</b>, not only is attachment of the mass bodies <b>50</b> facilitated, but the structure also does not become complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the second embodiment of the present invention, the structure of the key frame differs in comparison to the above described first embodiment, and the other structures are the same as the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a fragmentary sectional view of a front part of a keyboard apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the first embodiment, the sloping surface <b>19</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) is formed at the front part of the key frame <b>10</b>. In contrast, in the second embodiment a guiding member having a sloping surface that corresponds to the sloping surface <b>19</b> is constructed as a separate member from the key frame, and this guiding member is provided for the key frame in a detachable condition.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a guiding member mounting part <b>88</b> is formed at a front part of a key frame <b>85</b>. The guiding member mounting part <b>88</b> is composed of a mounting part <b>86</b> and a groove <b>87</b> that is dropped one level compared to the mounting part <b>86</b>. The guiding member mounting part <b>88</b> is formed to have a uniform cross section across the entire width of the keyboard. A guiding member <b>89</b> can be mounted to and detached from the guiding member mounting part <b>88</b>. The guiding member <b>89</b> is formed to have a uniform cross section, and has a length that is slightly longer than the entire width of the entire keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The undersurface of the guiding member <b>89</b> is formed with a step shape that corresponds to the mounting part <b>86</b> and the groove <b>87</b>, and the guiding member <b>89</b> is put in a mounted state by merely placing the guiding member <b>89</b> on the mounting part <b>86</b> and the groove <b>87</b>. At this time, by fitting a protruding part <b>89</b><i>b </i>of the guiding member <b>89</b> into the groove <b>87</b>, the guiding member <b>89</b> is prevented from dropping down to the rear from the guiding member mounting part <b>88</b>. A sloping surface <b>89</b><i>a </i>that corresponds to the sloping surface <b>19</b> is formed at the top of the guiding member <b>89</b>. In the mounted state, the shape of the sloping surface <b>89</b><i>a </i>is the same as the sloping surface <b>19</b>. The material of the guiding member <b>89</b> is not particularly limited, and it can be consist of resin or felt, or a product by hollow aluminum extrusion or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this structure, attachment of the mass bodies <b>50</b> and the key unit KU is carried out in the following manner. First, prior to attaching the mass bodies <b>50</b>, the guiding member <b>89</b> is mounted onto the guiding member mounting part <b>88</b>. At this time, to facilitate detachment as described later, the guiding member <b>89</b> is exposed a little from at least either one of the right side and left side of the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b>. Then, utilizing the sloping surface <b>89</b><i>a </i>of the guiding member <b>89</b> as a mounting guide, the mass bodies <b>50</b> are attached by the same method as in the first embodiment. Thereafter, utilizing the sloping surface <b>89</b><i>a </i>as a mounting guide, the key unit KU is attached by the same method as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After attachment of all of the key units KU is completed, in that state, the guiding member <b>89</b> is pulled out from the side of the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b> by holding the exposed portion of the guiding member <b>89</b> to thereby detach the guiding member <b>89</b>. There is no necessity to disassemble the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b> in order to detach the guiding member <b>89</b>, and the guiding member <b>89</b> can be detached with ease. In this manner attachment of the mass bodies <b>50</b> and the key unit KU is carried out. Upon detaching the guiding member <b>89</b>, an empty space is created in the region in which the guiding member <b>89</b> was present above the guiding member mounting part <b>88</b>. Various functional components can be provided in this empty space. For example, a lampholder for a performance guide or sensors or the like may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this connection, when producing a large number of keyboard apparatuses consecutively by using flow production or the like, utilizing the guiding member <b>89</b> to assemble a plurality of keyboard apparatuses produces favorable workability. More specifically, the guiding member <b>89</b> that has been detached from the keyboard apparatus that has been most recently assembled can be used in the keyboard apparatus to be assembled next.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A similar effect as the first embodiment can be obtained according to the present embodiment. Furthermore, since the empty space that exists after removing the guiding member <b>89</b> can be effectively utilized for providing various functional components and the like, the embodiment not only contributes to space saving within the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b>, but, in addition, the degree of design freedom is increased and applying to multiple models is also facilitated. Further, this empty space is also useful in the respect that various functional components can be retrofitted into the empty space even after delivery of the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A configuration may be adopted in which the guiding member <b>89</b> can be detached while the mass bodies <b>50</b> and the key unit KU are in an attached state, and the length of the guiding member <b>89</b> need not be the same as the entire width of the keyboard. For example, the length of the guiding member <b>89</b> may be that same as the width of one key unit KU, and the guiding member <b>89</b> may be detached each time one key unit KU is attached. Further, when the length of the guiding member <b>89</b> is configured to be the same as the width of one key unit KU, a plurality of guiding members <b>89</b> need not necessarily be provided, and only one guiding member <b>89</b> may be provided. In that case, for example, a method may be employed in which, after attaching mass bodies <b>50</b> for one octave utilizing the guiding member <b>89</b>, the guiding member <b>89</b> is shifted laterally by a distance equivalent to an amount for one octave, and the mass bodies <b>50</b> for the next one octave are then attached. Likewise for the key units KU, a method may be employed whereby after attaching one key unit KU utilizing the guiding member <b>89</b>, the guiding member <b>89</b> is shifted laterally by a distance equivalent to the amount for one octave to attach the next key unit KU.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In this connection, when there is no necessary to secure an empty space, the guiding member <b>89</b> need not be configured to be detachable from the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b>, and the keyboard apparatus <b>1</b> may be considered a finished product in a state in which the guiding member <b>89</b> is mounted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although in the first and second embodiments the key unit KU is configured as a three-level structure, from the viewpoint of facilitating operations to attach a plurality of keys, this invention is not limited thereto, and any configuration may be adopted as long as a plurality of keys are integrally connected at a common base end part.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although in the first and second embodiments the configuration is adopted in which the positions of the upper engaging piece <b>54</b> and lower engaging piece <b>53</b> of the mass body <b>50</b> are the same in the front-to-rear direction and vertical direction between the engaging pieces corresponding to the white keys <b>20</b> and the engaging pieces corresponding to the black keys <b>40</b>, from the viewpoint of facilitating operations to attach a plurality of keys, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the positions of these pieces in the front-to-rear direction and vertical direction may differ somewhat. In that case, the key unit KU may be configured so that the positions of the respective elastic members <b>31</b> in the key unit KU respectively match the positions of the corresponding upper engaging pieces <b>54</b> and lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>, and so that at the time of attachment all the elastic members <b>31</b> simultaneously contact against and engage with the corresponding upper engaging pieces <b>54</b> and lower engaging pieces <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Although in the above described first and second embodiments the guide parts <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) that guide the key guide part <b>12</b> and the key guided parts <b>33</b> into an engaged state are provided in the key guided parts <b>33</b>, i.e. the white keys <b>20</b>, conversely, the guide parts <b>32</b> may be provided in the key frame <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a view of a back side of the front half of the white key that shows a modification example of the key guide part and the key guided part.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a front end part <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the white key <b>20</b>, a T part <b>91</b> that is shaped in the form of the letter “T” as viewed from the bottom is integrally formed along the vertical direction. In the T part <b>91</b>, a key guided part <b>92</b> is provided to extend rearward from a rib that is parallel to the horizontal direction. The key guided part <b>92</b> corresponds to the above described key guided part <b>33</b>. At the most frontward part of the key frame <b>10</b>, a concave part <b>93</b> that opens frontward as viewed from the bottom is formed at a position corresponding to the key guided part <b>92</b> of each white key <b>20</b> along the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The concave part <b>93</b> has a key guide part <b>94</b> that has a width that is slightly larger than the width of the key guided part <b>92</b>, and also has a guide part <b>95</b> that joins to the front part of the key guide part <b>94</b> and is formed in a manner in which the key guide part <b>94</b> and the guide part <b>95</b> are integrated with each other. The key guide part <b>94</b> corresponds to the above described key guide part <b>12</b>. The guide part <b>95</b> fulfills a function that corresponds to the above guide part <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this configuration, when attaching the key unit KU to the key frame <b>10</b>, the guide part <b>95</b>, similarly to the above guide part <b>32</b>, fulfills a guiding function so that the key guide part <b>94</b> and the key guided part <b>92</b> engage appropriately. In this connection, the shapes of the key guide part, the key guided part and the guide part are not limited to the shapes exemplified in the foregoing.</p>
