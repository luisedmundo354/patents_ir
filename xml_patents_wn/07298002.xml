<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and methods for manufacturing -semiconductor devices. The present invention particularly relates to a semiconductor device including a cylindrical capacitor and a method for manufacturing such a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, semiconductor devices with a large capacity have been increasingly demanded. Therefore, dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) with a large capacity, for example, a capacity of 1 Gbit, are in practical use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Memory cells for DRAMs usually each include a gate transistor and a capacitor. The charge stored in the capacitor corresponds to information and is transferred with the transistor. The capacitor is connected to a diffusion layer electrode of the transistor and placed above the diffusion layer electrode or placed over a gate electrode and the diffusion layer electrode. The capacitor includes a lower electrode connected to the diffusion layer electrode, a commonly connected upper electrode, and a capacitor insulating layer placed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A reduction in the size of gate transistors leads to a reduction in the area occupied by each capacitor. However, the capacitor needs to have a capacitance sufficient to ensure the operation of a memory because the charge stored in the capacitor corresponds to information. The following techniques are effective In achieving small-sized capacitors with a sufficient capacitance: the use of insulating films (dielectric films) with a small thickness, the use of capacitor insulating layers with a large dielectric constant, the use of capacitor electrodes with a large surface area, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, such thin dielectric films or high-surface area capacitors are used. In order to achieve the thin dielectric films, known dielectric films are reduced in thickness or a new material with a large dielectric constant is used. This leads to a decrease in reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are two solutions to achieve the high-surface area capacitors: one is to use cylindrical capacitors having a large aspect ratio and the other one is to use rough silicon layers or silicon layers having hemispherical silicon grains (hereinafter referred to as HSGs) protruding therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A HSG layer is formed as follows: an amorphous silicon layer for forming the lower electrode of a cylindrical capacitor is formed and then seeded by heat-treating the amorphous silicon layer in an atmosphere containing SiH<sub>4 </sub>or SiH<sub>6 </sub>and the resulting amorphous silicon layer is further heat-treated under high vacuum conditions, whereby HSGs are formed so as to protrude from the amorphous silicon layer. Silicon atoms provided by the seeding treatment are allowed to migrate to create crystal grains by the heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the amorphous silicon layer contains a large amount of an impurity such as phosphorus (P), the crystal grains cannot be sufficiently grown because the impurity inhibits the migration of the silicon atoms. In usual, the HSG layer is prepared by heat-treating the amorphous silicon layer having an impurity concentration of 1E20 to 2E20 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or a smaller impurity concentration. If the obtained HSG layer has unsatisfactory electrical properties due to the low impurity concentration, the HSG layer is doped with P by heat-treating the HSG layer in an atmosphere containing PH<sub>3</sub>, whereby the impurity concentration of the HSG layer is increased. According to this technique, capacitors with a surface area about two times greater than that of known capacitors can be prepared; hence, small-sized memory cells with a desired capacity can be obtained. Higher advantages can be obtained if this technique is used in combination with the two techniques described above.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A reduction in the size of gate transistors leads to a reduction in the size of cylindrical capacitors; hence, the cylindrical capacitors have a small diameter and the distance between the cylindrical capacitors adjacent to each other is small. On the other hand, the HSG layer is readily peeled off. The peeled. HSG layer causes a short circuit between the cylindrical capacitors. This causes a reduction in the yield of memories. In order to prevent the short circuit which is occurs due to the peeling of the HSG, it is necessary to partly inhibit the growth of HSGs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 2000-196042, 2002-368133, and 2000-216346 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Documents 1, 2, and 3, respectively) disclose techniques for partly inhibiting HSGs from growing from cylindrical electrodes from which HSG layers are readily peeled off. According to Patent Documents 1 and 2, the HSGs protruding from the top ends of cylinder electrodes and the HSGs protruding from edges of box-shaped electrodes are prevented from growing, whereby short circuits are prevented from occurring between these electrodes. According to Patent Document 3, the HSGs placed protruding from the outer walls of cylindrical electrodes have a size different from that of the HSGs protruding from the inner walls thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-196562 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 4) discloses a technique for preventing oxides in contact with cylinder walls from being exposed due to the removal of electrodes placed on the cylinder walls during the formation of HSGs. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-222871 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 5) discloses a technique for reducing process cost and increasing throughput by forming HSGs in one step. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-334940 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 6) discloses a technique for reducing the resistance of a concave capacitor having an inner wall with HSGs by directly connecting a contact plug to a metal wire.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above known techniques, the HSGs are formed in one step, the resistance of the capacitor is reduced, a short circuit is prevented from occurring due to the peeled HSG layer, or the adjacent cylindrical capacitors are prevented from being short-circuited. Methods for manufacturing small-sized capacitors for DRAMs and configurations of such capacitors are problematic as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to increase the integration density of memory cells, holes are formed by etching so as to have a high aspect ratio. Such holes have lower zones having a diameter less than that of upper zones thereof. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, a mask insulating layer <b>33</b> and a second interlayer insulating layer <b>34</b> are arranged on a first interlayer insulating layer <b>31</b> including contact plugs <b>32</b>. Capacitor holes <b>35</b>, formed by lithography, for forming cylindrical capacitors extend through the mask insulating layer <b>33</b> and the second interlayer insulating layer <b>34</b>. Each capacitor hole <b>35</b> has an top opening, represented by a-a′, having a diameter equal to the design value and lower zones, represented by b-b′, c-c′, or d-d′, each having a diameter different from the design value when the capacitor holes <b>35</b> are formed by lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The diameter of the top opening a-a′ is the same as the design value. However, the upper zone b-b′ located below the top opening a-a′ has a diameter greater than that of the top opening a-a′ and the lower zone c-c′ located below the upper zone b-b′ has a diameter less than that of the upper zone b-b′, the lower zone C-C′ is tapered toward its bottom. And the capacitor hole <b>35</b> has a so-called bowing shape in cross section. For current high-capacity memories having holes with an aspect ratio of ten or more, lower regions of the holes are hard to etch because etching gas is not sufficiently supplied to the lower regions. Therefore, there is a problem that the diameter of the lower regions becomes small.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The capacitor hole <b>35</b> needs to be connected to each contact plug <b>32</b> placed thereunder. The bottom of the capacitor hole <b>25</b> is in contact with the mask insulating layer <b>33</b>, which is therefore referred to as an etching stopper. When the mask insulating layer <b>33</b> is etched, the first interlayer insulating layer <b>31</b> is partly etched if the capacitor hole <b>35</b> is misaligned with the contact plug <b>32</b>. Therefore, there is a problem in that the lower zone d-d′ of the capacitor hole <b>35</b> that is in contact with a side face of the contact plug <b>32</b> has a size less than that of other zones That is, in the capacitor hole <b>35</b>, tie lower zone c-c′ has a diameter less than its design value and the lower zone d-d′ has a size less than its design value.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A silicon layer <b>36</b> for forming cylindrical lower electrodes for capacitors is formed over formed on the walls and bottoms of the capacitor holes <b>35</b> having the above shape. The silicon layer <b>36</b> is treated, whereby the lower electrodes having HSGs <b>37</b> are prepared. A capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> is then formed so as to cover the HSGs <b>37</b>. The HSGs <b>37</b> are densely arranged or are in contact with each other at the lower zone of the lower electrodes. The lower zone of the lower electrodes has a size less than its design value. For example, the lower zone is the bottoms of hole, the lower zone d-d′ and the lower zone c-c′. Since the capacitor Insulating layer <b>38</b> is not uniformly grown on the HGGs <b>37</b> densely arranged the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> is not uniform in thickness and therefore has thin sections.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the HSGs <b>37</b> protrude from the lower electrodes having narrow regions with sizes less than their design values as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the HSGs <b>37</b> protruding from a circumferential zone of the inner wall of each lower electrodes are in contact with each other if these HSGs <b>37</b> have a diameter greater than half of the diameter of the circumferential zone. Narrow spaces are present between the HSGs <b>37</b> in contact with each other. Since reactive gas for forming the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> can hardly be introduced into the narrow spaces, the step coverage of the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> is insufficient, hence, the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> has such thin sections. Since an oxidative species such as oxygen is exhausted in the narrow spaces during the oxidation of the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b>, the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> cannot be sufficiently oxidized. That is, the reactive gas in the narrow spaces is rarefied because the reactive gas is not sufficiently supplied to the narrow spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When high electric fields are applied to the thin sections of the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b>, currents leak from the thin sections. A reduction in the thickness of the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> causes a decrease in the dielectric strength thereof. Although the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> is usually improved in dielectric strength by oxidation, there is a problem in that the capacitor insulating layer <b>38</b> has low dielectric strength because the oxidative species is insufficiently supplied to the narrow spaces.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A semiconductor device according to the present invention and methods for manufacturing semiconductor devices according to the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing one of cylindrical capacitors included in the semiconductor device manufactured by the method of this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 9</figref> are sectional views showing principal steps of manufacturing the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, isolation regions <b>2</b> are formed in a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> and gate transistors <b>3</b> for driving memory cells are then formed on p-well regions <b>4</b> arranged in the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>. The gate transistors <b>3</b> each include corresponding gate electrodes <b>8</b>, source/drain diffusion regions <b>9</b> aligned with the gate electrodes <b>8</b>. The gate electrodes <b>8</b> each include corresponding gate insulating layers <b>5</b>, polysilicon layers <b>6</b>, and suicide layers <b>7</b>, those layers being arranged in that order. Portions of the gate electrodes <b>8</b> that extend in the isolation regions <b>2</b> are used as wires.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first interlayer insulating layer <b>10</b> is formed over the gate transistors <b>3</b> and contact holes are formed in the first interlayer insulating layer <b>10</b> so as to each extend to the corresponding source/drain diffusion regions <b>9</b>. The contact holes are filled with polysilicon or amorphous silicon and unnecessary portions are then removed by etchback or CMP, whereby polysilicon plugs <b>11</b> are formed in the contact holes.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, after the polysilicon plugs <b>11</b> are formed, a second interlayer insulating layer <b>12</b> is formed over the polysilicon plugs <b>11</b> and the first interlayer insulating layer <b>10</b> and holes are then formed in the second interlayer insulating layer <b>12</b> by lithography and anisotropic dry etching. These holes are filled with TiN and W and unnecessary portions are then removed by etchback or CMP, whereby W plugs <b>13</b> are formed in the holes. TiN and W are deposited on the second interlayer Insulating layer <b>12</b> and bit lines <b>14</b> are formed by lithography and anisotropic dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a third interlayer insulating layer <b>15</b> is formed over the bit lines <b>14</b> and holes are formed to reach the polysilicon plugs <b>11</b> by lithography and anisotropic dry etching. These holes are filled with polysilicon or amorphous silicon and unnecessary portions are then removed by etchback or CMP, whereby contact plugs <b>16</b> are formed in the holes. A nitride layer <b>17</b> is formed over the contact plugs <b>16</b> and the third interlayer insulating layer <b>15</b> and a plasma oxide layer <b>18</b> having a thickness of 2 to 3 μm is formed on the nitride layer <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, cylindrical capacitor holes extending through the nitride layer <b>17</b> and the plasma oxide layer <b>18</b> are formed by lithography and anisotropic dry etching. The capacitor holes formed by lithography each have the top openings having a diameter equal to its design value; however, the capacitor holes each have a upper zone, located below each opening having a diameter greater than that of the opening and also each have a lower zone, located below the upper zone, having a diameter less than the upper zone, the lower zone is tapered toward its bottom. And the capacitor hole has a bowing shape in cross section. The contact plugs <b>16</b> are each exposed at the bottoms of the corresponding capacitor holes. Since side faces of the contact plugs <b>16</b> are partly etched due to the misalignment between the capacitor holes and the contact plugs <b>16</b>, the bottoms of the capacitor hole have recessed regions. An amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> with a phosphorus concentration of 1E19 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>is formed over the plasma oxide layer <b>18</b> and the walls and bottoms of the capacitor holes at a growth temperature of 500° C. to 600° C. The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> has a thickness less than or equal to a quarter of the diameter of the openings of the capacitor holes. In particular, the thickness of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is 20 to 50 nm. The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is used to form cylindrical lower electrodes of the cylindrical capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is doped with an impurity, for example, phosphorus, under the following conditions: a dose of 5E14 atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, an incident angle of zero degrees, and an acceleration voltage of 100 keV. The resulting amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is further doped with an impurity, for example, phosphorus, under the following conditions: a dose of 1E14 atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, an incident angle of zero degrees, and an acceleration voltage of 10 keV. In this step, lower regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> that are placed at lower zones of the capacitor holes are doped with the impurity so as to have an impurity concentration determined depending on the angle formed by each lower region of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> and the plane parallel to the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>, the lower zones having diameters less than those of upper zones of the capacitor holes. In particular, the lower regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are more heavily doped with the impurity than other regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A resist layer is provided on the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> and then partly removed by a photolithographic process such that portions of the resist layer that are located in the capacitor holes remain. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is etched back such that regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> remain in the capacitor holes, whereby amorphous silicon films separated from each other are prepared. The top ends of the amorphous silicon films are each located at a position 30 to 100 nm lower than the opening of each capacitor hole. The amorphous silicon films are processed into the lower electrodes (cylindrical electrodes) of the cylindrical capacitors. In this step, upper portions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are removed by dry etching, the upper portions being doped with the impurity and extending from the positions 30 to 100 nm lower than the openings of the capacitor holes. The remaining portions of the resist layer are then removed with a hot aqueous solution containing persulfuric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are cleaned, native oxides are removed therefrom. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, fine crystal grains are formed at surface of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> at a temperature of 550° C. to 570° C. with a HSG-forming apparatus using seeding gas containing monosilane or disilane. The fine crystal grains are grown by annealing, whereby HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>is prepared. The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> turns into HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>and the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a</i>. And HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>and the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>serve as the lower electrodes of the cylindrical capacitors. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from upper regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>have a size greater than that of the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from lower regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>having an impurity concentration greater than that of the upper regions thereof. Since the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower regions or the bottoms of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>that are in contact with the contact plugs <b>16</b> have a smaller size, these HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are not in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>of upper regions have a larger size and the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>of lower regions have a smaller size; that is, the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>have different sizes depending on the vertical position where the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are present. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from a circumferential zone of the inner wall of each silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a</i>, which is cylindrical, have a size less than half of the diameter of the circumferential zone and are not therefore in contact with each other. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from a narrower circumferential zone of the inner wall thereof have a smaller size. The entire surface of the lower electrode <b>20</b> is rough. In order to prevent the lower electrodes <b>20</b> from being depleted and in order to reduce the resistance of the lower electrodes <b>20</b>, the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are doped with an n-type impurity, for example, phosphorus, with a low-pressure CVD furnace such that the lower electrodes <b>20</b> have a phosphorus concentration of 5E20 atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> is formed over the lower electrodes <b>20</b> by vacuum CVD using reactive gas and then oxidized with oxidative gas. In this step, since the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>have a small size and are not therefore in contact with each other, the reactive gas can be uniformly diffused; hence, the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> can be formed so as to have a uniform thickness. An upper electrode <b>22</b> is provided on the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>, whereby the cylindrical capacitors are prepared as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Since the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from a narrower circumferential zone of the inner wall of the-silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>has a smaller size, there are no narrow spaces near a narrow circumferential zone of the inner wall and the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> therefore has a uniform thickness; hence, the cylindrical capacitors have good insulating properties.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, in this embodiment, since lower regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are heavily doped with the impurity, the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower regions thereof have a smaller size and are not therefore in contact with each other. Thus, the reactive gas can be uniformly diffused, the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> formed by low-pressure CVD can be prevented from being deteriorated in coverage, and the concentration of the oxidative gas can be prevented from being partly reduced in the step of oxidizing the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>. Since the oxidative gas can be uniformly diffused, the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> can be uniformly oxidized and therefore have improved insulating properties. Furthermore, since atomic mixing occurs at contact regions between the contact plugs <b>16</b> and the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the contact resistances between the contact plugs <b>16</b> and the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>are low; hence, the number of faulty electrical contacts is very small and high-speed operation is possible. The semiconductor device has high reliability because the semiconductor device includes the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> with a uniform thickness. The semiconductor device can be manufactured by the method of this embodiment as described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention will now be described. An impurity used in this embodiment is different from that used in the ion implantation described in the first embodiment. Steps of the method of this embodiment are similar to the steps described in the first embodiment. Therefore, only steps different from those described in the first embodiment are described in this embodiment and the same steps as those described in the first embodiment are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> for forming cylindrical lower electrodes of cylindrical electrodes is formed at a temperature of 500° C. to 600° C. so as to have a phosphorus concentration of, for example, 1E19 atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> has a thickness less than or equal to a quarter of the diameter of the openings of capacitor holes. In particular, the thickness of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is 20 to 50 nm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is doped with an impurity, for example, boron, under the following conditions: a dose of 5E14 atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, an incident angle of zero degrees, and an acceleration voltage of 20 keV. In this step, lower regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> that are placed at lower zones of the capacitor holes are doped with boron so as to have a boron concentration determined depending on the angle formed by each lower region of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> and the plane parallel to a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>. In particular, the lower regions and bottoms of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are more heavily doped with boron than other regions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Subsequently, HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are formed in the same manner as that described in the first embodiment. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from upper regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>have a size greater than that of the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower regions having an impurity concentration greater than that of the upper regions thereof. Since the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower regions or the bottoms of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>that are in contact with contact plugs <b>16</b> have a smaller size, these HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are not in contact with each other. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from a circumferential zone of the inner wall of each silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a</i>, which is cylindrical, have a size less than half of the diameter of the circumferential zone. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from a narrower circumferential zone or the inner wall have a smaller size. The entire surface of the lower electrode <b>20</b> is therefore rough. In order to prevent the lower electrode <b>20</b> from being depleted and in order to reduce the resistance of the lower electrode <b>20</b>, the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are doped with an n-type impurity, for example, phosphorus, with a low-pressure CVD furnace in the same manner as that described in the first embodiment such that the lower electrodes <b>20</b> have a phosphorus concentration of 5E20 atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The semiconductor device manufactured by the method of this embodiment has high reliability because the semiconductor device includes a capacitor insulating layer with a uniform thickness.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a third embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this embodiment, doping is not performed by ion implantation but is performed using gas containing an impurity. The step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is used in this embodiment instead of the doping step used in the first embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this embodiment, in order to simplify the description, the same components as those described in the first embodiment have the same reference numerals as those described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b>, containing phosphorus, for forming cylindrical lower electrodes of cylindrical electrodes is formed at a temperature of 500° C. to 600° C. The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> has a thickness less than or equal to a quarter of the diameter of the openings of cylindrical capacitor holes for forming the lower electrodes. In particular, the thickness of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is 20 to 50 nm. An oxide layer <b>23</b> with a thickness of 50 nm is formed on the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> by plasma-enhanced CVD using, for example, TEOS. The oxide layer <b>23</b> has incomplete coverage; that is, flat top sections of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> and upper sections of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> that are located on upper regions of the walls of the capacitor holes are covered with the oxide layer <b>23</b> but lower sections of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> that are located on lower regions of the walls thereof are hardly covered therewith. The oxide layer <b>23</b> is then slightly etched with dilute hydrofluoric acid such that the thickness of the oxide layer <b>23</b> is reduced by about 10 nm, whereby the lower sections of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are exposed. The area of the exposed lower sections thereof is adjusted by controlling conditions of plasma-enhanced CVD and/or the time of etching the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b>. Only the exposed lower sections are doped with an n-type impurity, for example, phosphorus, at 500° C. with a low-pressure CVD furnace by exposing the exposed lower sections to an atmosphere containing phosphorus.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this step, the covered sections of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are not doped with the impurity but only the exposed lower sections, which are present in narrow portions of the capacitor holes, are doped therewith. Subsequently, the oxide layer <b>23</b> is removed and HSGs are formed in the same manner as that described in the first embodiment. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from upper regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>have a size greater than that of the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower regions having an impurity concentration greater than that of the upper regions thereof. Since the HSGs protruding from the lower regions or the bottoms of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>that are in contact with contact plugs have a smaller size, these HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are not in contact with each other. The HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from a circumferential zone of the inner wall of each silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a</i>, which is cylindrical, have a size less-than half of the diameter of the circumferential zone. The HSGs protruding from a narrower circumferential zone of the inner wall have a smaller size. The entire surface of the lower electrode is therefore rough.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The semiconductor device manufactured by the method of this embodiment has high reliability because the semiconductor device includes a capacitor insulating layer with a uniform thickness.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 14</figref>. In this embodiment, HSGs are not grown from narrow lower regions of cylindrical electrodes. This method includes the same steps as those, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 6</figref>, described in the first embodiment. In this embodiment, in order to simplify the description, the same components as those described in the first embodiment have the same reference numerals as those described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">After amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is formed in the same manner as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an insulating layer <b>24</b> is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> such that cylindrical capacitor holes are filled with portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b>. The insulating layer <b>24</b> may be made of, for example, BPSG. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the insulating layer <b>24</b> is partly etched off such that portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b> remain only in lower regions of the capacitor holes. The lower regions of the capacitor holes have a diameter less than that of the openings of the capacitor holes. The insulating layer <b>24</b> can be wet- or dry-etched.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is processed into separated cylindrical amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> by removing flat portions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b>. A method for etching the insulating layer <b>24</b> and a method for partly removing the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are not particularly limited and the following procedure may be used: flat portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b> and flat portions of the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> are removed by CMP and the other portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b> are then partly etched off such that small portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b> remain in the lower regions of the capacitor holes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The top of each remaining portion of the insulating layer <b>24</b> is preferably located in a lower circumferential zone of each capacitor hole, the lower circumferential zone having a diameter equal to the diameter of the opening of the capacitor hole. This is because the openings of the capacitor holes have been designed such that HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>are not in contact with each other. When the top of the remaining portion thereof is located at a higher position, the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>having the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>have an area insufficient to achieve a desired capacitance. In contrast, when the top of the remaining portion thereof is located at a lower position, the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from lower regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>are in contact with each other and dead spaces are therefore present in the cylindrical capacitors. Therefore, a capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> described below has thin sections, from which currents leak.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> is cleaned, whereby native oxides are removed therefrom. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, fine crystal grains are formed in the amorphous silicon layer <b>19</b> at a temperature of 550° C. to 570° C. with a HSG-forming apparatus using seeding gas containing monosilane or disilane. The fine crystal grains are grown by annealing, whereby the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are formed. Upper regions of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>have the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>but lower regions thereof have no HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>because the lower regions thereof are covered with the remaining portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the remaining portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b> are removed from the capacitor holes by etching. In order to prevent the lower electrodes <b>20</b> from being depleted and in order to reduce the resistance of the lower electrodes <b>20</b>, the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are doped with an n-type impurity, for example, phosphorus, with a low-pressure CVD furnace such that the lower electrodes <b>20</b> have a phosphorus concentration of 5E20 atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. The capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> is then formed over the lower electrodes <b>20</b> by vacuum CVD using reactive gas and then oxidized with oxidative gas. In this step, since the lower regions of the lower electrodes <b>20</b> have no HSGs <b>19</b><i>b</i>, the reactive gas is uniformly diffused; hence, the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> has a uniform thickness. An upper electrode <b>22</b> is provided on the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>, whereby the cylindrical capacitors are prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, in this embodiment, the lower regions of the lower electrodes <b>20</b> have no HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>because the lower regions thereof are covered with the remaining portions of the insulating layer <b>24</b>. Therefore, the reactive gas can be uniformly diffused in narrow bottom regions of the lower electrodes <b>20</b> during the formation of the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>; hence, the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> can be prevented from being deteriorated in coverage. Furthermore, the concentration of the oxidative gas can be prevented from being partly reduced in the step of oxidizing the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>; hence, the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> can be uniformly oxidized and therefore have improved insulating properties. Accordingly, a high-reliability semiconductor device including a capacitor insulating layer with a uniform thickness can be manufactured by the method of this embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 18</figref>. In this embodiment, the semiconductor device includes cylindrical capacitors similar to the cylindrical capacitors described in the first, second, or third embodiment. The cylindrical capacitors used in this embodiment have a crown shape and each include corresponding cylindrical lower electrodes. Both the outer and inner walls of the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are covered with a capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>. The method of this embodiment includes a step identical to the step of forming the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and steps prior to the HSG-forming step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> are sectional views showing steps, subsequent to a HSG-forming step, included in the method of this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> are sectional views showing steps, subsequent to such a HSG-forming step, included in a modification of the method of this embodiment. In this embodiment, in order to simplify the description, the same components as those described in the first, second, and third embodiments have the same reference numerals as those described in the first, second, and third embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, after HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>are formed, an oxide layer <b>18</b> surrounding the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>is etched off as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In order to prevent the lower electrodes <b>20</b> from being depleted and in order to reduce the resistance of the lower electrodes <b>20</b>, the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are doped with an impurity. The capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> is formed over the lower electrodes <b>20</b> and then oxidized. An upper electrode <b>22</b> is formed on the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>, whereby the cylindrical capacitors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> are prepared. These cylindrical capacitors having such a crown shape are different from those cylindrical capacitors described in the first, second, or third embodiment in that the outer walls of these cylindrical capacitors are covered with the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> having the upper electrode <b>22</b> placed thereon. Therefore, the outer and inner walls of these cylindrical capacitors are used as capacitor regions. The inner walls of the lower electrodes of this embodiment have a area about two times greater than that of the inner walls of lower electrodes of known cylindrical capacitors including no HSGs. Since the outer walls of the lower electrodes of this embodiment are used as capacitor regions, the lower electrodes of this embodiment have a surface area about three times greater than that of the lower electrodes of-such known cylindrical capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A modification of the method of this embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>.

In order to prevent lower electrodes <b>20</b> from being depleted and in order to reduce the resistance of the lower electrodes <b>20</b>, the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are doped with an impurity. A capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b> is then formed over the lower electrodes <b>20</b> and then oxidized. An upper electrode <b>22</b> is formed on the capacitor insulating layer <b>21</b>, whereby crown-shaped cylindrical capacitors are prepared as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In this embodiment, half of the outer wall of each cylindrical capacitor of this modification is used as a capacitor region. The inner walls of the lower electrodes of this modification have an area about two times greater than that of the inner walls of lower electrodes of known cylindrical capacitors including no HSGs. Since half of the outer wall of each lower electrode of this modification is used as a capacitor region, the lower electrode of this modification has a surface area about 2.5 times greater than that of the lower electrodes of such known cylindrical capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this modification, although the thickness of the oxide layer <b>18</b> surrounding the lower electrodes is reduced by about half, the remaining half of the oxide layer <b>18</b> supports the lower electrodes to prevent the lower electrodes from falling down.

On the other hand, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the lower electrodes are supported by the etched oxide layer <b>18</b> having a thickness substantially equal to half of its original thickness and therefore prevented from falling down.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The amount of the reduction in the thickness of the oxide layer <b>18</b> may be determined depending on the strength of the lower electrodes. When the lower electrodes have high strength and are not therefore likely to fall down, the oxide layer <b>18</b> is completely removed. In this case, the lower electrodes have a large surface area. When the lower electrodes have low strength, the oxide layer <b>18</b> is partly removed, for example, the upper half of the oxide layer <b>18</b> is removed. In this case, the lower electrodes can securely be prevented from falling down.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the cylindrical capacitors of this embodiment, the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from upper regions of the inner walls of the silicon layer <b>19</b><i>a </i>have a larger size and the HSGs <b>19</b><i>b </i>protruding from lower regions of the inner walls thereof have a smaller size. The outer walls of the lower electrodes <b>20</b> are used as capacitor regions and the cylindrical capacitors have the crown shape; hence, the lower electrodes have a large surface area.
