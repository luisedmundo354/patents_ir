<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to plastic newspaper covers, and more particularly, to thin plastic covers for newspapers which have an overlay with advertising printed on the outer surface thereof with an attached severable coupon.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For many years newspapers were simply rolled and bound by wire or string before being thrown onto customers' lawns, porches or driveways. With the advent of thin film plastics, it became customary to fold or roll the newspaper and to enclose the folded or rolled newspaper in a sleeve of plastic before being thrown onto the customer's property. The plastic film had the advantage of protecting the paper from rain, snow, etc. The thin film plastic packages may be clear, colored, and in some instances have advertising printed on the package walls. It is also common place to distribute advertising flyers including coupons in newspapers and by direct mail. Samples of products also are distributed by direct mail.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention is embodied in a thin plastic sleeve for distributing newspapers and a separate plastic overlay attached to the sleeve and a severable coupon attached to one end thereof. The invention also embodies the process for making the sleeve and package.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the combined newspaper cover sleeve and advertising overlay and severable coupon package <b>10</b> which comprises a sleeve <b>11</b> which has an open end <b>12</b> and a closed or sealed end <b>13</b>. A folded newspaper <b>14</b> is positioned inside the sleeve <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Attached to the sleeve <b>11</b> along the side edges <b>15</b> is an advertising overlay <b>20</b>. The overlay <b>20</b> is attached only at the side edges <b>15</b> and has an extension flap or free edge <b>21</b> which extends past the closed end <b>13</b> of the sleeve <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The advertising overlay <b>20</b> has a line of perforations <b>22</b> in the flap <b>21</b> which defines a line of weakness allowing the end of the flap, on which is printed a coupon <b>23</b>, to be severed from the overlay <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advertising indicia <b>24</b> preferably is printed on the outer surface of the overlay <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a modification of the invention in which the sleeve <b>30</b> is more cylindrical and the newspaper <b>31</b> is rolled and inserted into the sleeve <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a flow diagram of the process for making this invention. The sleeve <b>11</b> is first extruded as a single sheet of thin plastic. This is folded lengthwise and formed into onto a roll. The overlay <b>20</b> likewise is a single sheet of thin extruded plastic film, which also is formed in a roll.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When an order is received, the overlay <b>20</b> is unrolled and printed with the appropriate indicia and the coupon also is printed on the free edge flap. The printed overlay <b>20</b> is re-rolled and both the folded sleeve <b>11</b> and the printed overlay <b>20</b> then are unrolled and located such that one edge of the overlay <b>20</b> is aligned with the sleeve open end <b>12</b> and the free edge <b>21</b> extends outwardly of and past the sleeve closed in <b>13</b>. The free edge flange <b>21</b> is perforated at <b>22</b> to define the coupon <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To form the products <b>10</b>, a hot knife is used to simultaneously sever and seal the sleeve side edges <b>15</b> and to sever the side edges of the overlay <b>20</b>. This also heat seals the overlay <b>20</b> to the sleeve <b>13</b> along the edges <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The combined sleeve and overlay package <b>10</b> is then shipped to the publisher, distributor, etc., where the newspaper is placed in the sleeve <b>11</b> and the package <b>10</b> is distributed to the homeowners.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects and advantages of the present invention have been achieved and other advantageous results have been obtained. As various changes could be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</p>
