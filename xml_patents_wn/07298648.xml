<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">According to one aspect, a memory cell array includes a bit line connected to a plurality of nonvolatile memory cells, where the nonvolatile memory cells are selectively programmable in any one of at least first, second, third and fourth threshold voltage states, and where the first, second, third and fourth threshold voltage states correspond to four different data values defined by first and second bits. A page buffer circuit stores a logic value as main latch data and is responsive to a main latch signal to selectively flip the logic value of the main latch data according to a voltage level of the bit line. A sub-latch circuit stores a logic value as sub-latch data and is responsive to a sub-latch signal to selectively flip the logic value of the sub-latch data according to the voltage level of the bit line. The memory device is operable in a read mode which reads the threshold voltage state of the non-volatile memory cells and a programming mode which programs the threshold voltage state of the non-volatile memory cells, wherein the page buffer circuit is selectively responsive to the sub-latch data to inhibit flipping of the logic value of the main latch data in the programming mode.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to semiconductor memory devices, and more particularly, the present invention relates to nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices and to methods of operating nonvolatile memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The demand for electrically programmable and electrically erasable nonvolatile memory devices has increased dramatically in recent years. Such devices are at least partially characterized by the ability to maintain stored data even in the absence of supplied power. The use of so-called flash memories has become especially popular, particularly, but not exclusively, in the context of portable devices such as digital cameras, cell phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), and laptop computers. Flash memories, such as NAND-type flash memories, are capable of storing large amounts of data in a relatively small area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As background discussion, the basic operating principles underlying flash memory cells and flash memory devices are presented below. However, it should be clearly understood that the discussion that follows is merely exemplary and does not in any way limit and/or define the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The operating principle of a flash memory cell will be described first with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a typical configuration in which a flash memory cell transistor is connected to word and bit lines of a memory device, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the circuit symbol of a flash memory cell transistor, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows the threshold voltage characteristics of a flash memory cell transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref>, a flash memory cell transistor includes a source region <b>4</b> and a drain region <b>5</b> located at the surface of a substrate <b>3</b>. In this example, the substrate is P-type, and the source and drain regions <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are N<sup>+</sup>-type. A gate structure is aligned over a channel region defined between the source and drain regions <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The gate structure includes a floating gate <b>1</b> and a control gate <b>2</b>. Although not shown, a tunneling dielectric layer is interposed between the floating gate <b>1</b> and the surface of the substrate P-sub, and another thin oxide layer (or control dielectric) is interposed between the floating gate <b>1</b> and the control gate <b>2</b>. In the illustrated example, the drain voltage Vd is supplied from a bit line BL, the control gate voltage Vcg is supplied from a word line WL, and the source voltage Vs is connected to a reference potential such as ground.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The threshold voltage (or voltages) of the flash memory cell transistor defines its stored logic value. That is, in the example of a single-bit cell transistor, when the flash memory cell transistor is in its initial state (also called an “erased” state), the threshold voltage Vth is relatively low as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In this state, the cell transistor is designated to have a logic value “1”, which generally corresponds to the ON state of a conventional transistor device. On the other hand, when the cell transistor is in its “programmed” state (PGM), the threshold voltage Vth is relatively high. This high threshold voltage state is designated to have a logic value “0”, which generally corresponds to the OFF state of a conventional transistor device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to change (program) the cell transistor from its initial state to its programmed state, a process known as Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling is utilized. Briefly, a relatively large positive potential difference is created between the control gate <b>2</b> and the substrate P-sub, and excited electrons within the channel on the surface of the substrate are caused to be pushed through and trapped in the floating gate <b>1</b>. These negatively charged electrons act as a barrier between the control gate <b>2</b> and channel on the substrate, thus increasing the threshold voltage of the cell transistor as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The cell transistor can be brought back to its initial state by forming a large negative potential difference between the control gate <b>2</b> and the substrate P-sub, whereby resultant FN tunneling draws the trapped electrons back across the thin oxide layer between the floating gate <b>1</b> and substrate, thus removing the electron barrier and decreasing the threshold voltage Vth.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Multi-bit (or multi-state) nonvolatile memories are characterized by utilizing each cell transistor to store two or more bits of data simultaneously. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram for explaining the operation of an exemplary two-bit nonvolatile cell memory. The threshold voltages Vth of the large numbers of flash cell transistors found in flash memory devices generally exhibit bell curve distributions. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cell transistor can be set in any one of four (4) different threshold distributions, i.e., a first state, a second state, a third state and a fourth state. Any cell transistor having a threshold voltage within the distribution defined by one of these four states is assigned a corresponding two-bit logic value, for example, “11”, “10”, “00” and “01” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The particular bit assignments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are known in the art as “gray-coding.”</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As mentioned above, a cell transistor is said to be “programmed” when its threshold voltage is increased from its normally ON state (its erased state) to a threshold voltage of a higher state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the threshold voltage distribution to the far left of the diagram (“11”) is the erased state. In two-bit programming of the cell transistor, two successive programming operations are executed, namely, a least significant bit (LSB) program mode, and a most significant bit (MSB) program mode. Examples of these LSB and MSB program modes are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Note first that the cell transistor is initially in its erased state, and accordingly, its initial logic value is “11” (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In this example, if the LSB of the data to be stored is “0”, then a programming operation is executed to increase the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the first state to the second state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). On the other hand, if the LSB of the data to be stored is “1”, no programming is executed during the LSB program mode. Note here that the cell transistor is either in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Next the MSB of the data to be stored dictates operations in the MSB program mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the case where gray-coding has been adopted. Regardless of whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode, no programming is executed in the MSB program mode if the MSB of the data to be stored is “1”. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is “0”, then programming occurs which is dependent on whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode. This is shown by the dashed lines appearing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. If the MSB of the data to be stored is “0”, and if the cell transistor is in the first state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the first state to the fourth state. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is “0”, and if the cell transistor is in the second state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the second state to the third state.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, except that binary coding has been adopted. In this case, the first through fourth threshold voltage states designate two-bit values of “11”, “10”, “01” and “00”. Again, regardless of whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode, no programming is executed in the MSB mode if the MSB of the data to be stored is “1”. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is “0”, then programming occurs which is dependent on whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode. This is shown by the dashed lines appearing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. If the MSB of the data to be stored is “0”, and if the cell transistor is in the first state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the first state to the third state. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is “0”, and if the cell transistor is in the second state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the second state to the fourth state.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reading of the multi-bit nonvolatile memory will be described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the LSB read mode in which the logic value of the LSB of the stored data is determined. The LSB read mode involves a first LSB read operation and a conditional second LSB read operation. In the first LSB read operation, a first read voltage Vread<b>1</b> is applied to the word line of cell transistor. If the cell transistor is turned ON as a result, then the cell transistor must be in the first state (“11”). If the cell transistor remains OFF, then a second LSB read operation is executed by applying a second read voltage Vread<b>2</b> to the word line of the cell transistor. Here, if the cell transistor remains OFF during the second LSB read operation, the cell transistor must be in the fourth state (“01”). On the other hand, if the cell transistor turns ON during the second LSB read operation, then the LSB of the stored data is “0”, but the MSB of the stored data remains unknown.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case of gray-coding, the MSB of the stored data can be detected by a single read operation. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> where the read operation is conducted by applying the third read voltage Vread<b>3</b> to the word line of the memory cell. If the cell transistor turns ON, the MSB of the stored data is “1”. If the cell transistor remains OFF, the MSB of the stored data is “0”.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As should be apparent from the above, detection of the multiple bits of a multi-bit nonvolatile memory is quite complex when compared to the detection of a single-bit nonvolatile memory. Numerous challenges are encountered when designing and developing the circuitry needed to both program and read the multiple bits from individual cell transistors.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">NAND flash memories are characterized by serially connected strings of flash memory cell transistors, where multiple parallel strings constitute a memory block of the flash memory. Each string is comprised of a plurality of flash memory cell transistors connected in series along a bit line BL in the memory block, and word lines WL are connected to the control gates of each respective row of cell transistors in the memory block. For example, a flash memory device may contain 16 or 32 cell transistors in each string, and 4224 strings (B/L<b>0</b> . . . B/L<b>4223</b>) in each memory block.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates two strings of memory cells MC each storing and outputting data through a respective even bit line BLe or odd bit line BLo.

Access to these odd and even bit lines BLe and BLo will be explained in more detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At opposite ends of each string are string select transistors having control gates which receive a string select signal SSL and a ground select signal GSL. Generally, the select signals SSL and GSL are utilized in reading and programming of the cell transistors. Further, at the end of each string is a common source line CSL which sets a source line voltage of the cell transistor strings of each memory block.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the main buffer block <b>200</b> of this example includes a main sensing node NSENM, a main sensing latch unit <b>210</b>, and an output driving unit <b>220</b>.

Further, in this example, the main latch driving unit <b>215</b> includes a main latch driving transistor <b>215</b><i>a</i>. The main latch driving transistor <b>215</b><i>a </i>is an NMOS transistor that is gated in response to the buffer selection address Yp and has a source terminal connected to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The latch transmission unit <b>213</b> of this example includes a first latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>a </i>and a second latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the voltage level of the main sensing node NSENM is close to the supply voltage VDD, the main sensing response transistor <b>217</b><i>a </i>is turned ON.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The main pre-charge unit <b>230</b> of this example includes a main pre-charge transistor <b>230</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The output driving unit <b>220</b> is enabled in response to the buffer selection address Yp, and drives an internal output line IDOUT to a predetermined output driving voltage which depends on the main latch data stored on the main latch node NLATM.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the example of this embodiment, when the main latch data stored on the main latch node NLATM is logic “H”, the internal output line IDOUT is driven to the ground voltage VSS in response to the transition of the buffer selection address Yp to a logic “H” state.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">On the other hand, when the main latch data stored on the main latch node NLATM is logic “L”, the first output driving transistor <b>220</b><i>a </i>is turned off.

In this embodiment, the sub-read latch signal LCHS is activated to a logic “H” state before the programming of a second bit data value in the memory cell MCsel is completed, but after the programming of a first bit data value in the memory cell MCsel has been completed. Also in this embodiment, main latch data stored in the main buffer block <b>200</b> can be flipped to correspond to a data value ultimately read from the memory cell MCsel.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> are timing diagrams showing principal signal and node voltages during programming of the first data bit value, i.e., the least signification bit (LSB) of a multi-bit nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention. This programming sequence is referred to herein as the “first data bit value LSB” program mode LSBPG.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">For explanation purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> are segmented into eight (8) LSBPG intervals, namely, a page buffer setup interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>1</b> interval”), a data loading interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>2</b> interval”), a high voltage enable interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>3</b> interval”), a bit line setup interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>4</b> interval”), a program execution interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>5</b> interval”), a recovery interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>6</b> interval”), a verification read interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>7</b> interval”), and a verification scan interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBPG<b>8</b> interval”).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Throughout the LSBPG<b>1</b> to LSBPG<b>8</b> intervals, the sub-pre-charge signal /PLOADS, the sub-read latch signal LCHS, the verification read control signal VFY and the sub-latch initialization signal RST are all inactive. The sub-latch block <b>300</b> is therefore effectively prevented from influencing the main sensing node NSENM.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">During the LSBPG<b>1</b> interval, the main latch node NLATM is adjusted to a program inhibited state before externally applied data is loaded, i.e., in this example, the voltage level of the main latch node NLATM is set to a logic “H” state. Herein, the phrase “program inhibited state” denotes a state in which the execution of programming is not required with respect to externally applied data. In this example, when data of logic value “1” is externally applied, the execution of the programming is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">More specifically, during the LSBPG<b>1</b> interval, the buffer selection address Yp is in a logic “H” state so as to turn ON the latch driving transistor <b>215</b><i>a</i>. Further, both the main selection address Yq and the sub-selection address Yr are in a logic “H” state, and thus the block decoding signal /BLDEC is activated to a logic “L” state. In this example, the first global input line GDI is an active pulse having a logic “L” state, and the second global input line nGDI is in a logic “H” state. Accordingly, the first internal input data IDI is an active pulse having a logic “H” state, and the second internal input data nIDI is in a logic “L” state. The first latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>a </i>is therefore temporarily turned ON, and the second latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>b </i>is in an OFF state. In this manner, the main latch node NLATM is set to the program inhibited state, i.e., a logic “H” state.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the LSBPG<b>2</b> interval, externally applied data is loaded on the main latch node NLATM before the selected memory cell MCsel is programmed. When the input data is logic “0”, a logic “L” state is stored as main latch data on the main latch node NLATM. In contrast, when the input data is logic “1”, a logic “H” state is stored as main latch data on the main latch node NLATM.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">More specifically, in the LSBPG<b>2</b> interval, the buffer selection address Yp is logic “H”. Also, both the main selection address Yq and the sub-selection address Yr are logic “H”, and thus the block decoding signal /BLDEC is logic “L”. At this time, the first global input line GDI or the second global input line nGDI is changed to a logic “H” state.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">That is, if the input data is logic “L”, the second global input line nGDI is changed to a logic “L” state, and accordingly, the first internal input line IDI is in a logic “L” state, and the second internal input line nIDI is changed to a logic “H” state. Therefore, data of a logic “L” state is stored on the latch node NLATM.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">On the other hand, if the input data is logic “H”, the first global input line GDI is changed to a logic “L” state. As a result, the second internal input line nIDI is in a logic “L” state, and the first internal input line IDI is changed to a logic “H” state. Therefore, data of a logic “H” state is stored on the latch node NLATM.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">During the LSBPG<b>3</b> interval, high voltage pumping circuits of the multi-bit nonvolatile memory device are enabled. These circuits, which are not shown in the drawings, generate the various operational supply voltages having voltage levels which exceed VDD. In the example of this embodiment, the high voltage pumping circuits includes circuits for generating a program voltage VPGM (for example, 20V), a pass voltage VPASS (for example, 7 to 9V), and a read voltage VREAD (for example, 5V). Further, the high voltage pumping circuits may also include a circuit for generating a boosting voltage VPP (not shown) which is utilized by the row decoder <b>600</b>. For reference, the supply voltage VDD in the example of the present embodiment is about 2.2 V.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the LSBPG<b>4</b> interval, the voltage of the even bit line BLe of the selected memory cell MCsel is adjusted to a level corresponding to data stored on the main latch node NLATM. That is, when data of logic “1” is programmed, the even bit line BLe is set to a voltage level close to the supply voltage VDD. When data of logic “0” is programmed, the even bit line BLe is set to a voltage level close to the ground voltage VSS. Further, the odd bit line BLo that is not connected to the selected memory cell MCsel, that is, an unselected bit line, is adjusted to the program inhibited state.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">More specifically, the voltage levels of the control signals SHLDHeM/SHLDHeS are temporarily increased to the read voltage VREAD, and the voltages of the control signals SHLDHoM/SHLDHoS are increased to the read voltage VREAD. Therefore, the voltage levels of the even bit line BLe and the odd bit line BLo become the supply voltage VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The voltage levels of the control signals BLSLTeM/BLSLTeS and the main sensing node blocking signal SOBLK are also increased to the read voltage VREAD, and the voltage level of the main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM is increased to a voltage “VDD+Vt<b>1</b>”. In the present example, the voltage “Vt<b>1</b>” is a voltage of about 1.5 V.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">After the lapse of a predetermined time period within the LSBPG<b>4</b> interval, the voltage level of the control signals SHLDHeM/SHLDHeS is again decreased to the ground voltage VSS. Further, soon after the buffer selection signal PBSLT is initially changed to a first reference voltage VREF<b>1</b>, it is changed again to a fifth voltage. In the example of this embodiment, the first reference voltage VREF<b>1</b> is about 1.3V, and the fifth voltage is equal to “VDD+Vt<b>1</b>”.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As a result of the above operations, the data stored on the main latch node NLATM is transmitted to the even bit line BLe connected to the selected memory cell MCsel. If the data stored on the main latch node NLATM is logic “L”, the voltage of the even bit line BLe becomes “0V”. On the other hand, if the data stored on the main latch node NLATM is logic “H”, the even bit line BLe maintains the supply voltage VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The LSBPG<b>5</b> interval is executed next in which LSB data transmitted to the even bit line BLe is stored in the selected memory cell MCsel. That is, when the LSB is logic “1” and thus the voltage level of the even bit line BLe is close to the supply voltage VDD, the program inhibited state is maintained. In contrast, when the LSB is logic “0” and thus the voltage level of the even bit line BLe is close to the ground voltage VSS, the selected memory cell MCsel is programmed as a result of F-N tunneling.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In particular, a pass voltage VPASS is briefly applied to a selected word line WL for a predetermined period of time, and then the program voltage VPGM, which is a third voltage, is applied to the selected word line WL. As discussed previously, the program voltage VPGM enables data dependent upon the voltage level of the even bit line BLe to be programmed in the selected memory cell MCsel. Further, the pass voltage VPASS is applied to the remaining unselected word lines WL, and accordingly, the unselected memory cells MC are not program-enabled and thus maintain their current states.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Also, during the LSBPG<b>5</b> interval, the string selection line SSL is changed to the supply voltage VDD, the ground selection line GSL remains the ground voltage VSS, and the common source line CSL maintains a voltage of about 1.5V.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The LSBPG<b>6</b> interval is executed next in which word lines WL, bit lines BL, BLe and BLo, and the sensing node NSENM are discharged to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">That is, during the LSBPG<b>6</b> interval, the control signals SHLDLeM/SHLDLeS and the control signals SHLDLoM/SHLDLoS are activated, and the control signals BLSLTeM/BLSLTeS, the main sensing node blocking signal SOBLKM, and the main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM are changed to the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the bit lines BL, BLe and BLo, and the sensing node NSENM, are discharged to the ground voltage VSS. In addition, voltages of the selected and unselected word lines are made the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, the buffer selection signal PBSLT is changed to the ground voltage VSS to electrically isolate the bit line BL from the main latch node NLATM.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The LSBPG<b>7</b> interval is executed next to sense (verify) the data programmed in the memory cell MCsel. Briefly, this is carried out by application of a first read verification voltage VF<b>1</b> to the selected word line WL during a read verification mode.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The specific operations performed during the LSBPG<b>7</b> interval are effectively the same as those performed in a later described normal read mode. That is, the LSBPG<b>7</b> interval differs from the normal read mode in that only a single read sequence is executed (at verification read voltage VF<b>1</b>) with respect to the selected word line WLn-<b>1</b>, and the resetting of the main latch node NLATM can be omitted. Since the remaining operations performed during the LSBPG<b>7</b> interval are similar to those of the later described read mode, a detailed description thereof is omitted here to avoid redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The LSBPG<b>8</b> interval is executed next in which a determination is made as to whether the selected memory cell MCsel has been correctly programmed. This is done using the data stored on the main latch node NLATM during the LSBPG<b>7</b> interval.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">That is, during the LSBPG<b>8</b> interval, if the data stored on the main latch node NLATM is logic “H”, data of a logic “L” state is output to the global output line GDOUT, meaning that a pass signal is generated. On the other hand, if the data on the latch node NLATM is logic “L”, data of a logic “H” state is output to the global output line GDOUT, meaning that a fail signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">When the fail signal is generated during the LSBPG<b>8</b> interval, a program loop from the LSBPG<b>4</b> interval to the LSBPG<b>8</b> interval is repeated until a pass signal is generated. Once the pass signal is generated, the LSBPG program mode is completed.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">For explanation purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A through 19C</figref> are segmented into a plurality of intervals, namely, a page buffer setup interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>1</b> interval”), a data loading interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>2</b> interval”), an initial reading interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG-X interval”), a high voltage enable interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>3</b> interval”), a bit line setup interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>4</b> interval”), a program execution interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>5</b> interval”), a recovery interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>6</b> interval”), a verification read interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>7</b> interval”), and a verification scan interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>8</b> interval”). The MSBPG<b>7</b> interval of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A through 19C</figref> is further segmented into a first verification read interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>7</b> A interval”) and a second verification read interval (hereinafter referred to as an “MSBPG<b>7</b>B interval”).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The MSBPG<b>1</b> to MSBPG<b>6</b> intervals (excluding the MSBPG-X interval) of the second data bit value program mode MSBPG are similar to the previously described LSBPG<b>1</b> to LSBPG<b>6</b> intervals of the first bit data value program mode LSBPG. As such, a detailed description of these intervals is omitted here to avoid redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A through 19C</figref>, the initial read interval MSBPG-X is executed between MSBPG<b>2</b> and MSBPG<b>3</b> intervals. In the MSBPG-X interval, the first bit data value previously programmed in the memory cell MCsel is read, and sub-latch data corresponding to the read data value is stored on the sub-latch node NLATS of the sub-latch block <b>300</b>. That is, the first read voltage VR<b>1</b> of 0V is applied to a word line WL<b>1</b> of the selected memory cell MCsel, and a high voltage VREAD is applied to word lines WL&lt;n:<b>2</b>&gt; of unselected memory cells MC. Then, when the first bit data value (LSB) programmed in the memory cell MCsel is logic “0”, the sub-latch data stored on the sub-latch node NLATS is flipped to a logic “L” state in response to the sub-read latch signal LCHS (tMP<b>1</b>). In contrast, when the first bit data value (LSB) programmed in the memory cell MCsel is logic “1”, the sub-latch data stored on the sub-latch node NLATS maintains a logic “H” state. The MSBPG<b>3</b> through MSBPG<b>6</b> intervals are then executed in sequence, and as mentioned previously, these intervals are essentially the same as the intervals LSBPG<b>3</b> through LSBPG<b>6</b> already described.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The first verification read interval MSBPG<b>7</b>A is then executed. During the MSBPG<b>7</b>A interval, the second verification read voltage VF<b>2</b> of 1.3V is applied to the word line WL<b>1</b> of the selected memory cell MCsel.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the case where memory cell MCsel is programmed to the first data state “11” or the second data state “10”, the voltage level of the main sensing node NSENM decreases to the ground voltage VSS.

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the case where the memory cell MCsel is programmed to the third data state “00”, the voltage level of the main sensing node NSENM maintains the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the main latch data is flipped from a logic “L” state to a logic “H” state.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Further, in the case wherein the memory cell MCsel is programmed to the fourth data state “01”, the sub-latch data stored on the sub-latch node NLATS is logic “H”. At this time, the voltage level of the main sensing node NSENM decreases to the ground voltage VSS in response to the verification read control signal VFY. Therefore, the main latch data is not flipped, but maintains a logic “L” state that existed during the MSBPG<b>2</b> interval.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Next, the second verification read interval MSBPG<b>7</b>B is executed. During the second verification read interval MSBPG<b>7</b>B, the third verification read voltage VF<b>3</b> of 2.3V is applied to the word line WL<b>1</b> of the selected memory cell MCsel.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the case where the memory cell MCsel is programmed to the fourth data state “01”, the voltage level of the main sensing node NSENM maintains the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the main latch data is flipped from a logic “L” state to a logic “H” state. Otherwise, the main latch data maintains its current state.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">So long as one of the first through fourth data states is correctly stored in the memory cell MCsel, the main latch data will have a logic “H” state at the end of the MSBPG<b>7</b>B interval. As such, data of a logic “L” state, which indicates a pass condition, is provided to both the internal output line IDOUT and to the global output line GDOUT. In contrast, if the intended data state is not correctly programmed, the main latch data will have a logic “L” state. As such, data indicative of a fail condition (logic “H”) will be transmitted on the internal output line IDOUT and the global output line GDOUT.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Herein, two types of fail conditions are described, namely, a “third data state failure program operation” and a “fourth data state failure program operation”.

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, since the input second bit data value is logic “0” during the MSBPG<b>2</b> interval, main latch data of a logic “L” state is stored on the main latch node NLATM.

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In the third data state failure program operation, the main latch data is still in a logic “L” state even after the first and second verification read intervals MSBPG<b>7</b>A and MSBPG<b>7</b>B have terminated.

<p id="p-0203" num="0202">For explanation purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> are segmented into nine (9) LSBRD intervals, namely, a bit line discharge and page buffer reset interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>1</b> interval”), a first bit line pre-charge interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>2</b> interval”), a first bit line development interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>3</b> interval”), a first sensing interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>4</b> interval”), a second bit line precharge interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>5</b> interval”), a second bit line development interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>6</b> interval”), a second sensing interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>7</b> interval”), a recovery interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>8</b> interval”), and a data fetch interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>9</b> interval”).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">For explanation purposes, the LSBRD<b>1</b> interval is divided here into a page buffer reset interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>1</b><i>a </i>interval”) and a bit line discharge interval (hereinafter referred to as an “LSBRD<b>1</b><i>b </i>interval”). During the LSBRD<b>1</b><i>a </i>interval, the main latch node NLATM of the main buffer block is reset to a logic “L” state, that is, the ground voltage VSS.

<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Resetting of the main latch node NLATM during the LSBRD<b>1</b><i>a </i>interval is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Since the buffer selection address Yp is logic “H” during the LSBRD<b>1</b><i>a </i>interval, the main latch driving transistor <b>215</b><i>a </i>is turned ON. Further, since both the main selection address Yp and the sub-selection address Yr are logic “H”, the voltage level of a block decoding signal /BLDEC is changed to a logic “L” state. At this time, the voltage level of the first global input line GDI is logic “H”, and the voltage level of the second global input line nGDI is logic “L”. Therefore, the voltage level of the first internal input line IDI is logic “L”, and the voltage level of the second internal input line nIDI is logic “H”. The first latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>a </i>is turned OFF, and the second latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>b </i>is turned ON. Accordingly, the voltage level of the node N<b>211</b><i>a </i>of the main latch unit <b>211</b> is changed to a logic “H” state, and the main latch node NLATM is reset to a logic “L” state.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The discharge of the bit lines BLe, BLo, BLm and BLs during the LSBRD<b>1</b><i>b </i>interval is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">During the LSBRD<b>1</b><i>b </i>interval, a read voltage VREAD (for example, 5V) is applied to unselected word lines WL&lt;n:<b>2</b>&gt;, and the ground voltage VSS is applied to a selected word line WL<b>1</b>. Further, the read voltage VREAD is applied to both the string selection line (SSL) and the ground selection line (GSL), and the ground voltage VSS is applied to the common source line (CSL). Also, control signals SHLDHeM, SHLDHeS, SHLDHoM and SHLDHoS are set to the ground voltage VSS, and control signals SHLDLeM, SHLDLeS, SHLDLoM, SHLDLoS, BLSLTeM, BLSLTeS, SOBLKM and SOBLKS are set to the supply voltage VDD. In this manner, the bit lines BLe, BLo, BLm and BLs are discharged to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The LSBRD<b>2</b> interval is executed next in which the even bit line BLe and the main bit line BLm are pre-charged to a predetermined pre-charge voltage (for example, 0.8V) to sense the data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">During the LSBRD<b>2</b> interval, the ground voltage VSS, which is a first reference voltage, is applied to the selected word line WL<b>1</b>, and the read voltage VREAD is applied to the unselected word lines WL&lt;n:<b>2</b>&gt;. Therefore, the on/off states of the selected memory cell MCsel are controlled depending on the data stored therein. When the data stored in the selected memory cell MCsel has a first data state (“11” in this example), the selected memory cell MCsel is in an ON state. In contrast, when the stored data is one of the second to fourth data states (“10”, “00” and “10” in this example), the selected memory cell MCsel is in an OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">During the LSBRD<b>2</b> interval, the voltage levels of the control signals SHLDLeM and SHLDLeS are changed to the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, the discharge state of the even bit line BLe and the main bit line BLm is released. In this case, the control signals SHLDLoM and SHLDLoS are maintained at the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the voltage level of the odd bit line BLo maintains the ground voltage VSS, and then functions as a shielding line between even bit lines BLe.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Further, after the main pre-charge signal /PLOADM changes from the supply voltage VDD to a first preliminary voltage VPRE<b>1</b> and maintains the first preliminary voltage VPRE<b>1</b> for a certain period of time, the main pre-charge signal /PLOADM decreases to the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, the main pre-charge transistor <b>230</b><i>a </i>is turned ON, and the main sensing node NSENM is thus pre-charged to the supply voltage VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In this case, the voltage level of a main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM is changed to a second preliminary voltage VPRE<b>2</b> having a voltage level between the supply voltage VDD and the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, the main sensing node NSENM and the main bit line BLm are electrically connected to each other. As described above, the main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM gates the main bit line shutoff transistor <b>240</b><i>a </i>with the second preliminary voltage VPRE<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the main bit line BLm is recharged to a voltage level that is lower than the second preliminary voltage VPRE<b>2</b> by the threshold voltage of the main bit line shutoff transistor <b>240</b><i>a </i>through the use of current provided from the main pre-charge transistor <b>230</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The LSBRD<b>3</b> interval is executed next in which the main bit line BLm senses the data stored in the selected memory cell MCsel and develops the sensed data thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">During the LSBRD<b>3</b> interval, since the main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM is the ground voltage VSS, the main bit line shutoff transistor <b>240</b><i>a </i>is set to an ON state. Therefore, the main bit line BLm is electrically isolated from the main sensing node NSENM, and the development of data on the main bit line BLm progresses.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">When a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is a first data state (“11” in this example), data on the main bit line BLm is discharged to the common source line (CSL). Therefore, the voltage level of the main bit line BLm approaches the ground voltage VSS. When the data value in the selected memory cell MCsel is one of the second to fourth data states (“10”, “00” and “0” in this example), the voltage level of the main bit line BLm does not change, except for any fluctuation caused by leakage current.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Further, the main pre-charge transistor <b>230</b><i>a </i>maintains ON state and is then turned off just before the LSBRD<b>3</b> interval terminates. Therefore, the main sensing node NSENM is changed to a floating state after maintaining the supply voltage VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The LSBRD<b>4</b> interval is executed next in which data developed on the main bit line BLm, that is, data corresponding to the voltage level of the main bit line BLm, is stored on the main latch node NLATM of the main buffer block <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">First, the floating state of the main sensing node NSENM occurring during the LSBRD<b>3</b> interval is maintained. Thereafter, the voltage level of the main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM is changed to a third preliminary voltage VPRE<b>3</b>, thus turning ON the main bit line shutoff transistor <b>240</b><i>a</i>. According to this example, the third preliminary voltage VPRE<b>3</b> has a voltage level between the ground voltage VSS and the supply voltage VDD. The voltage level of the main sensing node NSENM is determined according to the voltage level of data developed on the main bit line BLm.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In this case, the data value of the first internal input line IDI is changed to a logic “H” state, whereby the first latch transmission transistor <b>213</b><i>a </i>is turned ON. Further, the main latch node NLATM stores the data loaded on the main sensing node NSENM, determined according to the voltage level of the main bit line BLm, which ultimately corresponds to the data stored in the selected memory cell MCsel. That is, when a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is a first data state (“11” in this example), the voltage levels of the main bit line BLm and the main sensing node NSENM are close to the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, even if the main read latch signal LCHM is enabled to a logic “H” state, the main latch data on the main latch node NLATM maintains a logic “L” state.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">If a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is one of the second to fourth data states (“10”, “00” and “01” in this example), the main bit line BLm maintains the initially pre-charged voltage level, so that the main sensing node NSENM maintains a logic “H” state. Therefore, when the main read latch signal LCHM is enabled to a logic “H” state, the main latch data on the main latch node NLATM is flipped to a logic “H” state.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The second bit line precharge interval (LSBRD<b>5</b> interval), a second bit line development interval (LSBRD<b>6</b> interval) and a second sensing interval (LSBRD<b>7</b> interval) are executed next.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Except as discussed below, the operations executed during the LSBRD<b>5</b>, LSBRD<b>6</b> and LSBRD<b>7</b> intervals are closely similar to those executed during the LSBRD<b>2</b>, LSBRD<b>3</b> and LSBRD<b>4</b> intervals, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Specifically, while the first reference voltage (VSS) is applied to the selected word line WL<b>1</b> during the LSBRD<b>2</b>, LSBRD<b>3</b> and LSBRD<b>4</b> intervals, the third reference voltage (about 2.3V) is applied to the selected word line WL<b>1</b> during the LSBRD<b>5</b>, LSBRD<b>6</b> and LSBRD<b>7</b> intervals. Therefore, when a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is one of the first to third data states (“11”, “10” and “00” in this example), the selected memory cell MCsel is in an ON state. When the stored data value is a fourth data state (“01” in this example), the selected memory cell MCsel is in an ON state.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The voltage levels of the main bit line BLm and the main sensing node NSENM obtained during the LSBRD<b>6</b> and LSBRD<b>7</b> intervals are somewhat different from those obtained during the LSBRD<b>3</b> and LSBRD<b>4</b> intervals. That is, when a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is the one of the first to third data states (“11”, “10” and “00” in this example) during the LSBRD<b>6</b> and LSBRD<b>7</b> intervals, the voltage levels of the main bit line BLm and the main sensing node NSENM approach the ground voltage VSS. Further, when a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is the fourth data state (“01” in this example), the voltage levels of the main bit line BLm and the main sensing node NSENM hardly change.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Further, the LSBRD<b>7</b> interval is different from the LSBRD<b>4</b> interval in that the first internal input line IDI is logic “H” during the LSBRD<b>4</b> interval, while the second internal input line nIDI is logic “H” during the LSBRD<b>7</b> interval. Therefore, the main latch data is flipped from a logic “L” state to a logic “H” state during the LSBRD<b>4</b> interval, while the main latch data is flipped from a logic “H” state to a logic “L” state during the LSBRD<b>7</b> interval. Therefore, when a data value in the selected memory cell MCsel is a fourth data state (“01” in this example), the main latch data is flipped from a logic “H” state to a logic “L” state.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Consequently, after the main read latch signal LCHM is enabled to a logic “H” state during the LSBRD<b>7</b> interval, the logic state of the main latch data on the main latch node NLATM is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">If a data value in the selected memory cell MCsel is the first or fourth data state (“11” or “01” in this example), that is, if a first bit data value (LSB) is “1”, the voltage level of the main latch data on the main latch node NLATM is logic “L”. If the data value in the selected memory cell MCsel is a second or third data state (“10” or “00”, in this example), that is, if a first bit data value (LSB) is “0”, the voltage level of the main latch data on the main latch node NLATM is logic “H”.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The other operations executed during the LSBRD<b>5</b>, LSBRD<b>6</b> and LSBRD<b>7</b> intervals are the same as those executed during the LSBRD<b>2</b>, LSBRD<b>3</b> and LSBRD<b>4</b> intervals, and accordingly, a detailed description thereof is omitted here to avoid redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The LSBRD<b>8</b> interval is executed next in which the main bit line BLm and the main sensing node NSENM are reset.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">During the LSBRD<b>8</b> interval, the voltage levels of the control signals SHLDLeM and SHLDLeS are changed to the supply voltage VDD, and the voltage levels of the control signals BLSLTeM, BLSLTeS and SOBLKM are changed from the read voltage VREAD to the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the main bit line BLm and the main sensing node NSENM are reset to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Further, the voltage levels of unselected word lines WL&lt;n:<b>2</b>&gt;, the string selection line (SSL) and the ground selection line (GSL) are changed from the read voltage VREAD to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The LSBRD<b>9</b> interval is executed next in which data corresponding to the main latch data stored on the main latch node NLATM during the LSBRD<b>7</b> interval is output to the global output line GDOUT through the internal output line IDOUT.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">During the LSBRD<b>9</b> interval, the buffer selection address Yp and the block decoding signal /BLDEC are pulse activated. Data corresponding to the main latch data is transmitted to the global output line GDOUT through the internal output line IDOUT in response to the activation of the block decoding signal /BLDEC.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In the example of this embodiment, the global output line GDOUT is pre-charged to the supply voltage VDD by an output line pre-charge circuit (not shown) before the block decoding signal/BLDEC is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Therefore, when a first bit data value (LSB) stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is “11”, data on the main latch node NLATM is logic “L”, whereby data on the global output line GDOUT is changed to a logic “H” state. When a first bit data value (LSB) in the selected memory cell MCsel is “0”, data on the main latch node NLATM is logic “H”, whereby data on the global output line GDOUT is discharged to a logic “L” state. In this manner, the global output line GDOUT carries a signal indicative of the LSB of the selected memory cell MCsel.</p>

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The ground voltage VSS, which is the first reference voltage, is applied to a selected word line WL<b>1</b> during the LSBRD<b>1</b> through LSBRD<b>4</b> intervals, while the second reference voltage of about 1.3V is applied to the selected word line WL<b>1</b> during the MSBRD<b>1</b> through MSBRD<b>4</b> intervals.

<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The method of executing a read mode in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> includes a first main latch data initialization step S<b>1410</b>, a first bit data value primary read step S<b>1430</b>, a first bit data value secondary read step S<b>1450</b>, a first bit data value identification step S<b>1470</b>, a second main latch data initialization step S<b>1490</b>, a second bit data value read step S<b>1510</b>, and a second bit data value identification step S<b>1530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In the first main latch data initialization step S<b>1410</b>, the main latch data stored on the main latch node NLATM is initialized to a logic “L” state. In this case, the main latch driving voltage provided from the main latch driving unit <b>215</b> is utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In the first bit data value primary read step S<b>1430</b>, the selected memory cell MCsel is driven to the first reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">At this time, when data stored in the memory cell MCsel has one of the second to fourth data states (“10”, “00” and “01” in this example), the main latch data is flipped from a logic “L” state to a logic “H” state. Further, the main latch data is flipped with the main sensing response voltage provided from the main sensing response unit <b>217</b>. In contrast, when data stored in the memory cell MCsel has the first data state (“11” in this example), the main latch node is not flipped.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">At the first bit data value secondary read step S<b>1450</b>, the selected memory cell MCsel is driven to a third reference voltage. At this time, when data stored in the memory cell MCsel has a fourth data state (“01” in this example), the main latch data is flipped from a logic “H” state to a logic “L” state. Further, the main latch data is flipped with the main sensing response voltage. In contrast, when data stored in the memory cell MCsel has one of the first to third data states (“11”, “10” and “00” in this example), the main latch data does not flip.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">In the first bit data value verification step S<b>1470</b>, the internal output line IDOUT and the global output line GDOUT are driven by the main latch data obtained by the execution of the first bit data value secondary read step S<b>1450</b>.

<p id="p-0254" num="0253">In the second bit data value read step S<b>1510</b>, the selected memory cell MCsel is driven to the second reference voltage.

<p id="p-0257" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a timing diagram showing principal signal and node voltages during erasing of a multi-bit nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention. This programming sequence is referred to herein as an erase mode ERS.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">For explanation purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is segmented into six (6) ERS intervals, namely, an erase execution interval (hereinafter referred to as an “ERS<b>1</b> interval”), a first recovery interval (hereinafter referred to as an “ERS<b>2</b> interval”), a second recovery interval (hereinafter referred to as an “ERS<b>3</b> interval”), a first verification read interval (hereinafter referred to as an “ERS<b>4</b> interval”), a second verification read interval (hereinafter referred to as an “ERS<b>5</b> interval”), and a Y-scan interval (hereinafter referred to as an “ERS<b>6</b> interval”).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">During the ERS<b>1</b> interval, an erase voltage VERS is applied to the bulk region of the memory cells MC, and a voltage of about 0.3V is applied to selected word lines to erase data from corresponding memory cells. In this example, the erase voltage VERS is about 20V. Further, unselected word lines are adjusted to a floating state. In this case, the voltage level of the unselected word lines approaches the erase voltage VERS as the result of coupling with the bulk region. Therefore, an erase operation is not performed in the memory cells connected to the unselected word lines.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Also during the ERS<b>1</b> interval, the voltage levels of control signals SHLDHeM, SHLDHeS, SHLDHoM, SHLDHoS, SHLDLeM, SHLDLeS, SHLDLoM and SHLDLoS are maintained at the ground voltage VSS, and the voltage levels of control signals BLSLTeM, BLSLTeS, BLSLToM and BLSLToS are changed to “VERS-Vt<b>2</b>”. Sensing node blocking signals SOBLKM and SOBLKS maintain the supply voltage VDD. In this example, the voltage “Vt<b>2</b>” represents the threshold voltage of a high voltage NMOS transistor and is about 1.3V.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">During the ERS<b>2</b> and ERS<b>3</b> intervals, the voltages of the bulk region of the memory cells and the bit line BL are adjusted to sense the data stored in the selected memory cell MCsel.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">That is, the ERS<b>2</b> interval, during which the common source line (CSL) is discharged, is executed in which the bulk region of the memory cell MC is floated and a voltage of VERS-Vt charged on the CSL is discharged to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">In the ERS<b>3</b> interval, the bulk region and the bit lines BLm, BLs, BLe and BLo are discharged. That is, during the ERS<b>3</b> interval, the voltage levels of the control signals SHLDHeM, SHLDHeS, SHLDHoM and SHLDHoS are changed to the ground voltage VSS. Further, the voltage levels of the control signals, SHLDLeM, SHLDLeS, SHLDLoM, SHLDLoS, BLSLTeM, BLSLTeS, BLSLToM and BLSLToS are changed to the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the bit lines BLm, BLs, BLe and BLo are discharged to the ground voltage VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">During the ERS<b>4</b> and ERS<b>5</b> intervals, the main latch node NLATM is pre-charged to sense any un-erased data of the memory cell MC. Further, the data stored in the memory cell is sensed by and stored on the main latch node NLATM.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">That is, during the ERS<b>4</b> interval, the data of the memory cell MC that is connected to the even bit line BLe and was not erased during the ERS<b>1</b> interval is sensed after the main latch node NLATM is pre-charged to a logic “H” state. The operation performed during the ERS<b>4</b> interval is closely similar to that performed in the second bit data value (MSB) read mode. However, in the ERS<b>4</b> interval, the first reference voltage of 0V is applied to all word lines WL&lt;n:<b>1</b>&gt; in the selected memory block and the main latch node NLATM is reset to a logic “H” state. Further, sensing of read data is performed by the activation of the second internal input line nIDI during the ERS<b>4</b> interval. Since the remaining operations executed during the ERS<b>4</b> interval are essentially the same as those performed in the second bit data value (MSB) read mode, a description of the ERS<b>4</b> interval is omitted here to avoid redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The ERS<b>5</b> interval is executed next to sense data that is stored in the memory cell MC of the odd bit line BLo and that has not been erased during the ERS<b>1</b> interval. The operations executed during the ERS<b>5</b> interval differ from those of the ERS<b>4</b> interval in that setting the main latch node NLATM is not performed. Otherwise, the ERS<b>5</b> interval is closely similar to the ERS<b>4</b> interval, and accordingly, a detailed description thereof is omitted to avoid redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The ERS<b>6</b> interval is executed next in which a determination is made as to whether the erase operation for the memory cells MC has been correctly performed with respect to the data sensed during the ERS<b>4</b> and ERS<b>5</b> intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">If the main latch node NLATM is in a logic “H” state during the ERS<b>6</b> interval, data of a logic “L” state is output to the global output line GDOUT, which means that a pass signal is generated. In contrast, if the main latch node NLATM is in a logic “L” state, data of a logic “H” state is output to the global output line GDOUT, which means that a fail signal is generated. Therefore, when the pass signal is generated, the erase mode is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">However, during the ERS<b>6</b> interval, if the main latch node NLATM maintains a logic “H” state, the memory cell MCsel is sensed as an “on cell” in both the ERS<b>4</b> and ERS<b>5</b> intervals. If the even bit line BLe is connected to an “off cell”, the main latch node NLATM is discharged to the ground voltage VSS during the ERS<b>4</b> interval. Therefore, even though a memory cell MC connected to the odd bit line BLo is an “on cell” during the ERS<b>5</b> interval, data on the main latch node NLATM is logic “L”.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Further, if the odd bit line BLo is connected to an “off cell”, then data on the main latch node NLATM becomes logic “L” during the ERS<b>5</b> interval, even if a memory cell MC connected to the even bit line BLe is an “on cell”. As such, a fail signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">Therefore, a pass signal is generated only when both the even bit line BLe and the odd bit line BLo are connected to “on cells”.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, a NAND-type nonvolatile semiconductor memory device is shown and described in this specification. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the technical spirit of the present invention can also be applied to other types of nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices, such as AND-type semiconductor memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Further, as already suggested, it is not necessary or essential to include each and every element of the exemplary embodiments to realize the benefits and advantages of the present invention. As one example only, attention is direct to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> which illustrates a modification of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.
