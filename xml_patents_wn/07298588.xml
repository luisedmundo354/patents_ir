<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the field of disc drive storage, and more particularly to magnetic recording media on directly textured glass substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional disc drives are used to magnetically record, store and retrieve digital data. Data is recorded to and retrieved from one or more discs that are rotated at more than one thousand revolutions per minute (rpm) by a motor. The data is recorded and retrieved from the discs by an array of vertically aligned read/write head assemblies, which are controllably moved from data track to data track by an actuator assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The three major components making up a conventional hard disc drive are magnetic media, read/write head assemblies and motors. Magnetic media, which is used as a medium to magnetically store digital data, typically includes a layered structure, of which at least one of the layers is made of a magnetic material, such as CoCrPtB, having high coercivity and high remnant moment. The read/write head assemblies typically include a read sensor and a writing coil carried on an air bearing slider attached to an actuator. This slider acts in a cooperative hydrodynamic relationship with a thin layer of air dragged along by the spinning discs to fly the head assembly in a closely spaced relationship to the disc surface. The actuator is used to move the heads from track to track and is of the type usually referred to as a rotary voice coil actuator. A typical rotary voice coil actuator consists of a pivot shaft fixedly attached to the disc drive housing closely adjacent to the outer diameter of the discs. Motors, which are used to spin the magnetic media at rates of higher than 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), typically include brushless direct current (DC) motors. The structure of disc drives is well known.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Magnetic media can be locally magnetized by a read/write head, which creates a highly concentrated magnetic field that alternates direction based upon bits of the information being stored. The highly concentrated localized magnetic field produced by the read/write head magnetizes the grains of the magnetic media at that location, provided the magnetic field is greater than the coercivity of the magnetic media. The grains retain a remnant magnetization after the magnetic field is removed, which points in the same direction of the magnetic field. A read/write head that produces an electrical response to a magnetic signal can then read the magnetization of the magnetic media.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Magnetic media structures are typically made to include a series of thin films deposited on top of aluminum substrates, ceramic substrates or glass substrates. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a conventional magnetic media structure built on top of a glass substrate including a glass substrate <b>110</b>, a nickel-phosphorous (NiP) layer <b>115</b>, a seed layer <b>120</b>, a magnetic layer <b>125</b> and a protective layer <b>130</b>. The glass substrate <b>110</b> is typically a high quality glass having few defects such as those produced by OHARA Disk (M) SDN. BHD of Melaka, Malaysia. The nickel-phosphorous (NiP) layer <b>115</b> is an amorphous layer that is usually electrolessly plated or sputtered onto the glass substrate <b>110</b>. The NiP layer is used to enhance both the mechanical performance and magnetic properties of the disk. The NiP layer enhances the mechanical properties of the disk by providing a hard surface on which to texture. The magnetic properties are enhanced by providing a textured surface which improves the magnetic properties including the orientation ratio (OR) as is further discussed below. However, the disadvantage of applying the NiP layer <b>115</b> is that it adds another step in the process of making magnetic media, which adds to the cost of the magnetic media.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Seed layer <b>120</b> is typically a thin film made of chromium that is deposited onto the NiP layer <b>115</b> and forms the foundation for structures that are deposited on top of it. Magnetic layer <b>125</b>, which is deposited on top of seed layer <b>120</b>, typically include a stack of several magnetic and non-magnetic layers. The magnetic layers are typically made out of magnetic alloys containing cobalt (Co), platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr), whereas the non-magnetic layers are typically made out of metallic non-magnetic materials. Finally, protective overcoat <b>130</b> is a thin film typically made of carbon and hydrogen, which is deposited on top of the magnetic layers <b>125</b> using conventional thin film deposition techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the prior art conventional method of making the conventional magnetic media structure discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> above. First in step <b>140</b> a substrate <b>110</b> is prepared for deposition prior to cleaning. Next in step <b>145</b> the substrate is cleaned using conventional cleaning procedures that clean the substrate and prepares it for thin film deposition. In step <b>150</b>, the NiP layer <b>115</b> is deposited onto the substrate. Typically, the NiP layer <b>115</b> is plated onto the substrate, if the substrate is aluminum and sputtered on if the substrate is glass or ceramic. Next in step <b>155</b> the NiP layer <b>115</b> is mechanically textured. Next in step <b>160</b> the seed layer <b>120</b> is deposited using conventional thin film deposition techniques. In step <b>165</b> the magnetic layer or layers <b>125</b> are deposited using similar techniques as used in step <b>160</b> to deposit seed layer <b>120</b>. In step <b>170</b>, the protective overcoat layer <b>130</b> is deposited over the magnetic layers <b>125</b>. Typically, this protective overcoat layer <b>130</b> consists of carbon with hydrogen and is deposited directly after of the previous layer while the substrate remains under vacuum. The protective overcoat layer <b>130</b> is typically deposited by transferring the substrate with thin films, while being kept under vacuum, to an adjacent chamber that is isolated from the chambers previously used to deposit films. Protective overcoat layer <b>130</b> is typically deposited in an isolated chamber because reactive gasses containing hydrogen or nitrogen can be used in the deposition process. Finally in step <b>175</b> the vacuum deposition process ends by moving the conventional media structure into a load lock and unloading the media structure from the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Generally, macroscopic in-plane magnetic anisotropy is induced when magnetic recording media are sputtered on mechanically textured NiP coated disk substrates. In such case, the remnant moment (M<sub>rt</sub>) is higher in the circumferential direction than in the radial direction. The orientation ratio OR<sub>MRT </sub>is defined as the ratio of the measured M<sub>rt </sub>in the circumferential direction to the measured M<sub>rt </sub>in the radial direction. Media with OR<sub>MRT</sub>&gt;1 is called oriented media and media with OR<sub>MRT</sub>=1 is called isotropic media. The notation for orientation ratio OR<sub>MRT </sub>will be abbreviated as OR throughout this disclosure. One way of achieving orientated media on glass substrates <b>110</b>, is to mechanically texture the NiP layer <b>115</b> before films are sputtered onto them as was discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> above However, this procedure of depositing a NiP layer <b>115</b> onto the glass substrate <b>110</b> and mechanically texturing the NiP layer <b>115</b> significantly increases the cost of making magnetic media. Magnetic recording media sputtered directly on glass substrates are usually isotropic (OR<sub>MRT</sub>=1).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The advantages of oriented media is that they have higher thermal stability and better recording performance such as narrow pulse width and low media noise compared to isotropic media. However, the disadvantages of making oriented media on glass substrates are the additional cost and processing which is associated with depositing the NiP layer <b>115</b> and consequently texturing the NiP layer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There exists a particular need for a magnetic recording media comprising an alternate substrate, such as glass or ceramic, which exhibits OR<sub>MRT</sub>&gt;1 and is suitable for high aerial density recording application. The conventional ways of achieving oriented media on glass substrates are limited to using either mechanically texture NiP pre-coated glass substrates or sputtering NiP on directly textured glass substrates before the deposition of magnetic layers. Therefore what is needed is an alternative system and method that produces oriented media (OR&gt;1) on glass substrates that is as good, if not better, than the conventional means that use a NiP layer. This alternative media will reduce the cost of making high quality media on glass substrates by providing alternative means of making oriented media on glass that does not require the use of NiP and the associated steps that go along with using a NiP layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This limitation is overcome by making a magnetic recording medium comprising a magnetic media structure having a CoW seedlayer on a directly textured glass substrate. The magnetic recording medium with such a seedlayer can have an OR that is similar or higher than that with a NiP seedlayer. Magnetic recording medium with a CoW seedlayer can produce oriented glass media with orientation ratio OR&gt;1 when sputtered on substrates which have been circumferentially textured before the deposition of the CoW seedlayer. The sputter-deposited CoW seedlayer has a predominately amorphous or nanocrystalline structure or a mixture of amorphous and nanocrystalline structure. The CoW seedlayer is sputter deposited onto the circumferentially textured glass substrate with a gas mixture of Ar and at least one of the following gases including O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>. The W content of the CoW seedlayer can range between 30-50 at % and the thickness of the CoW seedlayer can range between 10 Å and 200 Å.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention provides a system and method for high areal density magnetic recording media deposited on glass substrates exhibiting oriented media magnetic properties.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a magnetic media structure <b>200</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, including a glass substrate <b>210</b>, a cobalt-tungsten (CoW) layer <b>215</b>, a chromium (Cr) layer <b>220</b>, a chromium-molybdenum-tantalum (CrMoTa) layer <b>225</b>, a cobalt-chromium-tantalum (CoCrTa) layer <b>230</b>, a first cobalt-chromium-platinum-boron alloy (First CoCrPtB alloy) layer <b>235</b>, a second cobalt-chromium-platinum-boron alloy (Second CoCrPtB alloy) layer <b>240</b>, and a protective overcoat layer <b>245</b>. Specifically, in one embodiment the CoW layer <b>215</b> is CoW<sub>40</sub>, the CrMoTa layer <b>225</b> is CrMo<sub>10</sub>Ta<sub>3</sub>, the CoCrTa layer <b>230</b> is CoCr<sub>14</sub>Ta<sub>4</sub>, the First CoCrPtB layer <b>235</b> is Co<sub>57</sub>Cr<sub>24</sub>Pt<sub>13</sub>B<sub>6</sub>, and the Second CoCrPtB layer <b>240</b> is Co<sub>57</sub>Cr<sub>15</sub>Pt<sub>16</sub>B<sub>12</sub>. Other possible concentrations are discussed below. The compositions and atomic percentages of the layers are directly related to the composition and atomic percentages of the target material being sputtered. For example, sputtering a target having a composition of Mo 10 at % and Ta 3 at % with the balance being Cr grows the CrMo10Ta3 layer. Similarly, sputtering targets of other compositions and atomic percentages grows films of substantially the same composition and atomic percentage in most cases but not all cases as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Substrate <b>210</b> is typically a high quality glass or ceramic substrate that has been circumferentially textured. The CoW layer <b>215</b> is a seed layer that has a predominately amorphous or nanocrystalline structure or a mixture of amorphous and nanocrystalline structure. The thickness of the CoW layer <b>215</b> is preferably between 10 Å and 200 Å while the W content of the CoW layer <b>215</b> is preferably between 30 at % and 50 at %. The CoW layer <b>215</b> can be deposited onto the substrate <b>210</b> using a variety of thin film growth techniques including sputtering, as is further discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> below. In one embodiment the CoW layer <b>215</b> is deposited onto the substrate using magnetron sputtering techniques with a gas mixture of Ar and at least one of O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, or N<sub>2</sub>. Alternatively other reactive gasses such as CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>, can be mixed with a noble gas such as Xe or Ar and used to sputter the CoW layer. The CoW layer <b>215</b> is used as a seedlayer because a magnetic media structure with a CoW seedlayer has a stronger (002)\(11 <o ostyle="single">2</o>0) texture than does a magnetic media structure with a NiP seedlayer. The ability of the CoW seedlayer to induce (002)\(11 <o ostyle="single">2</o>0) texture in the later deposited films is important for orientation ratio (OR). Additionally, the CoW layer <b>215</b> can also be used to isolate the later deposited films from the substrate <b>210</b>. Since the substrate can release contaminants which migrate into the later deposited films, which adversely affects the magnetic properties, the CoW layer <b>215</b> serves the function of separating the substrate from the rest of the later deposited structure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The Cr layer <b>220</b>, which is deposited on top of the CoW layer <b>215</b>, is an underlayer that enhances the coercivity of the later deposited magnetic films by orienting the crystal growth. In other embodiments, the Cr layer <b>220</b> can be substituted with a Cr-alloy, which may contain at least one alloying element chosen from W, Mo, V, Si, Ti, Mn, Ru, B, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Pt. The CrMoTa layer <b>225</b> is a second underlayer and the CoCrTa layer <b>230</b> is an intermediate layer. Both of these layers are used to increase the signal-to-media noise ratio (SMNR) of the magnetic media stack as well as the magnetic properties. The combination of the First CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>235</b> and Second CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>240</b> make up the magnetic layer, which gives the desired magnetic properties including coercivity and total magnetic remnant moment. Protective overcoat layer <b>245</b> is a hard overcoat layer that is lubricated and permits the head to glide over the surface without wearing out the media, which could lead to a malfunction of the disc drive. Typically, protective overcoat layer <b>245</b> is made of combinations of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. Preferably the protective overcoat is diamond-like-carbon which is made up of carbon and hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the one embodiment described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only references one specific concentration of elements in each layer, other embodiments having different concentrations of elements in each layer can be used to produce oriented media. Different embodiments of the invention can include a sputter-deposited CoW layer <b>215</b> followed by at least one Cr or Cr-alloy <b>220</b> underlayer and at least one magnetic layer on a circumferentially textured substrate to achieve an Mrt orientation ratio greater than one. The underlayer can further have a multi-layer structure with each layer being a Cr-alloy with different alloy content. The intermediate layer can also further have a multi-layer structure consisting of magnetic or non-magnetic materials or a mixture of them. For example, ruthenium (Ru) can be deposited between the CoCrTa layer and the first CoCrPtB layer to make either ferromagnetically or anti-ferromagnetically coupled multi-layer structures. Varying the thickness of the Ru layer changes the coupling of the structure from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic. The magnetic layer can also have a multi-layer structure with each magnetic layer having different alloy contents. Additionally, the magnetic multi-layer structure may have laminated nonmagnetic interlayers. Finally, the magnetic layer may also include granular structures that have ferromagnetic crystal grains uniformly distributed within a non-magnetic base material.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The CoW layer <b>215</b> may also be used for circumferentially textured NiP coated aluminum substrates. Such a usage allows media properties to be less sensitive to the time between substrate pre-wash and sputter-deposition. One advantage of minimizing the effects of time between substrate pre-wash and sputter deposition is that mass production of magnetic media in a factory is easier, more flexible and cheaper.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the preferred method of making magnetic media structure <b>200</b> on a glass or ceramic substrate. First in step <b>305</b> a substrate <b>210</b> is circumferentially textured prior to cleaning. In step <b>305</b>, the glass substrate is textured, using conventional mechanical texturing processes, to have a surface roughness of about 1 Å to about 12 Å. Next in step <b>310</b> the substrate is cleaned using a conventional glass cleaning procedure-involving combinations of acids, detergents, alcohol, solvents and water. This step cleans the substrate <b>210</b> of any residue left over from the texturing process and prepares the substrate <b>210</b> for the subsequent thin film deposition process. In step <b>320</b>, the CoW layer <b>215</b> is deposited onto the substrate <b>210</b> creating a predominately amorphous or nanocrystalline structure or a mixture of amorphous and nanocrystalline structure on the substrate. Typically the CoW layer <b>215</b> is sputter deposited onto the substrate <b>210</b> using conventional thin film growth techniques. Since the CoW is typically sputter deposited, the substrate is loaded into a vacuum deposition apparatus after it is cleaned in step <b>310</b> and before the CoW layer <b>215</b> is deposited in step <b>320</b>. The CoW<sub>40 </sub>layer can be sputter deposited onto the substrate, with a direct current (DC) magnetron, from a target that has a composition of 60 at % Co and 40 at % W. Additionally, the sputtering gas can be a mixture Ar and O<sub>2</sub>, which is optimized for sputtering CoW, and is usually held at a process pressure ranging from 2 millitorr to 12 millitorr. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other thin film deposition processes can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next in step <b>330</b> the Cr layer <b>220</b> is deposited onto the CoW layer <b>215</b>. This is typically done in the same deposition apparatus as the CoW was deposited and is usually accomplished by moving the substrate in front of a Cr target or moving the Cr target in front of the substrate and striking a plasma resulting in the deposition of the Cr layer <b>220</b> on the CoW layer <b>215</b>. The Cr layer is deposited in an inert gas environment such as Ar or other noble element gas. Therefore, when reactive gasses such as O<sub>2 </sub>are used to deposit the CoW, a door or vacuum valve is usually used to isolate the chamber used to deposit the Cr layer as well as other layers.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next in step <b>340</b>, the CrMoTa layer <b>225</b> is deposited onto the Cr layer <b>220</b> using the same apparatus and procedure as used in steps <b>330</b> and <b>340</b>. Next in step <b>350</b>, the CoCrTa layer <b>230</b> is deposited using similar processes as were used in steps <b>330</b> through <b>340</b>. Similarly, the First CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>235</b> and the Second CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>240</b> are deposited in step <b>360</b> and step <b>370</b>, respectively, using similar processes as were used in the previous steps. In step <b>370</b>, the protective overcoat layer <b>245</b> is deposited over the Second CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>240</b>. Typically, this protective overcoat layer <b>245</b>, which consists of carbon with hydrogen, is deposited directly after deposition of the previous deposited magnetic layers while the substrate remains under vacuum. The protective overcoat layer <b>245</b> is typically deposited by transferring the substrate with thin films, while being kept under vacuum, to an adjacent chamber that is isolated from the chambers previously used to deposit the CoW layer <b>215</b>, Cr layer <b>220</b>, CrMoTa layer <b>225</b>, CoCrTa layer <b>230</b>, First CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>235</b> and Second CoCrPtB alloy layer <b>240</b>. Protective overcoat layer <b>240</b> is typically deposited in an isolated chamber because reactive gasses containing hydrogen or nitrogen can be used in the deposition process. Finally in step <b>380</b> the vacuum deposition process ends by moving the sputtered magnetic media structure <b>200</b> into a load lock and unloading the magnetic media structure <b>200</b> from the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The above-mentioned process can be done with a variety of different thin film deposition processes including but not limited to plasma sputter deposition, ion beam deposition, chemical vapor deposition and reactive ion sputtering as is know to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Table 1 shows magnetic properties of various magnetic media structures including a CoW layer sputtered under different gas environments, which include oxygen and no oxygen. Specifically, Table 1 shows the coercivity (Hcr), (Magnetic Remnant Moment)×Thickness (Mrt), squareness (S*), and orientation ratio (OR) of the magnetic media structure seedlayer \Cr\CrMo<sub>10</sub>Ta<sub>3</sub>\CoCr<sub>14</sub>Ta<sub>4</sub>\CoCr<sub>24</sub>Pt<sub>13</sub>B<sub>6</sub>\CoCr<sub>15</sub>Pt<sub>16</sub>B<sub>12 </sub>deposited on textured glass substrates for seedlayer consisting of CoW<sub>40 </sub>sputtered in an Argon gas, CoW<sub>40 </sub>sputter deposited in an Ar+O<sub>2 </sub>gas, and NiP<sub>20 </sub>sputter deposited in an Ar+O<sub>2 </sub>gas. The magnetic properties were measured with conventional magnetic measurement tools. For the data shown in Table 1, the CoW<sub>40 </sub>film thickness is approximately 60 Å, the NiP<sub>20 </sub>thickness is approximately 90 Å and the total thickness of the Cr and CrMo<sub>10</sub>Ta<sub>3 </sub>is 70 Å. In this comparison, the substrates are pre-coated with a CoW<sub>40 </sub>seedlayer or with a NiP<sub>20 </sub>seedlayer before the magnetic recording media are sputtered so that comparison can be made between these two seedlayers. Additionally, the pre-coating of the seedlayer is done within the same sputtering system as the magnetic recording medium without breaking vacuum. Sputtering the seedlayer in a different sputtering system produces similar effects provided care is taken to avoid contamination of the seedlayer when transferred between different sputtering systems. The CoW<sub>40 </sub>is sputtered onto the circumferentially textured glass substrate with a DC magnetron from a target that has a composition of 60 at % Co and 40 at % W. The Ar and O<sub>2 </sub>mixing ratios for sputtering of CoW<sub>40 </sub>and NiP<sub>20 </sub>are optimized individually to achieve best performance. In Table 1, the CoW<sub>40 </sub>of the sample # 1 was sputtered with pure Ar gas. The CoW<sub>40 </sub>of the sample # 2 was sputtered with an Ar:O<sub>2 </sub>mixed ratio of 2:1. The NiP<sub>20 </sub>of the sample #3 was sputtered with an Ar:O<sub>2 </sub>mixed ratio of 1:5. The optimized Ar to O<sub>2 </sub>gas ratio for seedlayer sputtering depends on target composition, film deposition speed and pumping speed of the sputtering chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to sputter depositing the seedlayer for the structures shown in Table 1, the disks were heated after the deposition of the CoW<sub>40 </sub>seedlayer and before the Cr layer was sputter deposited onto the seedlayer. The sputter deposited CoW<sub>40 </sub>seedlayers of both sample #1 and sample #2 are amorphous or nanocrystalline, as measured by x-ray diffractometry (XRD). Moreover, the quality of the amorphous or nanocrystalline CoW<sub>40 </sub>seedlayer can be modified by using sputter gas which is a mixture of Ar and optimized amounts of O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O or N<sub>2</sub>. The amount of O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O or N<sub>2 </sub>mixed with Ar during the sputtering of CoW<sub>40</sub>, needs to be optimized to achieve a magnetic media structure with the highest OR.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing and comparing the X-Ray Diffractionn (XRD) scans of media sputtered on directly textured glass substrates with CoW and NiP seedlayers. The oxygen/argon gas ratios used to sputter deposit the CoW seedlayers were the same for samples 4147t11, 4147t12 and 4147t13 but the deposition rates were different. The CoW layer of sample 4147t11 was deposited using the highest deposition rate while the CoW layer of sample 4147t13 was deposited using lowest deposition rate. The oxygen content of the CoW layers is different for all three samples. Sample 4147t10 is different than the other three samples because the seedlayer is NiP sputter deposited with an optimized O<sub>2</sub>/Ar gas mixture. The orientation ratio (OR) for samples 4147t10, 4147t11, 4147t12 and 4147t13 are 1.66, 1.52, 1.64 and 1.72, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that all films having a CoW seedlayers have a stronger (002)\(11 <o ostyle="single">2</o>0) texture than the film having a NiP seedlayer. These results show that CoW seedlayers induce (002)\(11 <o ostyle="single">2</o>0) texture in the later deposited films, which assists seedlayers in enabling a better OR. Media with a CoW seedlayer can produce oriented glass media with OR&gt;1 when sputtered on substrates which have been circumferentially textured before sputter.</p>
