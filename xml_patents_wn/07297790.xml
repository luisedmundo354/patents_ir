<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The present invention relates to anhydrous mirtazapine crystals and a process for preparing the same, and crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate and a process for preparing the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to anhydrous mirtazapine crystals having low hygroscopic properties, which are useful as an antidepressant, and a process for preparing the same, and crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate, which are useful as a preparation intermediate for the anhydrous mirtazapine crystals, and a process for preparing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">As a process for increasing the purity of mirtazapine, there has been proposed a process for recrystallizing mirtazapine from a petroleum ether or the like (U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,848).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">However, there are some defects in this process that impurities are precipitated in an oily state when a crude mirtazapine having a purity of 95 to 99% or so is used, so that the crystallization of mirtazapine is inhibited, and that it would be difficult to crystallize mirtazapine having a high purity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In addition, since the crystals of mirtazapine have hygroscopic properties, there are some defects in the crystals that they cannot be handled and stored if they are not under dry conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">Accordingly, there have been earnestly desired the development of a process capable of efficiently preparing, mirtazapine having a high purity from a crude mirtazapine, and the development of mirtazapine crystals having low hygroscopic properties.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the prior art described above. An object of the present invention is to provide a process capable of efficiently preparing a high-purity mirtazapine from a crude mirtazapine, and anhydrous mirtazapine crystals having, low hygroscopic properties and a process for preparing the same; and crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate, which are useful as a preparation intermediate for the anhydrous mirtazapine crystals and a process for preparing the same. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0024" num="0025">In the present specification, the term “anhydrous” of the anhydrous mirtazapine crystals means that the mirtazapine crystals do not substantially contain moisture. More specifically, it is desired that the water content of the anhydrous mirtazapine crystals is not more than 0.5% by weight, preferably not more than 0.3% by weight, from the viewpoint of imparting sufficient low hygroscopic properties to the crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">The low-hygroscopic anhydrous mirtazapine crystals of the present invention have a hygroscopic degree of not more than 0.6% by weight when the crystals are stored in the air having a relative humidity of 75% at 25° C. under atmospheric pressure for 500 hours.

</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate can be readily prepared from, for instance, a crude mirtazapine as a starting material by the following method. The crude mirtazapine is one having a purity of not more than 99% or so, and can be prepared, for instance, by a process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,848.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">More specifically, the crude mirtazapine used in the present invention refers to one having an absorbance of not less than 0.1 at a wavelength of 600 nm and a transmittance of not more than 30% at a wavelength of 400 nm, when the absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm and the transmittance at a wavelength of 400 nm are determined using a 10 mm quartz cell in which 2 g of a crude mirtazapine dissolved in 10 mL of methanol is placed by means of a measuring device [commercially available from Shimadzu Corporation under the trade name of UV-2500PC], and also having b value shown by a colorimeter of not less than 10, when determined by using a colorimeter commercially available from Nippon Denshoku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha under the trade name of calorimeter Z-300A.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">In the preparation of the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate from a crude mirtazapine, firstly, the crude mirtazapine is dissolved in a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">The solvent includes a mixed solvent of a water-soluble organic solvent such as lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol; ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; ketones such as acetone; esters such as methyl acetate; and aprotic organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, with water. Among the water-soluble organic solvents, the lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are preferable. It is desired that the amount of water is 50 to 2000 parts by weight, preferably 80 to 1000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the water-soluble organic solvent, from the viewpoints of improvement in yield and improvements in purity and hue.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">It is desired that the amount of the solvent is usually 50 to 3000 parts by weight, preferably 50 to 2000 parts by weight, more preferably 100 to 1000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of mirtazapine, from the viewpoints of improvement in yield and improvements in purity and hue.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">The temperature at which the crude mirtazapine is dissolved in the solvent is not limited to specified ones. It is desired that the temperature is usually 0° to 80° C., preferably 0° to 60° C., more preferably 0° to 10° C., from the viewpoints of precipitating impurities as insoluble matters and efficiently removing them.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">When the crude mirtazapine is dissolved in the solvent at a temperature of 60° to 80° C., it is preferable to add water to a crude mirtazapine solution obtained by dissolving the crude mirtazapine in the solvent, from the viewpoint of improving the purity of the resulting mirtazapine hydrate. It is preferable that the amount of water is 10 to 100 parts by weight or so, based on 100 parts by weight of the solvent, from the viewpoints of improvements in purity and hue.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">In addition, in order to improve hue, a decolorizing carbon may be added properly to the crude mirtazapine solution. It is preferable that the amount of the decolonizing carbon used is 0.5 to 10 parts by weight or so, based on 100 parts by weight of the crude mirtazapine, from the viewpoints of improvements in purity and hue.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">It is preferable that a crude mirtazapine solution to which the decolorizing carbon is added is stirred at a temperature of 0° to 70° C. or so, preferably 0° to 30° C. or so, for 10 to 60 minutes in order to improve hue.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Next, the decolorizing carbon is filtered, and the decolorizing carbon is washed with a water-soluble organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, methyl acetate, dimethylformamide, or dimethyl sulfoxide. Thereafter, in order to obtain a uniform crystal, it is preferable to cool the resulting mirtazapine solution to a temperature of 0° to 10° C.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">It is preferable that water is added in a thin stream to the resulting mirtazapine solution in an amount of 100 to 1000 parts by weight or so based on 100 parts by weight of the crude mirtazapine, from the viewpoint of crystallization. Thereafter, the resulting solution is cooled to a temperature of 0° to 5° C. or so, and seed crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate may be added to the solution in order to obtain a uniform crystal. The amount of the seed crystals is not limited to specified ones, and the amount can be 0.05 to 1 part by weight or so, based on 100 parts by weight of the crude mirtazapine.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">In the procedures of dissolving and precipitating mirtazapine, it is preferable that the procedures are carried out in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, from the viewpoint of preventing coloration.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">After the resulting crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate are collected by filtration, the crystals may be washed with, for instance, a water-soluble organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, water, or a mixed solvent of the water-soluble organic solvent and water, and thereafter dried, as occasion demands. Thus, the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate are obtained. The average particle diameter of the resulting crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate is usually 60 to 150 μm. The crystals may be pulverized with a pulverizer such as a hammer-mill as occasion demands.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">Next, the process for preparing anhydrous mirtazapine crystals from the above-mentioned crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The low-hygroscopic anhydrous mirtazapine crystals can be readily prepared by drying the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate, which are obtained by crystallizing from a water-containing solvent as mentioned above. The anhydrous mirtazapine crystals have characteristic diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern, when angles of diffraction (2θ) are 9.14, 9.38, 14.16, 18.46, 18.56 and 20.56.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Before drying the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate, it is preferable to pulverize the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate in order to efficiently dry the crystals. This pulverization is carried out after filtering the resulting crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate. It is preferable to predry the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate in order to efficiently pulverize the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate. The predrying can be carried out by heating the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate to a temperature of 40° to 80° C. for 1 to 6 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The pulverization can be carried out by using, for instance, a pulverizer such as a hammer-mill, a cutter mill or an atomizer. It is desired that the pulverization is carried out so that the average particle diameter of the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate after the pulverization can be 10 to 70 μm or so, preferably 20 to 60 μm or so. The average particle diameter can be determined by using an apparatus commercially available from Shimadzu Corporation under the trade name of SALD1100, water as a medium, and Triton X-100 (trade name, commercially available from Rohm and Haas Co.) as a dispersing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">It is preferable that the drying is carried out under heating. In this case, it is desired that the heating temperature is 70° to 110° C., preferably 85° to 110° C., more preferably 90° to 105° C., from the viewpoint of shortening the drying time and the viewpoint of avoiding alteration of the mirtazapine hydrate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The drying time can be furthermore shortened if the drying is carried out under reduced pressure. It is desired that the reduced pressure is 1.33 to 13300 Pa, preferably 10 to 6650 Pa, more preferably 100 to 1995 Pa, from the viewpoint of drying in a short period of time without using a powerful vacuum pump.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">It is desired that the drying of the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate is carried out until the water content of the resulting anhydrous mirtazapine crystals becomes not more than 0.5% by weight, preferably not more than 0.3% by weight, from the viewpoint of imparting excellent low hygroscopic properties to the resulting anhydrous mirtazapine crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">The mirtazapine crystals thus obtained exhibit remarkably excellent properties such that the hygroscopic degree is not more than 0.6% by weight even though the mirtazapine crystals are stored in the air having a relative humidity of 75% at 25° C. under atmospheric pressure for 500 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">As explained above, according to the process of the present invention, the low-hygroscopic anhydrous mirtazapine crystals can be easily prepared from the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate as a starting material on an industrial scale.</p>

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>[Hygroscopic Degree (% by weight)]=[(Weight (<i>g</i>) of Crystals After Treatment)−(Weight (<i>g</i>) of Crystals Before Treatment)]÷[Weight (<i>g</i>) of Crystals Before Treatment]×100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">As is clear from the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the anhydrous mirtazapine crystals obtained in Example 7 have a very low hygroscopic degree after 500 hours passed, so that they are remarkably excellent in low hygroscopic properties, as compared with that of the mirtazapine crystals obtained in Comparative Example 3.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">In 4728 g of methanol was dissolved 1195.46 g of a crude mirtazapine (HPLC purity: 99.0%) at 0° to 5° C., and 12 g of decolorizing carbon was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 5° C. for 15 minutes. This solution was filtered at 0° to 5° C. Thereafter, 4065 g of ion-exchanged water was introduced into the filtrate, and 100 mg of seed crystals were added thereto. Thereto was added in a thin stream 9707 g of ion-exchanged water at 0° to 10° C. to allow crystallization. The mixture was stirred at 0° to 5° C. for 1 hour, and crystals were filtered. The crystals were washed with a mixed solution (liquid temperature: 0° to 5° C.) of 340 g of methanol and 1291 g of ion-exchanged water. The crystals were dried under reduced pressure (4 to 5.3 kPa) at 50° to 60° C. so that the water content was attained to not more than 3.5% by weight. The crystals were pulverized with a pulverizer (hammer-mill), to give crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate having an average particle diameter of 20 μm.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0114">On the bases of the above results, the molecular structure diagram of the mirtazapine hydrate obtained in Example 8 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0115">In addition, the crystal structure diagrams viewed along the a axis, the b axis, and the c axis of the mirtazapine hydrate obtained in Example 8 are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0116">In each figure, hydrogen atoms are geometrically calculated. Also, the positions of hydrogen atoms of the water molecules could not be determined from the electron density.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0117">As is clear from the above results, it can be seen that the space group of the crystals of the mirtazapine hydrate obtained in Example 8 is P2<sub>1</sub>/α, has a center of symmetry, and exists in a racemic form.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0118">The positions of oxygen atoms of the water molecules were estimated from the electron density distribution. As the electron density distribution was examined, it was found that there are two sites near the center of symmetry in which probability of existence was high. This distance is 1.75 Å. From the comparison of this distance with a van der Waals radius for oxygen atom of 1.4 Å, it can be thought that it would be less likely that two oxygen atoms exist at a distance of 1.75 Å. Therefore, it is estimated that oxygen atom of the water molecule does not simultaneously exist one each at these two sites, but randomly (probably with time) in any of two sites.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0119">Therefore, assuming that oxygen exists at these two sites, precision was carried out by varying its occupying ratio as a parameter. As a result, the occupying ratio focused in the vicinity of 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0120">It is thought from the above that one oxygen atom exists in a random state at these two sites. Finally, the occupying ratio was fixed at 0.5, and other parameters were precisely determined.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0121">Since the occupying ratio of the water molecules was 0.5, the molar ratio of the mirtazapine molecules to the water molecules in the crystals was 2:1.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0122">In addition, hydrogen bonding was formed between nitrogen atom of the mirtazapine molecule and oxygen atom of the water molecule in the crystal (in the figure, bonds shown by broken lines). Its bond distances were as follows. Incidentally, O(1)* is an atom in which O(1) was shifted by asymmetry operations.

One kilogram of decolorizing carbon was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 2° to 4° C. for 30 minutes. The mixture was filtered at 0° to 2° C., and thereafter 285 kg of ion-exchanged water was introduced into the filtrate over 30 minutes, and 80 g of seed crystals were added thereto. To the resulting mixture was added in a thin stream 682 kg of ion-exchanged water at 5° to 7° C. to allow crystallization. The mixture was stirred at 1° to 5° C. for 65 minutes, and crystals were filtered. The crystals were washed with a mixed solution (liquid temperature: 0° to 5° C.) of 24 kg of methanol and 90.8 kg of ion-exchanged water. As a result, 93.3 kg of wet crystals were obtained. Its dry weight was 80.5 kg.</p>

The mixture was filtered at 3.4° C., and thereafter 255 kg of ion-exchanged water was added in a thin stream to the filtrate over 45 minutes, and 80 g of seed crystals were added to the resulting mixture. Thereto was added in a thin stream 666 kg of ion-exchanged water at 5° to 7.8° C. over 75 minutes, and the mixture was stirred at 2.6° to 5° C. for 40 minutes, and thereafter filtered.
