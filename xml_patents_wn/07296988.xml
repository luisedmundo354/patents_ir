<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system for printing molding information from a molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In molding machines, e.g. injection molding machines, it is a generally accepted practice to display on a display screen, under the control of a control unit provided in the molding machine, various molding information including preset values such as molding conditions, and detected values (i.e., logging data) such as temperature, injection speed and resin pressure, showing a molding situation. In this connection, in order to print the molding information (molding conditions, logging data, picture data (such as hard copies of screens), etc.) on a medium such as a paper, a suitable printer unit is connected to the molding machine and the control unit of the molding machine commands the printing unit to print, because the conventional molding machine is not provided with a printing section as a component thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-57748 (JP5-57748A) discloses an injection molding machine provided with a control unit capable of transmitting print data to various types of printers, in order to permit a desired type of printer selected by a user to be connected to the injection molding machine for use. This control unit is constructed in such a manner that a user can select a printer to be actually connected, from the plural types of previously registered printers, and provide a printing command to the control unit, whereby the control unit can transmit print data to the connected printer in a print output format (or a data transmission mode) adapted to the connected printer. In this arrangement, it is necessary to previously prepare a plurality of data transmission modes adapted to the plural types of printers in the control unit of the molding machine, which causes an inconvenience in handling. Also, there is a disadvantage that only printers previously registered can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 4-175132 (JP4-175132A) discloses a group control system in which a plurality of injection molding machines are connected to a computer through a network, and in which a printer is connected to the computer so as to show and write all of the operating situations (or the events) of the injection molding machines together. In this system, the printer is structured in such a manner as to be able to print a single page containing an event-time writing area and event-contents writing areas corresponding respectively to the injection molding machines. If the events such as abnormal conditions occur in the respective molding machines, the printer prints the occurring times and contents of the events on the corresponding writing areas in real time by a time series expression. In this arrangement, a predetermined printer prints only the events such as abnormal conditions occurred in the respective molding machines on the single page, and thus the printer does not print, at any time, the molding information of the molding machine required by a user.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide, in a system of controlling a molding machine through a network, a molding information printing system capable of printing, at any time, molding information required by a user, using any printer selected by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a molding information printing system, comprising a network; a molding machine connected to the network; a printer for printing molding information of the molding machine; a print control section connected to the network independently of the molding machine, for controlling the printer for printing of the molding information; and an instructing section for instructing printing of the molding information and transferring a command to the print control section through the network.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the above molding information printing system, it is advantageous that the instructing section is provided to the molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this arrangement, it is preferred that the molding machine includes a control unit connected to the network, and that the instructing section is provided to the control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this configuration, the control unit may output the molding information as the command, on the basis of printing instructions instructed in the instructing section.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, the control unit may output, as the command, printing instructions instructed in the instructing section, and the print control section may acquire the molding information on the basis of the printing instructions output from the control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The instructing section may also be connected to the network.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also advantageous that the system comprises a computer connected to the network independently of the molding machine, and that the print control section is provided in the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The instructing section may comprise an input section for inputting printing instructions and a processing section for acquiring the molding information on the basis of the printing instructions input in the input section and for outputting the molding information as the command.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, the instructing section may comprise an input section for inputting printing instructions and a processing section for outputting the printing instructions as the command, and the print control section may acquire the molding information on the basis of the printing instructions output from the processing section.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A storage section for storing the molding information may be provided to the molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, the system may comprise a computer connected to the network independently of the molding machine, and a storage section for storing the molding information may be provided to the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The printer may be connected to the print control section, and the print control section may control the printer through a line outside the network.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, the printer may be connected to the network, and the print control section may control the printer through the network.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system may comprise a plurality of printers controllable by the print control section, printing instructions in the instructing section may include a printer designation for designating one printer selected from the plurality of printers, and the print control section may control the one printer designated by the printer designation for printing of the molding information.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0077">Various exemplary modes of a molding information printing process in the molding information printing system according to the present invention are explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 11B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show the first mode of the molding information printing process, performed by the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b> and the computer <b>46</b> in the above-described first to fifth embodiments. The system configuration executing this first processing mode corresponds to the combination of the above-described modes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D or <b>2</b>E, <b>2</b>F, <b>2</b>H and <b>2</b>J. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows a process flow executed by the processing section <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b> of one molding machine <b>42</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a process flow executed by the print control section <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) of one computer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0079">First, in step <b>101</b>, the processing section <b>28</b> judges whether the print start command is input in the input section <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b>. If the print start command is input, the processing section <b>28</b> reads out the molding information (MOLDING CONDITIONS, PROCESS MONITORING, TEMPERATURE) instructed in the input section <b>26</b> from the storage section <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b>, in step <b>102</b>, and prepares an information list for printing, in a predetermined form such as a table. Next, in step <b>103</b>, the processing section <b>28</b> transmits the information list for printing to the computer <b>46</b> indicated in the input section <b>26</b>, and then completes the print process.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0080">On the other hand, the computer <b>46</b>, which is monitoring the transmission of the information list for printing from the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b>, judges whether the transmitted information list for printing is addressed to the present computer <b>46</b>, in step <b>201</b>, and receives the list if it is addressed thereto. Next, in step <b>202</b>, the computer <b>46</b> controls and drives the printer <b>50</b> indicated in the input section <b>26</b>, so that the printer <b>50</b> prints the information list for printing. In this connection, in the configurations of the first and fourth embodiments as well as of one part of the fifth embodiment wherein the printer(s) <b>50</b> is connected to the computer <b>46</b>, the computer <b>46</b> directly drives the connected printer <b>50</b> so as to print the molding information. On the other hand, in the configurations of the second and third embodiments as well as of the other part of the fifth embodiment, the computer <b>46</b> drives the printer <b>50</b> through the network <b>48</b> so as to print the molding information.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> show the second mode of the molding information printing process, performed by the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b> and the computer <b>46</b> in the above-described first to fifth embodiments. The system configuration executing this second processing mode corresponds to the combination of the above-described modes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D or <b>2</b>E, <b>2</b>G, <b>2</b>I and <b>2</b>J. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows a process flow executed by the processing section <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b> of one molding machine <b>42</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows a process flow executed by the print control section <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) of one computer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0082">First, in step <b>111</b>, the processing section <b>28</b> judges whether the print start command is input in the input section <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b>. If the print start command is input, the processing section <b>28</b> transmits, in step <b>112</b>, the printing instructions including no molding information to the computer <b>46</b> indicated in the input section <b>26</b>, and then completes the print process.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0083">On the other hand, the computer <b>46</b>, which is monitoring the transmission of the printing instructions from the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b>, judges whether the transmitted printing instructions are addressed to the present computer <b>46</b>, in step <b>211</b>, and receives the instructions if they are addressed thereto. Next, in step <b>212</b>, the computer <b>46</b> accesses the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b> outputting the printing instructions, reads out the molding information (MOLDING CONDITIONS, PROCESS MONITORING, TEMPERATURE) instructed in the input section <b>26</b> from the storage section <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b>, and prepares an information list for printing, in a predetermined form such as a table. Next, in step <b>213</b>, the computer <b>46</b> controls and drives the printer <b>50</b> indicated in the input section <b>26</b>, through the network <b>48</b> or a line outside the network <b>48</b>, so that the printer <b>50</b> prints the information list for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> show the third mode of the molding information printing process, performed by the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b> and the computer <b>46</b> in the above-described first to fifth embodiments. The system configuration executing this third processing mode corresponds to the combination of the above-described modes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D or <b>2</b>E, <b>2</b>G, <b>2</b>I and <b>2</b>K. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a process flow executed by the processing section <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b> of one molding machine <b>42</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows a process flow executed by the print control section <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) of one computer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0085">In the third processing mode, each computer <b>46</b> collects the molding information from each molding machine <b>42</b> and stores it in the storage section <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>). For example, the preset values such as molding conditions are transferred from the molding machine <b>42</b> to the computer <b>46</b> every time when the presetting is changed, and the computer <b>46</b> stores and updates the preset values in the storage section <b>30</b> thereof as to be distinguished for the respective molding machines <b>42</b>. Further, each computer <b>46</b> reads out the logging data such as the process monitoring data and the temperature data from each molding machine <b>42</b> at predetermined periods such as every time of molding cycles or certain time intervals, and stores them in the storage section <b>30</b> as to be distinguished for the respective molding machines <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0086">First, in step <b>121</b>, the processing section <b>28</b> judges whether the print start command is input in the input section <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>) of the control unit <b>44</b>. If the print start command is input, the processing section <b>28</b> transmits, in step <b>122</b>, the printing instructions including no molding information to the computer <b>46</b> indicated in the input section <b>26</b>, and then completes the print process.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0087">On the other hand, the computer <b>46</b>, which is monitoring the transmission of the printing instructions from the control unit <b>44</b> of the molding machine <b>42</b>, judges whether the transmitted printing instructions are addressed to the present computer <b>46</b>, in step <b>221</b>, and receives the instructions if they are addressed thereto. Next, in step <b>222</b>, the computer <b>46</b> reads out the molding information (MOLDING CONDITIONS, PROCESS MONITORING, TEMPERATURE) instructed in the input section <b>26</b> from its own storage section <b>30</b>, in association with the molding machine <b>42</b> outputting the printing instructions, and prepares an information list for printing, in a predetermined form such as a table. Next, in step <b>223</b>, the computer <b>46</b> controls and drives the printer <b>50</b> indicated in the input section <b>26</b>, through the network <b>48</b> or a line outside the network <b>48</b>, so that the printer <b>50</b> prints the information list for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0088">Incidentally, when the molding information represented by “MOLDING CONDITIONS” is printed, it is preferred that the printer <b>50</b> is driven to print, just after the printing instructions thereof are input in the input section <b>26</b>. Contrary to this, as for the logging data instructed by “PROCESS MONITORING” or “TEMPERATURE”, it is preferred that the data is printed after the information list for printing, collectively showing data corresponding to a unit print (e.g., one page), is prepared. In this connection, if the printing instructions for the similar logging data are input from the other molding machine <b>42</b> during the time when the information list for printing is prepared, it is advantageous that the information list for printing, wherein the desired molding information of these molding machines <b>42</b> are written in a parallel arrangement, is prepared and printed, from the viewpoint of saving of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0089">Although, in the above-described first to fifth embodiments, the printing instructions for the molding information are input from the input section <b>26</b> of each molding machine <b>42</b>, it is also possible to input the printing instructions from each computer <b>46</b>. In this case, a printing-instructions entering screen displayed on a display of the computer <b>46</b> may be constituted so as to add a space for the selection and designation of the molding machine <b>42</b> to the printing-instructions entering screen <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As a result, it is possible for any computer <b>46</b> to input the printing instructions designating the molding machine having the required molding information, the type of molding information, as well as the computer and printer. In this configuration, the designated computer <b>46</b> executes processing steps after step <b>211</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> or processing steps after step <b>221</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, and thereby the designated printer <b>50</b> can print the designated molding information.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0090">As will be understood from the above, according to the present invention, it is possible to suitably select the computer and the printer for printing the molding information. Therefore, it is possible to satisfy various requirements, such that, in an arrangement wherein plural computers and plural printers, connected to a network, are situated respectively in a site where a molding machine is situated and in another place such as a system management room, and the printer in the management room is usually used to print the molding information, while the printer in the molding machine site is also used to print the molding information if the molding information is needed on the molding machine site.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0091">While the invention has been described with reference to specific preferred embodiments, it will be understood, by those skilled in the art, that various changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the following claims.</p>
