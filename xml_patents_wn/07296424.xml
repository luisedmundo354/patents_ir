<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mounting system is provided for mounting an air conditioner on the exterior of a building adjacent to a window with an opening defined by a window frame having a lower sill and a height to an upper horizontal frame member. The air conditioner includes a main cabinet and a removable air duct. The mounting system includes two mounting arms, each arm being attached at a first point to a wall of the main cabinet and at a second point being engaged to the frame of the window. The main cabinet is suspended from the two mounting arms such that when mounted, a top surface of the main cabinet is positioned at a height of no more than 10% of the height of the window opening above the sill. The mounting system may provide support for the air conditioner at three points, namely, the sill of the window, an inside casing of the window and an exterior surface of the building, without requiring any fasteners to be driven into any of these points.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a mounting system for an air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Air conditioners are oftentimes mounted in or adjacent to a window for the room such that at least a portion of the air conditioner is located outside of the room while the air conditioner is operating in order to prevent hot air associated with the condenser from entering the room that is being cooled. Many air conditioners are too large for them to merely rest on the window sill, with the partially closed window holding the air conditioner in place. Therefore, various types of mounting systems have been suggested in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,636,816, a bracket arrangement is disclosed that attaches, such as with screws, to the exterior window sill, and rests upon a strut pressed against the exterior siding of the building below the window. A variety of spacer blocks and vibration absorbing blocks are involved in the bracket arrangement. In U.S. Pat. No. 2,758,456, a bracket arrangement is disclosed that attaches to the interior window sill, such as by screws, and also rests upon a strut pressed against the exterior siding of the building below the window. In U.S. Pat. No. 2,717,139, a bracket arrangement is disclosed that clamps to an interior portion of the window sill, and also rests upon a strut pressed against the exterior siding of the building below the window. In each of these mounting systems, the bracket arrangements are installed prior to the air conditioner being placed on the bracket arrangement, and the air conditioner, in use, is positioned in the window opening, partially extending exterior of the room, and partially extending into the room. Also, in each case, to close the window fully or winterize the window, the air conditioner is required to be removed and stored in some other location.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Patent No. 4,510,852 discloses a mounting assembly for a room air conditioner that attaches on the inside of the room, above the window, and holds the air conditioner inside the room, until the air conditioner is to be used. At that point, the air conditioner is rolled on the mounting assembly to a position where it partially extends outside of the window by overhanging a portion of the mounting assembly. With this mounting assembly, the room air conditioner must be lifted to the elevated position of the upper window of a double hung window, and slid into an opening of the support frame. This mounting arrangement is useful only with double hung windows.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,543,533, 3,548,611, 3,552,139 and 3,602,006 all disclose a mounting arrangement for an air conditioner in which the operating components of the air conditioner depend along an outside building wall below a window, with a main body of the air conditioner projecting up into the window opening space. The air conditioner is attached to the window sill by screws and rests against the exterior siding of the building on a horizontal support foot. To install the air conditioner, either the installation takes place from the exterior of the building, if installed in a first floor window, or the person installing the air conditioner must blindly align a flanged support member with a channeled receiving track that is attached to a sill of the window opening.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be an improvement in the art if a mounting system were provided for an air conditioner that would address the problems of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">The present invention provides a mounting system for and a method of mounting an air conditioner on the exterior of a building adjacent to a window or other opening in the building. Particular embodiments of the invention are illustrated, however the scope of the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">In an embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a mounting system <b>30</b> is provided for mounting an air conditioner <b>32</b> on the exterior of a building <b>34</b> adjacent to a window <b>36</b>, wherein the air conditioner is supported solely by a frame <b>38</b> of the window and perhaps an exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building. In some embodiments, the support by the frame <b>38</b> is solely through a sill <b>42</b> of the frame and in other embodiments, the support by the frame is through the sill and through a vertical face <b>44</b> of an interior casing <b>46</b> of the frame. In the case of casingless window frames, a vertical face of the wall surrounding the window may substitute for the vertical face <b>44</b> of the casing <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">In this mounting arrangement, all of the electrical and mechanical components of the air conditioner <b>32</b>, such as the compressor, the evaporator, the fans and blowers, and the pumps are located on the exterior of the building, and principally below the window. This allows for a significant reduction in the noise being transmitted to the room being cooled, putting this type of air conditioner substantially on a par with central air conditioners, with respect to noise levels. The entire weight of the air conditioner, which may be in the range of 65 to 100 pounds, is supported by the mounting system <b>30</b> as described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">A specific embodiment of the mounting system <b>30</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-14</figref>. In this embodiment, the mounting system <b>30</b> comprises a mounting arm <b>48</b> attached to a wall <b>50</b> of a main cabinet <b>52</b> of the air conditioner <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, two mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, each attached at one end <b>56</b> to a left and right side wall <b>50</b>, <b>58</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> of the air conditioner <b>30</b>. In other embodiment, the mounting arm or arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> (two or more) may be secured to different walls or portions of the main cabinet <b>52</b> than the two walls illustrated. The mounting arm or arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may attach to the main cabinet <b>52</b> in a sliding manner, or in a pivoting manner or both. To provide a sliding attachment, a bearing pin <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be secured, such as with threaded fastening elements <b>62</b>, or by welding, or other fastening means, to the side walls <b>50</b>, <b>58</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b>. The mounting arm <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may have a slot or glide track <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) for receiving the bearing pin <b>60</b>, and a washer or enlarged head <b>66</b> on the bearing pin may assure that the arm will not come free from the bearing pin while in use. With the mounting arm <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> attached via the bearing pin <b>60</b>, and the slot <b>64</b> in the arm, the arm will also be pivotable or rotatable relative to the main cabinet <b>52</b>, unless otherwise constrained, as will be described in some situations below. The mounting arm <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may also be attached via the bearing pin <b>60</b> through a circular hole in the arm, rather than through a slot <b>64</b> as shown, in which case the arm will be pivotable or rotatable relative to the main cabinet <b>52</b>, but not slidable. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-14</figref>, the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> are attached on an exterior of the main cabinet <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">A length of the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may be adjusted by forming each arm in two parts, an outer arm <b>68</b> and an inner arm <b>70</b>, to accommodate for different wall thicknesses of a wall <b>72</b> that the air conditioner <b>32</b> is to be mounted to, and to accommodate the position of window sashes <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> in the wall. Some walls may be up to 12 inches thick, including 6 inch studs and a brick exterior siding. Other walls may only be about 5 inches thick, using a 4 inch stud and thin siding. This adjustability is particularly useful where a sill bracket, as described below, is to be utilized in the mounting system <b>30</b>. To make the adjustment, the user should make a measurement of a distance from the inside vertical face <b>44</b> of the casing <b>46</b> or wall surrounding the window <b>36</b> where the air conditioner <b>32</b> is to be mounted to a center of a channel in the sill <b>42</b> for the upper window sash <b>76</b> (in the case of a double hung window), or where the outside window (in the case of a single hung window) is centered. This distance should be replicated on the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as a distance <b>78</b> from a first hole <b>80</b> in the outer arm to <b>68</b> to a marking <b>82</b> on the inner arm <b>70</b>, just outward of a hole <b>84</b> at an inside end <b>86</b> of the inner arm. This marking <b>82</b> represents the approximate position that the inner arm <b>70</b> will have relative to the inside vertical face <b>44</b> of the casing <b>46</b> or wall surrounding the window <b>36</b>. The adjustment is made by aligning appropriate holes <b>88</b> in the inner arm <b>70</b> and the outer arm <b>68</b>, and securing fasteners <b>90</b>, such as bolts, through aligned holes <b>88</b> to hold the inner and outer arms at the desired relative positions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">In this illustrated embodiment, a cross bar <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is engaged with a second end <b>94</b> of the first and second mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>. The cross bar <b>92</b> may be engaged with the arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> by sliding through the hole <b>84</b> near the second end <b>94</b> of each of the arms. The cross bar <b>92</b> may also be engaged with the arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> by other attachment mechanisms. The cross bar <b>92</b> may be formed in two telescoping, and optionally threaded, sections <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> to permit a length of the cross bar to be adjusted so that the cross bar is substantially longer than a width of the main cabinet <b>52</b>, and in fact, longer than a width of the window opening, ensuring that each end <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the cross bar will extend beyond the window opening. A pad <b>104</b> of soft material, such as a non-marring and non-skidding material, as in an elastomeric or other material, may be applied to each end <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the cross bar <b>92</b> for engagement with the casing <b>46</b> or wall surrounding the window, as described below. Also, lateral stops <b>106</b> may be provided on the cross bar <b>92</b> to assure that the cross bar will be centered, and remain centered in the window opening during installation of the air conditioner <b>32</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">With the cross bar <b>92</b> assembled, the main cabinet <b>52</b> may be moved towards the window opening (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), using the cross bar under the main cabinet to provide a gripping location for a person on each side of the main cabinet to lift the cabinet. Alternatively, the cross bar <b>92</b> may be allowed to hang down on the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, below the main cabinet <b>52</b>, as the main cabinet is moved towards the window opening, with the gripping being done directly on the main cabinet. In some embodiments, as described below, the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> are constrained against significant pivoting or rotating movement, and so the arms will be constrained to hang down in such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">The main cabinet <b>52</b> is then set on the sill <b>42</b> of the window opening (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), such that one wall <b>108</b> of the cabinet rests on the sill. One or more skid rails <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are applied to this wall <b>108</b> to minimize any damage to the window sill <b>42</b>, and to provide a low friction sliding surface. The cross bar <b>92</b> is grasped and used as an installation aid, and the main cabinet <b>52</b> is allowed to slide out the window opening, with the only engagement being the cabinet wall <b>108</b> on the window sill <b>42</b>. Once the main cabinet <b>52</b> has slid completely out of the window opening, the cross bar <b>92</b> will engage the front face <b>44</b> of the window casing <b>46</b> to prevent the main cabinet from falling.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">The mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> will rest on the sill <b>42</b>, or the highest point thereof, providing vertical support for the main cabinet <b>52</b>, and the cross bar <b>92</b> will engage the vertical face <b>44</b> of the window casing <b>46</b>, or the wall <b>72</b> surrounding the window <b>36</b> at the padded ends <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, thereby preventing any damage to the casing or wall. The lateral stops <b>106</b> on the cross bar <b>92</b> are positioned just inside of the window opening to assure that the cross bar remains centered in the window opening, and that the cross bar engages the casing <b>46</b> or wall <b>72</b> on both sides of the window opening. The main cabinet <b>52</b> now hangs suspended from the first and second mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">In the illustrated embodiment, the position of the suspended main cabinet <b>52</b> relative to the supporting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> (and the building <b>34</b>) may be adjusted once the main cabinet has been mounted outside of the window. This adjustability will allow the mounting system <b>30</b> to accommodate a particular thickness of the building wall <b>72</b> in which the window is located. As mentioned above, building walls may have a range in thickness of between 5 to 12 inches. The adjustable position of the main cabinet <b>52</b> relative to the arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may be accomplished by grasping the main cabinet and pulling it towards the inside of the room to be cooled until the main cabinet engages the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>. Since the bearing pin <b>60</b> is positioned in the glide track or slot <b>64</b>, the main cabinet <b>52</b> is allowed to slide on the arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> toward and away from the building <b>34</b>, to the extent of the length of the glide track. In order to retain the main cabinet <b>52</b> in the position closest to the building <b>34</b>, a linear ratchet <b>112</b> may be provided in the form of ratchet teeth <b>114</b> formed on a top edge <b>116</b> of the outer arm <b>68</b> to be engaged by a finger <b>118</b> of a ratchet pawl <b>120</b> secured to the main cabinet <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the ratchet teeth <b>114</b> may be shaped to allow for easy movement of the main cabinet <b>52</b> in one direction (towards the inside) on the arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, and to prevent easy movement of the main cabinet in the opposite direction. The finger <b>118</b> may also be angled to assist in the one-way easy movement. The ratchet pawl <b>120</b>, being secured to the main cabinet <b>52</b>, provides a second function. The pawl <b>120</b>, by engaging the top edge <b>116</b> of the outer arm <b>68</b>, will prevent the main cabinet <b>52</b> from pivoting on the bearing pin <b>60</b>, at least in one rotational direction. As shown in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the pawl <b>120</b> will prevent the main cabinet <b>52</b> from over rotating in a counter-clockwise direction relative to the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">A pad <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) may be provided on the wall <b>108</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> which will frictionally engage the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>, once the main cabinet is pulled into engagement with the exterior siding of the building, to provide some vertical support for the main cabinet, and to prevent excessive rotation of the main cabinet relative to vertical exterior surface, in a rotational direction opposite that just described relative to the pawl <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">Once the main cabinet <b>52</b> is secured in place, an air duct housing <b>124</b> can be attached to a top surface <b>126</b> of the main cabinet to direct a flow of air through the window opening. The air duct housing <b>124</b> has two passages <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, one for air to be drawn from the room into the air conditioner <b>32</b>, and the other for air to be blown back into the room, after it has been cooled and dehumidified. The air duct housing <b>124</b> may attach to the main cabinet <b>52</b> in a variety of manners, such as with a friction telescoping fit, and appropriate fasteners or retaining elements to prevent the air duct from inadvertently dislodging from the main cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">The lower window sash <b>74</b> in the window opening may then be pulled down to engage a top <b>132</b> of the air duct housing <b>124</b>, or a surround <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) provided for sealing between sides <b>136</b> of the air duct and edges <b>138</b> of the window opening. The user is still able to open the window sash <b>74</b> with the air conditioner <b>32</b> remaining in place, and the relatively low profile of the air duct housing <b>124</b> will allow for a relatively large opening when the window is opened, to allow outside air to flow into the room, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">The air duct housing <b>124</b> may also act as a housing for controls <b>140</b> for the air conditioner <b>32</b>, and a passage for an electrical cord (not shown) to be plugged into a wall socket in the room to power the air conditioner. The controls <b>140</b> might also be located away from the air conditioner <b>32</b> and the air duct housing <b>124</b>, and could be wireless controls utilizing RF or IR transmission capabilities such that the controls, including temperature sensors, may be located in the space to be cooled, rather than at the air conditioner, in order to provide a more accurate temperature reading of the space being cooled. Such remote and portable controls <b>140</b> would also be more convenient for a user of the air conditioner <b>32</b>. The receiver of transmissions from the remote controls <b>140</b> could be located in the air duct housing <b>124</b> or in the main cabinet <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0080">Thus, in this embodiment, the mounting system provides a three point mounting arrangement where the air conditioner <b>32</b> is supported by the window frame sill <b>42</b>, by a vertical interior face <b>44</b> or wall adjacent to the window <b>36</b>, and by the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>. In other embodiments, as described below, the air conditioner <b>32</b> may be supported by only the sill <b>42</b> of the frame <b>38</b> and the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>, and in still other embodiments, the air conditioner may be supported only by the sill of the frame. The entire air conditioner <b>32</b> is mounted by the mounting system <b>30</b> described without requiring any fasteners to be driven into the window frame <b>38</b>, the wall <b>72</b> or the exterior siding <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0081">Further, in this embodiment, a combination of the air conditioner <b>32</b> and the mounting system <b>30</b> is provided for mounting the air conditioner on the exterior of the building <b>34</b> adjacent to the window <b>36</b> with a height <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of a visible window area measured from the lower sill <b>42</b> to an upper horizontal frame member <b>144</b>. The combination comprises the air conditioner <b>32</b> including the main cabinet <b>52</b> and the removable air duct housing <b>124</b>. The combination further comprises the mounting system <b>30</b> including two mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, each arm being attached at a first point to the wall <b>50</b>, <b>58</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> and at a second point being engaged to the frame <b>38</b> of the window <b>36</b>, wherein the main cabinet is suspended from the two mounting arms such that when mounted, the top surface <b>126</b> of the main cabinet is positioned at a height <b>146</b> of no more than 10% of the height <b>142</b> of the visible window area.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">The top surface <b>126</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> will extend above the window sill <b>42</b> by an amount equal to a height <b>148</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, and a distance <b>150</b> between the top edge <b>116</b> of the mounting arms and the top surface of the main cabinet (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). This total amount or height <b>146</b> generally is no greater than about 2 inches (5.1 cm), whereas the height <b>142</b> of the visible window area may be in the range of 30 to 60 inches (76.5-153 cm) or more. Therefore, the top surface <b>126</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> may be actually positioned at no more than 4 to 7% of the height <b>142</b> of the visible window area. Thus, when the air duct housing <b>124</b> is removed, such as during the winter, or when the air conditioner <b>32</b> is not in use, without removing the air conditioner from its mounting system <b>30</b>, the view out of the window <b>36</b> from the inside is nearly unblocked. Such a low profile also assists in reducing any noise transmission from the air conditioner <b>32</b> into the room.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">In order to prepare the air conditioner <b>32</b> for winterizing, for long periods of non-use, or merely to allow the window <b>36</b> to be completely closed, a sill mounting bracket <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) may be provided to allow the air conditioner to remain mounted on the exterior of the building <b>34</b>, yet allowing the window to completely close. This will permit the user to avoid the task of removing the air conditioner <b>32</b> in the fall and remounting it in the spring, or even more often if it is desired to completely close the window <b>36</b> more often. To begin the process, the air duct housing <b>124</b> is removed from the top surface <b>126</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b>, so only the main cabinet remains mounted by the mounting system <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">The sill mounting bracket <b>152</b> is shown to be a single bracket having an upstanding ear <b>154</b> at each end, however, the bracket could alternatively be formed as two separate brackets, each with an upstanding ear. The bracket <b>152</b> is sized such that the two ears <b>154</b> will be positioned just on the lateral inboard side of the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) when the bracket is set on the sill <b>42</b> in the area representing the position of the upper window sash <b>76</b> in a single or double hung window. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a threaded fastener <b>156</b>, such as a bolt may be inserted through a slot <b>158</b> in the inner arm <b>70</b>, with the bolt extending through the hole <b>80</b> in the outer arm <b>68</b> and through a hole <b>162</b> in the ear. The ear may include a slot <b>162</b> (or alternatively, a series of vertical holes) to accommodate sills having various channels or other elements on which the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may be resting. The slot <b>158</b> is dimensioned to be slightly larger than a dimension across the flats of the head of the bolt <b>156</b>, or the nut for the bolt, such that the slot will act as a wrench as the threaded fastener is tightened to prevent rotation of the fastener. The sill bracket <b>152</b> is then secured to the sill <b>42</b>, such as by lag bolts <b>164</b>, or similar fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0085">Once the bolts <b>156</b> are secured between the sill bracket <b>152</b> and the outer arms <b>68</b> and the sill bracket is secured to the sill <b>42</b>, the main cabinet <b>52</b> will be securely held by the sill bracket, and the inner arms <b>70</b> and cross bar <b>92</b> may be removed from the mounting system <b>30</b>. To accomplish this, the bolts <b>90</b> holding the inner <b>70</b> and outer <b>68</b> arms together are removed, and the inner arm can then be moved away from the outer arm, since the bolt <b>156</b> holding the sill bracket <b>152</b> to the outer arm is merely positioned in the slot <b>158</b>, but is not otherwise engaged to the inner arm. With the inner arms <b>70</b> and the cross bar <b>92</b> removed, the window sash <b>74</b> may be closed, while the main cabinet <b>52</b> remains mounted on the exterior of the building <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>). At this point, the air conditioner <b>32</b> is supported at two points, the sill <b>42</b> and the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b> (or only one point if no pad <b>122</b> is present). Future use of the air conditioner <b>32</b> will not require the replacement of the inner arms <b>70</b> and cross bar <b>92</b>, so reattachment of the air duct housing <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) is all that is required.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0086">An alternate embodiment of the ratchet pawl <b>120</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In this embodiment, a ratchet pawl <b>166</b> comprises a bracket <b>168</b> to be attached to the main cabinet <b>52</b>, such as with threaded fasteners through holes <b>170</b> in the bracket, and the bracket will completely surround the outer arm <b>68</b>, such that rotation or pivoting of the arm will be substantially prevented. The bracket <b>168</b> will allow for minor rotation of the arm <b>68</b>, to allow for movement of a pawl finger <b>172</b> in the ratchet teeth <b>114</b>, however the arm will be held generally perpendicular to the wall <b>108</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> that faces the exterior siding <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0087">An alternate embodiment of the mounting of the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> on the main cabinet <b>52</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref>, where it is shown that the outer arm <b>68</b> is secured on the interior of the side walls <b>50</b>, <b>58</b> of the main cabinet, and the outer arm exits the main cabinet through an opening <b>174</b> formed in the wall <b>108</b> of the cabinet that faces the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>. The opening <b>174</b> is sized slightly larger than the outer arm <b>68</b>, so that minor rotation or pivoting of the arm will be allowed relative to the main cabinet <b>52</b>. An edge <b>176</b> of the cabinet opening <b>174</b> may act as the ratchet pawl finger, to engage with the ratchet teeth <b>114</b> provided on the outer arm <b>68</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, the mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> will be held generally perpendicular to the wall <b>108</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> that faces the exterior siding <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">In all other respects, this embodiment is similar to the embodiment first described above, such that the mounting system <b>30</b> provides a three point mounting arrangement where the air conditioner <b>32</b> is supported by the window frame sill <b>42</b>, by a vertical interior face <b>44</b> or wall <b>72</b> adjacent to the window <b>36</b>, and by the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>, when the cross bar <b>92</b> is utilized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>). In other mounting arrangements, such as when the sill bracket <b>152</b> is installed, the air conditioner <b>32</b> may be supported by only the sill <b>42</b> of the frame <b>38</b> and the exterior siding <b>40</b> of the building <b>34</b>, or only by the sill of the frame (when no pad <b>122</b> is provided)(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">Also, in this embodiment, a combination of the air conditioner <b>32</b> and the mounting system <b>30</b> is provided for mounting the air conditioner on the exterior of the building <b>34</b> adjacent to the window <b>36</b> with a height <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the visible window area measured from the lower sill <b>42</b> to an upper horizontal frame member <b>144</b>. The combination comprises the air conditioner <b>32</b> including the main cabinet <b>52</b> and the removable air duct housing <b>124</b>. The combination further comprises the mounting system <b>30</b> including two mounting arms <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, each arm being attached at a first point to the wall <b>50</b>, <b>58</b> of the main cabinet <b>52</b> and at a second point being engaged to the frame <b>38</b> of the window <b>36</b>, wherein the main cabinet is suspended from the two mounting arms such that when mounted, the top surface <b>126</b> of the main cabinet is positioned at a height <b>146</b> of no more than 10% of the height <b>142</b> of the visible window area. The same dimensions and ranges as described above pertain to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">In this embodiment, the sill bracket <b>152</b> can be attached to the outer arms <b>68</b> and secured to the sill <b>42</b> as described above, so that the air conditioner <b>32</b> will be mounted solely by the sill bracket, and perhaps the wall pad <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">In an embodiment, a method is provided of installing an air conditioner <b>32</b> having a cabinet <b>52</b> through an opening <b>36</b> of a predetermined width in a wall <b>72</b> of a building <b>34</b> from a room side of the wall. The method comprises the steps of:
