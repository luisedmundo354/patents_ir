<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an earthing switch which can be used preferably in medium voltage switchgear assemblies, normally for voltages ranging between 1 and 36 kV.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Switchgear assemblies are typically used to connect a plurality of electrical loads to a common electrical bus. Such assemblies are typically provided with a plurality of switching devices having one side connected to the common bus and the other side connected to various electrical loads; these switching devices provide electrical protection to isolate the loads during abnormal current conditions, such as an overload or a short circuit condition.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Switchgear often comprises an earthing switch which allows either the line or bus terminals to be grounded for personnel safety. That is particularly important during maintenance operations, but also during normal function of the switchgear assemblies. Prior to earthing the line or bus terminals, it is mandatory to disconnect the upstream source of electrical power supplying the switchgear assembly; however, under certain conditions, it may happen by mistake to ground a live circuit. Another dangerous situation arises when the upstream source of electrical power is inadvertently reenergized during bus maintenance before performing closing of the switch. In both such situations, it is necessary to prevent wounds to personnel and damage to equipment by a correct functionality of the earthing switch used.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At the present, many kinds of earthing switches are known and used. For example, the patent U.S. Pat. No. 4,490,595 discloses an earthing switch which comprises a moving blade contact movable about a fulcrum and a fixed blade contact having an aperture at one end to define side walls which form spaced fixed contacts. In the open position of the switch, said moving blade is parallel to the fixed blade contact; during closing of the switch, the moving blade contact enters in said aperture from the closed end thereof and moves to the region of the current contacts until it comes into contact with an insulating stop disposed underneath the fixed blade contact. Thus, in the closed position of the earthing switch the moving blade is perpendicular to said blade fixed contact.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">European patent application EP A 0592338 discloses an earthing switch which is actuated by means of an interlocking device controlled by an operating unit associated with another switch; said interlocking device moves suitable mechanisms which actuate a shaft with a plurality of mobile contacts, these latter being suitable for contacting corresponding fixed contacts by a rotary movement around a fixed axis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the present state of the art, known earthing switches even though performing properly the functions required, still have drawbacks and present some aspects which deserve improvements. In fact, in many cases they have a structure that is not suitable for assuring an optimised functionality of the earthing switch; in particular it does not assure an optimised contact pressure which allows contrasting the magnetic repulsion forces generated especially during the closure operation on a live circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, the traditional layout of the components and traditional movement systems of the mobile contacts are carried out by a high number of elements which are assembled each other according to cumbersome and complicated solutions. Moreover, some earthing switches have a configuration which do not allow their easy insertion in the structure of a switchgear. Such condition increases costs and time for installation, and affects also the reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hence, it is evident the need to have technical solutions that represent a valid alternative to the known earthing switches.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus the main aim of the present invention is to provide an earthing switch that will enable to overcome the previously cited drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide an earthing switch with a short response time so as to allow a fast closure of the contacts and avoid possible damages to the equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide an earthing switch in which the contact pressure is suitable to contrast the magnetic repulsion forces which are generated when the earthing switch is closed on a live circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide an earthing switch with a reduced number of components which can be easily assembled both each other and with the switchgear in which the earthing switch is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Not the least object of the present invention is to provide an earthing switch which is highly reliable, relatively easy to manufacture, and at competitive costs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above main aim and objects, as well as others which will become more apparent hereinafter are achieved by an earthing switch for a medium voltage switchgear comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">a plurality of fixed contacts (<b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>);</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">a plurality of movable contact surfaces (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>) which are suitable to contact said plurality of fixed contacts (<b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>);</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">a support structure (<b>30</b>) suitable to support moving means which allow the movement of said second plurality of contact surfaces (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>);</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">at least one guide which comprises a fixed element (<b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c</i>) and a moving element (<b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>) coaxially coupled therewith (<b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>), said moving element (<b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>) being operatively connected to said movable contact surfaces (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b, a </i><b>5</b><i>c</i>) so as to allow their movement along a substantially rectilinear direction from a first position, corresponding to an open condition of said switch (<b>1</b>), to a second position corresponding to a closed condition of said switch (<b>1</b>).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">A compact structure and short times of closing are two evident advantages of the earthing switch according to the present invention. The use of a rectilinear guide for each moving contact allows obtaining a rectilinear movement of the contacts and then a reliability overally increased with respect to the traditional devices having rotary movement of the movable contacts, since either the mechanical stresses are reduced or the whole structure can be lightened.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">Further characteristics and advantages will emerge more clearly from the description of preferred but non-exclusive embodiments of an earthing switch according to the invention, illustrated by way of indicative and non-limiting example, with the aid of the attached drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0031">Preferably, the earthing switch <b>1</b> according to the present invention comprises a plurality of rectilinear guides each having a fixed element <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>coaxially coupled to a corresponding moving element <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>. In particular, in a first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, each guide comprises a fixed element <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>coaxially coupled to a respective moving element <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>and each of the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>bears, at one end, a corresponding movable contact surface <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c </i>suitable to contact a respective fixed contact <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c </i>when the switch <b>1</b> is brought into the closed condition. Further, it is advantageously provided a cross bar <b>26</b> which is connected to said moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>at an end thereof and electrically connects each other the plurality of movable contact surfaces <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>. This cross bar <b>26</b> can comprise, for example, a copper bar which is fastened near the ends of the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>; advantageously, if the earthing switch <b>1</b> is closed before disconnecting the upstream power source of the switchgear assembly <b>2</b>, the cross bar <b>26</b> allows performing an earthing operation without damaging the equipment, e.g. through an associated conducting element <b>27</b>, e.g. a suitably shaped braid illustrated for simplicity only in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Analogously, the same solution may be adopted for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref><i>b</i>, e.g. with a unique braid or by using a single braid for each phase.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">In the second embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-3</figref><i>a</i>, the earthing switch <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of rectilinear guides, for example two, each comprising a fixed element <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>coaxially coupled to a respective moving element <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, and a cross bar <b>26</b> which is positioned transversally with respect to the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>and is directly connected to them; advantageously, in this embodiment the movable contact surfaces are constituted by parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the cross bar <b>26</b> itself, spaced apart from each other along its extension, which parts contact each a respective fixed contact <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c </i>when the switch <b>1</b> is in the closed condition. Also in this case the cross bar <b>26</b> allows performing an earthing operation without damaging the equipment if the earthing switch <b>1</b> is closed before disconnecting the upstream power source.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">As illustrated, in both embodiments the guides can be preferably realized, for example, by tubular fixed elements <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>in which corresponding tubular moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>are coaxially inserted; accordingly, the movable contact surfaces <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c </i>operatively associated to the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, are moved along a substantially rectilinear direction from the first open position to the second closed position. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the arrow <b>150</b>, said rectilinear direction can be identified as the one which contains the minimum distance between the fixed contacts <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the contact surfaces <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">In turn, the support structure <b>30</b> comprises a first back wall <b>31</b>, a second lateral <b>32</b>, a third lateral wall <b>33</b> and a fourth lower wall <b>34</b>. The first back wall <b>31</b> allows positioning the switch <b>1</b> inside the structure of the switchgear assembly <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the back wall <b>31</b> can be advantageously fixed on an internal panel <b>4</b> of the switchgear <b>2</b> by means of traditional connecting means such as, for example, bolts, screws or other equivalent means. Preferably, said second and third lateral walls <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> are substantially perpendicular to said first back wall <b>31</b> and shaped so as to support the lower wall <b>34</b> to which said plurality of guides are advantageously connected. As illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the guides lye preferably on a plane which is substantially parallel to said first back wall <b>31</b>. Preferably, the support structure <b>30</b> can be integrated with a top wall <b>38</b> that contributes to increase the mechanical stiffness of the whole structure <b>30</b>. Moreover said top wall <b>38</b> could also be used for positioning the earthing switch <b>1</b> inside the switch assembly <b>2</b> in addition or in alternative to the back wall <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">As above mentioned, the earthing switch <b>1</b> according to the present invention comprises means for moving the plurality of movable contact surface <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>. With reference for example to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, said moving means comprise an actuating shaft <b>50</b> which is supported, at its longitudinal ends, by the lateral walls <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. In particular, one longitudinal end of the actuating shaft <b>50</b>, indicated with the reference number <b>59</b>, protrudes outside the support structure <b>30</b> for operative connection with manoeuvring means, not illustrated in the figures; these manoeuvring means are used for allowing a manual actuation of the shaft <b>50</b> and may comprise, for example, a metal rod which is moved outside the switchgear assembly <b>2</b> by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">Further, the moving means comprise a first radial arm <b>51</b> and a second radial arm <b>52</b> which are operatively connected to the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>and to the shaft <b>50</b> itself so as to protrude transversely, preferably perpendicularly, with respect to its rotation axis <b>54</b>; further, the shaft <b>50</b> is positioned so as also its axis <b>54</b> is substantially parallel to the plane on which said guides lye. In particular, said first and second radial arms <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are directly coupled to a cross element or rod <b>25</b> which is suitable to connect rigidly each other said moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The cross rod <b>25</b> comprises, for example, a metal rod which can be coupled to said moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>once these latter are coaxially inserted in said fixed elements <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c</i>. In this manner the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>can move simultaneously when the cross rod <b>25</b> is actuated by said actuating shaft <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">Preferably, as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the radial arms <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are connected to the cross rod <b>25</b> by a first âshape couplingâ which preferably comprises a first slot <b>53</b> provided onto said arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, in which said cross rod <b>25</b> is inserted and driven. The expression âshape couplingâ is herein used to indicate a coupling in which a first body can translate along a direction and independently turn of an angle with respect to a second body. This kinematic couple allows two degree of freedom and the shape of the kinematic elements is sufficient to keep the contact between the bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">In order to allow a rectilinear movement of the moving contacts <b>20</b>, rectilinear slots <b>43</b> are provided along the fixed elements <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>to hold and guide the cross rod <b>25</b>. In this way, the fixed elements <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>and the cross rod <b>25</b> are mutually connected by a prismatic coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">By using the indicated couplings, the rotary movement of the actuating shaft <b>50</b> is transformed into a linear movement of the cross rod <b>25</b> and consequently of the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>. For this purpose the above described kinematic chain with a reduced number of components is used. Advantageously, the kinematic chain is inserted in a compact structure <b>30</b> which needs a reduced volumetric clearance and which can be easily coupled to the internal structure of the switchgear assembly <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">Preferably, the moving means also comprise elastic thrust means which are operatively connected to said actuating shaft <b>50</b> and to said support structure <b>30</b>; according to a preferred embodiment, said elastic thrust means comprise a first <b>70</b> and a second thrust element <b>71</b> each comprising a main body <b>72</b> and an elastic spring <b>73</b> which is accommodated so as to surround the corresponding main body <b>72</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the main bodies <b>72</b> are coupled each to a corresponding projection <b>80</b> of the actuating shaft <b>50</b> by a cinematic rotoidal couple <b>81</b> and to the corresponding lateral wall <b>32</b> or <b>33</b> by a second coupling. In particular, in the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the thrust elements <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> are positioned proximal to the lateral walls <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> and said second coupling comprises an opening <b>75</b> provided in said bodies <b>72</b> and a pivot <b>76</b> which is inserted in the opening <b>75</b> and is fixed to and protrudes from the corresponding lateral wall <b>32</b> or <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Preferably, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-3</figref><i>a</i>, there are provided two spaced gussets <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> which protrude transversely from the back wall <b>31</b>; the pivot <b>76</b> passes through the openings <b>75</b> of each body <b>72</b> and is fixed at its ends to the gussets <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>. Advantageously, in this embodiment, the gussets <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> are positioned parallel to and close each other substantially in the middle of the support structure <b>30</b>; further, each main body <b>72</b> is connected solidly with the corresponding arm <b>51</b> or <b>52</b>, with the two couples first main body <b>72</b>-arm <b>51</b>/second body <b>72</b>-arm <b>52</b> which are in turn solidly interconnected by a transverse rod <b>74</b>. In this way, the switch <b>1</b> has a whole structure even more compact, sturdy, and functionally improved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Advantageously, in both embodiments, the elastic springs <b>73</b> cooperate with said second coupling so as to provide an acceleration of the rotation movement of the actuation shaft <b>50</b> thus allowing a faster closing movement of the earthing switch <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>a </i>are now considered to describe the working principles of the earthing switch <b>1</b>. When the earthing switch <b>1</b> is in the open position, the elastic springs <b>73</b> of the elastic thrust elements <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> are compressed by the pivot(s) <b>76</b>. By operating said manoeuvring means, the actuating shaft <b>50</b> turns around its rotation axis <b>54</b> bringing to the rotation of the radial arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and the projection <b>80</b>. The rotation of these element is performed according to the arrow <b>300</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. At first, the movement of the projection <b>80</b> forces a further compression of the springs <b>73</b> and the main bodies <b>72</b> change their position with respect to the fixed pivot(s) <b>76</b> thanks to said second coupling. The compression goes on until a dead point is reached, at which point the rotation axis of the actuating shaft <b>50</b>, the axis of the cinematic rotoidal couple <b>81</b> and the axis of the pivot <b>76</b> are aligned on a same plane. When this position of equilibrium is exceeded, the springs <b>73</b> release their kinetic energy performing an angular acceleration of the rotation of the actuating shaft <b>50</b>. This angular acceleration is transferred to the moving elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>by means of the radial arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and by means of the first shape coupling. This solution allows obtaining very short closing time of the earthing switch <b>1</b>. In particular the springs <b>73</b> are calibrated so as contrast the magnetic repulsion forces which are generated when the earthing switch <b>1</b> is closed on a live circuit as illustrated, for example, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>2</b><i>a e </i><b>2</b><i>b</i>. A similar operation occurs with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> where the bodies <b>72</b> move substantially jointly with the arms <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, and the rod <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">The earthing switch <b>1</b> according to the present invention can also comprise signalling means that are suitable to provide a visual indication of the operative condition of the earthing switch, so as to increase the personnel safety.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">According to a preferred embodiment, said signalling means comprise a C shaped element <b>100</b>, illustrated only in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> for the sake of simplicity, which is externally visible by a user. Said element <b>100</b> is connected to said cross rod <b>25</b> and is inserted in a hole <b>10</b> obtained on said lower wall <b>34</b> so as to be driven according to the movement of said plurality of moving elements <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">As above pointed out, the earthing switch <b>1</b> can be advantageously used in switchgear assembly, for example a MV switch assembly as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In particular the earthing switch <b>1</b> is connected to a panel <b>4</b> in a vertical position, but it could be positioned also in a horizontal or oblique position according to the layout of the components of the switchgear assembly <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">In practice it has been found that the earthing switch according to the invention fully achieves the intended aims and object, providing a significant series of advantages with respect to the known prior art; indeed, the earthing switch according to the present invention has a substantially improved functionality with a compact structure and a cinematic chain with a reduced number of components easily assembled each other. In particular, the purposive whole architecture, and more specifically that of the guides, allows increasing the precision and repeatability of operations, with a substantially improved reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">The earthing switch thus conceived is susceptible of modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the inventive concept; all the details may furthermore be replaced with technically equivalent elements. In practice, the materials used, so long as they are compatible with the specific use, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to the requirements and the state of the art.</p>
