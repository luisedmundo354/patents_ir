<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Known current sensors have a magnetic circuit, typically a C-shaped core of magnetic material having adjacent ends separated by an air gap. The core is meant to concentrate the magnetic field emitted from a current-carrying conductor that may pass through the core one or more times, such as by being looped around a leg of the C. The core can be an open square, generally rectangular, or approximately circular, for example, and a Hall effect device is typically placed in the air gap between the opposing ends. The object is to detect the strength of the magnetic field in the air gap and supply a corresponding varying voltage signal. The following patents and patent publications show current sensors of the general type with which the present invention is concerned, such patents being expressly incorporated by reference herein:</p>

This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a Hall effect current sensor with high sensitivity and linearity, and reduced hysteresis and temperature variation. In one aspect of the invention, a Hall effect generator chip is mounted between the ends of an annular, horseshoe or “C” spacer of nonmagnetic material. The spacer and generator are sandwiched between ferromagnetic rings. Each ring has a small air gap overlying or underlying the generator. The generator is sensitive to the flux density (B field) tangential to its flat top and bottom surfaces adjacent to the air gaps. The ferromagnetic rings act as the magnetic circuit, also known as the magnetic concentrator or core. The core-spacer-generator assembly can be compactly mounted on a circuit board with various leads (power, ground, output, test leads, etc.), and other circuits can be included to improve performance even further if desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention includes a unique packaging of a Hall effect current sensor with increased sensitivity and linearity and reduced hysteresis and temperature variation. An embodiment of the current sensor system <b>10</b> is shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. A Hall effect generator chip <b>12</b> is mounted between adjacent ends of an annular, horseshoe mounting member or spacer <b>14</b> of nonmagnetic material, such as a suitable plastic. The generator is sensitive to the flux density (B field) tangential to its wide, flat top and bottom surfaces which can be coplanar with the flat surfaces of the spacer. The spacer and generator are sandwiched between ferromagnetic rings <b>16</b>. Each ring has a large central opening and a small air gap <b>18</b> overlying/underlying the generator <b>12</b>. A circuit board <b>20</b> has a semicircular mounting recess <b>22</b> that snugly receives approximately one-half of the circumference of the lower ferromagnetic ring <b>16</b>. Input/output blocks <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> with corresponding input and output leads <b>28</b> are mounted on the board, as is a separate capacitor <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the conductor C for which current information is desired passes through the aligned central openings of the ferromagnetic rings <b>16</b> and spacer <b>14</b>. The current flowing in the conductor creates a B field that will be contained in and concentrated by the ferromagnetic rings <b>16</b>. The ferromagnetic rings with the air gaps magnify the field observed by the chip <b>12</b>, and at both sides of the chip. The double field magnification creates a greater sensitivity to the current in the conductor. The field that is tangential to the Hall effect generator <b>12</b> will be detected and will be converted to a voltage that is proportional to the current in the conductor. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a test coil TC can be provided, so that a current can be applied to the test coil to test the magnetic circuit-current sensor operation. The voltage output can be measured and graphed as a function of the known current in the test coil.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, permalloy ferromagnetic rings are used, such as Carpenter Steel HyMu80®, that are annealed for magnetic properties. This material should be annealed in a dry hydrogen or vacuum, oxygen-free atmosphere with a dew point below −40° F. at 2050° F. to 2150° F. for 2 to 4 hours. The rings are furnace cooled to 1100° F., and from 1100° F. to 700° F. at a rate between 350° F. to 600° F. per hour. As shown below, an object is to obtain very high permeability. The width of the air gap <b>18</b> is determined experimentally for high sensitivity. In the described embodiment, an air gap of 40 mils has been found to be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Hall effect generator <b>12</b> can be a SENTRON 1SA-1V single-axis magnetic sensor in an SOIC-8 package. The spacer <b>14</b> is made from 30% glass-filled polyetherimide (ULTEM2300). The ferromagnetic rings, spacer and Hall effect chip are aligned using the holes <b>32</b> and tabs <b>33</b>. The holes can be used with rivets to hold the rings and spacer together tightly against the Hall effect chip, and/or the parts can be secured with suitable adhesive. Metal etching primer is applied to metal surfaces where adhesives are used to bond the spacer, rings and Hall effect chip together. The Hall effect chip and the ferromagnetic assembly are soldered onto the circuit board so that it does not contact the circuit board except at the Hall effect chip solder joints so that no thermal stresses can be applied to the ferromagnetic assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A circuit diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The basic circuit is composed of the Hall effect generator <b>12</b> and a temperature compensating circuit <b>34</b>. The TC resistor for the ideal configuration was 680 PPM per degrees C.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A current sensor in accordance with the above description was built and evaluated, but without the temperature compensation circuit <b>34</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> displays voltage out versus current for the current sensor at 25° C. from −6 to 6 amps DC. Voltage out was recorded while the current varied positive and negative multiple times to show any hysteresis effects. The hysteresis is very small. The sensitivity is 173 mv per amp and the linearity is very good with a perfect correlation coefficient of 1.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the same graph for three temperatures (−55, 25 and 105° C.), still without a temperature compensation circuit. As temperature varies the linearity does not change appreciably, but the slope of the line or sensitivity does change slightly. The slope varies from about 165 to about 183 mv per amp in the tested temperature range, still very accurate at such small currents.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the results when the temperature compensation circuit is incorporated to reduce the thermal dependence. The temperature compensated slope only varies from 173 to 174 mv per amp. Consequently, on the scale shown, the lines and test points overlie each other. The sensor provides essentially identical outputs within the tested temperature range.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The modified circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> operates similarly to the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The power input, ground, and capacitor (C) connections to the Hall effect generator <b>12</b> are identical. The analog output (pin <b>7</b>, A_OUT) and the common output (pin <b>6</b>, CO_OUT) are both at a DC voltage level of ½ VDD with a 0 tangential B field. Using CO_OUT as a reference for the remainder of the signal conditioning circuit allows this circuit to operate from a single power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The DC voltage level from these two outputs varies from device to device and also varies with temperature. The DC voltage temperature variation of the two outputs track closely. This circuit topology allows errors in signal conditioning due to component parameter variation to be minimized. The sensor and signal conditioning circuit work with both AC and DC currents.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The amplifier and temperature compensation stage <b>34</b> following the sensor <b>12</b> accomplishes two things. The first is the bandwidth of the signal from the sensor is limited while balancing the impedances on the two inputs to the amplifier <b>35</b>. This is necessary if the sensor and circuit are to operate in harsh environments such as those found in the aerospace or automotive industries. The second is the gain of this stage temperature compensates the slope variation in the sensor output due to temperature. As noted above, the TC resistor for the ideal configuration was 680 PPM per degrees C. The slope correction could be reversed if the TC resistor is placed in the feedback position instead of the input position. As the current increases in the conductor looped through the sensor, A_OUT responds with an output positive relative to the CO_OUT reference and negative relative to the reference if the current is in the opposite direction. An absolute value and bandwidth limiting circuit <b>36</b> converts the output from circuit <b>34</b> to a positive output relative to the CO_OUT reference regardless of the direction of the current in the wire looped through the sensor. Capacitor C<b>3</b> can be chosen to be very large so that the output of the absolute value circuit is a DC value. This capacitor can also be chosen so that the absolute value output is a full wave rectified AC signal referenced to CO_OUT for applications requiring faster response.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A reference-scaling amplifier <b>38</b> derives the reference for a threshold detector <b>40</b> from the CO_OUT reference in the SENTRON device <b>12</b>. This also helps minimize errors due to component parameter variations since the detector reference varies with the absolute value circuit reference. Experimental results indicate that bandwidth limiting is also required here since noise from the input signal will also couple to the CO_OUT reference output. The bandwidth of the reference-scaling amplifier should be set to a value similar to that for the signal amplifier connected to the A_OUT sensor output.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The threshold detector <b>40</b> is a simple single-ended comparator since the absolute value circuit creates a positive output regardless of the direction of the current in the sensor. The threshold detector compares the absolute value output with the scaled reference and triggers follow on circuitry as the output of the comparator changes state.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Advantages are obtained by forming the ferromagnetic rings of a material with high permeability, preferably greater than 30,000. Using Ampere's law, the equation can be written for the flux concentrator (core) and the air gap as follows, where H represents the H field, I represents distance (airgap width and mean ferromagnetic diameter), N represents number of “turns” (number of times the conductor passes through the sensor), I represents conductor current, and μ represents permeability:</p>

and Equation 3 would reduce dramatically if not disappear, that is, temperature sensitivity is essentially eliminated. The design becomes linear and reduces the variation over temperature. Permalloy, if annealed correctly, can have a permeability of 30,000 to 100,000 and the magnetic hysteresis is almost nonexistent. To increase the sensitivity, a Hall device that is sensitive to fields that are tangential to the chip and two permalloy rings (field concentrators) preferably are used. In this case, the design will get two times the field change for a change in current. For the new design there is improved linearity, low magnetic hysteresis, decreased sensitivity to temperature variation and twice the sensitivity. If an amplifier with a TC resistor is added to the output of the Hall device the temperature variation can be removed even more.
