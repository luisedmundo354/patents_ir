<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the filing date of our prior application Ser. No. 11/237,605 filed Sep. 27, 2005, entitled “Combined outrigger holder and fishing rod holder”; now abandoned and the benefit of the filing date of our prior application Ser. No. 60/614,633 filed Sep. 29, 2004, entitled “Combined outrigger holder and rod holder” referenced therein, and the applications referenced therein, Ser. No. 10/801,275, filed Mar. 16, 2004, entitled “T-TOP OUTRIGGER HOLDER APPARATUS;” now U.S. Pat. No. 7,197,845 and application Ser. No. 60/455,982, filed Mar. 19,2003, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to fishing equipment and, more particularly, to fishing rod and outrigger holders for use on boats to hold either the outrigger or the rod or both.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art of sport fishing equipment, it is known to use outriggers to play out trolling lines away from the sides and back of the boat. These outriggers can be moved in line with the hull and in-board of the boat when they are not being used for trolling. Thus, they are adjustable between the trolling position and the storage position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These outriggers can be mounted on bases which are either fixed to the gunnels or tops of the boats or are fixed and adjustable, in that the outrigger can be swung out outwardly to a second fixed position. Prior art outriggers are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,927,754, 3,008,259, 3,161,390,3,724,791, 5,445,102, and 5,592,893. These patents also show the holders for the outriggers. Many of these patents disclose two means of adjustment: one means of rotating the outrigger and another means of angling the outrigger in a vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fishing boats are normally fitted with outrigger and fishing rod holders mounted in the gunnels; as, for example, is shown in the prior art U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,244 (see Prior Art FIG. 1, attached to this application).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A problem with such holders is that they can only be used for one device at a time. Furthermore, they are not adjustable for positioning the outriggers in various inboard, parallel, outboard, and elevated positions.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to the Figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a prior art fishing rod holder <b>11</b> for permanent installation in a gunnel of a fishing boat. Taking a section as indicated by the lines and arrows A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the usual holder structure would have a pin <b>10</b> across the inside near the bottom. The purpose of the pin <b>10</b> is to accommodate the notches in the bottom of a fishing rod. We provide similar notches, designated generally <b>12</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in the bottom of an outrigger holder <b>16</b>. Thus the rod or the outrigger holder can be moved, i.e. rotated, to a number of fixed positions; wherein the notches embrace the pin and the structure will not rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with our invention, a clamp-on rod holder <b>14</b> is provided; which can be clamped on to the outrigger holder <b>16</b> by any suitable clamp means <b>18</b>. The clamp means <b>18</b> is most preferably release able as by means of screws <b>20</b> fitted into bosses <b>22</b>. Thus the fishing rod holder <b>11</b> can now accommodate our outrigger holder <b>16</b> and simultaneously provide a fishing rod holder <b>14</b> for the rod <b>26</b>. It will be understood that the rod holder <b>14</b> has a cross-wise internally mounted pin near the bottom to accommodate the notches in the bottom of a fishing rod, as aforesaid.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The clamp-on fishing rod holder <b>14</b> may also be used to clamp the holder onto other structural parts of the boat, such as, the tubular structure of a “T” top boat. Thus it provides a means to position rods at other than a fixed number of places on the boat.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The outrigger holder <b>16</b> is preferably of a type which provides for adjustment to various angles, i.e. for positioning the outriggers in various inboard, parallel, outboard, and elevated positions. See our prior application Ser. No. 10/801,275 referenced herein above. The arm <b>100</b> of the outrigger holder can be adjusted to a plurality of positions in a vertical plane and the holder <b>16</b> can be raised from the mount <b>11</b> and rotated in a horizontal plane and then lowered into engagement with the pin <b>10</b> to fix it in a different horizontal position. Also the rod holder can be mounted on the arm <b>100</b> to provide adjustment in a vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an alternate embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, we provide a means of mounting the outrigger holder <b>216</b> to the tubular structure <b>200</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of a boat; such as is found on a “T” top construction. Herein the clamp <b>218</b> is fixed to or an integral part of a lower portion <b>216</b> of the outrigger holder. An upper portion <b>220</b> of the outrigger holder is mounted for rotation within the lower portion <b>216</b>. The upper portion <b>220</b> has a plurality of radially extending holes <b>22</b> therein spaced circumferentially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A seal <b>224</b> is positioned between the portions <b>220</b> and <b>216</b> to prevent debris from lodging there between.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A spring loaded handle and plunger means designated generally <b>250</b>, is provided mounted in the lower portion <b>216</b> to engage the holes <b>222</b> in the upper portion upon rotation thereof and prevent further rotation thereof. To rotate the upper portion <b>220</b> with respect to the lower portion <b>216</b>, the handle <b>203</b> is retracted in the direction of the arrow “B”, thereby retracting the pin <b>205</b> from one of the holes <b>222</b> and allowing the upper portion <b>216</b> to be turned in a horizontal plane. Upon release of the handle <b>203</b>, the spring <b>207</b> expands against the spring retainer <b>209</b> (which is fixedly attached to the pin <b>205</b>) and forces the pin against the surface <b>211</b> of the upper portion <b>216</b>. As the upper portion <b>216</b> continues to be rotate, the pin <b>205</b> eventually engages a hole <b>222</b> and prevents further rotation. The housing <b>213</b> mounted to the lower portion <b>216</b>, retains and guides the pin <b>205</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view of a portion of the assembled portion of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a central vertical section of that apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 10</figref>, an alternate embodiment of our invention is shown. These parts are similar in certain respects to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this embodiment, the bottom portion <b>318</b> of the clamp means is provided with a pin <b>319</b> press fitted into a hole in the inner concave surface thereof. The pin provides a means to fix the clamp to the tubular structure <b>200</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of a boat; such as is found on a “T” top construction. A hole <b>320</b> must be drilled into the tube to effect this arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The upper portion <b>315</b> of the clamp is secured to the lower portion by the screws <b>20</b> and bosses <b>22</b> previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The upper portion <b>315</b> has a cylindrical extension <b>316</b> which has a plurality of radially extending holes <b>317</b> therein in a plane perpendicular to its axis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embracing the extension <b>316</b> in a sliding fit is a base <b>330</b>. The base is retained axially with respect to portion <b>315</b> by a screw <b>354</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base has a cylindrical boss <b>338</b> extending therefrom; which is threaded internally and externally.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Mounted in threaded engagement to the external threads of the boss <b>338</b>, is a cap <b>334</b>. The cap has a hole <b>342</b> therein, through which the shank <b>343</b> of the handle <b>340</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Inside the cap is a retainer <b>344</b> having a cylindrical portion in threaded engagement with the internal threads of the boss <b>338</b>. The retainer has a shoulder <b>329</b> to rest against the end of the boss and prevent it from entering further into the boss. A threaded stud <b>346</b> extends from this portion of the retainer and is fixedly threaded into the shank <b>343</b>. Thus, when the handle <b>340</b> is rotated counterclockwise, the retainer <b>344</b> will be moved to the right away from the from the extension <b>316</b>. When the retainer is fully unthreaded from the boss <b>338</b>, the spring <b>350</b>, which is retained in the cap <b>334</b>, will force the retainer <b>344</b> toward the boss <b>338</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Extending from the side of the retainer <b>344</b> opposite to the threaded stud <b>346</b> is a protrusion <b>355</b>. This protrusion is dimensioned to fit in sliding engagement within the holes <b>317</b>. This protrusion is dimensioned to be completely withdrawn from the hole <b>317</b> when the retainer is backed off completely from threaded engagement with the boss <b>338</b> and the handle <b>340</b> is pulled further to the right (when viewed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>). In this withdrawn position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), the base <b>330</b> can be rotated in a horizontal plane. When the outward force on the handle <b>340</b> is released, the spring <b>350</b> forces the retainer <b>344</b> to the left and thereby forces the protrusion into engagement with the surface of the extension <b>316</b>. Upon further rotation of the base <b>330</b>, the protrusion <b>355</b> will eventually enter one of the holes <b>317</b>. The handle <b>340</b> can then be rotated clockwise to re-engage the threads of the retainer <b>344</b> with the boss <b>338</b>. As the handle is further rotated in the clockwise direction, the shoulder <b>352</b> will eventually engage the edge of the hole <b>317</b> and, thereby, provide a snug fit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Extending upwardly from the base <b>330</b>, is a donut shaped portion <b>360</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) which has a plurality of radially equidistantly spaced holes <b>362</b> there through. Embracing this donut shaped portion, is a forked portion <b>370</b> of the end of an arm <b>1000</b>. See the similar part <b>100</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The part <b>1000</b> is retained axially with respect to the part <b>330</b>/<b>360</b> by the bolt <b>394</b> and the bushing <b>400</b> (through which the bolt passes). The bushing fits in sliding engagement within a hole in the donut shaped portion <b>360</b> and is preferably made of a plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The forked portion <b>370</b> has a cylindrical boss <b>374</b> extending therefrom; which is threaded externally.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Mounted in threaded engagement to the external threads of the boss <b>374</b>, is a cap <b>372</b>. The cap has a hole therein, through which the shank <b>375</b> of the handle <b>376</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Inside the cap <b>372</b> is a retainer <b>380</b> having a threaded stud <b>378</b> extending therefrom which is fixedly threaded into the shank <b>375</b>. The opposite side of the retainer <b>380</b> is in threaded engagement with the bolt <b>394</b> (when viewed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>). The retainer <b>380</b> has a cylindrical portion <b>384</b> and an external shoulder <b>381</b>. Embracing this cylindrical portion in a sliding fit is a retainer plate <b>382</b>, which rests against the shoulder <b>381</b>. This plate <b>382</b> has pins <b>390</b> and <b>392</b> fixedly mounted therein which are positioned to engage the holes <b>362</b> in the donut shaped portion <b>360</b>. One of these pins (<b>392</b>) has a tapered portion <b>393</b> to engage the edge of the hole <b>362</b>. A spring <b>398</b> is retained within the cap <b>372</b> to exert a force against the retainer plate <b>382</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the handle <b>376</b> is rotated counterclockwise, the retainer <b>380</b> will be unthreaded from the bolt <b>394</b> and will be moved away from the from the forked portion <b>370</b>. When the retainer <b>380</b> is fully unthreaded from the bolt <b>394</b>, the spring <b>398</b>, which is retained in the cap <b>372</b>, will force the retainer <b>380</b> toward the forked portion <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The pins which extend from the side of the retainer plate <b>382</b> are dimensioned to be completely withdrawn from the holes <b>362</b> when the retainer plate is backed off completely from threaded engagement with the bolt <b>394</b> and the handle <b>376</b> is pulled further to the left (when viewed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>). In this withdrawn position, the arm <b>1000</b> can be rotated in a vertical plane. When the outward force on the handle <b>376</b> is released, the spring <b>398</b> forces the retainer plate <b>382</b> and the retainer <b>380</b> to the right and thereby forces the pins <b>390</b> and <b>392</b> into engagement with the surface of the donut shaped portion <b>360</b>. Upon further rotation of the arm <b>1000</b>, the pins will eventually enter the holes <b>362</b>. The handle <b>376</b> can then be rotated clockwise to re-engage the threads of the retainer <b>380</b> with the bolt <b>394</b>.
