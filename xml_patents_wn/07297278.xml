<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A device for separating metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution uses a vessel for holding the colloidal suspension or solution. A membrane impermeable to the selected metal components of a colloidal suspension or solution is sealed over a support to form a leaf element. The leaf element includes an outlet for the selected components of the colloidal suspension or solution and is extended into the colloidal suspension or solution. The leaf element is controllably vibrated simultaneously with application of a negative or positive pressure which is used to motivate permeation of the membrane by the liquid of the colloidal suspension or solution to purify it. Metals removed by the method include metals with an atomic number greater than 10 including and/or silicon. The colloidal suspension or solution may optionally contain a metal precipitator such as a dithiocarbamate and/or trithiocarbamate to aid in the separation.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 60/620,532 filed Oct. 20, 2004.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to methods and apparatus for separating metals from colloidal suspensions or solutions, and most particularly relates, in one non-limiting embodiment, to systems and techniques for separating metals from water using vibrating membranes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Permeable and impermeable membranes have been used to separate ions, molecules, and solids from the liquid portion of the colloidal suspension or solution. Although filtration has been employed in this regard there is an ever present problem of plugging or fouling of the filter membrane. Methods of enhancing membrane permeate rates (dewatering rates) are found in the prior art. Such methods include the shearing of liquid slurry across the membrane in tangential flow i.e. crossflow filtration. This method uses a pump to force the feed slurry to flow tangentially to the dewatering membrane. The resulting sheer causes concentrated material, usually in the form of a filter cake, to be removed from the face of the membrane. Thus, the rate of liquid removal through the membrane is increased. Unfortunately, the provision of pumps to force the feed slurry in this manner requires expensive and bulky equipment and creates serious problems in the sealing of the vessel holding the colloidal suspension or solution.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another method proposes the use of sonic vibration, created by ultrasonic transducers, to produce cavitation at the face of the membrane. A different technique proposes a shock-type system where the membrane support structure and a filtration apparatus are periodically shocked to induce the filter cake to drop from the membrane. A further process employs a shearing plate which is oscillated parallel to a fixed membrane. Further, an additional method teaches a system where a membrane is mechanically vibrated in a direction normal to the membrane. Alternatively, screening and sieving devices used in dry mineral and wet powder classification use screens vibrated parallel to the face of the screen to induce the powder to fall through the pores of the screen. None of these devices are suitable for separation of the components of a colloidal suspension or solution with the application of negative or positive pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ultrafilters manufactured by Millipore Corporation of Billerica, Mass. offer a system intended for separating proteins from aqueous solutions. The system utilizes a cylindrical probe which is inserted into a test tube containing the solution to be separated. The cylindrical wall of the probe is formed in part from a membrane material and the proteins pass through the filter from the solution occupying the annular volume between the probe and the test tube wall. The cylindrical probe is reciprocated over a small amplitude (less than 0.01 centimeters) and at 60 Hz. The shear created between the opposed walls of the probe and the test tube is partially effective in reducing plugging of the membrane by the proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, the technique of cross-flow microfiltration and ultrafiltration is limited since shear rates above 20,000 sec<sup>−1 </sup>of intensity are difficult to achieve. Such high intensities require a massive amount of power and the provision of entrance pressures which are uneconomical. Also, such membranes are often arrayed in a rectangular pressure vessel such as a plate and frame cross-flow device. The transmembrane pressure drop is limited by the inherently weak vessel walls.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A membrane filtration device which is able to produce a large shear intensity on the exterior or face of the membrane simultaneously with the application of a large pressure drop across the membrane to create high permeate rates would be a great advance in the art of filtration and metal component separation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present invention a novel and useful method and device for concentrating, dewatering, or separating colloidal and molecular slurries containing metals through the use of membrane filtration, is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A colloidal particle is generally defined as a particle possessing a size such that the dominant force influencing the particle motion in a liquid are surface forces; e.g. surface charge interaction, Van der Waals' forces, and the like. This normally occurs below a particle size of 50 microns. Practically, this definition includes finely divided clays, protein molecules, and ions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In carrying out these and other objects of the invention, there is provided, in one non-limiting form, a device for separating metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution formed of liquids, ions and/or solid particles. The device includes a vessel capable of holding the colloidal suspension or solution and a membrane having an exterior surface and an interior surface, where the membrane is impermeable to a metal component of the colloidal suspension or solution. The metal in the metal component removed includes, but is not necessarily limited to metals with atomics numbers greater than 10 and/or silicon and combinations thereof. The device also includes a support mounted at the interior surface of the membrane and sealed within the membrane, where the membrane and support member form a leaf element. The leaf element extends into the colloidal suspension or solution within the vessel, and the leaf element further includes an outlet for passage of the selected components of the colloidal suspension or solution permeating the membrane. The device additionally includes a mechanism for vibrating the leaf element tangentially along the exterior surface of the membrane to induce shearing between the exterior surface of the membrane and the colloidal suspension or solution. Also present is a mechanism for applying a pressure to motivate permeation of the membrane by a purified liquid of the colloidal suspension or solution.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Mechanisms for vibrating the leaf element include, but are not necessarily limited to, a vibrator and a rod or shaft which is connected to the support of the leaf element. Such rod may be hollow and, thus, conducts the permeates from the interior of the leaf element outwardly from the vessel. Alternatively, the leaf element may be fixed rigidly to a containment vessel and vibration may be applied to both the pressure vessel and the attached leaf element or to one or the other separately. In many cases, a plurality of leaf elements may be fixed within a pressure vessel and vibrated in this manner. In summary, the vibration in all cases, is applied approximately parallel to the leaf element to produce a shearing between the leaf element and the liquid slurry or colloidal suspension or solution in the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The leaf element or elements may be single-sided or double-sided. In the latter case, the support within the leaf member would be shaped to accommodate a plurality of faces on the membrane. In this regard, the support may be solid or of open construction i.e. a rigid screen.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A mechanism is also included in the present invention for applying a pressure influence to motivate or to urge permeation of the membrane by the permeates. Such pressure may be in the form of a vacuum communicating with the outlet of the leaf element or leaf elements; in such format the pressure vessel would be open to atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, the vessel may be constructed as a pressure vessel to accept a positive pressure which presses on the slurry or colloidal suspension or solution and, in turn, on the membrane to increase permeate transfer to the interior of the leaf element or elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It may be apparent that a novel and useful method and device for separating selective metal components from colloidal suspensions or solutions to give purified liquids has been described.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a device and method for separating selected metal components and purified liquids from a colloidal suspension or solution which produces a very high permeate flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is another object of the present invention to provide a device and method for separating selected metal components and purified liquids from a colloidal suspension or solution which includes a vessel that may be easily sealed for use with negative or positive pressure environments.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for the separation of selected metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution which employs a mechanism for vibrating the permeable membrane at varying frequencies commensurate with the shear characteristics of the colloidal suspension or solution being separated by the membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for separating selective metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution which may employ a plurality of leaf elements in a pressure vessel holding the colloidal suspension or solution.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for separating selected metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution which substantially improves the filtering rates of colloidal suspensions or solutions by preventing plugging of the filter membrane in such filtration process.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for separation of selected metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution which employs a vibrator imparting linear, orbital, and/or torsional motion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for separation of selected metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution which substantially improves the filtering rates of colloidal suspension or solutions by treating the colloidal suspension or solution with metal precipitators.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device and method for separation of selected metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution which substantially increases the concentration of the selected metal components after permeation of the purified liquid through membrane by treating the colloidal suspension or solution with metal precipitators.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A further object of the invention is to provide a metal component concentrate stream that may be disposed of as a coker elutriant to quench coke in a coker unit, such as a delayed coker unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In carrying out these and other objects of the invention, there is provided, in another non-limiting form, a method of filtration of metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution that involves placing the colloidal suspension or solution in a vessel. The colloidal suspension or solution includes a metal component where the metal has an atomic number greater than 10 and/or silicon. A leaf element contacts or is immersed into the colloidal suspension or solution in the vessel, where the leaf element includes a membrane having an exterior surface and an interior surface, the membrane being impermeable to the metal component of the colloidal suspension or solution, the leaf element further including a support mounted at the interior surface of the membrane and sealed within the membrane. The method also involves vibrating the leaf element tangentially relative to the exterior surface of the membrane to induce shearing between the exterior surface of the membrane and the colloidal suspension or solution. A negative and positive pressure is applied to the leaf element to urge permeation of the membrane by a purified liquid of the colloidal suspension or solution. It is not necessary for the method to be accomplished in the sequence of steps described, that is, another order or sequence is acceptable as long as the purposes and goals of the method are achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be appreciated that the drawings are schematic and that the various elements are not necessarily to scale or proportion, and that many details have been removed or simplified for clarity, and thus the invention is not necessarily limited to the embodiments depicted in the FIGS.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various aspects of the present invention will evolve from the following detailed description of the various alternate embodiments which should be referenced to the prior described drawings. The invention as a whole is depicted in the drawings by reference character <b>10</b> and an upper case letter, to denote specific embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, filter device <b>10</b>A is depicted. Filter device <b>10</b>A includes as one of its elements a rectangular leaf element <b>12</b>, the structure which will be discussed hereinafter. Leaf element <b>12</b> is submerged in a slurry or colloidal suspension or solution <b>14</b> found in open vessel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Leaf element <b>12</b> is vibrated by vibration mechanism <b>18</b> which includes a linear vibrator <b>20</b> connected to a hollow rigid shaft <b>22</b>. It should be noted that passageway <b>24</b> is employed to remove permeate from colloidal suspension or solution <b>14</b>. Permeate then passes through flexible tubing <b>26</b> having flexible fitting <b>28</b> which is linked to spout <b>30</b>. Vacuum pump <b>32</b> aids in the removal of permeate through conduit <b>34</b>, per directional arrow <b>36</b>. It should be apparent that rigid tube <b>22</b> serves a dual purpose. The first function is to transmit the vibratory motion from linear vibrator <b>20</b> to rectangular leaf element <b>12</b> along directional arrow <b>38</b>. The second function of rigid tube <b>22</b> is to serve as a pipe or conduit for permeate entering rectangular leaf element <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the construction of membrane leaf element <b>12</b> is shown in particular detail. Membrane leaf element <b>12</b> includes a pair of membrane filters <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Colloidal suspension or solution, such as slurry <b>14</b>, include a wide variety of particulates and molecules suspended and/or dissolved in a liquid phase. Such particles may vary in size from ions through proteins and large molecules with a molecular weight up to and including one million or more. The former may be separated by defining membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> as a reverse osmosis membranes; the latter may be separated by defining membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> as ultrafiltration membranes. Also, membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> may take the form of microfiltration membranes to filter colloidal particles up to fifty microns in diameter. In general, membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are chosen to prevent passage of selected metal components of colloidal suspension or solution while allowing the passage of a purified liquid slurry or solution <b>14</b> i.e. permeate. In particular, the membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are selected to be impermeable to a metal component where the metal is one having an atomic number greater than 10 and/or silicon or combinations thereof. It is appreciated that silicon is strictly a non-metallic element, but for the purposes of this invention, it is grouped with the other metallic elements. Otherwise, it is understood herein that metal has its normal, chemical meaning. In one non-limiting embodiment, the metal component includes, but is not necessarily limited to, selenium, magnesium, aluminum, iron, copper, silicon, and/or zinc. The liquid phase of colloidal suspension or solution <b>14</b> may be aqueous or organic; aqueous being the most commonly encountered liquid phase. In this regard, membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> may be constructed from a variety of materials depending on the strength, permeate selectivity, pore size, and chemical resistance, required for the particular application. Suitable materials may include natural substances, such as cellulose and natural rubber or polymeric substances such as non-polar polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, nylon, and the like. Membrane <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> may also be composed of polar polymers such as polyamides or inorganic substances such as sintered glass and ceramics. Moreover, sintered metal and chemically etched screens may also be used as a material for membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are sealed or laminated to each other over support or plate <b>44</b>. Support <b>44</b> may be constructed of a relatively rigid plastic material, metal, or other suitable materials. Support <b>44</b> is sufficiently rigid to transmit the vibratory forces generated by vibrator <b>20</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and carried along tube <b>22</b>. Support <b>44</b> includes a bore <b>46</b> which accepts rigid tube <b>22</b>. Tube <b>22</b> is glued, welded, or otherwise attached to support <b>44</b> through bore <b>46</b>. In addition, leaf element <b>12</b> may include a pair of layers <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> of open weave cloth which may be laminated between membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> and support <b>44</b>. It should be noted that permeate migrating through membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> also migrates through layers <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>. Bore <b>46</b> terminates in an opening <b>52</b> in support <b>44</b> which communicates with both sides of support <b>44</b> adjacent layers <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>. Opening <b>52</b> serves as a collection mouth for tube <b>22</b>. It should be noted that the heretofore described lamination of parts of rectangular leaf element <b>12</b> may be accomplished along edge <b>54</b> by the use of adhesive, glues, welding, and any suitable technique. In essence, leaf element <b>12</b> is a unitary body such that the outer faces or surfaces <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> of rectangular leaf element vibrate with support member <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be appreciated that the method may be practiced with positive pressure on one side of the membranes <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, negative pressure on one side of the membranes <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> or positive pressure on one side and negative pressure on the other.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the motion imparted to leaf element <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is designated as being linear, such vibration may be orbital, or torsional. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> represents the generation of this variety of vibratory motions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a linear vibrator <b>60</b> imparting linear vibratory motion along shaft <b>62</b> to a body <b>64</b> according to directional arrows <b>66</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> represents an electromechanical linear resonator <b>68</b>. In such rendition, a mass <b>70</b> to be vibrated is connected to compression spring <b>72</b> which is fixed to a relatively immobile seismic mass <b>74</b>. Rigid shaft <b>76</b> connects mass <b>70</b> to a linear motor <b>78</b> which forces mass <b>70</b> to vibrate at the resonant frequency of the spring-seismic mass <b>72</b>/<b>74</b> system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts another method of producing linear vibration according to directional arrow <b>81</b>. In this case, a linear motion generator <b>83</b> is depicted employing a flywheel <b>85</b> which rotates according directional arrow <b>87</b>. Rotary motion of flywheel <b>85</b> is transmitted to mass or body <b>89</b> via double pivoting linkage <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an orbital vibration generator <b>80</b> which utilizes an orbital vibrator <b>82</b>, passing such vibration through rigid shaft <b>84</b> to body <b>86</b>. Directional arrows <b>88</b> represent the orbital vibration imparted thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a generator of torsional motion or vibration <b>90</b> employing a torsional vibrator <b>92</b> which transmits such vibration along a torsion shaft <b>94</b> to a disk <b>96</b>. Disk <b>96</b> vibrates according to directional arrows <b>98</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> a mechanical engine <b>100</b> is depicted to convert the rotary motion of a flywheel <b>102</b> along shaft <b>104</b> to a body <b>106</b>. Directional arrow <b>108</b> represents the eventual torsional motion generated by flywheel <b>102</b> which moves according to directional arrow <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts an electromechanical torsional resonator <b>112</b> in which a torsion spring <b>114</b> is connected to a disc-shaped mass or body <b>116</b>. Torsion spring <b>114</b> is fixed to a relatively immovable seismic mass <b>118</b>. Body <b>116</b> is linked to the shaft <b>120</b> of a permanent magnet motor <b>122</b>. It should be noted that motor <b>122</b> is driven by an A.C. electrical current at the natural frequency of the torsional spring-mass <b>114</b>, <b>118</b> system. It should also be pointed out that mass or bodies <b>64</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>89</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>116</b>, may schematically represent leaf element <b>12</b>. Thus, any of the vibrational systems depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref> may be employed in the present invention <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Moreover, the force transducers (vibrators) schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref> are generally of at least two types: mechanical engines, and spring-mass resonators. The former produces a reciprocating motion by an arm attached through a bearing through a rim of a rotating flywheel. In the latter, the body to be vibrated is connected to a spring whose size and stiffness are chosen to create a mechanical resonation with the desired resonant frequency and safe deflection amplitude. In either case, the system <b>10</b> of the present invention provides a high shear intensity on the faces <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> of membranes <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. It should be noted that in certain cases only a single membrane may be used to form a leaf element. The details of the mechanics of such resonation will be discussed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, another embodiment <b>10</b>B of the present invention is depicted. Device <b>10</b>B includes a membrane leaf element <b>124</b> which is placed at the bottom <b>126</b> of a cylindrical vessel <b>128</b>. Vessel <b>128</b> takes the form of a Buchner funnel type of filtration apparatus. Membrane leaf element <b>124</b> and vessel <b>128</b> are attached to shaft <b>130</b> which is driven by torsional vibrator <b>132</b>. As disk-shaped leaf element <b>124</b> and vessel <b>128</b> move in torsional vibration about the axis <b>134</b> of shaft <b>130</b>, permeate is removed through vacuum port <b>136</b> by the pressure motivation afforded by vacuum pump <b>138</b>. Permeate passes through spout <b>140</b> per directional arrow <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows embodiment <b>10</b>C of the present invention in which a plurality of circular leaf elements <b>144</b> are connected to a central shaft <b>145</b>. For example, disk-shaped element <b>146</b>, similarly constructed to each of the plurality of leaf elements <b>144</b>, includes a support structure <b>148</b> and a pair of membranes <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> laminated thereto. A shaft <b>154</b> possesses a passageway <b>156</b> which conducts permeate from opening <b>158</b> through support <b>148</b>. Passageway <b>156</b> leads to a central passage <b>160</b> through shaft <b>145</b>. Plurality of circular disk leaf elements <b>144</b> are each connected to central shaft <b>145</b> inside a cylindrical vessel <b>162</b>. A slurry or colloidal suspension or solution <b>164</b> is poured inside vessel <b>162</b> to contact plurality of leaf elements <b>144</b>. It should be noted that shaft <b>145</b> is rigidly attached to cylindrical vessel <b>162</b> at the base <b>166</b> by suitable fastening technique such as welding, gluing, fasteners, and the like. Of course, such attachment of <b>145</b> to vessel <b>162</b> would seal the escape of slurry <b>164</b> through opening <b>168</b> in vessel <b>162</b>. Cylindrical vessel <b>162</b> is also connected to rigid drive shaft <b>170</b>. Drive shaft <b>170</b> includes an L-shaped passageway <b>172</b> which exits shaft <b>170</b> at nipple <b>174</b>. Shaft <b>170</b> is driven by torsional vibrator <b>176</b>. Flexible tube <b>178</b> sealingly engages nipple <b>174</b> to complete the path of permeate from slurry <b>164</b> to outlet <b>180</b> according to directional arrow <b>182</b>. In other words, vacuum pump <b>185</b> aids in the withdrawal of permeate from slurry <b>164</b> from open vessel <b>162</b>, through central passage <b>160</b> of shaft <b>145</b>, opening <b>168</b> in vessel <b>162</b>, passage <b>172</b> of drive shaft <b>170</b>, and through flexible tube <b>178</b> to outlet <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, another embodiment <b>10</b>D of the present invention is depicted in which a plurality of disc-shaped leaf elements <b>184</b> are shown inside a cylindrical pressure vessel <b>186</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a detail of disc-shaped leaf element <b>188</b> is depicted. The support member <b>190</b> periphery terminates in a quartet of tabs <b>192</b>, <b>194</b>, <b>196</b>, and <b>198</b>. Each of the tabs engage a corresponding groove, such as grooves <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b>, which are machined into the side wall <b>208</b> of pressure vessel <b>186</b>. A cylindrical support member <b>210</b> found within pressure vessel <b>186</b> permits the pre-stacking of plurality of leaf elements <b>184</b> to assure accurate fitting of the same within pressure vessel <b>186</b>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it may be seen that leaf element <b>188</b> is shaped as an annulus with a pair of membranes <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> heat sealed to outside rim <b>214</b> and inside rim <b>216</b> surrounding opening <b>218</b>. It should be noted that membrane <b>212</b> is sealed in the same manner to the side opposite that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> of leaf element <b>184</b>. Permeate removal tube <b>220</b> is inserted within leaf element <b>184</b> via opening <b>222</b> through pressure vessel <b>186</b> and passage <b>224</b> through support member <b>190</b>. Permeate from slurry or colloidal suspension or solution <b>225</b> exits through tube <b>220</b> and passes to manifold <b>226</b> according to directional arrow <b>228</b>. Pressure type bushing <b>231</b> seals any leakage through passage <b>222</b> outside of pressure vessel <b>186</b>. The plurality of leaf elements <b>184</b> are similarly constructed to leaf element <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it may be observed that pressure vessel <b>186</b> is formed of a cylindrical body <b>230</b> and a pair of plates <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>. A multiplicity of long bolts <b>236</b> extend from top plate <b>232</b> to bottom plate <b>234</b>, where threading engagement occurs. A mechanism <b>238</b> for pressure motivating the separation of slurry <b>225</b> may takes the form of a positive pressure pump, or other pressure-producing device, which applies pressure to slurry <b>225</b> and eventually to plurality of leaf elements <b>184</b>. Bleed valve <b>242</b> permits the removal of concentrated material from pressure vessel <b>186</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> it should be noted that each of the plurality of leaf elements <b>184</b> includes a gap <b>244</b> which permits circulation of slurry <b>225</b> within plurality of leaf elements <b>184</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the pressure vessel <b>186</b> is schematically depicted, and is assumed to contain plurality of stacked leaf elements <b>184</b> as detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. Pressure vessel <b>186</b> attaches to a torsion spring <b>244</b> which is itself rigidly attached to a large seismic mass <b>246</b>. Torsional force transducer <b>248</b>, which may be a brushless permanent magnet motor having a low inertia rotor, attaches to the top of pressure vessel <b>186</b> via shaft <b>250</b>. Alternating current from source <b>252</b> drives force transducer <b>248</b> at the natural frequency of the torsional resonating system created by the heretofore described elements. It should be noted that torsional spring <b>244</b> may be a coil spring, torsion bar, or similar torsion spring element.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In operation, each of the embodiments of the present invention <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C and <b>10</b>D are vibrated by vibration device or mechanism such as linear vibrator <b>20</b>, torsional vibrator <b>132</b>, torsional vibrator <b>176</b>, and torsional force transducer <b>248</b>, respectively. Respective leaf element or elements permit permeate to flow from each slurry containing vessel. In certain cases the flow of permeate is motivated by pressure mechanism such as a vacuum pump or a positive pressure pump. For example, in embodiments <b>10</b>C and <b>10</b>D, vacuum pump <b>185</b> and positive pressure pump <b>240</b> are used respectively in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each separation system of the present invention provides a high shear intensity on the outer surface or faces of the leaf element membranes without resort to cross-flow pumping of the colloidal suspension or solution or slurry held in a particular vessel. Vibration may be induced in both the membrane leaf elements and the surrounding pressure vessel. For example, in embodiments <b>10</b>C and <b>10</b>D, a simultaneous application of high shearing and high transmembrane negative or positive pressure can be achieved. As an example, vibration frequencies of about 70 hertz (Hz), with a displacement amplitude of 10 centimeters peak to peak, in combination with a transmembrane pressure drop of several hundred psi (or megapascals) have been produced by using a steel pressure vessel mounted to a torsion spring. The resulting higher permeate flow rate is achieved at a lower cost than cross flow systems. It is believed that the device and method employed in the present invention will produce shear intensities on the particular membrane leaf elements greatly in excess of those typically achieved by cross-flow devices or any of the vibrating filtration devices described in the prior art. It has been found that the particular vibration induced on the leaf element produces the same motion of liquid on the face or outer surface of the membrane leaf element being employed. In this regard, vibration is always applied to cause shearing between the membrane and the slurry or colloidal suspension or solution in which the membrane is immersed. Vibration is therefore applied tangentially to the face or outer surface of a particular leaf element. Liquid contacting the face of the membrane moves at exactly the velocity of the membrane due to the no-slip boundary conditions obeyed by all liquids. As one travels away from the face or outer surface of the membrane, fluid velocity amplitude decays exponentially as the envelope of a propagating shear wave. The decay length for the shear wave velocity amplitude may be expressed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>L</i><sub>s</sub>=(μ/ρω)<sup>1/2</sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where
</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">μ is the slurry viscosity,</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">ρ is the slurry density and</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">ω is the frequency of vibration in radians per second.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">It should be noted that where the frequency of vibration f is expressed in Hz then ω=2πf</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Within 3 or 4 decay lengths, (typically a fraction of a millimeter), the shear intensity is essentially zero. At this point the liquid is stationary. If the vibratory motion of the membrane leaf element is sinusoidal, the velocity of the membrane surface (μ) can be written as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>μ≈δω sin ωt<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where δ is the peak displacement of the membrane leaf away from its average position.
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The shear intensity (S) on the face of the membrane can be calculated to be approximately
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>S=157f<sup>1.5 </sup>δ<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
in c.g.s. units. Thus, a vibratory filter in which the frequency of vibration is 10 Hz and peak displacement amplitude is 10 centimeters, will produce shearing on the face of the membrane of 49,000 seconds<sup>−1</sup>. Equivalently, a membrane leaf element vibrating at 50 Hz with a displacement amplitude of 1 centimeter would produce a shear intensity of 55,000 sec<sup>−1</sup>. Many combinations of frequency and displacement amplitude would produce the same level of shearing.
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It has been determined experimentally that the permeate rate often increases proportionally to the square root of the shear intensity as defined herein, fixing the transmembrane pressure drop. The permeate rate also increases proportionally to the square root of the transmembrane pressure drop, fixing the shear intensity. If both shear intensity and transmembrane pressure are increased, the permeate rate increases proportional to the square root of the product of shearing times pressure. This implies that the highest permeate rate increase can be achieved by producing, simultaneously, a very intense shearing and a very large transmembrane pressure drop.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Ultimately, the maximum obtainable shear intensity obtainable with the present invention depends to a large degree in strength of material used in constructing the membrane leaf elements. The force acting on the leaf elements is proportional to the acceleration times the mass of the leaf elements:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>F=ma<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The peak acceleration is proportional to the frequency squared times the displacement. Thus, force acting on the leaf elements increases proportionally to frequency squared.
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the some non-limiting embodiments, one range of frequency induced by the vibratory devices described hereinabove ranges between about 5 Hz and about 300 Hz. It has been found that low frequency operation, although producing low “g” forces on the membrane leaf elements requires high displacement amplitudes. In certain cases such amplitudes may be difficult to control. Also, if the frequency induced on the membrane leaf elements is too low, the distances between parallel leaf elements stacked as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> must be increased. In other words, the zone of shear must be allowed to extend a greater distance from the outer surface or face of the membranes of the membrane leaf elements. It has also been found that increasing the frequencies of the embodiments depicted in the FIGS. produces a rather small increase shear intensity and a rather large increase in “g” forces above a frequency of about 300 Hz. However, other materials and arrangements may extend the heretofore described frequency range. Nevertheless, for the embodiments depicted, normal operation would typically take place between about 20 Hz and about 150 Hz. The low end of this range, at or about 20 Hz, may be employed to separate low viscosity slurries, especially those which are sensitive to shear, such as cellular suspensions. Conversely, the high end of the range, at or about 150 Hz, may be used to separate molecules in ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis applications. Also, such higher frequency may be employed to produce very high shear intensities in non-shear sensitive materials having high viscosity, such as in an application known as microfiltration of mineral clays. Commonly, the operating frequency of some non-limiting embodiments may range between about 40 Hz and about 70 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Likewise, the displacement amplitude of the vibration induced in any of the systems above described may be varied depending on whether the materials to be filtered are shear sensitive. Many living cells and molecules of biological importance are sensitive to shearing. In this case, the vibration displacement amplitude and/or operating frequency would have to be limited to produce a shearing of less than about 10,000-20,000 second<sup>−1</sup>. Non-shear sensitive material such mineral clays can be processed at very high shear intensities of 500,000 second<sup>−</sup> or more. It is particularly advantageous in such application to simultaneously apply high shearing intensity and high transmembrane pressure to achieve a very high permeate flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In general, the method and devices described above improved the filtering of colloidal suspensions or solutions by avoiding the plugging of the filter membrane. It is believed that applying a rigorous shear flow at the interface between the filter and membrane and the suspension removes the concentrated polarization layer primarily responsible for plugging of the filter membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is further expected and discovered that the use of metal precipitator chemical additives in the colloidal suspensions or solutions will aid in the separation of the metal components therefrom. Such metal precipitators include, but are not necessarily limited to, dithiocarbamates, trithiocarbamates, iron salts, aluminum salts, potassium salts, sodium salts, copper salts, metal sulfides, and metal hydroxides and mixtures thereof. In one non-limiting embodiment of the invention the amount of metal precipitator used ranges from about 5 to about 50,000 ppm based on the colloidal suspension or solution, and in an alternate non-restrictive embodiment ranges from about 50 to about 5,000 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Other additives and agents may be used in the method of this invention including, but not necessarily limited to sequestering agents and dispersing agents. Suitable sequestering agents include, but are not limited to, aminocarboxylic acids such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) and other chelates, whereas dispersing agents include, but are not limited to, sulfonates such as linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LABS or sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The invention will now be described with respect to specific Examples which are not intended to limit it in any way but to rather further illustrate it.</p>

<claim-text>16. A method of filtering metal components from a colloidal suspension or solution comprising:
<claim-text>placing the colloidal suspension or solution in a vessel, where the colloidal suspension or solution comprises
<claim-text>a liquid;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a metal component where the metal in the metal component is selected from the group consisting of metals with an atomic number greater than 10; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>from about 5 to about 50,000 ppm of a metal precipitator selected from the group consisting of iron salts, aluminum salts, potassium salts, sodium salts, copper salts, metal sulfides, and metal hydroxides and mixtures thereof; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>providing a leaf element in contact with the colloidal suspension or solution in the vessel, the leaf element comprising a membrane having an exterior surface and an interior surface, where the membrane is impermeable to the metal component of the colloidal suspension or solution, and the leaf element further comprises a support mounted at the interior surface of the membrane and sealed within the membrane; and</claim-text>
</claim-text>
<claim-text>in any order or concurrently:
<claim-text>vibrating the leaf element tangentially relative to the exterior surface of the membrane at a vibration frequency of between about 5 Hertz and about 300 Hertz to induce shearing between the exterior surface of the membrane and the colloidal suspension or solution;</claim-text>
<claim-text>applying a negative and/or positive pressure to the leaf element to urge permeation of the membrane by a purified liquid of the colloidal suspension or solution; and</claim-text>
</claim-text>
<claim-text>thereby producing a metal component concentrate after permeation through the membrane by the purified liquid; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>passing the metal component concentrate to a coke quencher as a coke quenching elutriant.</claim-text>
