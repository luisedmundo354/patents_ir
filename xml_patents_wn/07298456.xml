<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of invention relates generally to imprint lithography. More particularly, the present invention is directed to reducing pattern distortions during imprint lithography processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Micro-fabrication involves the fabrication of very small structures, e.g., having features on the order of micro-meters or smaller. One area in which micro-fabrication has had a sizeable impact is in the processing of integrated circuits. As the semiconductor processing industry continues to strive for larger production yields while increasing the circuits per unit area formed on a substrate, micro-fabrication becomes increasingly important. Micro-fabrication provides greater process control while allowing increased reduction of the minimum feature dimension of the structures formed. Other areas of development in which micro-fabrication has been employed include biotechnology, optical technology, mechanical systems and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An exemplary micro-fabrication technique is commonly referred to as imprint lithography and is described in detail in numerous publications, such as United States published patent applications 2004/0065976, entitled METHOD AND A MOLD TO ARRANGE FEATURES ON A SUBSTRATE TO REPLICATE FEATURES HAVING MINIMAL DIMENSIONAL VARIABILITY; 2004/0065252, entitled METHOD OF FORMING A LAYER ON A SUBSTRATE TO FACILITATE FABRICATION OF METROLOGY STANDARDS; and 2004/0046271, entitled METHOD AND A MOLD TO ARRANGE FEATURES ON A SUBSTRATE TO REPLICATE FEATURES HAVING MINIMAL DIMENSIONAL VARIABILITY, all of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The fundamental imprint lithography technique as shown in each of the aforementioned published patent applications includes formation of a relief pattern in a polymerizable layer and transferring a pattern corresponding to the relief pattern into an underlying substrate. To that end, a template is employed spaced-apart from the substrate with a formable liquid present between the template and the substrate. The liquid is solidified to form a solidified layer that has a pattern recorded therein that is conforming to a shape of the surface of the template in contact with the liquid. The substrate and the solidified layer are then subjected to processes to transfer, into the substrate, a relief image that corresponds to the pattern in the solidified layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One manner in which to locate the polymerizable liquid between the template and the substrate is by depositing a plurality of droplets of the liquid on the substrate. Thereafter, the polymerizable liquid is concurrently contacted by both the template and the substrate to spread the polymerizable liquid over the surface of the substrate. It is desirable to properly align the template with the substrate so that the proper orientation between the substrate and template may be obtained. To that end, both the template and substrate include alignment marks. A concern with these processes involves distortions in the pattern resulting from, inter alia, extenuative variations in the imprinting layer and/or the substrate, as well as misalignment of the template with respect to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desired, therefore, to provide a system to reduce distortions in patterns, due to magnification and alignment variations, formed using imprint lithographic techniques.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed toward a system to vary dimensions of a substrate, such as a template having a patterned mold. To that end, the system includes a substrate chuck adapted to position the substrate in a region; a pliant member; and an actuator sub-assembly elastically coupled to the substrate chuck through the pliant member. The actuator assembly includes a plurality of lever sub-assemblies, one of which includes a body lying in the region and spaced-apart from an opposing body associated with one of the remaining lever sub-assemblies of the plurality of lever sub-assemblies. One of the plurality of lever assemblies is adapted to vary a distance between the body and the opposing body. In this manner, compressive forces may be applied to the template to remove unwanted magnification or other distortions in the pattern on the mold. The pliant member is configured to attenuate a magnitude of resulting forces sensed by the substrate chuck generated in response to the compressive forces. These and other embodiments are discussed more fully below.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a lithographic system <b>10</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention that includes a pair of spaced-apart bridge supports <b>12</b> having a bridge <b>14</b> and a stage support <b>16</b> extending therebetween. Bridge <b>14</b> and stage support <b>16</b> are spaced-apart. Coupled to bridge <b>14</b> is an imprint head <b>18</b>, which extends from bridge <b>14</b> toward stage support <b>16</b>. Disposed upon stage support <b>16</b> to face imprint head <b>18</b> is a motion stage <b>20</b>. Motion stage <b>20</b> is configured to move with respect to stage support <b>16</b> along X and Y axes, but may move along the Z-axis as well. An exemplary motion stage device is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/194,414, filed Jul. 11, 2002, (issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,900,881) entitled “Step and Repeat Imprint Lithography Systems,” assigned to the assignee of the present invention. A source <b>22</b> is coupled to system <b>10</b> to impinge actinic energy upon motion stage <b>20</b>. Operation of system <b>10</b> is under control of a processor <b>31</b> in data communication with a memory <b>33</b> containing computer readable code that defines instructions to regulate the operation of the various components of system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, connected to imprint head <b>18</b> is a template <b>26</b> having a mold <b>28</b> thereon. Mold <b>28</b> includes a plurality of features defined by a plurality of spaced-apart recessions <b>27</b> and protrusions <b>29</b>. The plurality of features defines an original pattern that forms the basis of a pattern to be transferred into a wafer <b>30</b> positioned on motion stage <b>20</b>. To that end, imprint head <b>18</b> is adapted to move along the Z-axis and vary a distance “d” between mold <b>28</b> and wafer <b>30</b>, but may move along the X and Y axes as well. In this manner, the features on mold <b>28</b> may be imprinted into a flowable region of wafer <b>30</b>, discussed more fully below. Source <b>22</b> is located so that mold <b>28</b> is positioned between source <b>22</b> and wafer <b>30</b>. As a result, mold <b>28</b> is fabricated from material that allows it to be substantially transparent to the energy produced by source <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a flowable region is formed on a portion of surface <b>32</b> that presents a substantially planar profile. The flowable region may be formed using any known technique such as a hot embossing process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,905, or a laser assisted direct imprinting (LADI) process of the type described by Chou et al. in “<i>Ultrafast and Direct Imprint of Nanostructures in Silicon</i>,” Nature, Col. 417, pp. 835-837, June 2002. In the present embodiment, however, flowable region consists of a plurality of spaced-apart discrete droplets <b>36</b> of the imprinting material on wafer <b>30</b>, discussed more fully below. An exemplary system for depositing droplets <b>36</b> is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/191,749, filed Jul. 9, 2002, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,926,929), entitled “System and Method for Dispensing Liquids,” and which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Droplets <b>36</b> include imprinting material that may be selectively polymerized and cross-linked to record a pattern corresponding to the original pattern therein, defining a recorded pattern formed into an imprint layer <b>34</b>. An exemplary composition for the imprinting material is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/463,396, filed Jun. 16, 2003 (published as U.S. publication number 2004-0256764-A1) and entitled “Method to Reduce Adhesion Between a Conformable Region and a Pattern of a Mold.”</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the pattern recorded in imprinting layer <b>34</b> is produced, in part, by interaction with mold <b>28</b>, e.g., mechanical contact, electrical contact and the like. In the present example, the distance “d” is reduced to allow droplets <b>36</b> to come into mechanical contact with mold <b>28</b>, and form a contiguous formation of the imprinting material over surface <b>32</b> that may subsequently be solidified to form imprinting layer <b>34</b>. In one embodiment, distance “d” is reduced to allow sub-portions <b>35</b> of imprinting layer <b>34</b> to ingress into and fill recessions <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To facilitate filling of recessions <b>27</b>, imprinting material employed possesses the desired properties to completely fill recessions <b>27</b> while covering surface <b>32</b> with a contiguous formation of the imprinting material. In the present embodiment, sub-portions <b>37</b> of imprinting layer <b>34</b> in superimposition with protrusions <b>29</b> remain after the desired, usually minimum distance “d”, has been reached, leaving sub-portions <b>35</b> with a thickness t<sub>1</sub>, and sub-portions <b>37</b> with a thickness, t<sub>2</sub>. Thicknesses “t<sub>1</sub>” and “t<sub>2</sub>” may be any thickness desired, dependent upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, after a desired distance “d” has been reached, source <b>22</b> produces actinic energy that polymerizes and cross-links the imprinting material, forming cross-linked polymer material. As a result, the composition of imprinting material transforms from a liquified state to a solidified state. Specifically, the imprinting material is solidified to provide imprinting layer <b>34</b> with a side having a shape conforming to a shape of a surface <b>39</b> of mold <b>28</b>, shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. After formation of solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b> distance “d” is increased so that mold <b>28</b> and solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b> are spaced-apart.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, additional processing may be employed to complete the patterning of wafer <b>30</b>. For example, wafer <b>30</b> and solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b> may be etched to transfer a pattern of solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b> into wafer <b>30</b>, providing a patterned surface <b>294</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to facilitate etching, the material from which solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b> is formed may be varied to define a relative etch rate with respect to wafer <b>30</b>, as desired. Alternatively, or in addition to, solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b> may be provided with an etch differential with respect to photo-resist material (not shown) selectively disposed thereon. The photo-resist material (not shown) may be provided to further pattern solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b>, using known techniques. Any etch process may be employed, dependent upon the etch rate desired and the underlying constituents that form wafer <b>30</b> and solidified imprinting layer <b>34</b>. Exemplary etch processes may include plasma etching, reactive ion etching, chemical wet etching and the like. It should be understood that wafer <b>30</b> is used in a general sense and may include any type of substrate suitable for patterning with the described process. For example, wafer <b>30</b> may be a bare semiconductor wafer <b>34</b> with or without a native oxide thereon, e.g., a silicon wafer. Alternatively, wafer <b>30</b> may have one or more layers disposed thereon, such as a primer layer formed from a material sold under a tradename DUV30J-6 available from Brewer Science, Inc. of Rolla, Mo.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> an exemplary source <b>22</b> may produce ultraviolet energy. Other energy sources may be employed, such as thermal, electromagnetic and the like. The selection of energy employed to initiate the polymerization of the imprinting material is known to one skilled in the art and typically depends on the specific application which is desired. Furthermore, the plurality of features on mold <b>28</b> are shown as recessions <b>27</b> extending along a direction parallel to protrusions <b>29</b> that provide a cross-section of mold <b>28</b> with a shape of a battlement. However, recessions <b>27</b> and protrusions <b>29</b> may correspond to virtually any feature desired, including features to create an integrated circuit and may be as small as a few nanometers. As a result, it may be desired to manufacture components of system <b>10</b> from materials that are thermally stable, e.g., have a thermal expansion coefficient of less than about 10 ppm/degree Centigrade at about room temperature (e.g., 25 degrees Centigrade). In some embodiments, the material of construction may have a thermal expansion coefficient of less than about 10 ppm/degree Centigrade, or less than 1 ppm/degree Centigrade. To that end, bridge supports <b>12</b>, bridge <b>14</b>, and/or stage support <b>16</b> may be fabricated from one or more of the following materials: iron alloys available under the trade name INVAR®, or name SUPER INVAR™, ceramics, including but not limited to ZERODUR® ceramic and silicon carbide. Additionally a table <b>24</b> may be constructed to isolate the remaining components of system <b>10</b> from vibrations in the surrounding environment. An exemplary table <b>24</b> is available from Newport Corporation of Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, template <b>26</b>, upon which mold <b>28</b> is present, is coupled to imprint head <b>18</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, via chuck body <b>42</b>. Body <b>42</b> is coupled to a flexure <b>41</b> that is disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/142,838, filed Jun. 1, 2005, entitled “Compliant Device for Nano-Scale Manufacturing”, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Flexure <b>41</b> is coupled to an orientation system <b>43</b> that controls movement of template <b>26</b>, which is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/142,825, filed Jun. 1, 2005, entitled “Method and System to Control Movement of a Body for Nano-Scale Manufacturing,” which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> orientation system <b>43</b> is shown having an inner frame <b>44</b> disposed proximate to an outer frame <b>46</b>, and flexure ring <b>48</b>, discussed more fully below. Body <b>42</b> is coupled to orientation system <b>43</b>, shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> through flexure <b>41</b>. Specifically, body <b>42</b> is connected to flexure <b>41</b>, using any suitable means, such as threaded fasteners (not shown) located at the four corners of body <b>42</b> connecting to four corners of flexure <b>41</b> closest to the four corners of body <b>42</b>. Four corners <b>47</b> of flexure <b>41</b> that are closest to a surface <b>45</b> of inner frame <b>44</b> are connected thereto using any suitable means, such as threaded fasteners, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, inner frame <b>44</b> has a central throughway <b>50</b>, and outer frame <b>46</b> has a central opening <b>52</b> in superimposition with central throughway <b>50</b>. Flexure ring <b>48</b> has an annular shape, e.g., circular or elliptical, and is coupled to inner frame <b>44</b> and outer frame <b>46</b> and lies outside of both central throughway <b>50</b> and central opening <b>52</b>. Specifically, flexure ring <b>48</b> is coupled to inner frame <b>44</b> at regions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>, outer frame <b>46</b> at regions <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> using any suitable means, such as threaded fasteners (not shown). Region <b>60</b> is disposed between regions <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> and disposed equidistant therefrom; region <b>62</b> is disposed between regions <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> and disposed equidistant therefrom; and region <b>64</b> is disposed between regions <b>54</b> and <b>58</b> and disposed equidistant therefrom. In this manner, flexure ring <b>48</b> surrounds flexure <b>41</b>, body <b>42</b>, and template <b>26</b> and fixedly attaches inner frame <b>44</b> to outer frame <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be understood that the components of orientation system <b>43</b> and flexure <b>41</b> may be formed from any suitable material, e.g., aluminum, stainless steel and the like. Additionally, flexure <b>41</b> may be coupled to orientation system <b>43</b> using any suitable means. In the present example, flexure <b>41</b> is coupled to surface <b>45</b> employing threaded fasteners (not shown) located at the four corners of body <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Orientation system <b>43</b> is configured to control movement of template <b>26</b> and to place the same in a desired spatial relationship with respect to a reference surface (not shown). To that end, a plurality of actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are connected between outer frame <b>46</b> and inner frame <b>44</b> so as to be spaced about orientation system <b>43</b>. Each of actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> has a first end <b>72</b> and a second end <b>74</b>. First end <b>72</b> faces outer frame <b>46</b>, and second end <b>74</b> faces inner frame <b>44</b>. Actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> tilt inner frame <b>44</b> with respect to outer frame <b>46</b> by facilitating translational motion of inner frame <b>44</b> along three axes Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>, and Z<sub>3</sub>. Orientation system <b>43</b> may provide a range of motion of approximately ±1.2 mm about axes Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>, and Z<sub>3</sub>. In this fashion, actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> cause inner frame <b>44</b> to impart angular motion to both flexure <b>41</b> and, therefore, template <b>26</b> and body <b>42</b>, about one or more of a plurality of axes T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>3</sub>. Specifically, by decreasing a distance between inner frame <b>44</b> and outer frame <b>46</b> along axes Z<sub>2 </sub>and Z<sub>3 </sub>and increasing a distance therebetween along axis Z<sub>1</sub>, angular motion about tilt axis T<sub>2 </sub>occurs in a first direction. Increasing the distance between inner frame <b>44</b> and outer frame <b>46</b> along axes Z<sub>2 </sub>and Z<sub>3 </sub>and decreasing the distance therebetween along axis Z<sub>1</sub>, angular motion about tilt axis T<sub>2 </sub>occurs in a second direction opposite to the first direction. In a similar manner angular movement about axis T<sub>1 </sub>may occur by varying the distance between inner frame <b>44</b> and outer frame <b>46</b> by movement of inner frame <b>44</b> along axes Z<sub>1 </sub>and Z<sub>2 </sub>in the same direction and magnitude while moving of the inner frame <b>44</b> along axis Z<sub>3 </sub>in a direction opposite and twice to the movement along axes Z<sub>1 </sub>and Z<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, angular movement about axis T<sub>3 </sub>may occur by varying the distance between inner frame <b>44</b> and outer frame <b>46</b> by movement of inner frame <b>44</b> along axes Z<sub>1 </sub>and Z<sub>3 </sub>in the same direction and magnitude while moving of inner frame <b>44</b> along axis Z<sub>2 </sub>in direction opposite and twice to the movement along axes Z<sub>1 </sub>and Z<sub>3</sub>. Actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> may have a maximum operational force of ±200 N. Orientation System <b>43</b> may provide a range of motion of approximately ±0.15° about axes T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are selected to minimize mechanical parts and, therefore, minimize uneven mechanical compliance, as well as friction, which may cause particulates. Examples of actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> include voice coil actuators, piezo actuators, and linear actuators. An exemplary embodiment for actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> is available from BEI Technologies of Sylmar, Calif. under the trade name LA24-20-000A and are coupled to inner frame <b>44</b> using any suitable means, e.g., threaded fasteners. Additionally, actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are coupled between inner frame <b>44</b> and outer frame <b>46</b> so as to be symmetrically disposed thereabout and lie outside of central throughway <b>50</b> and central opening <b>52</b>. With this configuration an unobstructed throughway between outer frame <b>46</b> to flexure <b>41</b> is configured. Additionally, the symmetrical arrangement minimizes dynamic vibration and uneven thermal drift, thereby providing fine-motion correction of inner frame <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The combination of the inner frame <b>44</b>, outer frame <b>46</b>, flexure ring <b>48</b> and actuators <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> provides angular motion of flexure <b>41</b> and, therefore, body <b>42</b> and template <b>26</b> about tilt axes T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>3</sub>. It is desired, however, that translational motion be imparted to template <b>26</b> along axes that lie in a plane extending transversely, if not orthogonally, to axes Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>, and Z<sub>3</sub>. This is achieved by providing flexure <b>41</b> with the functionality to impart angular motion upon template <b>26</b> about one or more of a plurality of compliance axes, shown as C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, which are spaced-part from tilt axes T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>3 </sub>and exist on the surface of the template when the template, the template chuck, and the compliant device are assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, flexure <b>41</b> includes a support body <b>76</b> and a floating body <b>78</b> that is coupled to the support body <b>76</b> vis-a-vis a plurality of flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>. Body <b>42</b> is intended to be mounted to floating body <b>78</b>, as discussed above, and template <b>26</b> is retained by chucking system <b>40</b> using conventional methods, discussed more fully below, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, each of flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> includes first and second sets of flexure joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. The first and second sets of flexure joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are discussed with respect to flexure arm <b>88</b> for ease of discussion, but this discussion applies equally to the sets of flexure joints associated with flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>. Although it is not necessary, flexure <b>41</b> is formed from a solid body. As a result, support body <b>76</b>, floating body <b>78</b> and flexures arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> are integrally formed, and are rotationally coupled together vis-a-vis first and second sets of flexure joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. Support body <b>76</b> includes a centrally disposed throughway <b>96</b>. Floating body <b>78</b> includes a centrally disposed aperture <b>98</b> that is in superimposition with throughway <b>96</b>. Each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> includes opposed ends, <b>99</b> and <b>100</b>. End <b>99</b> of each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> is connected to support body <b>76</b> through flexure joints <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. End <b>99</b> lies outside of throughway <b>96</b>. End <b>100</b> of each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> is connected to floating body <b>78</b> through flexure joints <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>. End <b>100</b> lies outside of aperture <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, each of joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are formed by reducing material from flexure <b>41</b> proximate to ends <b>99</b> and <b>100</b>, i.e., at an interface either of support body <b>76</b> or floating body <b>78</b> and one of flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>. To that end, flexure joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are formed by machining, laser cutting or other suitable processing of flexure <b>41</b>. Specifically, joints <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are formed from a flexure member <b>102</b> having two opposing surfaces <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> and two hiatuses <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. Hiatus <b>108</b> is positioned facing away from hiatus <b>110</b>, and hiatus <b>110</b> faces away from hiatus <b>108</b>. Extending from hiatus <b>110</b>, away from surface <b>104</b> is a gap <b>112</b>, terminating in an opening in a periphery of flexure arm <b>82</b>. Joint <b>94</b> is also formed from a flexure member <b>114</b> having two opposing surfaces <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> and two hiatuses <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>. Hiatus <b>122</b> is disposed opposite to surface <b>118</b>. Extending from hiatus <b>122</b>, away from surface <b>116</b> is a gap <b>123</b>, and extending from hiatus <b>120</b> is a gap <b>125</b>. The spacing S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2 </sub>and S<sub>3 </sub>of gaps <b>112</b>, <b>123</b>, and <b>125</b>, respectively define a range of motion over which relative movement between either of support body <b>76</b> and floating body <b>78</b> may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>, flexure member <b>114</b> associated with joints <b>88</b> of flexure arms <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>124</b>, and flexure member <b>102</b> associated with joints <b>92</b> of flexure arms <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>126</b>. Flexure member <b>114</b> associated with joints <b>88</b> of flexure arms <b>80</b> and <b>86</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>128</b>, and flexure member <b>102</b> associated with joints <b>92</b> of flexure arms <b>80</b> and <b>86</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>130</b>. Flexure member <b>102</b> associated with joints <b>90</b> of flexure arms <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>132</b>, and flexure member <b>114</b> associated with joints <b>94</b> of flexure arms <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>134</b>. Flexure member <b>102</b> associated with joints <b>90</b> of flexure arms <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>136</b>, and flexure member <b>114</b> associated with joints <b>94</b> of flexure arms <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> facilitates rotation about axis <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As a result, each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> is located at a region of flexure <b>41</b> where groups of the axes of rotation overlap. For example, end <b>99</b> of flexure arm <b>80</b> is located where axes <b>130</b> and <b>134</b> overlap and end <b>100</b> is positioned where axes <b>128</b> and <b>132</b> overlap. End <b>99</b> of flexure arm <b>82</b> is located where axes <b>126</b> and <b>134</b> overlap, and end <b>100</b> is positioned where axes <b>124</b> and <b>132</b> overlap. End <b>99</b> of flexure arm <b>84</b> is located where axes <b>138</b> and <b>126</b> overlap, and end <b>100</b> is located where axes <b>124</b> and <b>136</b> overlap. Similarly, end <b>98</b> of flexure arm <b>86</b> is located where axes <b>130</b> and <b>138</b> overlap, and end <b>100</b> is located where axes <b>136</b> and <b>128</b> overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As a result of this configuration, each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> is coupled to provide relative rotational movement with respect to support body <b>76</b> and floating body <b>78</b> about two groups of overlapping axes with a first group extending transversely to the remaining group. This provides each of flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> with movement about two groups of orthogonal axes while minimizing the footprint of the same. Flexure <b>41</b> may provide a tilting motion range of approximately ±0.04°, an active tilting motion range of approximately ±0.02°, and an active theta motion range of approximately ±0.0005° above the above mentioned axes. Furthermore, having the reduced footprint of each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> allows leaving a void between throughway <b>96</b> and aperture <b>98</b> unobstructed by flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>. This makes flexure <b>41</b> suited for use with an imprint lithography system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, the present configuration of flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> with respect to support body <b>76</b> and floating body <b>78</b> facilitates parallel transfer of loads in flexure <b>41</b>. For example, were a load force imparted upon support body <b>76</b>, each flexure arm <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> imparts a substantially equal amount of force F<b>1</b> upon floating body <b>78</b>. Among other things, this facilitates obtaining a desired structural stiffness with flexure <b>41</b> when loaded with either a force F<sub>1 </sub>or a force F<sub>2</sub>. To that end, joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are revolute joints which minimize movement, in all directions, between flexure <b>41</b> and either support body <b>76</b> or floating body <b>78</b> excepting rotational movement. Specifically, joints <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> minimize translational movement between flexure arms <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>, support body <b>76</b> and floating body <b>78</b>, while facilitating rotational movement about axes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, the relative position of axes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> provides floating body <b>78</b> with a first remote center of compliance (RCC) at a position <b>140</b> spaced-apart from floating body <b>78</b>, centered with respect to aperture <b>98</b> and axes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>. Similarly, the relative position of axes <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> provides floating body <b>78</b> with a second RCC substantially close to position <b>140</b> and desirably located at position <b>140</b>, which is substantially centered with respect to axes <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> and is positioned equidistant from position <b>140</b>. Each axis of the group of axes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> extends parallel to the remaining axes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> of the group. Similarly, each axis of the group of axes <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> extends parallel to the remaining axes <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> of the group and orthogonally to each axis <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>. Axis <b>130</b> is spaced-apart from axis <b>128</b> along a first direction a distance d<sub>1 </sub>and along a second orthogonal direction a distance d<sub>2</sub>. Axis <b>124</b> is spaced-apart from axis <b>126</b> along the second direction a distance d<sub>3 </sub>and along the first direction a distance d<sub>4</sub>.

Axis <b>136</b> is spaced-apart from axis <b>138</b> along the first direction a distance d<sub>7 </sub>and along the third direction a distance d<sub>8</sub>. Distances d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>4</sub>, d<sub>6 </sub>and d<sub>7 </sub>are substantially equal. Distances d<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>3</sub>, d<sub>5 </sub>and d<sub>8 </sub>are substantially equal.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, two sets of transversely extending axes may be in substantially close proximity such that RCC may be considered to lie upon an intersection thereat by appropriately establishing distances d<sub>1</sub>-d<sub>8</sub>. A first set of includes four axes is shown as <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. Joints <b>88</b> and <b>92</b> of flexure arm <b>80</b> lie along axis <b>144</b>, and joints <b>88</b> and <b>92</b> of flexure arm <b>82</b> lie along axis <b>146</b>. Joints <b>88</b> and <b>92</b> of flexure arm <b>84</b> lie along axis <b>148</b>, and joints <b>88</b> and <b>92</b> of flexure arm <b>86</b> lie along axis <b>150</b>. A second set of four axes is shown as <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and <b>158</b>. Joints <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> of flexure arm <b>82</b> lie along axis <b>152</b>, and joints <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> of flexure arm <b>84</b> lie along axis <b>154</b>. Joints <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> of flexure arm <b>86</b> lie along axis <b>156</b>, and joints <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> of flexure arm <b>80</b> lie along axis <b>158</b>. With this configuration, movement of floating body <b>78</b>, with respect to RCC, about any one of the set of axes <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and <b>158</b> is decoupled from movement about the remaining axes <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and <b>158</b>. This provides a gimbal-like movement of floating body <b>78</b> with respect to RCC with the structural stiffness to resist, if not prevent, translational movement of floating body <b>78</b> with respect to axis <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 16</figref>, chuck body <b>42</b> is adapted to retain template <b>26</b>, upon which mold <b>28</b> is attached, employing vacuum techniques. To that end, chuck body <b>42</b> includes first <b>160</b> and second <b>162</b> opposed sides. A side, or edge, surface <b>164</b> extends between first side <b>160</b> and second side <b>162</b>. First side <b>160</b> includes a first recess <b>166</b> and a second recess <b>168</b>, spaced-apart from first recess <b>166</b>, defining first <b>170</b> and second <b>172</b> spaced-apart support regions. First support region <b>170</b> cinctures second support region <b>172</b> and the first <b>166</b> and second <b>168</b> recesses. Second support region <b>172</b> cinctures second recess <b>168</b>. A portion <b>174</b> of chuck body <b>42</b> in superimposition with second recess <b>168</b> is transparent to energy having a predetermined wavelength, such as the wavelength of the actinic energy mentioned above. To that end, portion <b>174</b> is made from a thin layer of transparent material, such as glass. However, the material from which portion <b>174</b> is made may depend upon the wavelength of energy produced by source <b>22</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 16</figref>, portion <b>174</b> extends from second side <b>162</b> and terminates proximate to second recess <b>168</b> and should define an area at least as large as an area of mold <b>28</b> so that mold <b>28</b> is in superimposition therewith. Formed in chuck body <b>42</b> are one or more throughways, shown as <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>. One of the throughways, such as throughway <b>176</b>, places first recess <b>166</b> in fluid communication with side surface <b>164</b>. The remaining throughway, such as throughway <b>178</b>, places second recess <b>168</b> in fluid communication with side surface <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should be understood that throughway <b>176</b> may extend between second side <b>162</b> and first recess <b>166</b>, as well. Similarly, throughway <b>178</b> may extend between second side <b>162</b> and second recess <b>168</b>. What is desired is that throughways <b>176</b> and <b>178</b> facilitate placing recesses <b>166</b> and <b>168</b>, respectively, in fluid communication with a pressure control system, such as a pump system <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Pump system <b>180</b> may include one or more pumps to control the pressure proximate to recesses <b>166</b> and <b>168</b>, independently of one another. Specifically, when mounted to chuck body <b>42</b>, template <b>26</b> rests against first <b>170</b> and second <b>172</b> support regions, covering first <b>166</b> and second <b>168</b> recesses. First recess <b>166</b> and a portion <b>182</b> of template <b>26</b> in superimposition therewith define a first chamber <b>184</b>. Second recess <b>168</b> and a portion <b>186</b> of template <b>26</b> in superimposition therewith define a second chamber <b>188</b>. Pump system <b>180</b> operates to control a pressure in first <b>184</b> and second <b>188</b> chambers. Specifically, the pressure is established in first chamber <b>184</b> to maintain the position of the template <b>26</b> with the chuck body <b>42</b> and reduce, if not avoid, separation of template <b>26</b> from chuck body <b>42</b> under force of gravity g. The pressure in the second chamber <b>188</b> may differ from the pressure in the first chamber <b>184</b> to, inter alia, reduce distortions in the template <b>26</b> that occur during imprinting, by modulating a shape of template <b>26</b>. For example, pump system <b>180</b> may apply a positive pressure in chamber <b>188</b> to compensate for any upward force R that occurs as a result of imprinting layer <b>34</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, contacting mold <b>28</b>. In this manner, produced is a pressure differential between differing regions of side <b>160</b> so that bowing of template <b>26</b> and, therefore, mold <b>28</b> under force R is attenuated, if not avoided. Coupled to template <b>26</b> is a means for varying dimensions of the same in X and Y directions, with the understanding that the Y-direction is into the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The means for varying dimensions is shown schematically as an actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, which is coupled to chuck body <b>42</b>, shown in exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Pump system <b>180</b> and actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> are operated under control of processor <b>31</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>, in the present example actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> is configured to subject template <b>26</b> to purely compressive forces so that out-of-plane bending forces are substantially minimized, if not avoided entirely. Forces causing bending of template <b>26</b> are problematic in that the same results in pattern distortion. To that end, actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> includes a plurality of lever sub-assemblies mounted to a frame <b>192</b> having a central aperture <b>194</b> to direct compressive forces along a neutral axis of template <b>26</b>. Each of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> includes a body <b>198</b> coupled to a lever arm <b>200</b>, an actuation system <b>202</b> and a linkage system <b>204</b>. Lever arm <b>200</b> is coupled to body <b>198</b> through linkage system <b>204</b>. Typically, lever arm <b>200</b>, body <b>198</b> and linkage system <b>204</b> are integrally formed from a solid material, e.g., aluminum, stainless steel and the like. A piston <b>206</b> of actuation system <b>202</b> is coupled to a terminus region <b>208</b> of lever arm <b>200</b> through a flex joint <b>212</b> and may push or pull against terminus region <b>208</b>. A second terminus region <b>210</b> of lever arm <b>200</b> is coupled to linkage system <b>204</b> to impart a force thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Each of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> is mounted to frame <b>192</b> so that linkage system <b>204</b> is positioned on a first side <b>214</b> of frame <b>192</b>. Frame <b>192</b>, as are most if not all of the metallic components of sub-assembly <b>190</b>, is formed from aluminum, stainless steel or the like. Actuation system <b>202</b> is positioned on a second side <b>215</b> of frame <b>192</b>, disposed opposite to first side <b>214</b>, with lever arm <b>200</b> extending therebetween. Although actuation system <b>202</b> may be any force or displacement actuator known in the art, such as pneumatic, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, voice coils, in the present example actuation system is an actuator available from SMC Corporation of America located in Indianapolis, Ind. under the product number 11-CUJB10-4D.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Each body <b>198</b> of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> extends from linkage system <b>204</b> away from lever arm <b>200</b> toward aperture <b>194</b> and terminates in superimposition therewith. Although it is not necessary, it is desirable to have the plurality of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> coupled to frame <b>192</b> so that the plurality of bodies <b>198</b> associated therewith are symmetrically disposed with respect to aperture <b>194</b>. Furthermore, it may be desirable to have the plurality of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> coupled to frame <b>192</b> such that the same may impart the aforementioned force on a common frame, i.e., frame <b>192</b>. Alternatively, sub-assemblies may be coupled to differing frames, but it is desirable that opposed sub-assemblies be coupled to a common frame. Although aperture <b>194</b> may have any shape desired, typically aperture <b>194</b> has a shape complementary to the shape of template <b>26</b>. To that end, and as shown, aperture <b>194</b> is square. Further, it is desired that each of the plurality of bodies <b>198</b> be disposed opposite one of the remaining bodies <b>198</b> of the plurality of bodies <b>198</b>. To that end, there are an equal number of bodies <b>198</b> on opposing sides of aperture <b>194</b>. Although four lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> are shown, providing four bodies <b>198</b> to a side of aperture <b>194</b>, any number may be present. More specifically, each lever sub-assembly <b>196</b> may be made smaller such that a greater number of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> may be employed to provide a finer precision of the distortion control of template <b>26</b>. In this manner, an area is defined between the plurality of bodies <b>198</b> in which template <b>26</b> may be centered. An advantage with the present design is that the entire actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> is positioned to lie on one side of mold <b>28</b> so as to be spaced-apart from a plane in which mold surface <b>39</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, lies. This is beneficial in preventing contact between the components of actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and a wafer <b>30</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, during imprint processes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>, during operation, actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> applies a force to terminus region <b>208</b> to provide aperture <b>194</b> with appropriate dimensions to receive template <b>26</b>. For example, in a neutral state, i.e., without the force being applied by actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, aperture <b>194</b> may have dimensions that are smaller than the dimensions of template <b>26</b>. As a result, actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> may operate to pull against terminus region <b>208</b> and cause retraction of body <b>198</b> away from an opposing body <b>198</b> to increase the size of aperture <b>194</b> for loading of template <b>26</b>. Template <b>26</b> is disposed within aperture <b>194</b> and held in place via chucking system <b>40</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, body <b>198</b> is allowed to press against template <b>26</b> without force being generated by actuation system <b>202</b>. Alternatively, the size of aperture <b>194</b> may be greater than the dimension of template <b>26</b>, requiring a force to be generated by actuation system <b>202</b> to achieve contact between template <b>26</b> and body <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Bodies <b>198</b> are arranged so that a contact surface <b>220</b> is included in body <b>198</b> to contact a side <b>218</b> of template <b>26</b>. Specifically, a contact surface <b>220</b> is configured to extend parallel to side <b>218</b> and make contact therewith. To that end, actuation system <b>202</b> is coupled to pump system <b>180</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to cause actuation system <b>202</b> to impart angular movement of lever arm <b>200</b>. Piston <b>206</b> imparts a force F<sub>IN </sub>upon one end of lever arm <b>200</b> through flexure joint <b>212</b>. This causes lever arm <b>200</b> to undergo rotational movement that causes body <b>198</b> to undergo translational movement toward template <b>26</b>, thereby decreasing the area defined by the plurality of bodies <b>198</b>. In this manner, a force F<sub>OUT </sub>is imparted upon side <b>218</b> of template <b>26</b>. By appropriately imparting F<sub>OUT </sub>from one or more bodies <b>198</b> along differing portions of side <b>218</b> of template <b>26</b>, dimensional variations of template <b>26</b> may be achieved. The dimensional variations of template <b>26</b> are imparted upon mold <b>28</b>, which may be employed to compensate for magnification errors, discussed more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An important consideration when varying the dimensions of template <b>26</b> is to minimize, if not avoid, localized force concentrations upon template <b>26</b> and bending of template <b>26</b>, both of which will result in distortions in the pattern of mold <b>28</b>. To that end, linkage <b>204</b> is designed to control the direction of travel of body <b>198</b> and lever arm <b>200</b>. Additionally the structural connection of sub-assemblies <b>196</b> to common frame <b>192</b> ensures that high forces are reacted in frame <b>192</b>, as opposed to other components, such as chuck body <b>42</b> and, therefore, template <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Linkage <b>204</b> includes a linkage member <b>224</b> and a plurality of flexure joints, shown as <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and <b>236</b>. Each of flexure joints <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> are regions of material of linkage member <b>224</b>, that has substantially reduced material. Flexure joint <b>226</b> defines a pivot axis <b>238</b> about which lever arm <b>200</b> undergoes rotational/angular movement in response to force F<sub>IN </sub>imparted upon lever arm <b>200</b> by piston <b>206</b> of actuation system <b>202</b> at terminus region <b>208</b>. The rotational/angular movement of lever arm <b>200</b> about pivot axis <b>238</b> causes body <b>198</b> to move in a direction <b>240</b> that is transverse, if not orthogonal, to pivot axis <b>238</b>. It is highly desired that direction <b>240</b> is precisely controlled so that deviation therefrom is minimized. This reduces, if not avoids, out-of-plane bending of template <b>26</b> upon being subjected to force F<sub>OUT </sub>by the plurality of bodies <b>198</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Flexure joints <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, and <b>232</b> in addition to flexure joint <b>226</b> facilitate rotational/angular movement between lever arm <b>200</b> and body <b>198</b> while ensuring that deviation of body <b>198</b> from direction <b>240</b> is minimized. Specifically, each of flexure joints <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, and <b>232</b> defines an axis of rotation, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, and <b>246</b>, respectively, about which rotational/angular movement between lever arm <b>200</b> and body <b>198</b> may occur.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, in furtherance of maintaining pure compression on template <b>26</b>, linkage system <b>204</b> includes joints <b>234</b> and <b>236</b>. Joints <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> facilitate rotational/angular movement of body <b>198</b> with respect to lever member <b>224</b> along two transversely extending axes <b>248</b> and <b>250</b>. By providing body <b>198</b> with rotational freedom about axes <b>248</b> and <b>250</b>, body <b>198</b> may change position to compensate for obliqueness of side <b>218</b> with respect to contact surface <b>220</b>. In this manner, contact surface <b>220</b> will maintain contact with side <b>218</b> so as to reduce, if not prevent, localized stresses resulting from, inter alia, having a corner of contact surface <b>220</b> contacting side <b>218</b>. To further reduce localized stresses between contact surface <b>220</b> and template <b>26</b>, contact surface <b>220</b> may be formed from a compliant material, so that localized stresses on side <b>218</b> resulting from non-conformity of contact surface <b>220</b> with side <b>218</b> is minimized. Exemplary materials from which contact surface may be formed include TEFLON®, fluorosilicone, urethane and Delrin/AF. Further compliance with surface anomalies of side <b>218</b> may be achieved by allowing independent control over body <b>198</b>, one among the plurality of bodies <b>198</b>, and, therefore, contact surface <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> facilitates varying dimensions of template <b>26</b> in two dimensions. This is particularly useful in overcoming Poisson's effect. Poisson's effect may result in linear coupling of strain in orthogonal directions of template <b>26</b>. Specifically, the Poisson ratio is the ratio between the tensile strain caused in the Y and Z directions in template <b>26</b> to the compressive strain imparted to template <b>26</b> in the X direction. Typical numbers are in the range of 0.1-0.4. Were template <b>26</b> formed from fused silica, the ratio would be approximately 0.16. A dimensional change that is purely in the X direction, therefore, i.e., with no dimensional change in the Y direction being desired, may necessitate activation of actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> to vary both distances d<sub>1 </sub>and d<sub>2</sub>, to compensate for Poisson's effect. With any of the above-described configurations of actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, a force may be applied to template <b>26</b> to vary the dimensions of the same and reduce distortions in the pattern recorded into imprinting layer <b>34</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> another important consideration when varying template dimensions is to minimize the deleterious effects of the forces employed. For example, when varying template dimensions, forces on the order of hundreds of pounds may be exerted. It is desirable to minimize the amount of these forces felt on other units of system <b>10</b>, such as orientation system <b>43</b>. In addition, it is desirable that template <b>26</b> neither rotate with respect to chuck body <b>42</b> about the Z-axis nor become displaced along the X and Y directions with respect to body <b>42</b>, such as in the presence of unequal compression forces exerted upon side <b>218</b> by bodies <b>198</b>. To that end, actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> is pivotally/elastically coupled to flexure <b>41</b> to move in a plane along X and Y directions and rotate about the Z direction in response to reaction forces generated when actuator sub-assembly compresses template <b>26</b>. Specifically, the force by which template <b>26</b> is held against chuck body <b>42</b> minimizes, if not prohibits, bulk and rotational movement of template <b>26</b> with respect to chuck body <b>42</b> in the presence of compression forces. This is accomplished by coupling each corner <b>252</b>, <b>254</b>, <b>256</b> and <b>258</b>, of actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> to a corner <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>, of flexure <b>41</b> through a pliant member <b>268</b> using any suitable fastening means, such as threaded fasteners (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown, each pliant member <b>268</b> includes opposed termini <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> with a dual fulcrum lever system <b>274</b> extending from terminus <b>270</b> toward terminus <b>272</b>, terminating in a fulcrum <b>276</b>. Fulcrum <b>276</b> is located between opposed termini <b>270</b> and <b>272</b>. Fulcrum lever system <b>274</b> includes a lever <b>278</b>, extending from fulcrum <b>276</b>, along direction Z toward terminus <b>270</b>, terminating in a base <b>280</b>. Base <b>280</b> is coupled to lever <b>278</b> defining a fulcrum <b>282</b> thereat. Base <b>280</b> extends from fulcrum <b>282</b>, transversely to direction Z. Extending from fulcrum <b>276</b> is a support <b>284</b> that terminates in a base <b>285</b>. Support <b>284</b> extends from fulcrum <b>276</b> toward terminus <b>270</b> and is disposed opposite to, and spaced apart from, lever <b>278</b>. Base <b>285</b> extends from support <b>284</b> away from lever <b>278</b> and is positioned in superimposition with, and spaced apart from, base <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Base <b>280</b> is fixedly attached to actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, and base <b>285</b> is fixedly attached to flexure <b>41</b>. To that end, a plurality of threaded fasteners (not shown) is coupled to each of base <b>285</b> and base <b>280</b>. With this configuration, relative movement between actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> and flexure <b>41</b> is facilitated. Having one pliant member <b>268</b> coupling together each pair of corners, i.e., one of the corners of flexure <b>41</b> with one of the corners of actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, allows each lever <b>278</b> to function as a parallel four-bar linkage in space. This provides the actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> with relative translational movement, with respect to flexure <b>41</b>, along the X and Y directions, as well as rotational about the Z direction. Specifically, fulcrum <b>276</b> facilitates relative movement about axis <b>288</b>, and fulcrum <b>282</b> facilitates relative movement about axis <b>290</b>. In addition, relative rotational movement about axis Z is facilitated by lever <b>278</b>. The rigidity of lever <b>278</b> minimizes, if not prevents, translational movement along the Z direction. Providing the aforementioned relative movement between actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> and flexure <b>41</b> minimizes the amount of magnification forces that is sensed by other features of the system <b>10</b>, e.g., flexure <b>41</b> and system <b>42</b> among others.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Additionally, actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> is allowed to accommodate loading tolerances and unequal forces between template <b>26</b> and actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>. For example, were template <b>26</b> loaded on body <b>42</b> with theta error, e.g., not properly aligned rotationally about the Z direction with respect to chuck body <b>42</b>, then the actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> might rotate about the Z direction to accommodate for the misalignment. In addition, were the sum of the forces applied to template <b>26</b> by opposing bodies <b>198</b> not to cancel, the actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> would accommodates for non-equilibrium of the forces applied by moving in the X and/or Y directions and/or rotating about the Z direction.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, it is desired that each of the plurality of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> operate independently of the remaining lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> so that the sum of the magnification forces applied to template <b>26</b> in each direction is zero. To that end the following is satisfied:

<br/>
where i is an integer number, F<sub>x </sub>is a force in the X direction, F<sub>y </sub>is a force in the Y direction and M<sub>z </sub>is the moment of the forces F<sub>x </sub>and F<sub>y </sub>about the Z-axis. A large number of combinations of forces can be applied to template <b>26</b> obeying the above constraints. These combinations can be used to correct for magnification and distortion errors.
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a further embodiment, to provide better distortion control of template <b>26</b>, the area of template <b>26</b> may be increased such that a greater number of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> may be employed to apply compressive forces to template <b>26</b>. The larger number of lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> allow a finer precision of the distortion control of template <b>26</b>. To that end, a subset of, or each of, lever sub-assemblies <b>196</b> may be constructed to have bodies <b>198</b> of smaller dimensions to increase the number thereof coupled to side <b>218</b>. In this manner, improved distortion correction may be achieved due to the increased resolution of correction afforded by increasing a number of bodies <b>198</b> on side <b>218</b>. Alternatively, the area of side <b>218</b> may be increased, requiring appropriate scaling of actuator sub-assemblies <b>190</b> to accommodate template <b>26</b> of increased size. Another advantage of increasing the size of template <b>26</b> is that the area of template <b>26</b> outside of mold <b>28</b> filters, e.g., attenuates, deleterious effects of stress concentrations of bodies <b>198</b> on side <b>218</b>. The stress concentration creates strain variations at mold <b>28</b>, which results in pattern distortions in the pattern on mold <b>28</b>. In short, it may be realized that the number of bodies <b>198</b> per unit area of side <b>218</b> is proportional to the resolution of distortion correction. Furthermore, decreasing the area of mold <b>28</b> with respect to the remaining regions of template <b>26</b> reduces the pattern distortions caused by bodies <b>198</b> contacting side <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, distortions in the pattern recorded into imprinting layer <b>34</b> may arise from, inter alia, dimensional variations of imprinting layer <b>34</b> and wafer <b>30</b>. These dimensional variations may be due in part to thermal fluctuations, as well inaccuracies in previous processing steps that produce what is commonly referred to as magnification/run-out errors. The magnification/run-out errors occur when a region of wafer <b>30</b> in which the original pattern is to be recorded exceeds the area of the original pattern. Additionally, magnification/run-out errors may occur when the region of wafer <b>30</b>, in which a pattern is to be recorded, has an area smaller than the original pattern. The deleterious effects of magnification/run-out errors are exacerbated when forming multiple layers of imprinted patterns, shown as imprinting layer <b>292</b> in superimposition with patterned surface <b>294</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Proper alignment between two superimposed patterns is difficult in the face of magnification/run-out errors in both single-step full wafer imprinting and step-and-repeat imprinting processes. To achieve proper alignment an interferometric analysis may be undertaken to generate control signals operated on by processor <b>31</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/000,331 filed Nov. 4, 2004, entitled “Interferometric Analysis For Manufacture Of Nano-Scale Devices,” having Pawan K. Nimmakayala, Tom H. Rafferty, Alireza Aghili, Byung-Jin Choi, Philip D. Schumaker, Daniel A. Babbs, and Sidlgata V. Sreenivasan listed as inventors, in which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, a step-and-repeat process includes defining a plurality of regions, shown as, a-<b>1</b>, on wafer <b>30</b> in which a pattern corresponding to the original on mold <b>28</b> will be recorded. The original pattern on mold <b>28</b> may be coextensive with the entire surface of mold <b>28</b>, or simply located on a sub-portion thereof. The present invention will be discussed with respect to the original pattern being coextensive with the surface of mold <b>28</b> that faces wafer <b>30</b>. Step-and-repeat imprint lithography processes may be achieved in a variety of manners. For example, the entire surface of wafer <b>30</b> may be coated with droplets <b>36</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of imprinting material so that mold <b>28</b> may be sequentially placed in contact therewith at each region a-<b>1</b>. To that end, each region a-<b>1</b> would include the requisite volume of imprinting material so that the same would not egress into adjacent regions a-<b>1</b> upon being patterned by mold <b>28</b> and subsequently solidified, as discussed above. In this technique all the imprinting material required to pattern regions a-<b>1</b> is deposited over the surface of wafer before solidification and imprinting material in any of regions a-<b>1</b>. Alternatively, a sub-portion of regions a-<b>1</b>, e.g., one of regions a-<b>1</b>, may be provided with imprinting material that is subsequently patterned and solidified before remaining regions of a-<b>1</b> are provided with any imprinting material. In yet another embodiment, the entire surface of wafer may be provided with imprinting material deposited employing spin-coating techniques followed by sequentially patterning and solidifying imprinting material in each of regions a-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Proper execution of a step-and-repeat process may include proper alignment of mold <b>28</b> with each of regions a-<b>1</b>. To that end, mold <b>28</b> includes alignment marks <b>298</b>, shown as a “+” sign. One or more of regions a-<b>1</b> include fiducial marks <b>296</b>. By ensuring that alignment marks <b>298</b> are properly aligned with fiducial marks <b>296</b>, proper alignment of mold <b>28</b> with one of regions a-<b>1</b> in superimposition therewith is ensured. To that end, machine vision devices (not shown) may be employed to sense the relative alignment between alignment marks <b>298</b> and fiducial marks <b>296</b>. In the present example, proper alignment is indicated upon alignment marks <b>298</b> being in superimposition with fiducial marks <b>296</b>. With the introduction of magnification/run-out errors, proper alignment becomes very difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, magnification/run-out errors are reduced, if not avoided, by creating relative dimensional variations between mold <b>28</b> and wafer <b>30</b>. Specifically, the relative dimensions of mold <b>28</b> and wafer <b>30</b> are established so that at least one of regions a-<b>1</b> defines an area that is slightly less than an area of the original pattern on mold <b>28</b>. Thereafter, the final compensation for magnification/run-out errors is achieved by subjecting template <b>26</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, to mechanical compression forces using actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, which are in turn transferred to mold <b>28</b> shown by arrows F<sub>1 </sub>and F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>-F<sub>8</sub>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. In this manner, the area of the original pattern is made coextensive with the area of the region a-<b>1</b> in superimposition therewith. To ensure that magnification correction is achieved primarily through reduction of dimensions of mold <b>28</b>, patterns defined by mold <b>28</b> may be generated to be slightly larger than nominal, e.g., slightly larger than desired. In this manner, it could be said that the original pattern defined by mold <b>28</b> has a fixed magnification associated therewith, compared to the nominal dimensions of the pattern desired to be recorded in one of regions a-<b>1</b>. Actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> is then employed to compress template <b>26</b> to provide the original pattern with a zero magnification. It is possible, however, to create thermal changes to vary the dimension of wafer <b>30</b> so that one of regions a-<b>1</b> has dimensions that are slightly less than the dimensions of mold <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when compressing template <b>26</b> with actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b>, relative movement between template <b>26</b> and support regions <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> occurs along the X and Y axes. As a result, in one embodiment support regions <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> have surface regions <b>300</b> and <b>302</b>, respectively, formed thereon from a combination of materials adapted to conform to a profile of said template <b>26</b> and resistant to bulk motion of template <b>26</b> along the X and Y axes, e.g., Buna-N, Viton, Silicone, TEFLON®, FEP, Fluorosilicone, Urethane, Kalrez, Simriz, Buna-n, mirror polished anodized Al, Ni plating, or SiC surface, or polished TEFLON® coating, a regular O-ring, TEFLON® tube, TEFLON® coating or any durable material that can be used to seal a vacuum in cleanroom environment. In this manner, surface regions <b>300</b> and <b>302</b> resist relative movement of template <b>26</b> with respect to chuck body <b>42</b> in the X and Y directions.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 24</figref>, providing a chuck body <b>304</b> with walls/baffles <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> facilitates providing sub-regions <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> with differing pressure levels, concurrently. As a result, the amount of force exerted on template <b>26</b> when being pulled-apart from imprinting layer <b>34</b> may vary across the surface of template <b>26</b>. This allows cantilevering, or peeling-off of template <b>26</b> from imprinting layer <b>34</b> that reduces distortions or defects from being formed in imprinting layer <b>34</b> during separation of mold <b>28</b> therefrom. For example, sub-region <b>316</b> may have a pressure established therein that is greater than the pressure associated with the remaining sub-regions <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>320</b>. As a result, when increasing “distance d,” the pulling force to which the portion of template <b>26</b> in superimposition with sub-regions <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> is subjected is greater than the pulling force to which the portion of template <b>26</b> in superimposition with sub-region <b>316</b> is subjected. Thus, the rate that “d” increases for the portion of template <b>26</b> in superimposition with sub-regions <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> is accelerated compared to the rate at which “d” increases for the portion of template <b>26</b> in superimposition with sub-region <b>316</b>, providing the aforementioned cantilevering effect.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In yet another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, chuck body <b>322</b> may include a plurality of pins <b>324</b> projecting from a nadir surface <b>326</b> of out recess <b>328</b>. Pins <b>324</b> provide mechanical support for the template (not shown) retained on chuck body <b>322</b> via vacuum and resting against surfaces <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> of support regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b>, respectively. Surface regions <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> provide a fluid-tight seal with the template (not shown). To that end, surfaces <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> are polished to be optically flat and pins <b>324</b> extend from recess <b>328</b> terminating in a common plane with surface regions <b>330</b> and <b>332</b>. Mechanical support of the template (not shown) in the Z direction is provided by support regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> and pins <b>324</b>, with pins <b>324</b> typically being rigid posts having a circular or square cross-section. Pins <b>324</b> are arranged in a pattern so that the mold (not shown) on template (not shown) is substantially flat when a nominal vacuum pressure is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</figref>, <b>23</b> and <b>26</b>, in operation, an accurate measurement of wafer <b>30</b> in an X-Y plane is undertaken at step <b>400</b>. This may be achieved by sensing gross alignment fiducials <b>338</b> present on wafer <b>30</b> using machine vision devices (not shown) and known signal processing techniques. At step <b>402</b>, the area of one of regions a-<b>1</b> is established to be slightly less than an area of the original pattern on mold <b>28</b>. This may be achieved by fabricating mold <b>28</b> to have a pattern thereon that is slightly larger than the area of one of regions a-<b>1</b>, and/or expanding mold <b>28</b> by varying the temperature thereof as for example, having mold <b>28</b> and wafer <b>30</b> in a temperature controlled environment (not shown) and varying the temperature of said environment causing dimensional changes that occur due to, inter alia, the differences in coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials from which mold <b>28</b> and wafer <b>30</b> are fabricated. The inherent assumption when dealing with thermal solutions is that excellent temperature control of the order of +0.01 Celsius of wafer <b>30</b> is possible, which may lead to +0.03 ppm distortion that is considered insignificant. Alternatively, or in conjunction therewith, the temperature of wafer <b>30</b> may be varied, i.e., raised or lowered, so that the area of one of regions a-<b>1</b> is slightly less than an area of the original pattern on mold <b>28</b>. The temperature variations may be achieved using a temperature controlled chuck or pedestal (not shown) against which wafer <b>30</b> rests. Alternatively, temperature variation of both wafer <b>30</b> and mold <b>28</b> may be achieved by placing the same in a temperature controlled chamber (not shown). This may be particularly beneficial were wafer <b>30</b> and mold <b>28</b> fabricated from materials having differing coefficients of thermal expansion. The area of each of regions a-<b>1</b> can be determined by measurement of a change in distance between two collinear gross alignment fiducials <b>338</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Specifically, a change in the distance between two gross alignment fiducials <b>338</b> collinear along one of the X or Y axes is determined. Thereafter, this change in distance is divided by a number of adjacent regions a-<b>1</b> on the wafer <b>30</b> along the X-axis. This provides the dimensional change of the areas of regions a-<b>1</b> attributable to dimensional changes in wafer <b>30</b> along the X-axis. If necessary the same measurement may be made to determine the change in area of regions a-<b>1</b> due to dimensional changes of wafer <b>30</b> along the Y-axis. However, it may also be assumed that the dimensional changes in wafer <b>30</b> may be uniform in the two orthogonal axes, X and Y.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At step <b>404</b>, compressive forces, F<sub>1-8</sub>, are applied to mold <b>28</b> to establish the area of the original pattern to be coextensive with the area of one of the regions a-<b>1</b> in superimposition with the pattern and proper alignment between the pattern on mold <b>28</b> and one of the regions a-<b>1</b>. This may be achieved in real-time employing machine vision devices (not shown) and known signal processing techniques, to determine when two or more of alignment marks <b>298</b> are aligned with two or more of fiducial marks <b>296</b>. At step <b>406</b>, after proper alignment is achieved and magnification/run-out errors are reduced, if not vitiated, the original pattern is recorded in the region a-<b>1</b> that is in superimposition with mold <b>28</b>, forming the recorded pattern. It is not necessary that compression forces F<sub>1-8 </sub>have the same magnitude, as the dimensional variations in either wafer <b>30</b> or mold <b>28</b> may not be uniform in all directions. Further, the magnification/run-out errors may not be identical in both X-Y directions. As a result, compression forces, F<sub>1-8 </sub>may differ to compensate for these anomalies. Specifically, as mentioned above, each lever sub-assembly <b>196</b> of actuator sub-assembly <b>190</b> may operate independently. This affords application of differing force combinations F<sub>1-8 </sub>to mold <b>28</b> to compensate for magnification distortion, as well as distortions that may be present in the pattern on mold, e.g., orthogonality distortions, such as skew distortions and keystone distortions. Furthermore, to ensure greater reduction in magnification/run-out errors, the dimensional variation in mold <b>28</b> may be undertaken after mold <b>28</b> contacts an imprinting layer (not shown) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, this is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, the alignment of mold <b>28</b> with regions a-<b>1</b> in superimposition therewith may occur with mold <b>28</b> being spaced-apart from an imprinting layer (not shown). Were it found that the magnification/run-out errors were constant over the entire wafer <b>30</b>, then the magnitude of forces F<sub>1-8 </sub>could be maintained for each region a-<b>1</b> in which the original pattern is recorded. However, were it determined that the magnification/run-out errors differed for one or more regions a-<b>1</b>, steps <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, would then be undertaken for each region a-<b>1</b> in which the original pattern is recorded. It should be noted that there are limits to the relative dimensional changes that may occur between wafer <b>30</b> and mold <b>28</b>. For example, the area of the regions a-<b>1</b> should be of appropriate dimensions to enable pattern on mold <b>28</b> to define an area coextensive therewith when mold <b>28</b> is subject to compression forces F<sub>1-8</sub>, without compromising the structural integrity of mold <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</figref>, <b>23</b> and <b>27</b>, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, accurate measurement of wafer <b>30</b> in an X-Y plane is undertaken at step <b>500</b>. At step <b>502</b>, it is determined whether the original pattern on mold <b>28</b> has any distortions, e.g., skew distortions, keystone distortions and the like. If there are original pattern distortions, a force differential is established to create the requisite differences in magnitude among forces F<sub>1-8 </sub>to remove the original pattern distortions, defining a force differential, at step <b>504</b>. In this manner, skew distortions, keystone distortions and the like may be attenuated if not abrogated entirely to provide mold <b>28</b> with the original pattern desired. If there are no distortions in the original pattern, it is determined whether the area of one of regions a-<b>1</b> in superimposition with mold <b>28</b> is larger than the area of the pattern on mold <b>28</b>, at step <b>506</b>. If this is the case, the process proceeds to step <b>508</b>, otherwise the process proceeds to step <b>510</b>. At step <b>510</b>, mold <b>28</b> is placed in contact with the region a-<b>1</b> in superimposition therewith, and the requisite magnitude of compressive forces F<sub>1-8 </sub>is determined to apply to mold <b>28</b> to ensure that the area of pattern is coextensive with the area of this region a-<b>1</b>, with the compressive forces including the force differential. At step <b>512</b>, compressive forces F<sub>1-8 </sub>are applied to mold <b>28</b> and the pattern is recorded in wafer <b>30</b>. At step <b>514</b>, the pattern is recorded on wafer <b>30</b>. Thereafter, mold <b>28</b> is spaced-apart from the region a-<b>1</b> in superimposition with mold <b>28</b> and the process proceeds to step <b>516</b> where it is determined whether there remain any regions a-<b>1</b> on wafer <b>30</b> in which to record a pattern. If there are, the process proceeds to step <b>518</b> wherein mold <b>28</b> is placed in superimposition with the next region and the process proceeds to step <b>506</b>. Otherwise, the process ends at step <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Were it determined at step <b>506</b> that the region a-<b>1</b> in superimposition with mold <b>28</b> had an area greater than the area of the pattern, then the process proceeds to step <b>508</b> wherein the temperature of mold <b>28</b> and/or wafer <b>30</b> is varied to cause expansion of the same. In the present embodiment, mold <b>28</b> is heated at step <b>508</b> so that the pattern is slightly larger than the area of region a-<b>1</b> in superimposition therewith. Then the process continues at step <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The embodiments of the present invention described above are exemplary. Many changes and modifications may be made to the disclosure recited above, while remaining within the scope of the invention. For example, by pressurizing all chambers formed by the chuck body-substrate combination with positive fluid pressure, the substrate may be quickly released from the chuck body. Further, many of the embodiments discussed above may be implemented in existing imprint lithography processes that do not employ formation of an imprinting layer by deposition of droplets of polymerizable material. Therefore, the scope of the invention should not be limited by the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p>
