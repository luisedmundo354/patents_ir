<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a gas-regulating unit for regulating a gas pressure in a gas-tight liquid-storage tank, in which stored liquid is sealed by covering a top surface of the stored liquid with an isolating-gas, in particular, a gas-regulating unit having a simplified gas piping structure and high serviceability.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, in a large liquid-storage tank, an internal gas pressure is changed, for example, by a gas space increased or decreased by receiving or releasing stored liquid, or for another example, by the air or vapor increased or decreased by an outside atmosphere condition. For coping with the changing internal gas pressure, a breathing valve system is mounted on the large liquid-storage tank.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, when the storage liquid is such as petroleum derivative products or chemical liquids, a gas-tight liquid-storage tank is used for purposes of flame protection and deterioration protection of the storage liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when mounting both a breathing valve system <b>103</b> and an isolating-gas regulator <b>104</b> on the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>, they are separately mounted on a roof <b>102</b> of the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an upstream pipe <b>105</b> of the isolating-gas, a downstream pipe <b>106</b> coupling the isolating-gas regulator <b>104</b> to the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>, and a control pipe (pressure-sensitive pipe) <b>107</b> connecting the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b> to the isolating-gas regulator <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the gas-tight liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>, an internal gas pressure should be slightly higher than an outside atmosphere pressure and kept constant. Therefore, it is necessary to control the isolating-gas supply so precisely as to supply the isolating-gas when the internal gas pressure in the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b> is less than a specified level. In the past, we suggested a high-precision isolating-gas regulator for the liquid-storage tank described above in a patent document (Utility Model Document No. JP, H04-13513, Y), and excellent results are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> of the present application, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the patent document, for mounting the breathing valve system <b>103</b> and the isolating-gas regulator <b>104</b> on the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>, fitting holes <b>107</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a</i>of the control pipe <b>107</b> and the downstream pipe <b>106</b> should be drilled through a roof <b>102</b> of the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>. Therefore, a piping-work costs a great deal of money, and a large piping space is occupied for mounting the breathing valve system <b>103</b> and the isolating-gas regulator <b>104</b> on the liquid-storage tank <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, when mounting on an existing liquid-storage tank, the fitting holes <b>107</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the control pipe <b>107</b> and the downstream pipe <b>106</b> are newly drilled under limitations. Therefore, the existing liquid-storage tank may be heavily modified. Resultingly, there is a problem that mounting the downstream pipe <b>106</b> and the control pipe <b>107</b> on the existing liquid-storage tank costs a great deal of money.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a gas-regulating unit for regulating an internal gas pressure of a gas-tight liquid-storage tank having no disadvantages of the conventional gas-regulating unit described above, and allowing an isolating-gas regulator to be much easily mounted on the liquid-storage tank, to considerably reduce a mounting cost, and to be mounted on an existing liquid-storage tank without a heavy modification work on a roof of the existing liquid-storage tank.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to attain the object, according to the present invention, there is provided a gas-regulating unit for regulating an internal gas pressure in a gas-tight liquid-storage tank, mounted on the gas-tight tank in which stored liquid is sealed from outside atmosphere by covering a top surface of the stored liquid with an isolating-gas including:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">a main gas-exhausting unit having an exhaust valve for opening and exhausting gases from the gas-tight tank when an internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank increases to more than a specified level; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">an isolating-gas regulator for supplying the isolating-gas when an isolating-gas pressure decreases to less than a specified level,</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">whereby the main gas-exhausting unit and the isolating-gas regulator are integrally coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the main gas-exhausting unit and the isolating-gas regulator are integrally coupled in a manner that a downstream pipe of the isolating-gas regulator is inserted into the main gas-exhausting unit via a fitting port formed on a valve chamber and is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the gas-regulating unit for regulating the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank, the main gas-exhausting unit is required to include the exhaust valve for opening and exhausting gases from the gas-tight tank when an internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank increases to more than the specified level, and the isolating-gas regulator supplies the isolating-gas to the gas-tight tank when the internal gas pressure of the gas-tight tank decreases to less than a specified level for control the internal gas pressure to be a specified level.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For coping with a rapid change of the internal gas pressure, preferably, a breathing valve system having the exhaust valve and an intake valve for taking the outside atmosphere in accordance with the decrease of the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank is adopted for the main gas-exhausting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In case that the breathing valve system is adopted for the main gas-exhausting unit, when the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank increases to more than the specified level, the exhaust valve opens and exhausts gases from the gas-tight tank, and when the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank rapidly decreases to less than the specified level, the intake valve supplies the outside atmosphere to the gas-tight tank, while the isolating-gas regulator sensing the decrease of the internal gas pressure through the control pipe (pressure-sensitive pipe) supplies the isolating-gas so as to increase the internal gas pressure to the specified level.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The downstream port of the exhaust valve of the main gas-exhausting unit may be exposed to the outside atmosphere like a conventional breathing valve system, or may be connected to a gas treatment unit for treating an exhaust gas which may be a mixture of a stored liquid vapor and the isolating-gas.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank is sensed by an end of the control pipe of the isolating-gas regulator being connected to the main gas-exhausting unit in the vicinity of the gas-tight tank. However, the isolating-gas regulator finely regulates an isolating-gas supply. Therefore, preferably, for preventing the isolating-gas regulator from directly receiving the excessive internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank, an orifice is mounted in between the end of the control pipe of the isolating-gas regulator and the main gas-exhausting unit in the vicinity of the gas-tight tank.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be better understood when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and description.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A first embodiment of a gas-regulating unit for regulating an internal gas pressure in a gas-tight liquid-storage tank according to the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a liquid-storage tank <b>1</b> is a gas-tight tank in which stored liquid is sealed from outside atmosphere by covering a top surface of the stored liquid with an isolating-gas SG. A gas-regulating unit <b>10</b> for regulating an internal gas pressure in the liquid-storage tank <b>1</b> is mounted on a roof <b>2</b> of the liquid storage tank <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the gas-regulating unit <b>10</b> includes: a main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> having an exhaust valve <b>8</b> for opening and exhausting gases from the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> when the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> increases to more than a specified level; and an isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> for supplying the isolating-gas when an isolating-gas pressure decreases to less than a specified level. The main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> and the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> are integrally coupled with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an upstream pipe <b>5</b> and a downstream pipe <b>6</b> of the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b>. An end of the downstream pipe <b>6</b> is protruded to an interior of the main gas-exhausting unit <b>8</b> in the vicinity of the liquid-storage tank via an elbow pipe <b>6</b><i>a </i>so that the isolating-gas injected from the end of the downstream pipe <b>6</b> is prevented from affecting a sensing of a control pipe <b>7</b> explained below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an end of the control pipe (pressure-sensitive pipe) <b>7</b> of the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> is connected to a valve chamber <b>11</b> of the main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b>. Therefore, the internal gas pressure of the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> is conducted to the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> via an orifice <b>9</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the valve chamber <b>11</b> of the main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> is formed substantially in a T-shape by a main body <b>11</b><i>a </i>and a fitting port <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> is attached to the fitting port <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The downstream pipe <b>6</b> of the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> is inserted into the interior of the valve chamber <b>11</b> via the fitting port <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and coupled by a pipe coupler <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flange fitting <b>13</b> for mounting the main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> on the roof <b>2</b> of the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> is formed on a bottom end of the main body <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the valve chamber <b>11</b>. Further, an exhaust port <b>14</b> is mounted on a top end of the main body <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the valve chamber <b>11</b>. The exhaust valve <b>8</b> of the exhaust port <b>14</b> is an overlap type disc valve. A flange fitting <b>15</b> for connecting the main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> to a not-shown gas treatment unit is formed on a downstream part <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the exhaust valve <b>8</b>. Therefore, it is possible that an exhaust gas, which may be a mixture of a stored liquid vapor and the isolating-gas, is treated by the gas treatment unit via the flange fitting <b>15</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a second embodiment of the gas-regulating unit <b>10</b>, in which the exhaust port <b>14</b> has an air-vent valve. In this embodiment, the exhaust gas is directly released into the outside atmosphere. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cylindrical bird screen <b>16</b>, a lifting ring <b>17</b> for being lifted by such as a crane when the exhaust port <b>14</b> is mounted or unmounted.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show a third embodiment of the gas-regulating unit <b>10</b>, in which a breathing valve system having the exhaust valve <b>8</b> described above and an intake valve <b>18</b> for taking the outside atmosphere in accordance with a decrease of the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> is adopted for a main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> respectively are a front view and a partially sectional front view showing an internal structure of the main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the third embodiment, in the main gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b> having a breathing valve system, the valve chamber <b>11</b> is formed in a cross shape by the main body <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the fitting port <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and an intake port <b>11</b><i>c </i>arranged symmetrical to the fitting port <b>11</b><i>b</i>. An intake valve chamber <b>19</b> is attached to the intake port <b>11</b><i>c</i>. In the intake valve chamber <b>19</b>, an intake valve <b>18</b> is lifted to take the outside atmosphere in accordance with a decrease of the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank <b>1</b>. The breathing valve system is mainly adopted for the gas-exhausting unit <b>3</b>, by introducing the intake valve <b>18</b> as described above, to decrease a load on the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> as a way of coping with a rapid decrease of the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank <b>1</b>. The intake valve <b>18</b> also is a disc valve.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A detailed explanation of the structure of the gas-regulating unit <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> is omitted because this structure is substantially the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> except the intake valve chamber <b>19</b>. Additionally, as alternate long and two short dashes lines shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the flange fitting <b>16</b> is rotated a quarter turn from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> for avoiding an interference with the intake port <b>11</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross sectional top cut away view along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> showing internal mechanism of the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a longitudinal sectional front mid-depth cut-away view of regulator <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> wherein the internal mechanism is exposed. A basic structure of the isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> is the same as that disclosed in the patent document by the inventor of the present invention (Utility Model Document No. JP, H04-13513, Y). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B show a fitting hole <b>20</b> for the upstream pipe <b>5</b>, a fitting hole <b>21</b> for the downstream pipe <b>6</b>, and a fitting hole <b>33</b> for connecting the other end of the control pipe (pressure-sensitive pipe) <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This isolating-gas regulator <b>4</b> includes:</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">a main valve <b>25</b> for opening and closing a communicating path <b>24</b> communicating an inlet <b>22</b> to an outlet <b>23</b> of the isolating-gas;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">first and second diaphragms <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> attached to a valve spindle <b>26</b> of the main valve <b>25</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">a first pressure chamber <b>30</b> formed in between the first and second diaphragms <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>, and to which the isolating-gas is supplied from the inlet <b>22</b> via a bypass <b>29</b>; a hole having a same diameter as bypass <b>29</b> is formed on a communicating part of diaphragm <b>27</b>; hence, bypass <b>29</b> can communicate with the first pressure chamber <b>30</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">a second pressure chamber <b>31</b> partitioned by the first diaphragm <b>27</b>, and to which the isolating-gas is supplied from the inlet <b>22</b> via a needle valve <b>32</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">a pilot valve (not shown) being formed in between the second pressure chamber <b>31</b> and the outlet <b>23</b> for opening and closing a gas flow path (not shown);</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">a third pressure chamber <b>35</b> partitioned by the third diaphragm <b>34</b>, and to which the isolating-gas is supplied via the control pipe (pressure-sensitive pipe) <b>7</b> from the gas-tight tank <b>1</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">a connecting pipe <b>36</b> connecting the third diaphragm <b>34</b> to the pilot valve, and opening the pilot valve shutting the gas flow path with the third diaphragm <b>34</b> which shifts upward corresponding to a pressure decrease in the third pressure chamber <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the configuration described above, because the isolating-gas enters the first pressure chamber <b>30</b> via the bypass <b>29</b> from the inlet <b>22</b>, and enters the second pressure chamber <b>31</b> via the needle valve <b>32</b>, when the internal gas pressure of the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> remains constant, the pressures in the first and second pressure chambers are equal. However, since an outside of the second diaphragm <b>28</b> is exposed to the outside atmosphere, a differential pressure caused by an output gas from the second diaphragm <b>28</b> acts so as to close the main valve <b>25</b>. Owing to the control pipe <b>7</b>, an internal gas pressure in the third pressure chamber <b>35</b> is equal to that in the gas-tight tank <b>1</b>. Thereby, because the internal gas pressure of the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> remains constant, the pilot valve closes the gas flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a condition described above, when the internal gas pressure of the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> is decreased, the third diaphragm <b>34</b> is pushed up, and the pilot valve opens the gas flow path via the connecting pipe <b>36</b>. Thereby, the isolating-gas in the second pressure chamber <b>31</b> is gradually exhausted to the outlet <b>23</b> and enters the gas-tight tank <b>1</b> via the downstream pipe <b>6</b>. The isolating-gas is supplied to the second pressure chamber <b>31</b> from the inlet <b>22</b>. However, since the needle valve <b>32</b> regulates an amount supplied to the second pressure chamber <b>31</b>, the internal gas pressure of the second pressure chamber <b>31</b> is gradually decreased. Thereby, the differential pressure between the first and second pressure chambers <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> gradually pushes down the main valve <b>25</b> to a lower side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Then, the communicating path <b>24</b> is opened, and the inlet <b>22</b> communicates with the outlet <b>23</b>. Resultingly, a large quantity of the isolating-gas is allowed to be supplied to the gas-tight tank <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A large liquid-storage tank is shown in the embodiments described above, however, this invention also is adopted to a small liquid-storage tank.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to a gas-regulating unit for regulating a gas pressure in a gas-tight liquid-storage tank of the present invention, an isolating-gas covers a stored-liquid surface, and an internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank is maintained at a specified level. When the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank decreases to less than a specified level by releasing the stored-liquid or fall of outside atmosphere temperature, the isolating-gas regulator senses the decrease of the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank through the control pipe, and opens a valve to supply the isolating-gas to the gas-tight tank via a downstream pipe. Thereby, the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank is maintained at a specified level.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank increases to more than a specified level by receiving the stored-liquid or fall of the outside atmosphere temperature, the main gas-exhausting unit opens a valve of the main gas-exhausting unit to exhaust a gas stored in the gas-tight tank. Thereby, the internal gas pressure in the gas-tight tank is maintained at a specified level.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Since the isolating-gas is connected directly to the main gas-exhausting unit, mounting the main gas-exhausting unit on a roof of the gas-tight tank is all that is needed to mount the isolating-gas regulator on the gas-tight tank. Therefore, it is not necessary to drill either a fitting hole for the control pipe, or a fitting hole for the downstream pipe of the isolating-gas regulator on the gas-tight tank.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Therefore, the gas-regulating unit of the present invention allows the isolating-gas regulator to be much easily mounted on the liquid-storage tank, to considerably reduce a mounting cost, and to be mounted on an existing liquid-storage tank without a heavy modification work on a roof of the existing liquid-storage tank. Further, since the isolating-gas regulator and the main gas-exhausting unit are easily disconnected from each other, the gas-regulating unit of the present invention has another effect that only the isolating-gas regulator is detached for maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Having now fully described the present invention, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth herein.</p>
