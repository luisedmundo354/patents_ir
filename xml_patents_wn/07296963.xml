<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention pertains to a method and apparatus for transporting or handling electrical components in electronic manufacturing process. Specifically, the present invention is related to tape structures and methods for using the same that increase the efficiency of electronic manufacturing processes efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One system or method of manufacturing electrical products that have electrical components is to use a tape and reels process. The carrier tape used in current tape and reel processes has a single row of apertures. Each aperture houses an electrical component. The carrier tape also has sprocket openings on each edge of the tapes. Sprockets associated with a feeder mechanism move the carrier tape to an index position where the tape presents the electrical component to a pick and place mechanism. The pick and place mechanism removes or picks the electrical component from the tape and places it on the electrical product so that it can be connected or soldered into place.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tape and reel systems have shortcomings. Among the shortcomings is that only one electrical component is presented to the pick and place mechanism after the feeder mechanism indexes the carrier tape. The current one row carrier tape solution is inefficient since only one electrical component is available for the pick and place process at each indexed position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is need for a more efficient tape and reel system that will make the electronic manufacturing process more efficient. There is also a need for a tape and reel system that will allow for faster and less costly production.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, it should be understood that such embodiments are by way of example only and merely illustrative of but a small number of the many possible specific embodiments which can represent applications of the principles of the present invention. Various changes and modifications obvious to one skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the present invention as further defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a prior art longitudinal carrier tape <b>110</b> which has small components or dies <b>126</b> fitted into a plurality of aperture cavities <b>122</b>. The longitudinal carrier tape <b>110</b> has a single row of components <b>126</b>. The longitudinal carrier tape <b>110</b> also includes a row of sprocket openings or sprocket drive holes <b>124</b> which are used to move the tape between index positions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of the prior art carrier tape <b>110</b> which includes a longitudinal punched tape <b>112</b> and a longitudinal backing tape <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the longitudinal punched tape <b>112</b> is a smooth ribbon-like film, usually made of plastic or paper. The punched tape <b>112</b> has a front side <b>138</b>, a back side <b>140</b> and a plurality of aperture cavities <b>122</b> which have a volume region. The punched tape <b>112</b> thickness is the same as the thickness “D” of the aperture cavity <b>122</b>. The length “L”, width “W” and thickness “D” of an individual aperture cavity <b>122</b> is generally dependent on the pitch “P” of the aperture cavities <b>122</b> to the sprocket drive holes <b>124</b> as well as the nature and thickness of the component to be placed within the aperture cavity <b>122</b>. As one example, the volume region of the aperture cavities <b>122</b> on a <b>2</b> mm pitch “P” can have dimensions approximately sixty (60) mils in length, by one hundred twenty-five (125) mils in width, by ten (10) mils in depth to contain components <b>126</b> as small as eight (8) to ten (10) mils square by five (5) to six (6) mils thick, in addition to larger components <b>126</b> ranging up to approximately 90% of the aperture cavity volume. Some of the normal ranges for the punched tape <b>112</b> thickness “D” and resulting aperture cavity depth is of the order of five (5) or six (6) mils at a shallow depth, and sixty (60) or seventy (70) mils for the thicker cavity material. The thickness “D” of the punched tape <b>112</b> may be greater than the thickness of the small component <b>126</b> which is to be retained, or thickness “D” of the punched tape <b>112</b> may be substantially less than the thickness of the component <b>126</b> to be retained, thereby allowing the retained component <b>126</b> to protrude above the surface of punched tape <b>112</b>, for certain automated handling and processing needs. The punched tape <b>112</b> can be made of plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The punched tape <b>112</b> can be used in high speed manufacturing processes, where a continuous reel of small components <b>126</b> are retained in the aperture cavities <b>122</b> and are sequentially indexed to a specific position or dead spot by the processing machinery. In order to feed the punched tape <b>112</b> forward, accurately indexing the punched tape <b>112</b> forward an exact distance, the punched tape <b>112</b> has sprocket drive holes <b>124</b> which engage gear teeth of a drive wheel or the probe of a lateral pawl of the processing machinery (typically, a tape feeder) and synchronizes the translation of the punched tape <b>112</b> with the action of other processing machinery such as the vacuum tip arm of a pick-and-place assembly system. The direction of forward feed is designated by an arrow “F” which the punched tape <b>112</b> moves during final assembly placement of the components <b>126</b> contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The longitudinal spacing between the longitudinal centerlines of one aperture cavity <b>122</b> to an adjacent aperture cavity <b>122</b> is shown as the pitch “P”. The pitch “P” is set to adapt to the action of a carrier tape transport mechanism, typically a tape feeder used with a pick-and-place assembly system, and is governed by the “L” and “W” dimensions of the aperture cavity required to suitably contain the component therein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a schematic view of a tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. The tape and reel machine includes a reel <b>310</b> that carries a carrier tape <b>400</b> having electrical components therein. A sprocket <b>320</b> moves the carrier tape <b>400</b> to successive index positions where a pick and place machine <b>330</b> removes electrical components from an aperture in the carrier tape <b>400</b> using a vacuum pickup <b>332</b> and places the electrical components on the electrical product, such as a circuit board <b>340</b> shown.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> are the various carrier tapes used in the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. Each carrier tape represents one of several embodiments of the present invention. Each carrier tape includes a cover tape that is removed by the tape and reel machine <b>300</b> before the electrical component on the carrier tape is picked by the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. The cover tape is typically made of a thin, transparent material such as plastic. The cover tape holds the electrical component within the aperture of the carrier tape. For the sake of clarity, the cover tape is not shown on each of the carrier tapes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>. It should be understood that these carrier tapes <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> generally include a cover tape for containing individual electronic components within apertures in the carrier tape.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a carrier tape <b>400</b> of the instant invention. The carrier tape <b>400</b> is a longitudinal punched tape in the form of a smooth, ribbon-like film, usually made of paper or plastic. The carrier tape <b>400</b> includes a plurality of aperture cavities <b>422</b> which have a specific volume. The aperture cavities occur in a first row <b>410</b> and in a second row <b>412</b>. The aperture cavities <b>422</b> hold electronic components <b>426</b>. The length “L”, width “W” and thickness “D” of an individual aperture cavity <b>422</b> is generally dependant upon the nature and thickness of the component to be placed within the aperture cavity <b>422</b>, as well as the pitch between the aperture cavities <b>422</b> and the sprocket drive holes <b>424</b>. The carrier tape <b>400</b> can be used in high speed manufacturing processes or other electronic manufacturing processes where a continuous reel of small components <b>426</b> are retained in the aperture cavities <b>422</b> and are sequentially indexed to a specific position or dead spot by the processing machinery. Specifically, the feeder mechanism of the tape and reel machine <b>300</b> moves the tape <b>400</b> using the sprocket openings <b>424</b> between the index positions. The feeder mechanism removes the covering on the tape (not shown) to expose the electrical components <b>426</b> within the apertures <b>422</b> to a pick and place machine <b>330</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The advantage of using tape <b>400</b> is that at each index position two rows of components are presented to the pick and place machine or the pick and place assembly system. Therefore, pick and place efficiency is increased by having multiple electrical components <b>426</b> available to pick and place at the same time without increasing the amount of feeders into the tape automated bonding machine <b>300</b>. Cost is reduced by reducing the number of reels or tape and reel machines <b>300</b> required to deliver the same number of components to an indexed position where the components <b>426</b> are picked from the carrier tape <b>400</b>. Thus, at each index position there are at least double the number of electrical components <b>426</b> presented to the pick and place assembly of the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. It should be noted that pick and place assembly require parts to be available in the same position at each index point, yet they do not require that one part be in the same position at each index point. In other words, a pick and place machine <b>330</b> can manage having two parts in different positions as long as the same two positions are consistent each and every time the tape <b>400</b> is indexed or the small electrical components <b>426</b> within the aperture openings <b>422</b> are presented to the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. The efficiency is also increased since the feeder mechanism does not have to index the tape <b>400</b> for each electronic component <b>426</b>. In other words, the pick and place machine indexes the tape <b>400</b> to a position to expose several of the aperture openings <b>422</b> and the electrical components <b>426</b> within those aperture openings. The pick and place machine <b>330</b> removes the parts without having to re-index the tape for each and every port. This also increases the efficiency of the tape and reel machine <b>300</b> as well as the efficiency of the electronic manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a carrier tape <b>500</b> of the instant invention. Carrier tape <b>500</b> is very similar to the carrier tape <b>400</b>. The carrier tape <b>500</b> is a smooth, ribbon-like film, usually made of paper or plastic. The longitudinal carrier tape <b>500</b> includes sprocket drive holes or sprocket openings <b>524</b> along one edge of the tape <b>500</b>. The carrier tape <b>500</b> has a thickness “D”. The carrier tape includes aperture openings <b>522</b>, which occur in a first row <b>510</b> and in a second <b>512</b>. The aperture cavities or openings <b>522</b> have a thickness “D”, a length “L”, and a width “W”. The actual length, width and thickness of an individual aperture cavity <b>522</b> is generally dependant upon the pitch of the aperture cavities <b>522</b> to the sprocket drive holes or openings <b>524</b> as well as the nature and thickness of the electrical component, which will be carried by the aperture cavity or opening <b>522</b>. The difference between tape <b>500</b> and tape <b>400</b> is that the aperture openings <b>522</b> of row <b>510</b> carry a first type of electrical component <b>526</b>, while the aperture openings or cavities <b>522</b> found in row <b>512</b> carry a second type of electrical component <b>536</b>. During electronic manufacturing processes, the carrier tape <b>500</b> can be used to deliver two types of electrical components <b>526</b> and <b>536</b> to the tape and reel machine <b>300</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, each time the tape is indexed to a specific position or dead spot by the feeder system of the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>, at least one of the first type of electrical component <b>526</b> and one of the second type of electrical component <b>536</b> are presented to the pick and place machine <b>330</b> of the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. Of course, the apertures <b>522</b> one covered by a cover tape (not shown) which is removed just prior to picking and placing the component <b>526</b>, <b>536</b>. This multi-row solution provides for increased pick and place efficiency since multiple components are available to the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for each indexed position. In addition, there is no need to have an additional feeder and an additional sprocket <b>320</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to handle an additional tape. Cost is reduced by reducing the number of reels required to deliver the same amount of components to the tape and reel machine <b>300</b>. Thus, the tape <b>500</b> provides for a much more efficient tape and reel machine <b>300</b> and for a much more efficient electric manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a carrier tape <b>600</b> of the instant invention. The carrier tape <b>600</b> includes a first edge and a second edge. The first edge includes sprocket drive openings or holes <b>624</b>. The carrier tape <b>600</b> also includes a number of individual aperture cavities <b>622</b> having a length “L”, width “W” and thickness “D”, which is generally dependant upon the pitch of the aperture cavity <b>622</b> to the sprocket drive holes or openings <b>624</b>, as well as the nature and thickness of electrical components <b>626</b>, which are carried in the aperture cavities <b>622</b>. The aperture cavities <b>622</b> are situated in a number of rows <b>610</b>, <b>612</b> and <b>618</b>. In fact, the carrier tape <b>600</b> extends the idea of having rows of apertures <b>622</b> carrying rows of electrical components <b>626</b> to any number of rows, N, as depicted by the dots between row <b>612</b> and row <b>618</b> of the carrier tape <b>600</b>. It should be noted that the electrical components carried within each row <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>618</b> may be the same electrical component or same type of electrical component, or the electrical components within the various rows can all be different.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The advantages presented by the carrier tape <b>600</b> are similar or the same to those discussed with respect to carrier tapes <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>. Namely, the advantages are that during production, the carrier tape <b>600</b> can be used or indexed to a position so that the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is able to pick and place more than one component each time the tape <b>600</b> is indexed to a dead spot or index position. This multi-row solution increases the pick and place efficiency since the pick and place device or pick and place machine <b>330</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the tape and reel machine <b>300</b> does not wait for the tape <b>600</b> to index each time a component is needed to be placed on an electrical product <b>340</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In addition, the number of carrier tapes that need to be fed into the machine are reduced, as well as reducing the number and amount of feeders into the tape and reel machine <b>300</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a carrier tape <b>700</b> of the instant invention. In this particular embodiment, the tape has a first edge <b>701</b> and a second edge <b>702</b>. The first edge <b>701</b> includes a plurality of sprocket drive openings <b>724</b>. The tape also includes aperture openings <b>722</b> and aperture openings <b>732</b>. The aperture openings <b>722</b> carry and contain electrical components <b>726</b>. Aperture openings <b>732</b> carry electrical component <b>736</b>. Electrical components <b>726</b> are different than the electrical components <b>736</b>. As shown in this particular example, there are two apertures <b>732</b> for each of the apertures <b>722</b> and, therefore, there are two electrical components <b>736</b> presented for each of the electrical components <b>726</b>. The aperture <b>722</b> occurs in a row <b>710</b> closest to the first edge <b>701</b>, and the aperture <b>732</b> occurs in a row <b>712</b> closest to the edge <b>702</b> of the carrier tape <b>700</b>. A number of the sprocket openings <b>724</b> are counted to come to an index position. The index position is a position where an aperture cavity or opening <b>722</b> and two aperture openings or cavities <b>732</b> are presented to the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the tape automated bonding machine <b>300</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The index position is shown to be a position between the dotted lines <b>740</b> and <b>742</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, at each of the index positions that are successively moved to upon with the carrier tape <b>700</b> an electrical component <b>726</b> is removed from the first row <b>710</b> while two electrical components <b>736</b> are removed from the second row <b>712</b>. It should be noted that the two components <b>736</b> may be the same or they may be different at each indexed position. In this particular embodiment, it should be noted that at each of the indexed positions, each of the electrical components <b>726</b> and <b>736</b> are repeatedly placed in the same X, Y, and Z position for the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In other words, the same positioning is repeated each time the carrier tape <b>700</b> is indexed to a new index position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The advantages of this particular tape are that the tape <b>700</b> can be provided with specific components necessary to build a particular electrical product such as populating a particular circuit board <b>340</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Advantageously, the efficiency of the pick and place process is increased since additional feeder tapes or additional tapes do not have to be fed into the tape automated bonding machine. In addition, the pick and place machine or assembly <b>330</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) does not have to wait for each and every component to be indexed on a separate carrier tape in order to pick the particular component from the carrier tape. In other words, in this particular embodiment three components can be picked and placed per indexed position before the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) will have to wait for the carrier tape <b>700</b> to be re-indexed. Of course, it should be noted that this particular idea can be further extended to include more rows beyond those rows <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a carrier tape <b>800</b> of the instant invention. The carrier tape <b>800</b> includes a first edge <b>801</b> and a second edge <b>802</b>. Along the first edge there are sprocket drive openings or holes <b>824</b>. Sprocket drive openings <b>824</b> are used to move the tape <b>800</b> to various index positions. One index position is shown between the lines <b>840</b> and <b>842</b>, and another index position is shown between lines <b>842</b> and <b>844</b>. The carrier tape <b>800</b> includes aperture cavities or openings <b>822</b> and <b>852</b>, which occur in a first row <b>810</b>. The carrier tape also includes aperture openings <b>832</b> and <b>862</b>, which occur in a second row <b>812</b>. The aperture opening <b>822</b> carries an electrical component <b>826</b>, while the aperture opening <b>852</b> carries an electrical component <b>856</b>. The aperture openings <b>832</b> carry two different types of electrical components <b>836</b> and <b>837</b>. Each of the aperture openings <b>862</b> carries an electrical component <b>866</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, at the indexed position between lines <b>840</b> and <b>842</b>, there is one aperture opening <b>822</b> for two aperture openings <b>832</b> so that at the index position between the lines <b>840</b> and <b>842</b>, an electrical component <b>826</b> will be presented in aperture opening <b>822</b>, and an electrical component <b>836</b> will be presented in aperture opening <b>832</b>, and a different electrical component will be presented in the other occurrence of the aperture opening <b>832</b> between the dotted lines <b>840</b> and <b>842</b>. Upon re-indexing the tape, the aperture opening <b>852</b> and aperture openings <b>862</b> will be presented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is one aperture opening <b>852</b> and three instances of the aperture opening <b>862</b>. Thus, one electrical component <b>856</b> is presented while three electrical components <b>866</b> are presented in each of the aperture openings <b>862</b>. The second index position is between the lines <b>842</b> and <b>844</b>. Thus, the idea here is that for each index position the same electrical components need not be delivered. Of course, there will need to be a repeating pattern of the electrical component for a given number of index positions along the tape <b>800</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, this pattern of two index positions with different components would be repeated over and over so that the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be programmed so that at a first index position the pick and place machine accesses the electrical components <b>826</b>, <b>836</b>, and <b>837</b>, and at a second index position the pick and place machine <b>330</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) accesses electrical components <b>856</b> and the three electrical components <b>866</b>. The benefits of this are numerous. The number of feeder tapes that need to be put into a pick and place machine <b>330</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be further reduced. The tapes can be custom made to populate or produce particular electrical products <b>340</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The number of rows can be extended also beyond rows <b>810</b> and <b>812</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which further increases the pick and place efficiency since the pick and place machine will be able to do the pick and placing without having to wait for re-indexing of the tape.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a method for assembling an electrical product using a pick and place machine and using the tapes for <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b> and <b>800</b> of the instant invention. The initial step is to index the carrier tape, as depicted by reference numeral <b>910</b>. Once the carrier tape is in an index position, the pick and place machine removes the first electrical component from the carrier tape and places it on to an electrical product, as depicted by reference numeral <b>912</b>. The next step is to remove a second electrical component from the carrier tape while in the same index position, as depicted by reference numeral <b>914</b>. Of course, part of removing the first and second electrical components includes removing the cover tape covering the apertures of the carrier tape. The pick and place machine will then place the second electrical component onto the electrical product while the carrier tape is moved to the next index position, as depicted by reference numeral <b>916</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment for assembly of an electrical product using at least two pick and place machines. The first step is to index the carrier tape, as depicted by reference numeral <b>1010</b>. The next step is to remove a first electrical component from the carrier tape using a first pick and place device as depicted by reference numeral <b>1012</b>. The next step is to remove a second electrical component with a second pick and place device, as depicted by reference numeral <b>1014</b>. Of course, part of removing the first and second electrical components includes removing the cover tape covering the apertures of the carrier tape. Finally, the carrier tape is moved to the next index position, as depicted by reference numeral <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be noted that one carrier tape could be used to feed two pick and place machines and to build two electrical products. For example, two circuit boards could be built substantially simultaneously from the same tape. A further extension of this invention is that a single carrier tape could be provided with many of the components needed for a particular electrical product or a particular circuit board. The first pick and place machine could populate one side of the circuit board, and the second pick and place machine could populate a second side or area of the circuit board so that the pick and place machines would not interfere with one another during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The structures shown and described in the above figures and the methods discussed for making these structures provides many advantages. Using the inventive carrier tapes and methods described, tape and reel machines and the associated processes provide for a more efficient electronic manufacturing systems. The carrier tapes present more than one electrical component to the pick and place machine when the carrier tape stops at a particular index point. This makes the tape and reel machine is made more efficient at delivering electrical components and allows for faster and less costly production.</p>
