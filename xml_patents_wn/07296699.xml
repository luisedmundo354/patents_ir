<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(a) Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to display racks that are to be assembled on the field, and more particularly to a flexible, highly efficient, and easy to assemble display rack structure used in show room or exhibition hall.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many businesses in their show rooms and/or exhibition halls use temporary structures such as display racks and/or frames for their mobility and functionality. These structures are designed for easy assembly to achieve flexibility and convenience in transportation and storage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most of these designs use a few basic types of beams that can be put together easily. To obtain the necessary strength of the finished structure, the construction is usually consisted of two or more main beams connected with several connecting or supporting beams in between. The disadvantages of prior arts are:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">First, traditionally these supporting beams are welded together. Although welding makes a strong connection, the bulky structure makes them difficult to transport and store.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Secondly, to meet different configuration and strength requirements, many types and sizes of beams are needed resulting in cumbersome stocking and material management operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thirdly, to avoid the problems created by welding connection, some manufacturers also provide screws and bolts type of connections which use ball-shaped connectors to put together extension beams. This type of structure has the advantage of easy assembly but at the expense of labor extensive and time consuming operations in the field. Again, it has the disadvantage of stocking many types of beams to meet different configuration requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Fourthly, on top of these, the prior arts use screws and press-fit gadgets to fasten face-plates for marking and description of goods displayed onto the displaying racks. These steps are also labor extensive and time consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is indeed a need for simplified structure that can provide flexible rack configuration, convenient assembling method, and easy attachment of accessories such as face-plates. This invention offers an innovated design meets all these desired features.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide an improved structure of assembled display rack construction. In this invention, the main mechanical structure comprises two or more main beams with pre-defined length, embedded connecting sockets movable vertically on the main beam, diagonal support beams to be installed on the main beams using the connecting sockets, and other required accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The main design feature of this invention is that the connecting socket has U-shaped slots formed by built-in parallel flanges for installation of the diagonal support beams and face-plates required.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">From the description of the mechanical structure and associated operational characteristics, the present innovative design provides flexibility in the number of and space between main beams as well as means of adding support beams and face-plates. This invention has the additional advantage of adding extension sockets at the end of each main beam, so the structure can be repeated to fill the required space and display need.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood from a careful reading of a detailed description provided herein below with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing object and summary provide only a brief introduction to the present invention. To fully appreciate these and other objects of the present invention as well as the invention itself, all of which will become apparent to those skilled in the art, the following detailed description of the invention and the claims should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Throughout the specification and drawings identical reference numerals refer to identical or similar parts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Many other advantages and features of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying sheets of drawings in which a preferred structural embodiment incorporating the principles of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

The embodiment of the present invention comprises main beams <b>101</b>, connecting sockets <b>201</b>, and diagonal support beams <b>301</b>. The embodiment will take at least two main beams which are shallow cylinder with pre-defined length, several connecting sockets, and a number of diagonal support beams as required. The diagonal support beam <b>301</b> is a set of two beams fastened at the center using a pivotal connection, so the two beams can be in either an open or a close configuration. The connecting socket <b>201</b> has an insertion hole <b>202</b> in the center of its body, so the main beam <b>101</b> can be put trough the insertion hole, and the socket <b>201</b> can be moved vertically along the main beam <b>101</b> for the suitable location. The connecting socket <b>201</b> also has a fastening hole <b>203</b> used to attach the connecting socket <b>201</b> firmly at the desired location on the main beam. The connecting socket <b>201</b> is provided with three fins <b>204</b> at one side to form two slots <b>205</b> and a plurality of fins <b>204</b> at an adjacent side to form two slots <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show how the diagonal support beams <b>301</b> are installed on the flanges with the fastening bolt <b>302</b> inside the slot <b>205</b>. The main beams <b>101</b> are inserted into the connecting socket <b>201</b> and fastened with blind rivets <b>206</b>. This completes the basic structure of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> demonstrate the assembled main beams <b>101</b> can be put in a closed narrow structure as a result of the pivotal connecting construction of the diagonal support beams <b>301</b> for transportation and storage. In actual application, the user can open the two diagonal support beams <b>301</b> to place the main beams <b>101</b> at desired spacing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, user can add the basic constructions in both horizontal and vertical direction with fastening bolt <b>102</b> and threaded insert <b>103</b> attached to the end of the main beam <b>101</b>. Or as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the main beam <b>101</b> can also be added in desired angle using a ball-shaped extension socket <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, fins <b>204</b> and slots <b>205</b> on connecting sockets <b>201</b> can accommodate installation of several sets of the diagonal support beams <b>301</b> on one main beam <b>101</b>, thereby increasing the strength of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flexibility of this new embodiment described herein offers triangular as well as rectangular shaped construction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> respectively.</p>
