<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to an antenna structure for operating multi-band system, and more particularly relates to a circuit board having a hole for fixing the antenna structure, and further comprising radiation metal wires to correspond with outer spaces for bending suitably.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The role of antennas in wireless communication devices is to transmit and to receive data of wireless system. General speaking, the antenna design in mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistances (PDA) can be a traditional planner antenna or a monopole antenna and further can be a helical antenna, However, the planner antenna uses a base having dielectric constants for supporting that does not only increase cost but also increases complexity. The radiation bandwidth of the planner antenna is not better than the monopole antenna. The monopole antenna takes a characteristic with Omni-Directional Radiation Pattern. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a distribution diagram of an example of omni-directional radiation pattern of a prior art monopole antenna is illustrated. The helical antenna is an uncovered structure that suffers damages easily.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a schematic diagram of an example of a prior art helical antenna is illustrated. The helical antenna comprises a helical antenna <b>21</b>, a feed point <b>22</b>, and a feed wire <b>23</b>. The helical antenna is used to transmit and to receive signal in a single band. The feed wire <b>23</b> provides a feed point <b>22</b> for coupling the helical antenna <b>21</b>. Due to the characteristics of mentioned above, there must be a case for containing the monopole antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because of the frequency sections are opened gradually, wireless communication devices start to do receiving integration in different frequency sections. The integration development of the antenna is used to receive wireless signal of different frequency sections and is an application of the wideband antenna. Therefore, the monopole antennas of two different frequency sections are integrated into a wideband antenna that appears in the wireless communication field. Furthermore, there is also a module design for antenna carrier support.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a schematic diagram of an example of an antenna carrier support of a prior art wideband antenna is illustrated. The wideband of the antenna carrier support comprises an antenna base <b>31</b>, a feed point <b>32</b> a low frequency radiation metal wire <b>33</b>, and a high frequency radiation metal wire <b>34</b>. The antenna base <b>31</b> is used to support the wideband antenna that comprises the low frequency radiation metal wire <b>33</b> and the high frequency radiation metal wire <b>34</b>. The antenna base <b>31</b> also provides a feed point <b>32</b> to couple to the wideband antenna and still has capacity to accept other components. However, the characteristics of mentioned above increase complexity of wireless communication devices and raises costs. There must be some ways to resolve the problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an antenna structure for operating multi-band system. The antenna structure is applied on a base having at least one hole. The antenna structure comprises at least one feed wire that is set on the base to form a feed point and at least one radiation metal wire that is embedded the hole. The radiation metal wire has a feed terminal for coupling the feed point. The radiation metal wire further has a ground surface that is set on the base and couples to an outer ground conductor of the feed wire. The feed wire covered by the outer ground conductor is a feed coaxial transport wire. The base can be a circuit board that is composed by any form. The hole can be set on the border of the base or into the inside of the base. The radiation metal wire has a first radiation metal wire and a second radiation metal wire. The feed terminal of the first radiation metal wire couples to the feed point. The second radiation metal wire has a start terminal for coupling the first radiation metal wire near the feed terminal. The radiation metal wire does not touch with the base except the feed terminal and a touch point is embedded into the hole. The radiation metal wire is to extend and to bend freely according to a space formed by a case. In addition, the length of the first radiation metal wire is bigger than the second radiation metal wire that has a certain length for corresponding with a first operating band in order to receive or send the signal of the first operating band. The second radiation metal wire is smaller than the first radiation metal wire that has a certain length for corresponding with a second operating band in order to receive or send the signal of the second operating band. The first operating band can be a low frequency operating band and the second operating band can be a high frequency operating band.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To make it easier for our examiner to understand the objective of the invention, its innovative features and performance, a detailed description and technical characteristics of the present invention are described together with the drawings as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a lateral view and a vertical view of examples of an antenna structure for operating multi-band system according to embodiments of the present invention are illustrated. The antenna structure for operating multi-band system comprises a circuit board <b>41</b>, a first radiation metal wire <b>42</b>, a second radiation metal wire <b>43</b>, a feed coaxial transport wire <b>44</b>, and a ground surface <b>45</b>. The border of the circuit board <b>41</b> has at least one hole <b>411</b> for embedding the first radiation metal wire <b>42</b> and the first radiation metal wire <b>42</b> couples to the feed point <b>441</b> provided by the feed coaxial transport wire <b>44</b>. The feed coaxial transport wire <b>44</b> is composed of the feed wire covering the outer ground conductor. The second radiation metal wire <b>43</b> couples to the first radiation metal wire <b>42</b> near the feed point <b>441</b>. In addition, the ground surface <b>45</b> is set on the circuit board <b>41</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first radiation metal wire <b>42</b> and the second radiation metal wire <b>43</b> does not touch the circuit board <b>41</b> except fixing into the hole <b>411</b> and coupling to the feed point <b>441</b>. The end of both radiation metal wires <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> extend to the same side. The first radiation metal wire <b>42</b> is to receive and to transmit the low frequency operating band of the first operating band, such as 824-960 MHz. The second radiation metal wire <b>43</b> is to receive and to send the high frequency operating band of the second operating band, such as 1710-2170 MHz. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an experiment result of a return loss and a voltage standing wave ratio of an antenna structure for operating multi-band system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The curve of point <b>61</b> to point <b>62</b> is the low frequency operating band 824 MHz-960 MHz and the curve of point <b>63</b> to point <b>64</b> is the high frequency operating band 1710 MHz-2170 MHz. Therefore, the antenna band can cover four bands of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) and the band of WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) (824-960 MHz, 1710-2170 MHz). Moreover, the high frequency band can be reached 460 MHz and return loss observation in the low frequency operating band and the high frequency operating band has a better gain of antenna radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a structural drawing of an example of an antenna structure for operating multi-band system according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The first radiation metal wire <b>71</b> is to extend from different directions from shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The extended result will take the tail of the first radiation metal wire <b>71</b> and the tail of the second radiation metal wire <b>43</b> to set at different sides.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another structural drawing of an example of an antenna structure for operating multi-band system according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The circuit board <b>41</b> is set into a space of a case <b>84</b> and there is at least one hole <b>83</b> that is set into the circuit board <b>41</b> for fixing the first radiation metal wire <b>81</b>. The first radiation metal wire <b>81</b> and the second radiation metal wire <b>82</b> are to extend according to the space provided by the case <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As mentioned above, the antenna structure uses a monopole antenna for setting structure and is hided into the case. Therefore, the advantage of the invention is to satisfy the characteristics with wideband monopole antennas and omni-directional radiation pattern. The invention also overcomes the drawback with the uncovered structure. The invention of the antenna structure has a better gain of antenna radiation in the low frequency operating band 824 MHz-960 MHz and the high frequency operating band 1710 MHz-2170 MHz. In the apparatus characteristics, the invention uses a radiation metal wire to be a main body and uses the hole of the circuit board to fix the antenna. The design decreases complexity in the antenna module structure and the antenna is bent by metal wires without antenna carrier supports. The characteristics increase the capabilities of production and reduce cost. Another advantage of the invention is that the antenna structure can be set any shape of cases. In other words, the antenna structure can be bent freely according to any shape of cases.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In summation of the description above, the present invention is novel and useful and definite enhances the performance over the conventional structure and further complies with the patent application requirements and is submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office for review and granting of the commensurate patent rights.</p>
