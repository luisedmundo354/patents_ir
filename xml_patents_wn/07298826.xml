<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an X-ray generator for irradiating a target with an electron beam to generate X-rays.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The inspection device which irradiates an object to be inspected with X-rays and taking an image of the X-rays transmitted through the object has been known previously. An X-ray generator can be used as an X-ray source for such an inspection device. The X-ray generator generates X-rays by irradiating a target with an electron beam. The X-ray dosage varies according to the acceleration voltage applied to the electron beam, the current value of the electron beam or the like, as well as according to the damage of the target, the thermal deformation of the target supporting member, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In response to the variation of the dosage of the X-rays applied to an object to be inspected varies, the image of the X-rays transmitted through the object changes. In such a case, it cannot be distinguished whether this change is due to characteristics of the object or due to change in the applied X-rays, and thus the object cannot be inspected precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to overcome this difficulty, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. S55-124997 discloses an X-ray generator which monitors the dosage of X-rays emitted from an exit window of an X-ray tube using a semiconductor X-ray detector and keeps the X-ray dosage constant by the feedback of the output of the detector.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, inspections of electronic parts and other compact, high-density objects by means of X-rays have come to be carried out, and in accompaniment, the obtaining of X-ray images of high magnification has come to be desired. However, with the X-ray generator of Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. S55-124997, though the variation of the X-ray dosage can be reduced, it is difficult to obtain X-ray images of high magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of overcoming such a difficulty, it is an object of the present invention to provide an X-ray generator capable of keeping the X-ray dosage constant and acquiring X-ray images of high magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An X-ray generator in accordance with the present invention comprises: an electron gun emitting an electron beam; an X-ray generating target positioned so that the electron beam from the electron gun is incident thereon; a first exit window transmitting an X-ray emitted from the target in response to the incidence of the electron beam; and an X-ray monitor receiving another X-ray from the target to monitor a state of the other X-ray. The X-ray monitor is positioned off the path on which the X-ray transmitted through the first exit window travels.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the state of the X-ray is monitored in real time by the X-ray monitor, it is possible to maintain the X-ray in a constant state. Since the X-ray monitor is positioned off the path on which the X-ray transmitted through the first exit window, the X-ray monitor is unlikely to obstruct the approach of an object to be inspected to the first exit window in irradiating the object with the X-ray from the first exit window. Consequently it is possible to bring the object close to the first exit window to acquire X-ray images of high magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first exit window has an exit surface from which the X-ray from the target is emitted. The X-ray monitor is positioned so as not to protrude beyond the exit surface. This makes easier to bring the object to be inspected close to the first exit window.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The X-ray generator may further comprise a second exit window transmitting the other X-ray from the target. The second exit window is positioned on an X-ray path different from an X-ray path extending from the target to the first exit window. The X-ray monitor receives the other X-ray transmitted through the second exit window. The X-ray monitor receives the other X-ray with higher intensity in comparison to the case where the X-ray monitor receives the other X-ray transmitted through a wall of a housing or other obstruction, thereby improving the monitoring precision of the other X-ray.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The second exit window is preferably positioned so as to face a portion of a surface of the target on which the electron beam is incident. Since X-rays are generated strongly at the electron beam incidence portion and vicinity thereof of the target, the X-rays enter the X-ray monitor efficiently from the second exit window positioned so as to face the portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second exit window may be a stem plate holding a terminal of the electron gun and through which the terminal extends. The X-ray generator in accordance with this invention may, for example, be manufactured using an X-ray tube that includes an electron gun and a target. In an X-ray tube, a stem plate, such as that described above, is often installed to electrically couple an electron gun to a driver for the electron gun. The stem plate may be formed of a material that sufficiently transmits X-rays such as insulating ceramic. Using the stem plate as the second exit window for transmitting the other X-ray makes it possible to manufacture the X-ray generator of this invention without greatly modifying an existing X-ray tube with the stem plate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A shutter able to block the X-ray may be installed between the second exit window and the X-ray monitor. By blocking the X-ray using the shutter when it is not necessary to control the state of the X-ray, such as immediately after starting the generation of the X-ray, the X-ray exposure of the X-ray monitor can be prevented to extend the lifetime of the X-ray monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The X-ray generator may further comprise a housing in which the electron gun, first exit window, target, and X-ray monitor are installed. In this case, the structure of the X-ray generator can be simplified and installation of the X-ray generator becomes easier.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electron gun, the X-ray monitor and the portion of the surface of the target onto which the electron beam is incident may be housed in an enclosure capable of being maintained under vacuum. In this case, the control of the temperature, humidity, etc., of the X-ray monitor is facilitated. The X-ray monitoring precision can thus be improved further. The X-ray monitor may be installed in the enclosure so as to face the part of the surface of the target on which the electron beam is incident. Since the X-ray is generated strongly at the electron beam incidence portion and vicinity thereof of the target, the X-ray efficiently enters the X-ray monitor from the second exit window positioned so as to face the portion. The X-ray monitoring precision can thereby be improved further.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The X-ray generator may further comprise an X-ray state controller to maintain the X-ray generated from said target in a constant state, such as constant dosage of the X-ray, based on the state of the other X-ray monitored by the X-ray monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This invention will be made adequately clear by way of the detailed description that follows and the attached drawings. The attached drawings are simply illustrations of examples. This invention will thus not be considered as being restricted by the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further range of application of this invention will become clear from the detailed description that follows. Though this detailed description and the specific examples illustrate preferred embodiments of this invention, these are simply examples since various modifications and changes within the gist and scope of this invention will become clear to those skilled in the art from the detailed description.</p>

Trunk part <b>21</b><i>a </i>and electron gun housing cylinder <b>21</b><i>b </i>are in communication with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A ceramic stem plate <b>24</b> is installed at the end of electron gun housing cylinder <b>21</b><i>b </i>at the side away from the trunk part <b>21</b><i>a</i>. As will be described later, stem plate <b>24</b> allows the transmission of the X-rays emitted from target <b>27</b>. In electron gun housing cylinder <b>21</b><i>b</i>, an electron gun <b>23</b> which emits an electron beam substantially horizontally towards the central axis of trunk part <b>21</b> is installed. Electron gun <b>23</b> is supported by a stem pin <b>25</b> held by stem plate <b>24</b> while extending through stem plate <b>24</b>. Stem pin <b>25</b> is a terminal for supplying the driving power for electron gun <b>23</b>. Stem pin <b>25</b> is electrically coupled to an electrode, filament, etc., inside electron gun <b>23</b> and is electrically coupled to current and voltage controller <b>40</b>. Current and voltage controller <b>40</b> supplies the predetermined current and voltage to electron gun <b>23</b> via stem pin <b>25</b> to drive electron gun <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lower part of enclosure <b>20</b> is a valve <b>22</b> which is formed of glass, ceramic, or other electric insulator. Valve <b>22</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape that is coaxial to trunk part <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and is connected to trunk part <b>21</b><i>a</i>. An electrically conductive target support <b>26</b> of substantially cylindrical form is inserted in valve <b>22</b> along the central axis of valve <b>22</b> from the lower end of valve <b>22</b>. Target support <b>26</b> extends to the vicinity of the upper end of trunk part <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A portion of target support <b>26</b> at its upper end on which the electron beam from electron gun <b>23</b> is incident and the surroundings of this portion form a surface inclined downward and facing electron gun <b>23</b>. Reflection type target <b>27</b>, formed of tungsten, etc., is installed on this inclined surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Target <b>27</b> is electrically coupled to current and voltage controller <b>40</b> via target support <b>26</b>. The predetermined voltage which is positive relative to electron gun <b>23</b> is applied to target <b>27</b> from control device <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A first exit window <b>31</b> is disposed on a part of the upper wall of trunk part <b>21</b><i>a </i>that faces target <b>27</b>. The X-rays generated from target <b>27</b> are transmitted through first exit window <b>31</b> and emitted upward out of vacuum enclosure <b>20</b>. Hereinafter, the upper surface of first exit window <b>31</b> from which the X-rays are emitted will be referred to as “X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a.”</i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, X-ray generator <b>100</b> has X-ray monitor <b>30</b> for monitoring the dosage of the X-rays generated from target <b>27</b>. X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is installed outside vacuum enclosure <b>20</b> and opposes stem plate <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is positioned off the path on which the X-rays emitted through first exit window <b>31</b> travel, and is positioned so as not to protrude beyond X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>. The upper surface of X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is placed below X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>, that is, at the side of target <b>27</b> from X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>. X-ray monitor <b>30</b> detects the X-rays transmitted through stem plate <b>24</b> from target <b>27</b> and measures the dosage of these X-rays in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">X-ray generator <b>100</b> further includes an X-ray dosage controller <b>41</b>. X-ray dosage controller <b>41</b> is for controlling the state of the X-rays. X-ray dosage controller <b>41</b> controls current and voltage controller <b>40</b> so that the dosage of the X-rays generated from target <b>27</b> is constant. More specifically, controller <b>41</b> regulates the setting values of the voltage and current which current and voltage controller <b>40</b> applies to target <b>27</b> and electron gun <b>23</b> to make the X-ray dosage constant based on the X-ray dosage measured by X-ray monitor <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">X-ray tube <b>10</b>, current and voltage controller <b>40</b>, X-ray dosage controller <b>41</b>, and X-ray monitor <b>30</b> are all installed inside a housing <b>4</b> so as to simplify the structure of X-ray generator <b>100</b> and reduce the installation cost.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The operations and merits of non-destructive inspection system <b>80</b> and X-ray generator <b>100</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the predetermined current and voltage are applied to electron gun <b>23</b> and target <b>27</b> in X-ray tube <b>10</b> by current and voltage controller <b>40</b>, an electron beam is emitted from electron gun <b>23</b>. The electron beam is incident on target <b>27</b> to generate X-rays. Meanwhile, the desired object <b>5</b> to be inspected is placed on stage <b>2</b> and then stage <b>2</b> is moved so that the object <b>5</b> opposes first exit window <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The X-rays emitted from target <b>27</b> are transmitted through first exit window <b>31</b> in a direction that is rotated by substantially 90° with respect to the traveling direction of the electron beam and then transmitted through moving stage <b>2</b> and object <b>5</b>. The transmitted X-rays are detected by X-ray camera <b>1</b> and an X-ray image is taken. By visual inspection of this X-ray image or by application of a binarization process or other image processing on the X-ray image, non-destructive inspection of object <b>5</b> is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present embodiment, the dosage of the X-rays generated from target <b>27</b> is monitored in real time by X-ray monitor <b>30</b>. Based on the dosage monitored by monitor <b>30</b>, X-ray dosage controller <b>41</b> controls current and voltage controller <b>40</b> so that the dosage of the X-rays generated from target <b>27</b> is constant. As a result, even if the dosage of the X-rays generated from target <b>27</b> varies due to thermal expansion of target support <b>26</b> caused by the heat generation of target <b>27</b>, damage of the surface of target <b>27</b> by electron beam irradiation, an unpredicted variation of current or voltage, etc., this variation will be immediately feedback corrected. Hence, the dosage of the X-rays illuminated from the first exit window <b>31</b> to object <b>5</b> is made constant. Correspondingly, the background of the X-ray image that is acquired by X-ray camera <b>1</b> becomes substantially constant. Visual inspection based on this X-ray image can thus be carried out favorably. Also, in the case where inspection is carried out upon image processing the X-ray image, the setting of an optimal threshold value, etc., is facilitated. In either case, non-destructive inspection using an X-ray image can be carried out advantageously.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is positioned so as not to protrude beyond X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> will not obstruct moving stage <b>2</b> and object <b>5</b>, which oppose X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>, from approaching X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>. This enables moving stage <b>2</b> and object <b>5</b> to be positioned close to X-ray exit surface <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Hence X-ray images of high magnification can be acquired using X-ray camera <b>1</b>. This is especially beneficial for non-destructive inspection of electronic components or other compact, high-density objects.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present embodiment, a so-called reflection type X-ray tube <b>10</b> is used. Reflection type X-ray tube <b>10</b> normally has stem plate <b>24</b> which holds stem pin <b>25</b> for supplying electric power from the outside to electron gun <b>23</b> inside X-ray tube <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, stem plate <b>24</b> is positioned on an X-ray path that differs from the X-ray path directed from target <b>27</b> to first exit window <b>31</b>. In the present embodiment, stem plate <b>24</b> is used as a second exit window for transmitting the monitoring X-rays. Consequently, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> can detect X-rays at higher intensity than in the case where the X-rays from target <b>27</b> are received upon passage through a wall of housing <b>4</b> or other obstacle. This improves the precision of the X-ray monitoring. Further, X-ray generator <b>100</b> of this embodiment can be manufactured without modifying a conventional X-ray tube.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An X-ray generator <b>200</b> of the second embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. X-ray generator <b>200</b> differs from X-ray generator <b>100</b> of the first embodiment in having an X-ray tube <b>11</b> in place of X-ray tube <b>10</b>. X-ray tube <b>11</b> has a second exit window <b>50</b> for transmitting X-rays from reflection type target <b>27</b> to the outside. Accordingly, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> does not oppose stem plate <b>24</b> but opposes second exit window <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Second exit window <b>50</b> is formed of Be or other substance with high X-ray transmittance and is fitted into a side wall of trunk part <b>21</b><i>a </i>of vacuum enclosure <b>20</b>. The position of second exit window <b>50</b> is not restricted in particular; however, it is preferably installed at a position that faces the portion of the surface of target <b>27</b> on which the electron beam is incident so that X-rays with adequate intensity emerges through it.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A preferable arrangement of second exit window <b>50</b> and X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is shown specifically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is preferably located at a position where the angle formed by a straight line <b>61</b> extending between target <b>27</b> and electron gun <b>23</b> and a straight line <b>62</b> extending between target <b>27</b> and X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is in the range of ±90° when X-ray tube <b>11</b> is viewed from above. Second exit window <b>50</b> is preferably located at a position where straight line <b>62</b> passes when straight line <b>62</b> is positioned within ±90° from straight line <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In X-ray generator <b>200</b>, X-rays emitted from target <b>27</b> pass through second exit window <b>50</b> and enters X-ray monitor <b>30</b> with intensity greater than or equivalent to the intensity of the X-rays emitted through stem plate <b>24</b> in the first embodiment. X-ray monitor <b>30</b> can thus monitor the state of the X-rays at high precision in the present embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">THIRD EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An X-ray generator <b>300</b> of the third embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. X-ray generator <b>300</b> differs from the second embodiment in having a transmission type X-ray tube <b>12</b> in place of reflection type X-ray tube <b>11</b>. X-ray tube <b>12</b> has, in place of reflection type target <b>27</b> and first exit window <b>31</b> in X-ray tube <b>11</b>, a transmission type target <b>60</b> which is fitted into the upper wall of trunk part <b>21</b><i>a </i>in substantially horizontal arrangement. Transmission type target <b>60</b> acts as both target <b>27</b> and first exit window <b>31</b> in the second embodiment. The upper surface of target <b>60</b> is an X-ray exit surface <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the lower surface is an electron beam incidence surface <b>60</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Correspondingly, electron gun <b>23</b> is positioned below target <b>60</b> in the interior of trunk part <b>21</b><i>a </i>and is installed so as to emit an electron beam upward towards electron beam incidence surface <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Second exit window <b>50</b> is installed in the side wall of trunk part <b>21</b><i>a </i>so as to face electron beam incidence surface <b>60</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In X-ray generator <b>300</b>, the electron beam emitted from electron gun <b>23</b> enters electron beam incidence surface <b>60</b><i>b </i>of target <b>60</b>. The X-rays generated from target <b>60</b> are emitted from X-ray exit surface <b>60</b><i>a</i>. Also, part of the X-rays generated from target <b>60</b> is transmitted through second exit window <b>50</b> to enter X-ray monitor <b>30</b>. The dosage of the X-rays is thereby detected. Hence X-ray generator <b>300</b> with the transmission type X-ray tube <b>12</b> provides the same merits as those of the second embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">FOURTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An X-ray generator <b>400</b> of the fourth embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. X-ray generator <b>400</b> differs from the second and third embodiments in equipping a shutter <b>70</b> between second exit window <b>50</b> and X-ray monitor <b>30</b>. Shutter <b>70</b> can block, as necessary, the X-rays emitted from second exit window <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">By closing shutter <b>70</b> immediately after the start of generation of X-rays and other times where the control of the X-ray dosage is not required, X-rays can be blocked and prevented from entering X-ray monitor <b>30</b>. This prevents the exposure of X-ray monitor <b>30</b> to extend the lifetime of X-ray monitor <b>30</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">FIFTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An X-ray generator <b>500</b> of the fifth embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. X-ray generator <b>500</b> differs from the third and fourth embodiments in having an open enclosure <b>101</b> in place of vacuum enclosure <b>20</b> which is sealed in a vacuum state. Open enclosure <b>101</b> houses electronic beam incidence surface <b>60</b><i>b </i>of transmission type target <b>60</b>. The interior of open enclosure <b>101</b> may be put into a vacuum state or be opened under atmospheric pressure as necessary. Open enclosure <b>101</b> is made, for example, of stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Correspondingly, X-ray generator <b>500</b> has an exhaust pump <b>102</b> and a coil <b>103</b>. Exhaust pump <b>102</b> exhausts gases in order to maintain the interior of open enclosure <b>101</b> in the vacuum state during the X-ray irradiation. Coil <b>103</b> surrounds, in an annular manner, the path of the electron beam directed from electron gun <b>23</b> to target <b>60</b>, thereby adjusting the focus of the electron beam. In such a so-called open type X-ray generator, electron gun <b>23</b> and transmission type target <b>60</b> inside the generator can be exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">X-ray generator <b>500</b> also differs from the third and fourth embodiments in that X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is housed inside enclosure <b>101</b>. X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is preferably installed at a position facing electron beam incidence surface <b>60</b><i>b </i>of transmission type target <b>60</b> in the present embodiment as well.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">X-ray generator <b>500</b> provides the same merits as the above-described embodiments. In addition, in X-ray generator <b>500</b>, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is housed inside open enclosure <b>101</b> and X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is thus exposed to a vacuum atmosphere during the X-ray irradiation. This facilitates the control of the temperature, humidity, etc., of the X-ray monitor and improves the precision of monitoring the state of the X-rays by the X-ray monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The X-ray generator in accordance with the present invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments and may take on various modified forms.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the above-described embodiments, X-ray dosage controller <b>41</b> controls the output current and output voltage of current and voltage controller <b>40</b> so that the X-ray dosage is constant. However, for example, if the X-ray dosage decreases below a certain level, the controller may judge the target have reached its lifetime and deflect the electron beam so as to irradiate another portion of the target and recover the X-ray dosage to be constant. Also, the controller may automatically exchange the target.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the above-described embodiments, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> monitors the state of the X-rays based on the X-ray dosage. However, another characteristic of the X-rays may be monitored instead. For example, in a case where a composite target containing a plurality of types of materials is employed to generate X-rays having different wavelengths, the wavelengths of the X-rays may be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the first embodiment, stem plate <b>24</b> is made of ceramic. However, it is sufficient that stem plate <b>24</b> be made of a material that is electrically insulating and transmits X-rays sufficiently. Glass may be cited as an example of such a material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the second to fourth embodiments, in order to direct the X-rays generated at target <b>27</b> or <b>60</b> appropriately to X-ray monitor <b>30</b>, second exit window <b>50</b> is positioned so as to face the portion of the surface of target <b>27</b> or <b>60</b> on which the electron beam is incident. However, if the X-rays emitted from reflection type target <b>27</b> are sufficiently intense, second exit window <b>50</b> may be disposed at another position.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the first to fourth embodiments, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> may be installed inside vacuum enclosure <b>20</b> if X-ray tube <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, or <b>12</b> is large, for example. In this case, as in the fifth embodiment, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is preferably installed so as to face the electron beam incidence surface of the target. In the fifth embodiment, X-ray monitor <b>30</b> may be positioned outside open enclosure <b>101</b> and receive the X-rays through the second exit window provided on open enclosure <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the first to fourth embodiments, in order to monitor the X-rays precisely, second exit window <b>50</b> or stem plate <b>24</b> for transmitting the X-rays is installed or X-ray monitor <b>30</b> is installed inside open enclosure <b>101</b>. However, if the X-rays generated from the target are intense, for example, the state of the X-rays transmitted through the enclosure to the outside without passing through a window or the like may be monitored by X-ray monitor <b>30</b> outside the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above-described embodiments, an image of the X-rays transmitted through object <b>5</b> to be inspected is taken. However, for example, a tomographic image may be taken by CT. In this case, since the magnification is high and the computing is carried out based on the X-ray image obtained with the stable X-rays, the precision of tomography is improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, X-ray generators in accordance with the present invention can monitor the state of the X-rays emitted from the target in real time using the X-ray monitor. It is possible to maintain the X-rays generated from the target in a constant state by controlling the current and voltage applied to the electron gun and the target, or moving the electron beam incidence position on the target, or other regulation, according to the state of the X-rays acquired by the X-ray monitor. Consequently, the generators can emit stable X-rays from the first exit window.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The X-ray monitor is positioned off the path on which the X-rays travel from the target to enter the first exit window. Thus, when X-rays are emitted through the first exit window to an object to be inspected, the X-ray monitor is not likely to obstruct approach of the object to the first exit window. Hence it is possible to bring the object close to the first exit window, thereby obtaining X-ray images of high magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thus this invention provides the X-ray generator capable of keeping the X-ray dosage constant and acquiring X-ray images of high magnification.</p>
