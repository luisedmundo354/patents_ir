<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a paper machine, and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for removing water from a fibrous web using a dewatering fabric and a permeable press belt in a paper machine that reduces or eliminates mechanical pressing thus increasing sheet quality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Voith Paper patented TissueFlex process substitutes a shoe press for the conventional suction pressure roll in a typical Tissue paper machine. The shoe press provides a wider nip that lowers peak pressure, which has shown an increase in sheet caliper and absorbency. These gains are in the 10% to 20% range depending on furnish and overall load. The suction pressure roll is relocated to a position prior to the nip to dewater the press fabric and sheet prior to reaching the shoe press as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,160.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The sheet solids going into the shoe press when running a conventional press fabric on a Crescent former fitted with the TissueFlex process is about 23%. Post shoe press solids are in the 37% to 41% range depending on furnish and overall load.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A fabric is utilized to carry the fiber web during the formation of the web. After the web takes form it is usually subjected to a drying process. The same fabric used during formation of the web or another fabric may come in contact with the web, to move the web across a vacuum section for the remove of moisture from the web. The fabric may additionally absorb moisture from the web and the moisture so absorbed is subsequently removed from the fabric at a later point in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A problem with conventional fabrics is that they carry too much water and rewetting is one of the major issues relative to light basis weight papers, such as tissue. Further, independent of the vacuum applied the sheet solids remain in the 23% to 25% range.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed in the art is a more efficient method of removing water from a fibrous web.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a combination of a dewatering membrane used in conjunction with a permeable belt press in a paper machine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention comprises, in one form thereof, a dewatering system in a paper machine, the dewatering system including a dewatering fabric and a permeable extended nip press belt. The dewatering fabric includes a woven permeable fabric and a polymeric layer having openings therethrough, the polymeric layer is connected to the permeable fabric. The permeable extended nip press belt applying pressure to a portion of the dewatering fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An advantage of the present invention is that the combination of the dewatering fabric and the permeable extended nip belt enhance the water removal capacity of the dewatering system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another advantage is that although a significant tension is applied to the extended nip press belt, the pressure per square inch, as applied to the web, is relatively low.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a papermaking machine <b>10</b>, for the processing of fibrous web <b>12</b>. Headbox <b>11</b> provides a fibrous slurry to a nip that is formed by a fabric <b>13</b> and a dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. Moisture is removed through fabric <b>13</b> allowing web <b>12</b> to form. Web <b>12</b> proceeds in machine direction M to dewatering apparatus <b>15</b>. Dewatering apparatus <b>15</b> includes a suction roll <b>18</b>, an optional fabric <b>20</b> and a belt press assembly <b>22</b>. Belt press assembly <b>22</b> includes a fabric <b>24</b>, which is also known as a belt <b>24</b>. Web <b>12</b> proceeds from dewatering apparatus <b>15</b> to shoe press <b>26</b>, which defines a transfer point with its proximity to Yankee roll <b>28</b>. At this transfer point web <b>12</b> separates from fabric <b>14</b> and attaches to the surface of Yankee roll <b>28</b>, which at least partially dries web <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After forming fibrous web <b>12</b> proceeds in machine direction M it comes into contact with fabric <b>20</b>. Web <b>12</b> then proceeds toward vacuum roll <b>18</b> between dewatering fabric <b>14</b> and fabric <b>20</b>. Fabric <b>20</b> is a course mesh fabric. Vacuum roll <b>18</b> is operated at a vacuum level to draw moisture from web <b>12</b>. Fabric <b>20</b>, web <b>12</b> and dewatering fabric <b>14</b> are pressed against vacuum roll <b>18</b> by belt press assembly <b>22</b>. A vacuum present in vacuum zone Z pulls a drying fluid, such as air, through permeable belt <b>24</b>, then through fabric <b>20</b>, then through web <b>12</b> and then through dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. Moisture collected in vacuum roll <b>18</b> is then discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, there are shown several embodiments of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown fabric <b>14</b> having a permeable woven base fabric <b>50</b> connected to a batt layer <b>58</b>. Fabric <b>50</b> includes machine direction yarns <b>54</b> and cross-directional yarns <b>56</b>. The cross-sectional area of machine direction yarns <b>54</b> is larger than the cross-sectional area of cross-direction yarns <b>56</b>. Machine direction yarn <b>54</b> is a multifilament yarn that may include thousands of fibers. Base fabric <b>50</b> is connected to batt layer <b>58</b> by a needling process that results in straight through drainage channels therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> there is illustrated another embodiment of dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, base fabric <b>50</b> has attached thereto a lattice grid <b>74</b> made of a polymer, such as polyurethane, that is put on top of base fabric <b>50</b>. The side of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> that runs against a roll is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The opposite side of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> (not shown), which is an opposite side of base fabric <b>50</b>, is the side that contacts web <b>12</b>. Grid <b>74</b> may be put on base fabric <b>50</b> by utilizing various known procedures, such as, for example, an extrusion technique or a screen-printing technique. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, lattice <b>74</b> is put on base fabric <b>50</b> with an angular orientation relative to machine direction yarns <b>54</b> and cross direction yarns <b>56</b>. Although this orientation is such that no part of lattice <b>74</b> is aligned with machine direction yarns <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, other orientations such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can also be utilized. Although lattice <b>74</b> is shown as a rather uniform grid pattern, this pattern can actually be discontinuous in part. Further, the material between the interconnections of the lattice structure may take a circuitous path rather than being substantially straight, as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Lattice grid <b>74</b> is made of a synthetic, such as a polymer or specifically a polyurethane, which attaches itself to base fabric <b>50</b> by its natural adhesion properties.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Lattice grid <b>74</b> being a polyurethane has good frictional properties, such that it seats well against the vacuum roll. This then forces vertical airflow and eliminates any x, y plane leakage. The velocity of the air is sufficient to prevent any rewetting once the water makes it through lattice <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally, grid <b>74</b> may be a thin perforated hydrophobic film <b>74</b> having an air permeability of 35 cfm or less, preferably 25 cfm or less having pores therein of approximately 15 microns. Here too we have vertical airflow at high velocity to prevent rewet.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which illustrates the vacuum roll contacting side of dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. This is yet another embodiment of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> that includes permeable base fabric <b>50</b> having machine direction multifilament yarns <b>54</b> and cross-direction monofilament yarns <b>56</b>, that are adhered to grid <b>76</b>, also known as an anti-rewet layer <b>76</b>. Grid <b>76</b> is made of a composite material, which may be an elastomeric material the may be the same as that used in lattice grid <b>74</b>. Grid <b>76</b> includes machine direction yarns <b>78</b> and a composite material <b>80</b> formed therearound. Grid <b>76</b> is a composite structure formed of elastomeric material <b>80</b>, and machine direction yarn <b>78</b>. Machine direction yarn <b>78</b> may be pre-coated with elastomeric material <b>80</b> before being placed in rows that are substantially parallel in a mold that is used to reheat elastomeric material <b>80</b> causing it to re-flow into the pattern shown as grid <b>76</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Additional elastomeric material <b>80</b> may be put into the mold as well. Grid structure <b>76</b>, also known as composite layer <b>76</b>, is then connected to base fabric <b>50</b> by one of many techniques including laminating grid <b>76</b> to permeable fabric <b>50</b>, melting elastomeric coated yarn <b>78</b> as it is held in position against permeable fabric <b>50</b> or by re-melting grid <b>76</b> onto base fabric <b>50</b>. Additionally, an adhesive may be utilized to attach grid <b>76</b> to permeable fabric <b>50</b>. Composite layer <b>76</b> seals well against the vacuum roll preventing x, y plane leakage and allowing vertical airflow to prevent rewet.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which illustrates the roll side of dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. This structure includes the elements that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the addition of batt fiber <b>82</b>. Batt fiber <b>82</b> is needled into the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to mechanically bind the two layers together, thereby forming a dewatering fabric <b>14</b> having a smooth needled batt fiber surface. Batt material <b>82</b> is porous by its nature, additionally the needling process not only connects the layers together, it also creates numerous small porous cavities extending into or completely through the structure of dewatering fabric <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Dewatering fabric <b>14</b> has an air permeability of from 5 to 100 cubic feet/minute preferably 19 cubic feet/minute or higher and more preferably 35 cubic feet/minute or higher. Mean pore diameters, as measured using a Coulter method, are from 5 to 75 microns, preferably 25 microns or higher and more preferably 35 microns or higher. Either surface of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> can be treated with a material to make it hydrophobic. Lattice composite layer <b>76</b> may be made of a synthetic polymeric material or a polyamide that is laminated to fabric <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Batt fiber layers are made from fibers ranging from 0.5 d-tex to 22 d-tex and may contain an adhesive to supplement fiber to fiber bonding in each of the layers. The bonding may result, for example, from a low temperature meltable fiber, particles and/or resin. The layers of dewatering fabric <b>14</b>, when combined are less than 2.0 millimeters thick, preferably less than 1.50 millimeters, and more preferably less than 1.25 millimeters and even more preferably less than 1.0 millimeter thick.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Machine direction yarns <b>54</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, also known as weft yarns <b>54</b> in an endless weaving process, are made of a multi-filament yarn, normally twisted/plied or can be a solid monolithic strand usually of less than 0.40 millimeter diameter, with a preferable diameter of 0.20 millimeter or as low as 0.10 millimeter. Cross direction yarns <b>56</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, also known as warp yarns <b>56</b> when woven in an endless weaving process are made of a monofilament yarn, of a diameter greater than or equal to 0.2 mm, preferably 0.38 mm. The multifilament yarns are formed in a single strand, twisted cabled or joined side by side to form a flat shaped fabric <b>50</b>. Woven permeable fabric <b>50</b> may have straight through channels needled through fabric <b>50</b>, thereby causing a straight through drainage channel through dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. Additionally, a hydrophobic layer may be applied to at least one surface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As to the uses of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> in papermaking machine <b>10</b>, web <b>12</b> continues with fabric <b>14</b> from its formation until it encounters Yankee roll <b>28</b>, where web <b>12</b> separates from fabric <b>14</b>. At drying apparatus <b>15</b> gentle pressure is applied by belt press <b>22</b> against web <b>12</b> as a mechanical force that helps to accelerate the moisture removal from web <b>12</b>. The squeezing action is coupled with a vacuum at zone Z of vacuum roll <b>18</b>, to drive moisture from web <b>12</b> and through dewatering permeable membrane <b>14</b>. Advantageously, moisture is removed through the combination of the pressure applied by the extended nip press contact of belt <b>24</b> and the introduction of air through belt <b>24</b> and fabrics <b>14</b> and <b>20</b> enhance the dewatering capability of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> there are shown details of permeable belt <b>24</b> of belt press <b>22</b> having holes <b>36</b> therethrough, holes <b>36</b> are arranged in a hole pattern <b>38</b> and grooves <b>40</b> are located on one side of belt <b>24</b>. Permeable belt <b>24</b> is routed so as to engage a surface of dewatering fabric <b>14</b> and thereby press dewatering fabric <b>14</b> further against web <b>12</b>, and web <b>12</b> against dewatering fabric <b>14</b>, which is supported thereunder by vacuum roll <b>18</b>. As this temporary coupling around vacuum roll <b>18</b> continues in machine direction M, it encounters a vacuum zone Z causing air to be passed through permeable belt <b>24</b>, dewatering fabric <b>14</b>, drying web <b>12</b> and the moisture picked up by the airflow proceeds further through dewatering fabric <b>14</b> and through a porous surface of vacuum roll <b>18</b>. There is a low pressing load applied to web <b>12</b> over the extended nip as air flows through belt <b>24</b>, web <b>12</b>, fabric <b>14</b> and roll <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Permeable belt <b>24</b>, used in belt press <b>22</b>, may be an extended nip press belt made of a flexible reinforced polyurethane. The advantage of a flexible reinforced polyurethane belt is that it provides a low level of pressing in the range of 50-300 KPa and preferably greater than 100 KPa. This allows a suction roll with a 1.2 meter diameter to work in concert with belt <b>24</b> having a tension of greater than 30 KN/m and preferably greater than 60 KN/m. The pressing length of permeable belt <b>24</b> against dewatering fabric <b>14</b>, which is indirectly supported by vacuum roll <b>18</b>, is at least as long as suction zone Z in roll <b>18</b>. Although the contact portion of permeable belt <b>24</b> can be shorter than suction zone Z. Even though significant tension can be applied to belt <b>24</b>, since there is a large interface area of belt <b>24</b> with roll <b>18</b>, the pressure per square centimeter is low so that compression on web <b>12</b> is minimized. Further if fabric <b>14</b> has a structure associated therewith, significant portions of web <b>12</b> will lie in valleys and may not receive any mechanical compression at all.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Permeable belt <b>24</b> has a pattern <b>38</b> of holes <b>36</b> therethrough, which may, for example, be drilled, laser cut, etched formed or woven therein. Permeable belt <b>24</b> may be monoplanar without the grooves shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the surface having grooves <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is placed in contact with fabric <b>20</b> along a portion of the travel of permeable belt <b>24</b> in belt press <b>22</b>. Each groove <b>40</b> connects with a set of holes <b>36</b> to allow the passage and distribution of air in belt <b>24</b>. Air is distributed along grooves <b>40</b>, which constitutes an open area adjacent to contact areas, where the surface of belt <b>24</b> applies pressure against web <b>12</b>. Air enters permeable belt <b>24</b> through holes <b>36</b> and then migrates along grooves <b>40</b> passing through fabric <b>20</b>, web <b>12</b> and dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. The diameter of holes <b>36</b> is larger than the width of grooves <b>40</b>. Although grooves <b>40</b> are shown having a generally rectangular cross-sectional, grooves <b>40</b> may have a different cross-section contour, such as, triangular, trapezoidal, semi-circular or semi-elliptical. The combination of permeable belt <b>24</b>, associated with vacuum roll <b>18</b>, is a combination that has been shown to increase sheet solids by at least 15%.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Permeable belt <b>24</b> is capable of running at high running tensions of at least 30 KN/m or 60 KN/m or higher with a relatively high surface contact area of 25% or greater and a high open area of 25% or greater. The composition of permeable belt <b>24</b> may include a thin spiral link having a support layer within permeable belt <b>24</b>. Alternatively, belt <b>24</b> may be a link fabric and fabric <b>20</b> may be eliminated, allowing link fabric <b>24</b> to both encounter web <b>12</b> and to pass drying air therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment of permeable belt <b>24</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a polyurethane matrix <b>126</b> has a permeable structure in the form of a woven structure with reinforcing machine direction yarns <b>128</b> and cross direction yarns <b>130</b> at least partially embedded within polyurethane matrix <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another embodiment of permeable belt <b>24</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, a polyurethane matrix <b>126</b> has a permeable structure in the form of a spiral link fabric <b>132</b> at least partially embedded within polyurethane matrix <b>126</b>. Holes <b>120</b> extend through belt <b>24</b> and may at least partially sever portions of spiral link fabric <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In yet another embodiment of permeable belt <b>24</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, yarns <b>134</b> are interlinked by the entwining of generally spiral woven yarns <b>134</b> with cross yarns <b>136</b> to form link fabric <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Permeable belt <b>24</b> is capable of applying a line force over an extremely long nip, thereby ensuring a long dwell time in which pressure is applied against web <b>12</b> as compared to a standard shoe press. There is a simultaneous airflow while web <b>12</b> is passing through the long nip. This results in a much lower specific pressure, thereby reducing the sheet compaction and enhancing sheet quality. The present invention further allows for a simultaneous vacuum and pressing dewatering with airflow through the web at the nip itself.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Advanced dewatering system <b>15</b> utilizes belt press <b>22</b> to remove water from web <b>12</b>, which is formed prior to reaching belt press <b>22</b>. Permeable belt <b>24</b> is routed in belt press <b>22</b> so as to engage a surface of fabric <b>20</b> and thereby press fabric <b>20</b> further against web <b>12</b>, and web <b>12</b> against dewatering fabric <b>14</b>, which is supported thereunder by vacuum roll <b>18</b>. As this coupling of web <b>12</b> with fabrics <b>14</b> and <b>20</b>, and belt <b>24</b> continues around vacuum roll <b>18</b> in machine direction M, it encounters a vacuum zone Z by which air is drawn through permeable belt <b>24</b>, dewatering fabric <b>14</b>, drying web <b>12</b> and the moisture picked up by the air flow proceeds further through dewatering fabric <b>14</b> and through a porous surface of vacuum roll <b>18</b>. Drying air passes through holes <b>36</b> is distributed along grooves <b>40</b> before passing through dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. As web <b>12</b> leaves belt press <b>22</b>, belt <b>24</b> and fabric <b>20</b> separate from web <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Web <b>12</b> proceeds from dewatering apparatus <b>15</b> to transfer device <b>26</b> and Yankee <b>28</b>. Transfer device <b>26</b> may be in the form of a shoe press <b>26</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a suction press roll, a solid press roll or a drilled press roll. Now additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref>, there are shown alternatives ways in which transfer device <b>26</b> may be embodied in which the nip is lengthened. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a roll <b>27</b> precedes roll <b>26</b>, in machine direction M, and is arranged to cause web <b>12</b> to contact Yankee roll <b>28</b> prior to roll <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, roll <b>27</b> precedes roll <b>26</b> and roll <b>29</b> follows roll <b>26</b>, in machine direction M, with roll <b>29</b> arranged to cause web <b>12</b> to contact Yankee roll <b>28</b> at and subsequent to roll <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, roll <b>27</b> precedes roll <b>26</b> and roll <b>29</b> follows roll <b>26</b>, in machine direction M, with rolls <b>27</b> and <b>29</b> arranged to cause web <b>12</b> to contact Yankee roll <b>28</b> prior to and subsequent to roll <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, roll <b>27</b> precedes roll <b>26</b>, in machine direction M, and roll <b>26</b> is a shoe press causing web <b>12</b> to contact Yankee roll <b>28</b>. In each case reduced pressure is used in contacting web <b>12</b> with Yankee <b>28</b> than in conventional paper machines, because the solids in web <b>12</b> are high enough that less pressing is required. This advantageously allows less compaction of web <b>12</b> thereby enhancing quality, strength and absorbency of web <b>12</b>. A benefit of the present invention is that the caliper and absorbency of the web produced is increased by 25% to 35% over that produced by conventional technology.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The dewatering that occurs at dewatering apparatus <b>15</b> presents a web <b>12</b> to Yankee <b>28</b> having sheet solids of greater than 30%, preferably greater than 35% and more preferably greater than 40%. This greatly reduces the need for additional mechanical pressing at Yankee <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention may be applied to other configurations, for example a suction breast roll machine, a twin wire or a Fourdrinier machine. A shoe press may be optionally utilized. If a shoe press is used it will require an additional dewatering apparatus, such as a vacuum turning roll or a multi-slot vacuum box prior to the pressure roll nip at Yankee <b>28</b>. The paper web is formed, for example on a Crescent Former between an inner and an outer fabric. The outer fabric can be a conventional or a drainage fabric having differing zonal drainage characteristics. The inner fabric is dewatering fabric <b>14</b>. Web <b>12</b> is carried by fabric <b>14</b> to and around suction roll <b>18</b> whereby the dryness of web <b>12</b> is increased from about 12% to 23% or higher than 30%. Press apparatus <b>22</b> enhances the dewatering effect. The wrapping angle of fabric <b>14</b> around roll <b>18</b> can be greater or smaller than vacuum zone Z. A pressure is applied by belt <b>24</b> to web <b>12</b> and fabric <b>14</b>. Fabric <b>20</b> is optionally present to prevent web <b>12</b> from following belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After web <b>12</b> passes from dewatering apparatus <b>15</b>, web <b>12</b> is carried to a press nip between Yankee <b>28</b> and shoe press <b>26</b>. Shoe press <b>26</b> preferably has a shoe width of 80 mm or higher, preferably 120 mm or higher. A maximum peak pressure applied in the length of contact is less that 1.5 MPa, preferably less than 1.0 MPa, and more preferably less than 0.5 MPa. The solids content of web <b>12</b> as it enters the Yankee nip is preferably greater than 30%, more preferably greater than 35%, and even more preferably greater than 40%. This eliminates or greatly reduces the need for additional mechanical pressing at the Yankee. With substantially less pressing, the dewatering structures can be less robust than prior art structures an still provide acceptably acceptable service.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> there is shown vacuum roll <b>18</b> also known as a suction press roll <b>18</b> and a Yankee <b>28</b>. Dewatering fabric <b>14</b> carries web <b>12</b> as water is removed from web <b>12</b>. At position A the water content of fabric <b>14</b>, also known as felt <b>14</b> is 1,200 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and the water content of web <b>12</b> also known as sheet <b>12</b> is 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>. At point C after web <b>12</b> is transferred to Yankee <b>28</b> the water content of felt <b>14</b> is 750 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and the water content of sheet <b>12</b> is 35 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> there is shown vacuum roll <b>18</b>, shoe press <b>26</b> and Yankee <b>28</b>. Dewatering fabric <b>14</b> carries web <b>12</b> as water is removed from web <b>12</b>. At position A the water content of fabric <b>14</b>, also known as felt <b>14</b> is 1,200 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and the water content of web <b>12</b> also known as sheet <b>12</b> is 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>. At point B the water content of felt <b>14</b> is 800 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and the water content of sheet <b>12</b> is 50 g/m<sup>2</sup>. At point C after web <b>12</b> is transferred to Yankee <b>28</b> the water content of felt <b>14</b> is 810 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and the water content of sheet <b>12</b> is 35 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The press fabric strategy for this process as well as other Tissue processes is to provide a fabric <b>14</b> for carrying web <b>12</b> that is robust enough to withstand repeated compactions in a press nip to thereby provide adequate life of fabric <b>14</b>. This has translated into a state of the art press fabric that typically carries around 1,200 g/m<sup>2 </sup>of water when saturated. The TissueFlex process, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,160, partially illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> has separated a suctioning effect from the pressing effect. During the first dewatering process, the press fabric loses up to 400 g/m<sup>2 </sup>of water and the sheet loses up to 50 g/m<sup>2 </sup>resulting in web <b>12</b> having approximately 23% solids. During mechanical pressing in shoe press <b>26</b> web <b>12</b> will lose another 15 g/m<sup>2</sup>, which is absorbed into the fabric <b>14</b>. Comparing this with a standard Crescent former (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> without TissueFlex, fabric <b>14</b> and web <b>12</b> simultaneously lose 450 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and 65 g/m<sup>2 </sup>respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The ratio of water still in fabric <b>14</b> remaining post press is disproportional to the water remaining in web <b>12</b>, approximately 20:1 for a conventional Crescent former and for a Crescent former retrofitted to the TissueFlex process. It has been shown that by either reducing residual fabric water in the press fabric or minimizing the rewetting effect with the dewatering fabric of the present invention that sheet solids can increase above 23%, which in turn can yield a dryer sheet after pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
