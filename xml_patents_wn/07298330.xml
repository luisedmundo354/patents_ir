<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A radio frequency identification (RFID) system includes an RFID device, and a conductive material that cooperates with the RFID device to enhance performance of the RFID device. The RFID device and the conductive material may be within a distance of about one-quarter of a wavelength of energy most preferentially received by the RFID device. The RFID device may be mounted at an angle to the conductive material. Alternatively, or in addition, the RFID device may be partially overlapped by the conductive material. The RFID device may include a conductive antenna structure having an aperture therein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A radio frequency identification (RFID) system includes an RFID device, and a conductive material that cooperates with the RFID device to enhance performance of the RFID device. The RFID device and the conductive material may be within a distance of about one-quarter of a wavelength of energy most preferentially received by the RFID device. The RFID device may be mounted at an angle to the conductive material. Altenatively, or in addition, the RFID device may be partially overlapped by the conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The RFID device may include a conductive antenna structure having an aperture therein. Parts of the antenna structure on both sides of one end of the aperture are coupled to a wireless communication device, such as an RFID chip or strap. On the opposite end of the aperture, parts of the antenna structure at both sides of the aperture are electrically coupled together, for instance by being coupled together by other conductive parts of the antenna structure. All of the parts of the antenna structure may be parts of a continuous unitary layer of conductive material. The antenna structure with the aperture therein may facilitate increased readability of the RFID device, particularly in directions out from the edges of the RFID device. The antenna structure may be directly conductively coupled to the wireless communication device. Alternatively, the antenna structure may be indirectly (reactively) coupled to the RFID device, such as by capacitive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an RFID device <b>10</b> includes an antenna structure <b>12</b> that is coupled to a wireless communication device, such as an RFID chip <b>14</b> that may be a part of an RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>. The RFID strap <b>16</b> includes conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> that are coupled to arms or parts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The standard elements of the interposer or strap <b>16</b> include the RFID chip <b>14</b> and conductive leads. The interposer or strap <b>16</b> also may include a substrate to support the RFID chip <b>14</b> and the conductive leads. In most embodiments herein (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) there is no substrate, but rather the conductive leads and the chip <b>14</b> are supported by the antenna. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 11A</figref> (discussed below), the interposer substrate is the same as the antenna substrate. In another possible variation, the RFID chip and the conductive leads may be supported by a separate substrate for processing purposes, and this separate substrate may remain with the chip and leads after the chip and leads are coupled to the antenna, or may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are on either side of an aperture or elongated slot <b>30</b>, an opening between the parts of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. At a first end <b>32</b> of the aperture or elongated slot <b>30</b>, an open end, the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are electrically coupled to the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>. The conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are in turn coupled to contact points of the RFID chip <b>14</b>. At a second end <b>36</b> of the aperture or slot <b>30</b>, a closed end that is distal relative to the RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>, the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are electrically connected together, for example by linked together by a conductive connection <b>38</b> that is also part of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and the conductive connection <b>38</b>, all may be parts of a unitary, continuous layer <b>40</b> of conductive material forming the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The conductive layer <b>40</b> may be attached or otherwise coupled to a substrate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The slot or aperture <b>30</b> may have a substantially constant width between the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The slot <b>30</b> may have a length from of approximately one quarter of a wavelength of radiation used to communicate with the RFID chip <b>14</b>. The slot <b>30</b> allows the RFID device <b>10</b> to be read along a narrow axis <b>46</b>. Indeed, the RFID device <b>10</b> may exhibit good readability characteristics in substantially any direction within or parallel to the plane of the antenna structure <b>12</b> or the RFID device <b>10</b> as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, at short ranges, the RFID device <b>10</b> demonstrates good read performance in other directions, such as above and below the tag. Thus the RFID device <b>10</b> shows good read performance in all directions around the device <b>10</b>. The read performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> is good even when the device <b>10</b> is of a small size. For example, an RFID device of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, having outer dimensions of 25 mm×25 mm (1 inch×1 inch) has been found to have good read performance at distances in excess of 2 m (6.5 feet), when utilizing suitable power and frequency levels. Examples of suitable power and frequency labels are operation over a frequency band of 902 to 928 MHz at a power of 4 W e.i.r.p (effective isotropic radiated power) in accordance with FCC part 15 section 247. By using a suitable reader with either a circularized polarized antenna, or dual linear antennas polarized at 90 degrees to each other connected to separate ports on a reader system which are alternately switched, the antenna structure <b>12</b> gives a read capability that is good over a wide variety of orientations, and may be substantially orientation independent.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The coupling between the RFID chip <b>14</b> and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may either be a direct conductive coupling, occurring through the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the interposer <b>16</b>, or may be in whole or in part a reactive coupling, such as capacitive or inductive coupling through a dielectric material. Several configurations of reactive coupling connections are discussed below with regard to different embodiments of the RFID device <b>10</b>. With regard to the direct (conductive) electrical connections between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, such connections may be made by use of a suitable conductive adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A circuit path <b>54</b> proceeds from one side (contact point) of the RFID chip <b>14</b>, through the arm <b>26</b>, the conductive connection <b>38</b>, and the arm <b>28</b>, to another side (contact point) of the RFID chip <b>14</b>. Thus, in contrast to a standard slot antenna, there is not conductive material fully around the slot <b>30</b>. A standard slot antenna has a short circuit of conductive material fully surrounding a slot.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The antenna structure <b>12</b> of the RFID device <b>10</b> may have some features of loop antennas, and may have some features of slot antennas, while overcoming the null spots that may occur in traditional loop antennas and slot antennas. The antenna structure <b>12</b> may provide better coverage of a wide range of orientations by coupling to the RFID chip <b>14</b> with at least two modes of operation. The antenna modes may include two or more modes that include modes such as a mode substantially that of a notch antenna, a mode substantially that of a loop antenna, a mode substantially that of a folded dipole antenna, and/or a mode substantially that of a slot antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The RFID device <b>10</b> may utilize a variety of suitable materials. The substrate <b>42</b> may be a suitable plastic material, such as PET or polypropylene, which may be a flexible film or sheet of plastic material. The conductive layer <b>40</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b> may be formed, deposited or adhered onto the substrate <b>42</b> by any of a variety of suitable methods. For example, the conductive layer <b>40</b> may be a conductive ink, such as an ink containing metal particles, that is printed onto the substrate <b>42</b> in a suitable pattern. Alternatively, the conductive layer <b>40</b> may be plated onto the substrate <b>42</b>, such as by electroplating. As another alternative, the conductive layer <b>40</b> may be adhesively adhered to the substrate <b>42</b>. Etching may be used to remove conductive material to form the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The RFID device <b>10</b> may include additional suitable layers, such as protective layers to protect the functional elements of the device that may also provide desired surface properties such as printability or weatherability, and/or an adhesive layer to adhere the device <b>10</b> to an object.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It will be appreciated that a variety of wireless communication devices, such as RFID interposers or straps, may be used as the RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>. Examples of suitable RFID interposers or straps include an RFID strap available from Alien Technologies, and the interposer (called a module) marketed under the name I-CONNECT, available from Philips Electronics. Chips available from Alien Technologies may be attached either conductively, in a flip-chip die, or conductively or reactively for a strap form of the chip. Suitable RFID chips include Philips HSL chip, available from Philips Electronics, and the EM Marin EM4222, available from EM Microelectronic-Marin SA, as well as RFID chips available from Matrics Inc. of Columbia, Md. USA.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It will be appreciated that the RFID device <b>10</b> may have any of a variety of suitable configurations, some of which are described further below. The configuration of the conductive areas and slot of the antenna structure may vary widely, for instance. As one example, the slot <b>30</b> may be substantially rectangular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Alternatively, the slot may have another shape, such as bent or curved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one alternative configuration for the RFID device <b>10</b>, in which the slot <b>30</b> has a bent shape, with a number of constant-width segments <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>68</b>, angled with regard to one another. The segments <b>60</b>-<b>68</b> allow the same overall slot length on a small, more compact device. An RFID interposer <b>16</b> is mounted onto both sides of the aperture or slot <b>30</b>, thus using material of the conductive layer on both sides of the slot <b>30</b> and along a distal end of the elongated slot as a hybrid loop-slot antenna, similar to the above-discussed embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The conductive layer <b>40</b> covers substantially all of an underlying substrate <b>42</b>, with an exception of the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> is shown, in which the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are not directly electrically coupled to one another. Rather the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are reactively coupled together by respective coupling portions <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> of the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, that are capacitively coupled together across an interaction region <b>80</b> of the substrate <b>42</b> upon which the conductive arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are mounted. The interaction region <b>80</b> and the slot <b>30</b> are to some extent separate, although it will be appreciated that the interaction region <b>80</b> may be taken into account when properly tuning the antenna structure <b>12</b> by tuning the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> in the vicinity of the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be advantageously used with RFID chips that require that no short circuit be presented between the contacts of the chip that are coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Examples of such RFID chips are the EM4222 and the HSL chips.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b>, which has an antenna structure <b>12</b> that includes both a hybrid loop-slot antenna, as well as a monopole antenna element <b>90</b>. The hybrid loop-slot antenna may be similar to the structure described above with regard to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, with a pair of arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> coupled to different contact points of the RFID chip <b>14</b>, and a conductive connection <b>38</b> between the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, with the conductive connection <b>38</b> and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> defining the slot <b>30</b>. The arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are coupled, respectively, to an RF input <b>92</b> and a common (ground) connection <b>94</b> of the RFID chip <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The monopole antenna element <b>90</b> is a folded dipole element <b>96</b> that is electrically coupled to another contact point (connection) <b>100</b> of the RFID chip <b>14</b>. The dipole element <b>96</b> has a serpentine shape, with a number of back-and-forth segments <b>102</b>. The antenna structure <b>12</b> thus utilizes the hybrid loop-slot antenna as a ground plane for the folded dipole element <b>96</b>. The antenna structure <b>12</b> is thus a dual polarization antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7-14</figref> show various embodiments of the RFID device <b>10</b> that have capacitive coupling between the RFID chip <b>14</b> and at least one of the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Referring first to the embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the RFID interposer <b>16</b> are adhesively coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b> by respective adhesive pads or layers <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. The adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are made from a non-conductive adhesive that prevents direct (conductive) electrical coupling between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Rather, the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are capacatively coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> across the non-conductive adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. By avoiding direct conductive electrical coupling between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, shorting together of the corresponding contact points of the RFID chip <b>14</b> is avoided. As noted above, some chips may require that the contact points not be shorted together, for the chips to operate properly.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It will be appreciated that a suitable thickness may be selected for the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, in order to provide the desired capacitive coupling between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The thickness of the adhesive pads may be selected based on such factors as the operating power and frequency, the coupling area, and the dielectric constant of the adhesive to be used. In one example, adhesive pads having an area of 5 mm<sup>2 </sup>and a thickness of 10 μm may be used, although it will be appreciated that a wide range of suitable areas and thicknesses may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> show another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b>, which illustrates one way of forming a device that utilizes adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> to attach conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, different parts of the device <b>10</b> are formed on different parts <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> of a substrate <b>124</b>. The parts <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> have a fold line <b>126</b> therebetween. On the first part <b>120</b> the RFID interposer <b>16</b> is placed, with the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> face up. The RFID interposer <b>16</b> may be attached to the first part <b>120</b> of the substrate <b>124</b> by use of a suitable adhesive. Alternatively, the interposer <b>16</b> may be formed in situ, by depositing or forming the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, such as by printing or electroplating, after placing the RFID chip <b>14</b> face up on the first part <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The antenna structure <b>12</b> is deposited or attached onto the second part <b>122</b> of the substrate <b>124</b>. The adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may then be deposited on the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>, for example by a suitable printing process.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Following making of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the two parts of the device are joined together by folding the substrate <b>124</b> along the fold line <b>126</b>. This brings in conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> into contact with the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, thereby adhesively joining together the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The first part <b>120</b> of the substrate <b>124</b> may be sized to substantially cover the second part <b>122</b>, when the first part <b>120</b> is folded over the second part <b>122</b>. The second part <b>122</b> may be pressed against and sealed to the second parts, such as by heat sealing, to enclose and protect the operative elements of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It will be appreciated that the method of making an RFID device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, may be performed as a series of continuous roll operations, such as in a roll-to-roll process. The placement of the RFID chip <b>14</b> and/or the interposer <b>16</b>; the formation of the antenna structure <b>12</b> on the substrate <b>124</b> (or adherence of the antenna structure <b>12</b> to the substrate <b>124</b>); and/or placement of the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, all may be performed as roll operations. Such operations may be performed on a web of material, which may then be suitably cut to produce individual RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be further appreciated that the sort of method described above may be utilized with RFID devices having other configurations, as described herein. For example, suitable electrically-conductive adhesive may be substituted for non-conductive adhesive of the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, thereby producing an RFID device <b>10</b> where the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are directly (conductively) electrically coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. As another example, the antenna structure <b>12</b> may have some of the other configurations described herein.</p>

The first part <b>130</b> has an RFID chip <b>14</b> and conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> thereupon. The second part <b>132</b> has the conductive layer <b>40</b>, with its various parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>38</b>, thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the first part <b>130</b> may be folded back along the fold line <b>136</b>, to make back-to-back contact with the second part <b>132</b> of the substrate <b>134</b>. The parts <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> may be joined with an adhesive layer <b>138</b>.

The chip <b>14</b> is conductively coupled to a conductive pad <b>142</b> on the substrate <b>42</b>. The conductive pad <b>142</b> includes a number of fingers <b>144</b> jutting out therefrom, along the substrate <b>42</b>. The fingers <b>144</b> interdigitate with corresponding fingers <b>146</b> of the arm <b>26</b>, leaving a narrow serpentine gap <b>150</b> between the sets of fingers <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. Capacitive coupling may occur across the gap <b>150</b>, indirectly (capacitively) electrically coupling the conductive pad <b>142</b> and the arm <b>26</b>, without danger of short-circuiting of the arm <b>26</b>. The conductive pad <b>142</b> and the fingers <b>144</b> may be part of a conductive layer <b>154</b> that also includes the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and the conductive connection <b>38</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A variety of capacitive coupling embodiments of the RFID device <b>10</b> have been described above. It will be appreciated that other types of indirect reactive coupling, such as inductive coupling via a magnetic field, may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> with a corrugated cardboard layer <b>180</b>. A pair of conducting strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>, such as copper strips, are placed on corrugations <b>186</b> and <b>188</b> during manufacture of the cardboard layer <b>180</b>. The conducting strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> serve as the arms of a hybrid loop/aperture antenna. A shorting conductive connection <b>190</b> is placed at one point along the conductive strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>, and an RFID interposer <b>16</b> is placed at another point along the conductive strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>. The points for placement for the shorting connection <b>190</b> and the interposer <b>16</b> are chosen so that the aperture <b>12</b> defined by the various elements has a suitable length.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Following placement of the elements of the device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, construction of the cardboard layer may be completed by placement of a facing layer atop the corrugations. The cardboard may be used for suitable purposes, such as in a carton or other container. The RFID device <b>10</b> thus may be employed as an internal device within a cardboard layer, readable from a wide variety of orientations. The placement of the device within the cardboard layer may help protect the device from physical damage during handling of the cardboard. In addition, placement of the device within a cardboard layer helps to hide the device, protecting it from deliberate attempts to disable it. However, it will be appreciated that an external marker may be provided on the cardboard to indicate location of the RFID device <b>10</b>, for example to aid in placement of a reader for short-range reading.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates one application of the RFID device <b>10</b>, with application of the device <b>10</b> to a clothing item <b>200</b>, such as a shirt. The device <b>10</b> may be a card-mounted label placed between buttons of the clothing item <b>200</b>, or attached to the item <b>200</b> with a plastic fastener. The device <b>10</b> on the clothing item <b>200</b> may be read with a hand-held reader <b>204</b>, from any of a variety of directions relative to the clothing item <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a display unit <b>210</b> capable of reading RFID devices <b>10</b> on a group of clothing items <b>200</b>. The display unit <b>210</b> has a number of suitable antennas <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in a back wall <b>216</b> of the display unit <b>210</b>. The antennas <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> are coupled to a reader <b>220</b>. The ability of the RFID devices <b>10</b> to be read along their edges in a variety of orientations, especially along axes in the narrow directions of the devices <b>10</b>, facilitates reading of the devices by the display unit <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">It will be appreciated that the variety of permissible edge-reading angles for the devices <b>10</b> allow reading even when the items <b>200</b> are placed in the display unit <b>210</b> at a variety of orientations, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The flexibility in variety of read orientation for the RFID devices <b>10</b> allows, for example, a retailer flexibility to display the items <b>200</b> at a variety of orientations, while still allowing them to be detected by the display unit <b>210</b>. In addition, detection by the display unit <b>210</b> may be maintained largely unaffected by how the items <b>200</b> are placed or misplaced in the display unit, such as by employees or customers.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates reading of RFID devices <b>10</b> on clothing items <b>230</b>, which are on a portable rack <b>240</b>.

The devices <b>10</b> on the items <b>230</b> may be read from a side direction <b>244</b> or <b>246</b> as the rack <b>240</b> is moved past a reading station. The good edge-reading characteristics of the RFID devices <b>10</b> facilitate detection of the devices <b>10</b> in the directions <b>244</b> and <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the clothing items <b>230</b> mounted on a display rack <b>250</b>.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It will be appreciated that the read properties of the RFID devices <b>10</b> may be utilized in detecting and/or tracking a wide variety of objects in addition to clothing items. The detection of the clothing items <b>200</b> and <b>230</b> is but one example of a wide variety of objects with which the RFID devices <b>10</b> may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, an RFID device <b>10</b> is attached to an object <b>300</b> having electrically-conductive material <b>302</b>, either at or below the surface of the object <b>300</b>, thereby forming an enhanced-performance RFID system <b>304</b>. The device <b>10</b> is attached to the object <b>300</b> at an angle to the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b>, such that a slot <b>30</b> of the device <b>10</b> is at an angle a to the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">With the RFID device <b>10</b> at an angle to the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b>, there is a limited amount of parallel overlap between the RFID device <b>10</b> and the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b>. The amount of parallel overlap is defined as the fraction of the area of the antenna structure <b>12</b> and the slot <b>30</b> of the device <b>10</b>, that is projected onto the conductive material <b>302</b>, when the projection is in a direction perpendicular to the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b>. For the simple case of a flat RFID device <b>10</b> at an angle a to a flat conductive material <b>302</b>, the parallel overlap is equal to the cosine of the angle a.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> is enhanced by the presence of the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b> near at least part of the RFID device <b>10</b>. The term “near,” as used herein with regard to proximity of conductive material and RFID devices, refers to conductive material being less than about a quarter wavelength of the antenna of the RFID device <b>10</b>, with the wavelength being that or energy used to detect and/or communicate with the RFID device <b>10</b>. This wavelength may be more particularly taken to be that of the energy most preferentially received by the RFID device <b>10</b> (the wavelength the RFID device <b>10</b> is tuned for). The RFID device <b>10</b> may be almost in contact with the conductive material <b>302</b>, so that there is substantially no separation between the RFID device <b>10</b> and the conductive material <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> may be enhanced more and more as it is brought closer and closer to the conductive material <b>302</b>. This is in contrast to prior art use of conductive “reflectors” located a quarter wavelength away from antennas, which are used to increase gain in such antennas. Performance with such reflectors is not enhanced when the antenna is brought closer than a quarter wavelength to the reflector. Although such reflectors utilize a conductive material to increase gain, the reflectors have a completely different mode of operation than the systems described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> may be further enhanced by limiting the amount of parallel overlap of the RFID device <b>10</b>. The amount of parallel overlap may be about 0.5 or less, and may be about 0.2 or less, or even about 0.1 or less. By placing the RFID device <b>10</b> substantially perpendicular to the object <b>300</b> and the conducting material <b>302</b>, the parallel overlap may be reduced to substantially zero.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The RFID device <b>10</b> may be mounted on a triangular or other shape protrusion <b>310</b> (which may be considered to be a part of the RFID device <b>10</b>), which is in turn mounted to the object <b>300</b>. The protrusion <b>310</b>, which may be made of plastic or another suitable material, may aid in maintaining a desired amount of parallel overlap between the RFID device <b>10</b> and the conductive material <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The electrically-conductive material <b>302</b> may be metal or another suitable electrically-conductive material. The conductive material <b>302</b> may be a layer of material, or may have other configurations, such as being a bulk material. The object <b>300</b> may be any of a wide variety of different things, including products for sale or in use, and containers, such as cartons, for use in transporting products or other objects. A few of the many possible objects include beverage containers, such as kegs and cans, and devices with metal casings or parts.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The use of the electrically-conductive material <b>302</b> for enhancing performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> may allow use of smaller RFID devices, and/or may allow detecting and/or reading of the RFID devices <b>10</b> at greater distances. Smaller RFID devices <b>10</b> are desirable from a number of standpoints: smaller RFID devices require less raw materials, which may reduce costs; and smaller RFID devices require less space to affix to an object, are loss obtrusive, and are less likely to be damaged. In addition, smaller RFID devices may be less detectable after purchase by the end user, when the RFID device <b>10</b> is no longer in close proximity to other such devices. The reduced detectability of a separated RFID device (not in close proximity to other devices) may allay privacy concerns concerning RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The RFID device <b>10</b> may have a size such that it requires conductive material in close proximity in order to achieve desired performance characteristics. The RFID device <b>10</b> may have an overall size of about 8 cm (3 inches)×8 cm (3 inches) or less. The RFID device <b>10</b> may be even smaller, having for example a size of about 4 cm×4 cm or less, or of about 2.5 cm (1 inch)×2.5 cm (1 inch) or less. Expressed in terms of wavelengths, in its largest dimension the antenna structure <b>12</b> of the RFID device <b>10</b> may be about one-eight of a wavelength or less. However, it will be appreciated that other sizes for the RFID device <b>10</b> are possible. For example, the RFID device <b>10</b> may be big enough to work well on its own, but may still have its performance enhanced by close proximity to an electrically-conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As another alternative, it will be appreciated that the RFID device <b>10</b> may be placed in close proximity to an electrically conductive material that is not part of an object to which the RFID device is attached. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, objects <b>300</b> with RFID devices <b>10</b> are placed in close proximity to a metal shelf <b>312</b>, forming an enhanced-performance RFID system <b>314</b>. The RFID device <b>10</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the shelf <b>312</b>, which enhances performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> may be enhanced by putting other RFID devices in close proximity to it. For example, a number of similar items, each with an RFID device, may be placed in close proximity to one another, enhancing performance of at least some of the RFID devices, above and beyond the performance enhancement that may be obtained by close proximity of electrically-conductive material. Generally it is observed in the case of RFID devices with hybrid antennas (combining characteristics of slot or notch antennas with characteristics of loop antennas) that the enhancement of performance is most pronounced if the tags are in close proximity, and are coplanar.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">This performance enhancement in grouping of tagged items may be employed to advantage in the RFID tagging of packaged articles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22E</figref> illustrate this effect in a variety of configurations of RFID-tagged, packed bottles <b>330</b>, with RFID devices <b>10</b> in close proximity to one another. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> the bottles <b>330</b> are tagged at their the bottom surfaces <b>332</b> with RFID devices <b>10</b>, wherein packing the bottles <b>330</b> on a common surface results in roughly co-planar placement of the RFID devices <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> shows multiple layers of tagged bottles <b>330</b> separated by packing sheets <b>336</b>, resulting in a series of co-planar groups of RFID devices (horizontal planes at different packing levels). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, the RFID devices <b>10</b> are applied to plastic bottle caps <b>340</b> instead of to the bottoms of the bottles. Placement of the RFID devices <b>10</b> on the bottle caps <b>340</b> may be desirable for bottles containing liquids, in order to provide greater distance of the RFID device <b>10</b> from the liquid. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22D and 22E</figref> the bottles <b>330</b> are tagged at their sidewalls <b>350</b>. For bottles <b>330</b> with cylindrical shapes <b>352</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref>), this may result in less consistency in co-planarity of groups of tags because of variations in orientation from bottle to bottle. For bottles <b>300</b> with flat faces <b>354</b> and natural orientations, such as rectangular cross sections <b>358</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22E</figref>), it is easier to assure co-planarity of the RFID devices <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22E</figref> show RFID devices <b>10</b> placed on bottles <b>300</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the bottles <b>330</b> are merely examples of a larger group of objects that may have RFID devices <b>10</b> attached to or mounted thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22F and 22G</figref> illustrate another way of enhancing performance of an RFID device <b>10</b> by placement of electrically-conductive material in close proximity to the RFID device <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22F</figref> shows an RFID device <b>10</b> in a container <b>368</b>, partially overlapped by an object (a CD or DVD) <b>370</b> that contains a conductive material <b>372</b>, thereby forming an RFID system <b>364</b>. The conductive material <b>372</b> may be near or in close proximity to the RFID device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22G</figref> shows the container <b>368</b> with the object <b>370</b> removed. The presence of the conductive material <b>372</b> partially overlapping conductive material of the RFID device <b>10</b>, and near or in close proximity to the RFID device <b>10</b>, enhances performance of the RFID device <b>10</b>. The presence of the conductive material <b>372</b> may enhance the read distance of the RFID device <b>10</b> (distance at which a specified signal strength is obtained) by a factor of 3 or a factor of 5 or more.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It will be appreciated that enhancement of performance provided by the partial overlapping of the RFID device <b>10</b> may be utilized in any of a number of ways. Most obviously, the enhanced performance may be used to communicate with the RFID device <b>10</b> at a greater distance. Another use may be as a theft detection device, which may be used to indicate when the object <b>370</b> is removed from the container <b>368</b>. Such a function may also be performed by a pair of RFID devices, only one of which is partially overlapped for the by the conductive material <b>372</b> (or which are subject to different amounts of overlap). When signals of similar intensity are received from both the RFID devices, it indicates that the object <b>370</b> has been removed from the container <b>368</b>. It will be obvious that there are many other uses enhanced performance provided by partial overlapping of RFID devices with conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22H</figref> illustrates another configuration, in which the object <b>370</b>, when present, covers one of a pair of RFID devices <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ that share a common antenna structure <b>12</b>. With the object <b>370</b> in place, the device <b>10</b>′ cannot be read due to the presence of the conductive material <b>372</b> covering the slot <b>30</b>′. In contrast, the slot <b>30</b> is always uncovered, so that the device <b>10</b> may always be read or otherwise communicated with. When the object <b>370</b> is removed, both of the devices <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ may be read.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22I and 22J</figref> show still another configuration, in which an RFID device <b>10</b> within a package <b>376</b> on a surface of a keg <b>378</b>.

The small device size that may be used in such a configuration may aid in avoiding interference with cleaning and filling operations of the keg <b>378</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22L and 22M</figref> illustrate placement of an RFID device <b>10</b> substantially perpendicular to a metal rack <b>382</b> that may be used in a retail store, for example for display or items for sale.
