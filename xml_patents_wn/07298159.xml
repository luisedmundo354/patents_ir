<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to deep trench isolation structures and, more particularly, to a method of measuring the leakage current of a deep trench isolation structure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A deep trench isolation structure is a well-known semiconductor structure that is used to isolate laterally adjacent regions of a substrate, epitaxial layer, or well from each other. The structure is commonly formed by first etching a deep trench in the substrate or through an epitaxial layer into the substrate. Once formed, the trench is typically lined with oxide, and then filled with polysilicon. (Other processing, such as channel stop implants, is often associated with the formation of a trench.)</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross-sectional diagram that illustrates an example of a prior-art semiconductor structure <b>100</b> that utilizes deep trench isolation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, semiconductor structure <b>100</b> includes a p− substrate <b>110</b>, and an n+ buried layer <b>112</b> that is formed in p− substrate <b>110</b>. In addition, structure <b>100</b> includes an n− well <b>114</b> that is formed in p− substrate <b>110</b> to extend down from the top surface of p− substrate <b>100</b> to n+ buried layer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, semiconductor structure <b>100</b> includes a lateral region <b>116</b>, and a deep trench isolation structure <b>118</b> that is formed in p− substrate <b>110</b> to isolate n+ buried layer <b>112</b> and n− well <b>114</b> from lateral region <b>116</b>. Deep trench isolation structure <b>118</b> includes a trench <b>120</b>, a layer of oxide <b>122</b> that contacts p− substrate <b>110</b>, n+ buried layer <b>112</b> and n− well <b>114</b>, and a polysilicon region <b>124</b> that fills up trench <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, semiconductor structure <b>100</b> includes a p-type region <b>130</b> that is formed in n− well <b>114</b>, a spaced-apart n+ region <b>132</b> that is formed in n− well <b>114</b>, and a p+ region <b>134</b> that is formed in p− substrate <b>110</b>. Further, semiconductor structure <b>100</b> has a top surface <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In operation, semiconductor structure <b>100</b> can represent the elements of a number of devices such as, for example, a MOS transistor (e.g., HVPMOS, isolated NMOS, LDMOS arrays) a bipolar transistor (e.g., npn, npn arrays), and a resistor (e.g., p-well, p-base). With a MOS device, p-type region <b>130</b> represents a p+ source region, n+ region <b>132</b> represents a contact region for n− well <b>114</b>, and p+ region <b>134</b> represents the contact region for p− substrate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a MOS device also has a p+ drain region that is formed in n− well <b>114</b>, and a channel region that is defined between source region <b>130</b> and the drain region. In addition, a layer of oxide is formed over the channel region, and a gate is formed on the layer of oxide over the channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With a bipolar device, p-type region <b>130</b> represents a p− base region, n+ region <b>132</b> represents a collector contact region for n− well <b>114</b>, and p+ region <b>134</b> represents the contact region for p− substrate <b>110</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an n+ emitter region is also formed in p− base region <b>130</b>. With a resistor, p-type region <b>130</b> represents the resistor, n+ region <b>132</b> represents a contact region for n− well <b>114</b>, and p+ region <b>134</b> represents the contact region for p− substrate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One problem with semiconductor structure <b>100</b> is that semiconductor structure <b>100</b> is subject to a significant trench leakage current that results from deep trench isolation structure <b>118</b>. When poly-filled deep trench isolation structures are utilized, the polysilicon region, such as polysilicon region <b>124</b>, has a potential which is defined by the voltage on the adjacent regions and the capacitive coupling of oxide layer <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some cases, the potential can be sufficient to form a parasitic channel region adjacent to the deep trench isolation structures which, in turn, provides a pathway for the trench leakage current. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when a channel region is present, a trench leakage current IL can flow from p-type region <b>130</b> to p− substrate <b>110</b>, or from p− substrate <b>110</b> to p-type region <b>130</b>, along the side walls of trench isolation structure <b>118</b>, depending on the relative voltages on p− substrate <b>110</b> and p-type region <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The leakage current IL represents different leakage currents (or components of it) in actual devices. For example, in MOS and LDMOS devices, the leakage can appear as a sub-threshold drain-to-source leakage current Idss<b>0</b>. In bipolar devices, the leakage may appear as a base-to-substrate leakage current Ibs, or a collector-to-base leakage current Icbo. In arrays, the leakage can appear as a yield issue if the detected level is high.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various steps can be taken to reduce the trench leakage current IL. For example, in a low-voltage bipolar example, the trench leakage current IL can be reduced by ensuring that p− base region <b>130</b> lies a sufficient distance X away from oxide layer <b>122</b>. In a high-voltage lateral DMOS (LDMOS) example, the trench leakage current IL can be reduced by placing an n+ guard ring between oxide layer <b>122</b> and p-type region <b>130</b>. In a low-voltage bipolar example, the trench leakage current IL can be reduced by the insertion of a highly-doped guard ring in between the trench and p-type region <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Manufactured parts which have the elements of semiconductor structure <b>100</b> can be tested to ensure that the trench leakage current IL falls within specified limits. One standard bipolar test which is often used as a measure of the trench leakage current IL is a bipolar breakdown voltage base-substrate-open (BVbso) test, which measures the current across the junction between p− substrate <b>110</b> and n+ buried layer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following Table 1 illustrates an example of a conventional bipolar BVbso test, with the rows representing the successive steps in the test.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in the first row of Table 1, p− substrate <b>110</b> is grounded via p+ region <b>134</b>, n+ buried layer <b>112</b> and n− well <b>114</b> (the substrate) float via n+ region <b>132</b> which is open (not connected to a voltage source), and a positive voltage Vbias is applied to p-type region <b>130</b> (the base).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">After the voltages have been applied, a current is measured at p-type region <b>130</b>. Following this, the voltage applied to p-type region <b>130</b> is progressively lowered and the current measured until breakdown or punchthrough occurs (at Vbias-BD), at which time the magnitude of the current measured at p-type region <b>130</b> increases substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One problem with the bipolar BVbso test, however, is that the bipolar BVbso test is a poor measure of the trench leakage current, and tends to produce incorrect results which are more optimistic than is the actual case. Thus, there is a need for a method of measuring the trench leakage current of a deep trench isolation structure that provides more accurate results.</p>

This is because when a voltage is placed on n+ region <b>112</b> and n− well <b>114</b> that represents a typical well voltage that is used during normal operation, the potential on polysilicon region <b>124</b> represents a more accurate summation of all of the capacitively coupled voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, at <b>212</b>, as shown in the fourth column of Table 2, a trench leakage current IL<b>1</b> is measured at p-type region <b>130</b>. For example, when ground is applied to p− substrate <b>110</b> and lateral region <b>116</b>, a voltage near ground is capacitively coupled to polysilicon region <b>124</b> which, in turn, attracts holes to the interface between n+ buried layer <b>112</b>/n− well <b>114</b> and oxide layer <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When a sufficient voltage difference exists between p− substrate <b>110</b> and p-type region <b>130</b>, a hole current, which represents the trench leakage current IL, can flow between p− substrate <b>110</b> and p-type region <b>130</b>, along the interface between n+ buried layer <b>112</b>/n− well <b>114</b> and oxide layer <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Following this, at <b>214</b>, the trench leakage current IL<b>1</b> is compared to a range of acceptable values to determine if the current IL<b>1</b> falls within the range of acceptable values. When the trench leakage current IL<b>1</b> falls within the range of acceptable values, structure <b>100</b> passes the test.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, at <b>216</b>, when the trench leakage current IL<b>1</b> falls outside of the range of acceptable values, one or more of the test voltages are changed. A junction between n− well <b>114</b> and p-type region <b>130</b> is reverse biased following the change. The application of a reverse bias across the junction between n− well <b>114</b> and p-type region <b>130</b> enhances the detection of leakage components.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second row of Table 2 illustrates an example of the test voltages that can be used in <b>216</b>. As shown in the second row of Table 2, the test voltages can be changed by only reducing the voltage applied to p-type region <b>130</b> by a first amount to a voltage Vbias −1, with the other test voltages remaining the same. (The same result can be obtained by altering other test voltages.)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, at <b>218</b>, as shown in the fourth column of Table 2, a trench leakage current IL<b>2</b> is measured at p-type region <b>130</b>. Following this, at <b>220</b>, the trench leakage current IL<b>2</b> is compared to the range of acceptable values to determine if the current IL<b>2</b> falls within the range of acceptable values. When the trench leakage current IL<b>2</b> falls within the range of acceptable values, structure <b>100</b> passes the test.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, at <b>222</b>, when the trench leakage current IL<b>2</b> falls outside of the range of acceptable values, one or more of the test voltages are changed to increase the reverse bias across the junction between n− well <b>114</b> and p-type region <b>130</b>. The third row of Table 2 illustrates an example of the test voltages that can be used in <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in the third row of Table 2, the test voltages can be altered by only reducing the voltage applied to p-type region <b>130</b> by a second amount to a voltage Vbias −2, with the other test voltages remaining the same. (The same result can be obtained by altering other test voltages.)</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, at <b>224</b>, as shown in the fourth column of Table 2, a trench leakage current IL<b>3</b> is measured at p-type region <b>130</b>. Following this, at <b>226</b>, the trench leakage current IL<b>3</b> is compared to the range of acceptable values to determine if the current IL<b>3</b> falls within the range of acceptable values. When the trench leakage current IL<b>3</b> falls within the range of acceptable values, structure <b>100</b> passes the test.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, when the trench leakage current IL<b>3</b> falls outside of the range of acceptable values, one or more of the test voltages are changed to further increase the reverse bias across the junction between n− well <b>114</b> and p-type region <b>130</b>. This process continues until structure <b>100</b> passes the test, or the bias on p− region <b>130</b> reaches zero volts. At zero volts, both p− substrate <b>110</b> and p+ region <b>130</b> have the same bias so no leakage current can flow.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in Table 2, any number N of voltages can be applied to p-type region <b>130</b>, depending on the required testing. In this example, the test voltages represent voltages that can be present during normal operation. In addition, the testing can continue with additional test voltages below ground placed on p-type region <b>130</b> until break down or punchthrough occurs, and provide a BVbso-type test when structure <b>100</b> represents a bipolar device.</p>
