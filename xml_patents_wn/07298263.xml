<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0003">The invention concerns, generally, the sector of information technologies and in particular that of the identification by radio frequency, known under the Anglo-Saxon acronym RFID (for “Radio Frequency Identification”).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0004">More precisely, the invention relates to a control and/or monitoring device including at least a first pair of interactive elements made of an electronic label and of an electronic tag reader in mutual communication by means of respective radio aerials, the reader feeding the label with electrical energy in an electro-magnetic way and the label comprising a memory in which is saved an identification code which is specific to it and that it selectively transmits to the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">The electronic labels, still called “radio tags”, “smart tags”, or “smart cards”, an Anglo-Saxon equivalent name to “étiquettes intelligentes”, are today largely used in many automatic identification applications and in particular in theft security systems, counterfeit protection, the management of materials handling supports, the control of goods dispatching or reception, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">The invention, which is based on the identification of a need until now latent, aims at widening the application field of these labels.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">For this purpose, the inventive device, is primarily characterised by the fact that it includes a state encoder belonging, at least to some extent, to the label and producing a status signal representative of a logical or analogical status affecting the label or a relation between the label and the reader and by the fact that the status signal is transmitted by the label to the reader or directly read by this reader.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">Thanks to this fixture, the reader disposes, in form of the status signal, of an information which not only is richer than a simple identification code insofar as it is connected to the local physical environment of the label, but which additionally is, by construction, correlated with this identification code.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the label is mobile compared to the reader, and the status signal is representative of a relative position of the label compared to the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">Under these conditions, the couple formed by the label and the reader fulfills the function that an electrical contact connected to a mechanical action fulfills, with the additional advantage that this contact disposes of an own identification thanks to the identification code of the label.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The state encoder can include at least a permanent magnet carried by one of the elements of the first pair of interactive elements and a magnetic field sensor carried by the other element of this first pair of interactive elements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">It is for example possible to provide that the state encoder permanently includes primarily a pair of magnetized tracks, distant the one from the other, carried by the label and a pair of corresponding Hall effect sensors carried by the reader. The magnetized tracks are laid out compared to the corresponding Hall effect sensors for a relative reference position of the label compared to the reader and only for this position. The status signal takes at least two different principal logical values according to whether the label is or not, in its relative reference position compared to the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">A maximum discrimination of the various states can be obtained by providing that the tracks of the pair of magnetized tracks have reversed polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">In a first possible embodiment, the label is for example physically guided, compared to the reader, between the relative reference position and a plurality of distant positions while passing by at least one of the two intermediate relative positions in each one of whose only one magnetized track is detected by a Hall effect sensor and the status signal takes at least two different secondary logical values according to whether the label is, or is not, in one of the intermediate relative positions.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">The label can thus be guided in translation movement, compared to the reader, along a translation axis, the magnetized tracks being distant one from the other along this translation axis and possibly being inclined compared to this same translation axis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">In this case, the label takes for example the form of a card, the reader being at least partially flat.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">In another embodiment, the label is for example guided in rotation, compared to the reader, along a rotational axis, the magnetized tracks being angularly distant one from the other by rotation around the rotational axis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">In this case, the label takes advantageously a cylindrical form, the reader itself being at least partially cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">Practically, the reader typically includes a power supply circuit and pulse shaper belonging to the state encoder and connected to the Hall effect sensors and a communication circuit connected to the aerial of this reader.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">Under these conditions, the communication circuit can adopt, at least selectively, a passive state and an active state and the status signal can make the communication circuit go from its passive state to its active state at the time of the passage of the corresponding label from a distant relative position to an intermediate relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">The inventive device is particularly advantageous if it includes several pairs of interactive elements, each of which includes an electronic label and a tag reader. The readers of the various pairs of interactive elements are connected to a communication network and all the labels of the various pairs have different identification codes.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">It is then possible to equip this device with a polling circuit connected to the communication network, communicating periodically with each reader. Each reader reads off the identification code of the associated label in so far as this reader and the associated label are in their reference relative position. Each reader transmits to the polling circuit the identification code of the associated label in so far as it was read off and the polling circuit compares each identification code which is transmitted to it to a memorized reference code and produces an anomaly signal in the event of absence of the one of the codes to be compared or of disparity of the compared codes.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0040">This state transducer, which belongs at least to some extent to the label <b>1</b>, has as a function to produce a status signal, noted STAT, representative of a logical or analogical state specific to the pair P of interactive elements.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">More precisely, the status signal STAT relates to a state affecting the label <b>1</b> or a relation between the label <b>1</b> and reader <b>2</b>, and this status signal STAT is transmitted by the label <b>1</b> to the reader <b>2</b>, or directly read by this reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">If the STAT signal relates to a state affecting the label <b>1</b>, the STAT signal can represent any physical parameter to which the label <b>1</b> is subordinated, for example a pressure, whereas the transducer <b>3</b> will be composed by a pressure transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">If the STAT signal relates to a relation between the label <b>1</b> and the reader <b>2</b>, this relation can be composed by a relative position of these two elements, as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">In this case, the label <b>1</b> is mobile compared to the reader <b>2</b>, and the STAT status signal is then representative of the relative position adopted at every moment by the label <b>1</b> compared to the reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">For example, the state encoder includes one or more permanent magnets, such as <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>, carried by one of the elements of the first pair P of interactive elements, in fact by the label <b>1</b> and one or more magnetic field sensors, such as <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, carried by the other element of this first pair P of interactive elements, in fact by the reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3C</figref> illustrate a realisation mode in which the transducer <b>3</b> belonging to the state encoder includes two magnetised tracks, <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>, magnetised in a permanent way, distant the one from the other and carried by the label <b>1</b> and two corresponding Hall effect sensors, <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, carried by the reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>are laid out in relation to the corresponding Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>for a reference relative position of the label <b>1</b> compared to the reader <b>2</b>, shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, and only for this position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">The Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>are connected to a electrical power supply circuit and pulse shaper <b>21</b>, which produces the STAT status signal and provides it to the control circuit <b>23</b>, this signal taking at least two different principal logical values, according to whether the label <b>1</b> is, or not, in its reference relative position compared to the reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">In other words, whatever the number of bits being used to code the STAT status signal, the code representative of this signal start with a bit of strong weight equal to “1” or with “0” (or the reverse) according to whether the label <b>1</b> is, or not, in its reference relative position compared to the reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">To increase the number of states likely to be discriminated the ones from the others the magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>have preferably reversed polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> represent in a simplified way a realisation mode in which the label <b>1</b> is physically guided compared to the reader <b>2</b> and can be pushed, along a translation axis X, up to its reference position towards the force exerted by a spring <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> represents the label <b>1</b> in a distant position compared to the reader <b>2</b>, i.e. in a position in which none of the Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>detects one of the magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>and in which the aerials <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are too much shifted apart, the one compared to the other, to allow a communication between the reader <b>2</b> and the label <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> represents the label <b>1</b> in a position known as “intermediate” compared to the reader <b>2</b>, i.e. in a position in which one of the Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>detects one of the magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>, although the aerials <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are still too much shifted apart, the one compared to the other, to allow a communication between the reader <b>2</b> and the label <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">Two intermediate positions are a priori possible, namely the one in which the sensor <b>32</b><i>b </i>detects the magnetised track <b>31</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) and the one in which the sensor <b>32</b><i>a </i>detects the magnetised track <b>31</b><i>b</i>, even if the relative movement of the label <b>1</b> compared to the reader <b>2</b> can be limited by stops to prohibit the label to reach for example the second intermediate position.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">The STAT status signal produced by the electrical power supply circuit and pulse shaper <b>21</b> takes at least two different secondary logical values, according to whether the label <b>1</b> is, or not, in one of the intermediate relative positions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">In other words, whatever the number of bits being used to code the STAT status signal, the code representative of this signal comprises, after the bit of strong weight whose value indicates if the label <b>1</b> is, or not, in its reference relative position compared to the reader <b>2</b>, a second bit whose value indicates if label <b>1</b> is, or not, in one of its intermediate relative positions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">If the label <b>1</b> is guided in translation movement compared to the reader <b>2</b> along a translation axis X and, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>are distant the one from the other along this translation axis X, as also are the Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">To make the detection via the Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>of magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>more progressive, these tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>are advantageously tilted compared to the translation axis X.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">The label <b>1</b> and the reader <b>2</b> can assume a priori several forms.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">In particular, label <b>1</b> can either take the form of a card (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3C</figref>), in which case the reader <b>2</b> is at least partially flat, or a cylindrical form (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>), in which case the reader <b>2</b> itself is at least partially cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">Moreover, instead of being guided in translation movement compared to reader <b>2</b>, the label <b>1</b> can be guided in rotational movement compared to the reader <b>2</b> around an axis of rotation Y (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), in which case the magnetised tracks <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>are angularly distant the one from the other by rotation around the rotation axis Y, as also are the Hall effect sensors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">To avoid the necessity of supplying the aerial <b>20</b> in a permanent way, it can be convenient to provide that the communication circuit <b>22</b> is by default in a passive state, in which the aerial <b>20</b> is not supplied and that this communication circuit <b>22</b> is only moved to an active state, in which the aerial <b>20</b> is supplied, for certain relative positions of the label <b>1</b> compared to the reader <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">For example, when label <b>1</b> moves from a distant relative position to an intermediate relative position, i.e. when the second strong weight bit of the STAT status signal transmitted to the control circuit <b>23</b> changes value, this control circuit <b>23</b> can make the communication circuit <b>22</b> moves from its passive state to its active state, this operating mode avoiding the permanent feeding of the aerial <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">The invention device develops the its greatest number of advantages when it includes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) a communication network <b>4</b>, for example formed by a bus <b>40</b> or including it, several pairs of interactive elements <b>15</b> such as P and P′ connected to the network <b>4</b> and a polling circuit <b>5</b> itself connected to different pairs of interactive elements P and P′ by means of the communication network <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">Each pair of interactive elements, such as P and P′, includes an electronic label, such as <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>′ and a tag reader, such as <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>′, the readers of the various pairs P and P′ of the interactive elements being connected to the polling circuit <b>5</b> by the communication network <b>4</b> and all the labels of the various pairs P and P′ of the interactive elements having different identification codes, such as KID<b>1</b> and KID<b>1</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">The control circuit <b>23</b> of each reader, such as <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>′, is for example programmed so as to transmit to the corresponding label <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>′, by means of the communication circuit <b>22</b>, a transmission request of the identification code KID<b>1</b> or KID′ of this label <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>′, when the STAT status signal received by the control circuit <b>23</b> of this reader <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>′ indicates that this same reader, and the associated labels <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>′, are in their reference relative position, and only in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">If such is the case, the label <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>′ reads its identification code KID<b>1</b> or KID<b>1</b>′ in its memory <b>111</b> and retransmits it to the associated reader <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">The reader <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>′, in so far as it has acquired the identification code KID<b>1</b> or KID′ of the associated label <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>′, retransmits this code to the polling circuit <b>5</b> by means of the network display unit circuit and/or network interface circuit <b>24</b> of this reader and of the network <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">The polling circuit <b>5</b>, which communicates periodically with each reader such as <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>′, is able to receive the identification code conditionally emitted by each reader and to identify the origin of it.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">This polling circuit <b>5</b> has a memory <b>51</b> in which reference codes such as KMM and KMM′ are saved, each one of these codes being representative of the identification code that one of the readers, such as <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>′, is specifically supposed to emit and these reference codes being memorised in a given polling order of the various readers.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">With the polling of each reader, such as <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>′, the polling circuit compares the identification code, such as KID<b>1</b> or KID<b>1</b>′, transmitted by this reader with the corresponding memorised reference code, KMM or KMM′.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">If the identification code KID<b>1</b> or KID<b>1</b>′ is not provided by the polled reader, which means that this reader and the corresponding label are not in their reference position, or if the identification code KID<b>1</b> or KID<b>1</b>′ provided by the polled reader differs from the code KMM or KMM′ which it should have produced, which means that an inversion has occurred between two labels, the polling circuit <b>5</b> produces a anomaly signal WARN, whose value preferably makes it possible to distinguish, the one from the other, these two types of anomaly.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">If various identification codes, such as KID<b>1</b> and KID<b>1</b>′, are provided by the various polled readers and match with the respective reference codes memorised, such as KMM and KMM′, the polling circuit <b>5</b> continues its normal operation and proceeds to a new polling phase.</p>
