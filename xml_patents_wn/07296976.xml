<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention was made under U.S. Government Contract Number N0019-02-3003 awarded by the Navy, and the Navy may have certain rights in the present invention.</p>
<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a system for correcting an unbalance in rotating components that can result in an unacceptable level of vibration during operation. More specifically, in one form the present invention relates to a balancing system including two mass asymmetric rings that are coupled to the rotating component through a splined interface. Although the present invention was developed for balancing gas turbine engine components, application in other areas of technology are contemplated herein, such as high speed machine tool applications, gearboxes, actuators and motors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is recognized that gas turbine engines include components that rotate at high rates of speed. The dynamic unbalance of the components can lead to severe vibration that reduces the useful life of the component.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The engineers and scientists developing gas turbine engine technology recognize that one can add or remove material at select locations to achieve proper balance for the component. Many of the techniques included the addition and removal of separate balance weights from the component and the actual removal of material from the component. The prior balancing techniques that relied upon the adding of separable balance weights are often limited by issues such as: configuration management and structural integrity of the separable weights, additional part count, and lack of flexibility in adjustment. In many of the prior techniques to balance the component, the component had to be removed and sent to a machine shop for machining, which is time consuming and adds the possibility of a machining error in the process. Alternatively, the component may have been hand machined without removal from the machine. In either case, the machining of the component to perfect a balance condition can be very difficult and in many cases any error in machining is irreversible.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although there are currently many methods to reduce unbalance conditions in rotatable components there remains a significant need for further technological solutions in this area. The present invention satisfies this need and others in a novel and unobvious way.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is set forth literally in the claims. More generally, invention can be summarized as a method and/or system for balancing a rotatable gas turbine engine component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One form of the present invention contemplates a system comprising: a rotatable gas turbine engine component adapted to rotate about a centerline, the component including a first circular portion having a first splined surface with a plurality of first spline teeth; and, a pair of counterweight rings located adjacent one another and rotatable with the component, each of the rings having a mass asymmetric portion that is positioned relative to the component to effect an unbalance condition of the component and a second circular portion including a second splined surface with a plurality of second spline teeth for coupling with the plurality of first spline teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another form of the present invention contemplates a system comprising: a rotatable gas turbine engine member having a surface with a plurality of first serrations; a first continuous ring having a mass asymmetry, the first continuous ring having a first surface with a plurality of second serrations configured to engage with the plurality of first serrations; a second continuous ring having a mass asymmetry, the second continuous ring having a surface with a plurality of third serrations configured to engage with the plurality of first serration; and, each of the rings are indexable relative to the member independent of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another form of the present invention contemplates a method of balancing a rotatable gas turbine engine component with two balance rings having an imbalance. The method comprising: determining the orientation of each of the two balance rings to locate a mass imbalance portion of each of the balance rings relative to the component to effect an unbalance correction of the rotatable component; mating the spline teeth of a first one of the balance rings with the spline teeth of the component to position the mass imbalance portion of the first one of the balance rings proximate the orientation in the determining act; positioning a second one of the balance rings adjacent the first one of the balance rings; mating the spline teeth of the second one of the balance rings with the spline teeth of the component to position the mass imbalance portion of the second one of the balance rings proximate the orientation from the determining act; and, restraining movement of the two balance rings relative to the component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another form the present invention contemplates a system comprising: a gas turbine engine component that is rotatable about a centerline, the component including a bore extending parallel with the centerline and having a plurality of first spline teeth; two balance correction rings located non-concentrically and adjacent one another and within the bore, each of the rings is coupled with the plurality of first spline teeth by a corresponding plurality of second spline teeth defined on each of the rings, and each of the rings having a mass imbalance portion that is located relative to the component to effect an unbalance correction of the component.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another form the present invention contemplates a system comprising: a rotatable gas turbine engine member having a circular outer surface with a plurality of first splines; a first continuous ring having a mass asymmetry, the first continuous ring having an inner surface with a plurality of second splines configured to engage with the plurality of first serrations; a second continuous ring having a mass asymmetry, the second continuous ring having an inner surface with a plurality of third splines configured to engage with the plurality of first splines; and, each of the rings are indexable relative to the member independent of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One object of the present invention is to provide a unique system for balancing a rotatable gas turbine engine component.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Related objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes that component <b>20</b> is rotatable about a longitudinal centerline X. In balancing a component with the present invention the operating speeds contemplated for the gas turbine engine components to be balanced are within a range of 3,000 to 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), and preferably within a range of 3,000 to 10,000 RPM. However, other operating speeds are fully contemplated herein. In one form the component <b>20</b> has an opening/recess <b>21</b> at one end. An axial stop <b>22</b> is located within the component and limits the distance that the counterweight balance rings <b>40</b> can be positioned within the opening/recess <b>21</b>. In one form the counterweight balance rings are positioned adjacent to one another and are non-concentric. The application contemplates that the opening/recess <b>21</b> can extend only a partial length of the component or may extend the entire length of the component <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Opening/recess <b>21</b> has a portion with a circular inner surface including a spline <b>30</b> formed thereon. In one form a wall of the component <b>20</b> defines the opening/recess <b>21</b>. The term spline as utilized herein is intended to be read broadly and includes, but is not limited to, serrations, teeth, notches key slots, and index holes unless specifically provided to the contrary. The spline <b>30</b> is preferably defined by a plurality of spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>that are spaced around the circumference of the circular inner surface. However, the present invention also contemplates that there may only be a few teeth/serrations in the spline. In one form the spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>are circumferentially spaced around a substantial majority of the component. In another form the spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>are circumferentially spaced around the entire circular inner surface. The spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>in one embodiment are formed substantially parallel with the centerline X, however other geometric relationships between the spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the centerline X are contemplated herein. In one form the spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>have a pitch within a range of about 16 to 40 teeth/inch, however other pitches are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The counterweight balance rings <b>40</b> are preferably a continuous hoop structure that has a circular external surface sized to fit within the opening/recess <b>21</b>. In one form of the present invention the counterweight balance rings are substantially identical. The continuous hoop structure defines a continuous ring that is not interrupted as in a split ring. In one form the counterweight balance rings <b>40</b> are capable of carrying their own centrifugal load at the rotational speeds associated with the rotating component. Each of the counterweight balance rings <b>40</b> have a substantially constant outer diameter including a circular outer surface with a spline <b>80</b> formed thereon. The spline <b>80</b> is preferably defined by a plurality of spline teeth <b>80</b><i>a </i>that are spaced around the circumference of the circular outer surface. In one form the spline teeth <b>80</b><i>a </i>are circumferentially spaced around a substantial majority of the counterweight balance ring <b>40</b>. However, in another form the spline teeth <b>80</b><i>a </i>are circumferentially spaced around the entire circular outer surface. Spline teeth <b>80</b><i>a </i>are preferably formed substantially parallel with the centerline X, however other geometric relationships between the spline teeth <b>80</b><i>a </i>and the centerline X are contemplated herein. The spline teeth <b>80</b><i>a </i>are configured to engage with the spline teeth <b>30</b><i>a </i>to couple the counterweight balance ring <b>40</b> to the component <b>20</b> and limit the circumferential and radial motion between each of the counterweight balance rings <b>40</b> and the component <b>20</b> during rotational movement of the component. Counterweight balance rings <b>40</b> are coupled to and rotate with the component <b>20</b>.</p>
