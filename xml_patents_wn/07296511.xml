<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a rice huller for grain, and in particular, to a rice hulling roll driving apparatus in the rice huller.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional rice hullers of this kind, a pulley and a driving motor attached to respective roll shafts of a pair of rice hulling rolls (main shaft roll and sub shaft roll) are connected together via an endless belt. These rice hulling rolls, that is, a high- and low-speed side rice hulling rolls, have respective constant rotational frequencies. The high-speed side rice hulling roll is more significantly worn than the low-speed rice hulling roll. A continuous rice hulling operation gradually reduces the outer diameter of the high-speed side rice hulling roll, thereby reducing the difference in peripheral speed between the high- and low-speed side rice hulling rolls. In this case, the high-speed rice hulling roll needs to be replaced with a rice hulling roll having a larger diameter than the low-speed rice hulling roll.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a rice huller configured as described below has been proposed (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-38230). Driving motors having adjustable rotational frequencies are connected to the respective roll shafts of the high- and low-speed side rice hulling rolls. Sensors are provided each of which senses the rotational frequency and outer diameter of the corresponding rice hulling roll. When the difference in peripheral speed between the rice hulling rolls which is determined by the sensors is equal to or smaller than a predetermined value, the rotational frequency of each rice hulling roll is adjusted to maintain a predetermined difference in peripheral speed. This rice huller thus eliminates the need to replace the rice hulling rolls with new ones.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the driving apparatus in the conventional, common rice huller, the paired rice hulling rolls rotate almost in contact with each other via unhulled rice as material. This causes each rice hulling roll to exert a repulsive force. These repulsive forces act in a direction in which an endless belt, passed between the pulleys attached to the respective roll shafts in a manner such that these pulleys rotate in directions opposite to each other, is tensed. The reaction forces thus offset each other. This phenomenon will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A high-speed side rice hulling roll pulley <b>100</b> and a low-speed side rice hulling roll pulley <b>102</b> are driven by an endless belt <b>106</b> diagonally passed between the pulleys, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The rice hulling pulleys <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> then rotate at different speeds in directions opposite to each other. This causes each of paired rice hulling rolls <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> to exert a repulsive force during rice hulling. Specifically, the high-speed side rice hulling roll <b>101</b> exerts a force F<b>1</b> acting in an anti-rotational direction under the effect of the low-speed side rice hulling roll <b>103</b>. In contrast, the low-speed side rice hulling roll <b>103</b> exerts a force F<b>2</b> acting in a rotational direction under the effect of the high-speed side rice hulling roll <b>101</b>. The forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> act to tense the endless belt <b>106</b>, passed between the paired pulleys <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, to maintain the gap between the rolls. This enables a rice hulling operation to be smoothly performed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-38230 connects the different driving motors to the high- and low-speed side rice hulling rolls. Thus, avoiding the repulsive forces (F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>) of the rolls, which may be exerted during rice hulling, disadvantageously requires a driving force strong enough to make these repulsive forces negligible.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a driving apparatus in a rice huller which does not require a strong driving force and which enables a rice hulling operation without the need to replace rice hulling rolls with new ones.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the rice hulling roll driving apparatus in a rice huller according to the present invention, a first roll shaft is provided with a first small-diameter pulley, a second roll shaft is provided with a first large-diameter pulley, and the first small-diameter pulley, the first large-diameter pulley, and a driving pulley for a first motor are connected together via a first endless belt, so that a first and second rice hulling rolls, which constitute paired rice hulling rolls, rotate at different peripheral speeds in directions opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first roll shaft is provided with a second large-diameter pulley in addition to the first small-diameter pulley, the second roll shaft is provided with a second small-diameter pulley in addition to the first large-diameter pulley, and the second large-diameter pulley, the second small-diameter pulley, and a driving pulley for a second motor are connected together via a second endless belt.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first small-diameter pulley and the second large-diameter pulley are attached to the first roll shaft so that each of the pulleys may rotate with respect to the first roll shaft, and the first large-diameter pulley and the second small-diameter pulley are attached to the second roll shaft so that each of the pulleys may rotate with respect to the second roll shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Transmission switching means is provided between the first small-diameter pulley and the second large-diameter pulley, which are attached to the first roll shaft, and between the first large-diameter pulley and the second small-diameter pulley, which are attached to the second roll shaft, so as to transmit rotation of the pulleys to the corresponding roll shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">And, the transmission switching means comprises a slidable cylinder provided so as to be movable in a direction of each roll shaft, a large diameter portion provided around an outer periphery of the slidable cylinder, a spline shaft formed on the large-diameter portion in order to fit into a boss portion of each of the pulley, a spring that always urges the slidable cylinder toward the pulley attached to the roll shaft at the end thereof, and an air chamber into which compressed air is fed to cause the slidable cylinder to slide against an urging force of the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the rice hulling roll driving apparatus in the rice huller constructed as described above, the first endless belt may be passed around the driving pulley for the first motor, the first small-diameter pulley, and the first large-diameter pulley, in a manner such that the inner surface of the first endless belt is in contact with the driving pulley and the first small-diameter pulley, while the outer surface of the first endless belt is in contact with the first large-diameter pulley, and the second endless belt may be passed around the driving pulley for the second motor, the second small-diameter pulley, and the second large-diameter pulley, in a manner such that the inner surface of the second endless belt is in contact with the driving pulley and the second small-diameter pulley, while the outer surface of the second endless belt is in contact with the second large-diameter pulley, so that these rice hulling rolls rotate in directions opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the above configuration in accordance with the present invention, when the high-speed side rice hulling roll is worn, the transmission switching means performs a switching operation so that the current low-speed side rice hulling roll will be used as a high-speed side rice hulling roll. On the other hand, the current high-speed side rice hulling roll will be used as a low-speed side rice hulling roll. This eliminates the need to manually replace the rice hulling rolls with new ones. Further, as an endless belt is passed between the pulley of paired rice hulling rolls so that these pulleys rotates in directions different from each other, as in the case of prior art, inappropriate rice hulling that may result from the repulsive force of the pair of rice hulling rolls does not occur. The present invention therefore provides a driving apparatus of rice hulling rolls in a rice huller which eliminates the need to use a strong driving force otherwise required to avoid the repulsive force of the pair of rolls and which eliminates the need to manually replace the rice hulling rolls with new ones.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a vertically sectional view of a rice huller comprising a roll driving apparatus in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A first rice hulling roll <b>3</b> and a second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> are arranged in a machine frame <b>2</b>. The first rice hulling roll <b>3</b> is rotatably supported around a first roll shaft <b>5</b>. The second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> is rotatably attached to a second roll shaft <b>6</b> so as to adjustably approach and leave the first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>. The first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> rotate at different speeds in directions opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A supply port <b>7</b> which supplies grain to be hulled is formed at the top of the machine frame <b>2</b>. A vibrating feeder <b>8</b> is provided immediately below the supply port <b>7</b> and can adjust the flow rate of grain. A guide chute <b>9</b> is further provided immediately below the vibrating feeder <b>8</b> at a predetermined angle of inclination so as to guide grain which has fallen from the vibrating feeder <b>8</b> toward the area between the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The guide chute <b>9</b> has a width (size in vertical direction of sheet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) almost equal to that of the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. When the straight line joining the first roll shaft <b>5</b> with the second roll shaft <b>6</b> crosses the trajectory of grain flung out of the guide chute <b>9</b> at almost the right angles, the grain being supplied to the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> is prevented from being flicked away and displaced. This prevents the grain from being crushed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a rear perspective view showing an embodiment of a rice hulling driving apparatus in a rice huller in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A first driving motor <b>10</b> is provided in the center of the machine frame <b>2</b>. A second driving motor <b>11</b> is provided on a left side surface of the machine frame <b>2</b>. A first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> is rotatively attached to the first roll shaft <b>5</b> on the outer side therof. A first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> is rotatively attached to the second roll shaft <b>6</b> on the outer side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An endless belt <b>14</b> is passed around the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> and first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b>, a driving pulley <b>12</b> for a first driving motor <b>10</b>, and an idler pulley <b>20</b> provided below the first driving motor <b>10</b> to form a first driving system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The endless belt <b>14</b> in the first driving system is diagonally passed between the first small-diameter pulleys <b>16</b> and the first large-diameter pulleys <b>18</b> so that the first small-diameter pulleys <b>16</b> and the first large-diameter pulleys <b>18</b> rotate in directions opposite to each other, with the inner surface of the endless belt <b>14</b> in contact with first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> and with the outer surface thereof in contact with the first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b>. This endless belt <b>14</b> is driven so as to rotate leftward as viewed from the rear of the rice huller <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> is further rotatably attached to the first roll shaft <b>5</b> in proximity to the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> between the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> and the first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>. A second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b> is further rotatably attached to the second roll shaft <b>6</b> in proximity to the first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> between the first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> and the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b>. An endless belt <b>15</b> is passed around the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b>, the second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b>, a driving pulley <b>13</b> for a second driving motor <b>11</b>, and an idler pulley <b>21</b> to form a second driving system.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The endless belt <b>15</b> in the second driving system is diagonally passed between the second large-diameter pulleys <b>17</b> and the second small-diameter pulleys <b>19</b> so that the second large-diameter pulleys <b>17</b> and the second small-diameter pulleys <b>19</b> rotate in directions opposite to each other, with the outer surface of the endless belt <b>15</b> in contact with the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> and with the inner surface thereof in contact with the second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partly enlarged sectional view showing transmission switching means in accordance with the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are schematic diagrams showing the procedure of operations of the transmission switching means.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transmission switching means is provided for each of the first and second roll shafts <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The transmission switching means on the side of the first roll shaft <b>5</b> is mounted so as to lie between the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> and second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> of the first roll shaft <b>5</b> and touch internally with either of the pulleys <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>. Specifically, the top of a key <b>47</b> provided on the first roll shaft <b>5</b> is fitted into a key groove <b>50</b> in a slidable cylinder <b>30</b>. The slidable cylinder <b>30</b> can then slide along the key <b>47</b> in the axial direction of the first roll shaft <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The slidable cylinder <b>30</b> is provided with a larger diameter portion <b>49</b> around its outer periphery. A plurality of key grooves are formed in the larger diameter portion <b>49</b> to constitute a spline shaft <b>46</b>. On the other hand, a plurality of key grooves are formed in boss portions of the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> and second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> to constitute spline bosses <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>. The spline shaft <b>46</b> of the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> is selectively connected (spline coupling) to either the spline boss <b>44</b> of the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> or the spline boss <b>45</b> of the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> to transmit power to the selected pulley.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Like the transmission switching means on the side of the first roll shaft <b>5</b>, the transmission switching means on the side of the second roll shaft <b>6</b> is mounted so as to lie between the first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> and second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b> of the second roll shaft <b>6</b> and touch internally with either of the pulleys <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. Specifically, the top of a key <b>48</b> provided on the second roll shaft <b>6</b> is fitted into a key groove (not shown) in a slidable cylinder <b>31</b>. The slidable cylinder <b>31</b> can then slide along the key <b>48</b> in the axial direction of the second roll shaft <b>6</b>. The slidable cylinder <b>31</b> is provided with a larger diameter portion (not shown) around its outer periphery. A plurality of key grooves are formed in the larger diameter portion to constitute a spline shaft (not shown). On the other hand, a plurality of key grooves are formed in boss portions of the first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> and second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b> to constitute spline bosses (not shown). The spline shaft of the slidable cylinder <b>31</b> is selectively connected to either the spline boss of the first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> or the spline boss of the second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b> to transmit power to the selected pulley.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transmission switching means on the side of the first roll shaft <b>5</b> has the same configuration as that of the transmission switching means on the side of the second roll shaft <b>6</b>. Thus, only the transmission switching means for the first roll shaft <b>5</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A spring <b>43</b> is interposed between the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> and the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b>. The spring <b>43</b> always urges the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> toward the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> to engage the spline shaft <b>46</b> with the spline boss <b>44</b>. This allows the rotative driving force of the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> to be transmitted to the first roll shaft <b>5</b> via the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> (first system driving state; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An air chamber <b>42</b> is provided in a gap defined by the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> and the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b>. An air pipe <b>41</b> is formed in the roll shaft <b>5</b> to supply and discharge air to and from the air chamber <b>42</b>. Compressed air is fed to the air chamber <b>42</b> via the air pipe <b>41</b> to expand the air chamber <b>42</b>. This causes the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> to slide along the key <b>47</b> toward the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> against the urging force of the spring <b>43</b>. Then, the spline shaft <b>46</b> engages with the spline boss <b>45</b> to transmit a driving force from the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> to the roll shaft <b>5</b> via the slidable cylinder <b>30</b> (second system driving state; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The transmission switching means on the side of the first roll shaft <b>5</b> and the transmission switching means on the side of the second roll shaft <b>6</b> simultaneously perform a switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, description will be given of the procedure of operations of the transmission switching means shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rice huller <b>1</b> is powered on to start driving the first driving motor <b>10</b>. The transmission switching means is brought into a first system driving state. Specifically, the driving force of the first driving motor <b>10</b> is transmitted to the first small-diameter pulley <b>16</b> and first large-diameter pulley <b>18</b> via the endless belt <b>14</b> in the first driving system. The first rice hulling roll <b>3</b> rotates at a high speed, while the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> rotates at a low speed. These rice hulling rolls <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> rotate in directions opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Subsequently, driving of the vibrating feeder <b>8</b> is started to drop grain (unhulled rice) fed from the supply port <b>7</b>, onto the guide chute <b>9</b>. The unhulled rice having fallen on the guide chute <b>9</b> slides down in the form of a thin layer and is then loaded in between the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The loaded unhulled rice is hulled owing to the difference in peripheral speed between the first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>, rotating at the high speed, and the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b>, rotating at the low speed. This allows the hulls to be peeled off from the unhulled rice (step <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The continuous rice hulling operation in the first system driving state gradually wears the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>, rotating at the high speed, has a larger accumulative area over which it contacts the unhulled rice than the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b>, rotating at the low speed. The first rice hulling roll <b>3</b> is thus worn earlier. This reduces the outer diameter of the first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>, thereby reducing the difference in peripheral speed between the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. If the value of the difference in peripheral speed is smaller than a predetermined value by, for example, 1% (or the value of the difference is 22% or less if the predetermined value is 23%) (step <b>2</b>), the transmission switching means is brought into a second system driving state (step <b>3</b>). Specifically, driving of the vibrating feeder <b>8</b> and the first system driving motor <b>10</b> are stopped, and the second system driving motor <b>11</b> is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The driving force of the second system driving motor <b>11</b> is transmitted to the second large-diameter pulley <b>17</b> and second small-diameter pulley <b>19</b> via the endless belt <b>15</b> in the second driving system. The first rice hulling roll <b>3</b> rotates at a low speed, while the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> rotates at a high speed. Driving of the vibrating feeder <b>8</b> is started again to resume a rice hulling operation (step <b>4</b>). During the rice hulling operation in the first system driving state, the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> has a larger diameter than the first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>. This maintains the difference in peripheral speed at at least the predetermined value, resulting in a continuous rice hulling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The transmission switching means switches the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> from a low-speed rotation side to a high-speed rotation side. The second rice hulling roll <b>4</b> is thus worn earlier than the first rice hulling roll <b>3</b>. This gradually reduces the outer diameter of the second rice hulling roll <b>4</b>, thereby reducing the difference in peripheral speed between the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. If the value of the difference in peripheral speed is smaller than the predetermined value by, for example, 1% (or the value of the difference is 22% or less if the predetermined value is 23%) (step <b>6</b>), the transmission switching means is brought into the first system driving state again (step <b>7</b>). Subsequently, every time the value of the difference in peripheral speed becomes smaller than the predetermined one by, for example, 1%, the transmission switching means performs a switching operation (steps <b>6</b> and <b>10</b>). The rice hulling operation is continued by alternately switching the rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> to the high-speed rotation side, which is more significantly worn.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If the amounts of wear in the first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> reach a predetermined value (steps <b>5</b> and <b>9</b>), driving of the vibrating feeder <b>8</b> is stopped to stop driving the first or second driving motor <b>10</b> or <b>12</b> to end the operation. The first and second rice hulling rolls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are replaced with new ones. The operation is then resumed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Repetition of a switching operation of the transmission switching means as described above enables the rice hulling process to be continued without the need to replace the rice hulling rolls until the predetermined amount of friction is reached. A rice huller with a suitable difference in peripheral speed can thus be provided without the need for a strong driving force.</p>
