<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to water extraction and processing, and more particularly to systems and methods for extracting and purifying water recovered from a groundwater source.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Although water occupies a substantial portion of the Earth's surface, a relatively small portion (approximately about one percent) of this water is fresh water. Of that portion, even less is immediately suitable for human consumption. In most cases, the available fresh water must be recovered and suitably processed in order to eliminate dangerous water borne pathogens that may be present. In most developed nations of the world, water treatment and pumping plants are generally available to recover the water from surface or subterranean sources and to suitably treat the water so that it is safe for human consumption. The water treatment and pumping plant may then provide the suitably treated water to a distribution network so that safe drinking water is supplied to various water consumers over a widespread area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In contrast, in the developing nations of the world, safe drinking water is typically unavailable due to economic as well as climatic reasons. For example, constructing and maintaining suitable water treatment and pumping plants is not economically obtainable in most cases due to the relatively high cost associated with these plants. Moreover, since many portions of the developing world are typically arid, the only suitable water is available from deep groundwater sources that are relatively expensive to exploit, due to the relatively deep well that must be drilled, and the large pumping plant that is required to extract useable volumes of water. Consequently, most drinking water is locally obtained from any available water source. Typically, relatively shallow groundwaters are extracted from boreholes or shallow wells to provide useable amounts of drinking water. Unfortunately, water obtained from shallow groundwater sources is generally of a low bacteriological quality (e.g., having a relatively high bacteriological concentration).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, many persons in the developing world do not have access to adequate amounts of safe drinking water, which has adversely affected the state of public health in these regions. For example, drinking water of substandard quality has significantly contributed to infant mortality in the developing world. According to recent estimates, infant mortality rates in the underdeveloped world range between approximately 160 and 180 deaths per one-thousand live births, as compared with approximately five to seven deaths per one-thousand live births in the developed world. One factor that significantly contributes to the high infant mortality rate in the developing world are the various waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, gastroenteritis and others that are frequently present in drinking water.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is therefore a distinct need to provide an apparatus and method that provides potable water in sufficient quantities. At present, approximately one in three children on the African continent are affected by drinking contaminated water. As a consequence, more children die due to diarrhea contracted from contaminated drinking water than from any other single cause. Since a child suffering from diarrhea necessarily consumes resources than are not required by ordinary, healthy children. For example, caring for the sick child requires intravenous fluids, sterile set-ups and a nurse and/or physician who can administer them. Sterile intravenous set-ups and nurses and/or physicians to administer them are all too scarce in rural Africa. In severe cases, the child may require a hospital or clinic. This is often very difficult, or even impossible since transporting the sick child through rural areas of African countries may not be possible. Still further, since babies dehydrate so quickly, the child often will die while being transported to the hospital or clinic. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that the child survives by receiving adequate care, the child may become infected again quite soon, if a new source of clean water is not found.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In most of Africa, the primary contaminant in the ground water is bacteria. At present, to obtain relatively uncontaminated water, wells are dug very deep, often to depths of more than 200 feet. The cost associated with establishing deep wells is very high, often in the range of approximately about $20,000 (USD). Moreover, deep wells further require powerful submersible pumps to extract water from the well. Accordingly, large amounts of electrical power are required, which is generally scarce in underdeveloped regions. Suitable submersible pumps further require engineering support to install and maintain the pump, and to make certain that it has an adequate power source to operate the pump. Obviously, the necessary engineering support is generally also unavailable in underdeveloped regions, such as rural Africa.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed in the art are systems and methods for extracting and purifying water so that relatively contaminated water sources may be used to provide useful amounts of safe drinking water.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention relates to systems and methods for extracting and purifying water recovered from groundwater sources. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, or that the present invention may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description. It is also understood that the term “groundwater” may refer to water recoverable from subterranean sources as well as water recovered from surface bodies of water, such as streams, ponds, marshes and other similar bodies of water. Still further, it is also understood that the term “water purification” may refer to one or more of a water disinfectant process, a sediment removal process, or the removal of any other undesired water contaminant, such as a water deionization process.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagrammatic view of a system <b>10</b> for extracting and purifying water obtained from a groundwater source, according to an embodiment of the invention. The system <b>10</b> includes a water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> that is operable to accept water at a first end of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> and move the water to an opposing second end of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b>. Briefly, and in general terms, the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> is configured to move the water by receiving a compressed gas from a gas generation unit <b>14</b> so that a relatively low density gas-water mixture is generated, so that the gas-water mixture moves by buoyant forces from the first end of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> to the second end. The water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The gas generation unit <b>14</b> is operable to provide a compressed gas at a predetermined pressure and flow rate to the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b>. In one specific embodiment, the gas generation unit <b>14</b> includes any self-contained compressed gas source, such as a pressure vessel configured to contain the compressed gas, and a suitable pressure regulation device coupled to the pressure vessel that is configured to provide the predetermined pressure and flow rate to the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b>. In another specific embodiment, the gas generation unit <b>14</b> is a mechanical gas compression device, such as a mechanically driven diaphragm compressor, which may be coupled to a suitable pressure vessel to store the compressed gas. One suitable diaphragm compressor is available from KNF Neuberger, Incorporated of Trenton, N.J., although other alternatives exist. In another specific embodiment, a chemical gas generator may be used to provide the compressed gas. The chemical gas generator provides the compressed gas through a chemical reaction between selected reactants. Alternately, the reaction may involve a reactant that is exposed to a selected catalyst, so that the compressed gas is generated. For example, the reactant may include hydrogen peroxide that is exposed to a transition metal catalyst, so that steam and oxygen are evolved from the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In any case, the gas generation unit <b>14</b> also includes a water purification device (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The water purification device is configured to controllably release a water purification agent into the compressed gas that is, in turn, supplied to the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b>. The water purification agent may include chlorine gas, or other compounds of chlorine, such as chlorine dioxide, chloramines and sodium hypochlorite. In a specific embodiment, however, the water purification agent is at least one of the well-known allotropic forms of oxygen, such as ozone. Accordingly, the water purification device may include any device that is configured to generate sufficiently useful amounts of ozone. For example, the water purification device may include known devices that are operable to generate ozone using ultraviolet illumination sources or corona discharge sources. One example of a suitable ozone generator is the AOS-1MP Corona Discharge Ozone Generator, available from applied Ozone Systems, Incorporated of Auburn, Calif., although other suitable alternatives are readily available. Depending upon a desired water purity value, the selected purifying agent, as well as other factors, the water purification device is further configured to provide the selected agent to the gas at a predetermined rate. When a chemical gas generator is used, the reaction that generates the gas may also include the purification agent. For example, when hydrogen peroxide is evolved by the reaction, the hydrogen peroxide may also serve as an effective water purification agent. In other embodiments, the water purification device may be configured to controllably release a halide-based purification agent into the compressed gas.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>10</b> also includes a power supply <b>16</b> that is operably coupled to the gas generation unit <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the power supply <b>16</b> is configured to provide electrical energy at a desired voltage and current to the gas generation unit <b>14</b> to energize the mechanical gas compression device and/or the water purification device. Accordingly, the power supply <b>16</b> may include an alternating current (AC) power source (such as an existing AC power distribution network) that may be rectified by known methods to generate direct current power (DC), if desired. The power supply <b>16</b> may also include one or more storage batteries, which may be coupled to a suitable inverter device if AC is required by at least one of the mechanical gas compression device and/or the water purification device. Alternately, the power supply <b>16</b> may also include one or more photovoltaic units (e.g., “solar cells”) that are operable to provide electrical energy in response to illumination of the photovoltaic units from an illumination source. The photovoltaic units may be further coupled to one or more storage batteries so that electrical energy may be provided to the gas generation unit <b>14</b> during periods when the illumination source provides minimal, or even no illumination to the photovoltaic units.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still other devices may be used to supply electrical energy to the gas generation unit <b>14</b>. For example, in another specific embodiment, the power supply <b>16</b> may include a manually operated electrical generator (or alternator) that is suited to receive a power input from a human or an animal locomotive source. Alternately, the electrical generator may be coupled to a prime mover, such as a gasoline engine, a diesel engine, or other known prime movers. The power supply <b>16</b> may also include a fuel cell device, such as a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) device that generates an electrical current in response to the oxidation of methanol in the presence of a catalyst. One suitable DMFC device is the SFC A50 DMFC, available from SFC Smart Fuel Cell AG, of Germany, although other alternatives exist.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial isometric view of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to another embodiment of the invention. The water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> includes a water collector <b>18</b> having an interior volume and a sealed end <b>20</b> that is configured to contain a corresponding volume of water. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the water collector <b>18</b> may also include an activated carbon bed that promotes adsorption of various undesired metals and compounds. In other alternative embodiments, the activated carbon bed may be positioned in other portions of the unit <b>12</b>. A lift tube <b>22</b> includes a first end <b>24</b> that sealably extends through the sealed end <b>20</b> and into the interior volume of the water collector <b>18</b>, and an opposing second end <b>26</b> that extends outwardly from the sealed end <b>20</b> for a selected distance <b>1</b>. The lift tube <b>22</b> also includes a gas emitter tube <b>28</b> that extends longitudinally along at least a portion of a length of the lift tube <b>22</b> and extends outwardly from the first end <b>24</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b> so that the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> may be coupled to the gas generation unit <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The gas emitter tube <b>28</b> also includes a gas emitter <b>30</b> that is coupled to a distal end of the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> and positioned proximate to the second end <b>26</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b>. For clarity of illustration, a portion of the lift tube <b>22</b> has been cut away to illustrate this structural detail. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> extending along a length of the lift tube <b>22</b>, it is understood that the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> may be oriented in other directions. For example, the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> may project through a wall of the lift tube <b>22</b> and extend laterally outwardly from the lift tube <b>22</b> in any desired direction. In other specific embodiments, the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> may be coiled about the lift tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The gas emitter <b>30</b> may be comprised of a generally porous material having a selected porosity that permits a gas supplied to the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> to be released into an interior portion of the lift tube <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the gas emitter <b>30</b> may be formed from a metal, such as bronze, or other similar metals that is sintered. Alternately, the gas emitter <b>30</b> may be formed from a fused granular material such as silica sand, or other similar granular materials. Still other materials may be used to form the gas emitter <b>30</b>. For example, the gas emitter <b>30</b> may be formed from a fired, non-glazed porcelain material. The gas emitter <b>30</b> may also be formed from a polymeric material having a desired porosity. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a gas emitter formed from a generally porous material, it is understood that the gas emitter <b>30</b> may also be comprised of a gas emitter tube <b>28</b> having a closed end with one or more apertures projecting through a wall portion of the gas emitter tube <b>28</b>. It is further understood that the gas emitter <b>30</b> may also be comprised of an open end of the gas emitter tube <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> may include a filter device <b>32</b> configured to be received by the second end <b>26</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b> that is operable to prevent undesired solid material from entering the lift tube <b>22</b> when water is introduced into the lift tube <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the filter device <b>32</b> may include a screen formed from a woven material having a desired open area to exclude the solid material from the lift tube <b>22</b>. Alternately, the filter device <b>32</b> may also include a filter matrix comprised of a relatively dense network of fibers that is operable to trap and retain relatively small solid materials that may be present in the water. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the filter device <b>32</b> coupled to the second end <b>26</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b>, it is understood that the filter device <b>32</b> may be coupled to other selected portions of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the operation of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> will now be described in detail. With the second end <b>26</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b> immersed in water to at least a depth d that is sufficient to fully immerse the gas emitter <b>30</b> below a surface of the water. The depth d is also generally at least a height sufficient to provide a balancing head between the pure water outside the tube <b>22</b> and the gas-water mixture existing at the first end <b>24</b>. The gas generation unit <b>14</b> transfers the gas at a predetermined flow rate and pressure through the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> to the gas emitter <b>30</b>. Gas released from the gas emitter <b>30</b> mixes with the water surrounding the gas emitter <b>30</b> and forms a gas-water mixture of relatively lower density. Accordingly, the gas-water mixture moves through the lift tube <b>22</b> and towards the water collector <b>18</b>, so that a pumping head is developed that draws additional water into the second end <b>26</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b>. Upon reaching the first end <b>24</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b>, the gas-water mixture is introduced into the water collector <b>18</b>, where the water component of the mixture is captured, while the gas component is released. Since the gas component in the gas-water mixture may include a water purification agent, the water component is subject to purification as it moves within the collector <b>18</b> and the lift tube <b>22</b>. Since the gas provided to the gas emitter tube <b>28</b> may be selectively regulated, a residence time for the exposure of the water to the water purification agent may be continuously adjusted. It will be readily appreciated that a plurality of units <b>12</b> may be serially coupled to transport water through various distances, as will be described in greater detail below. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a second end <b>26</b> of the lift tube <b>22</b> that corresponds to an adjacent unit <b>12</b> is positioned within the water collector <b>18</b> so that water may be further transported from the collector <b>18</b> and into the lift tube <b>22</b> of the adjacent unit <b>12</b>. It is also understood that water may be repeatedly routed through one or more of the units <b>12</b> in order to achieve an enhanced water purification effect.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a partial isometric view of a water transfer unit <b>34</b>, according to another embodiment of the invention. Many of the details of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> have been described in detail in connection with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Accordingly, in the interest of brevity, these details will not be described further. The water transfer unit <b>34</b> includes a fluid transfer line <b>36</b> that fluidly couples a pair of laterally spaced-apart water collectors <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the water transfer unit <b>34</b> is operable to move the water in a lateral direction as it is generally moved upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial isometric view of a water transfer unit <b>40</b>, according to another embodiment of the invention. The water transfer unit <b>40</b> includes a water collector <b>42</b>, which may be substantially as described in connection with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The water collector <b>42</b> is coupled to a lift assembly <b>44</b> that includes more than one lift tube <b>46</b>. Each of the lift tubes <b>46</b> may also be substantially as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Accordingly, each of the lift tubes <b>46</b> is configured to generate a pumping head that is operable to transfer water to a first end <b>48</b> of the lift assembly <b>44</b> from a second end <b>50</b>. Although the lift assembly <b>44</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a pair of the lift tubes <b>46</b> having approximately similar diameters and lengths, it is understood that more than two of the lift tubes <b>46</b> may be included in the lift assembly <b>44</b>, and that the lift tubes <b>46</b> may have different diameters and/or lengths. Additionally, each of the lift tubes <b>46</b> in the lift assembly <b>44</b> may be independently actuated so that a pumping head may be independently generated in each of the lift tubes <b>46</b> by selectively providing gas to the lift tubes <b>46</b>. Further, although the lift assembly <b>44</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a pair of spaced-apart lift tubes <b>46</b>, it is understood that the lift assembly <b>44</b> may be fabricated as a unitary assembly, wherein the lift tubes <b>46</b> are mutually fixedly joined together.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The foregoing embodiment advantageously allows greater volumetric flow rates to be transferred than is generally achievable using a single lift tube. Further, since the foregoing embodiment provides more than one lift tube <b>46</b>, the water transfer unit <b>40</b> will continue to pump water to the water collector <b>42</b> when one or more of the lift tubes <b>46</b> become inoperable due to clogging of the tube <b>46</b>, or by failure of the gas emitter <b>30</b>, or due to other reasons. Still other advantages are apparent in the foregoing embodiment. For example, since the lift tubes <b>46</b> may be independently controlled (e.g., by separately controlling a gas flow rate and/or pressure delivered to the gas emitter <b>30</b>), the volumetric flow rate of the water transfer unit <b>40</b> may be selectively adjusted to provide a desired volumetric flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side-elevational view of a groundwater pumping and purification apparatus <b>60</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. The apparatus <b>60</b> is configured to be positioned within an earthen excavation <b>62</b>, such as a borehole, or a well, so that a portion of the apparatus <b>60</b> is in fluid communication with a water pool <b>64</b> that occupies a lower portion of the excavation <b>60</b>. The apparatus <b>60</b> includes a pumping stack <b>66</b> that extends downwardly into the excavation <b>60</b>, and includes one or more of the water transfer and treatment units <b>12</b> and the water transfer unit <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, respectively. The water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> and/or the water transfer unit <b>40</b> may be serially coupled to fully extend into a water pool <b>64</b> in the lower portion of the excavation <b>60</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is nevertheless understood that the pumping stack <b>66</b> may also include a supporting structure that is fixedly coupled to each of the water transfer units to impart sufficient structural rigidity to the pumping stack <b>66</b>. The apparatus <b>60</b> also includes a main collector <b>68</b> that may be used to collect water that is pumped upwardly by the pumping stack <b>66</b>. The main collector <b>68</b> may include one or more taps <b>70</b> that are fluidly coupled to the main collector <b>68</b> so that water pumped by the pumping stack <b>66</b> may be removed from the apparatus <b>60</b>. The main collector <b>68</b> may also include a gas emitter interface <b>72</b> that is operably coupled to the gas generation unit <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The gas emitter interface <b>72</b> may include a gas flow regulation device <b>74</b> that is configured to control an amount of gas provided to the interface <b>72</b>. The interface <b>72</b> may be configured to provide different gas flow rates to the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> and/or the water transfer unit <b>40</b> comprising the pumping stack <b>66</b>. Accordingly, a pumping rate and/or a residence time for the purification agent may be effectively adjustably controlled. A gas recovery cap <b>76</b> may be positioned at an upper portion of the excavation <b>62</b> that is suitably configured to capture the purification agent released within the excavation <b>62</b>, and to route the recovered purification agent to the gas generation unit <b>14</b> through a recovery line <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The foregoing embodiment advantageously allows water to be extracted from wells and/or bore holes having at least a moderate depth by serially coupling water transfer units to form a unitary pumping stack. The pumping stack also desirably permits the water purification agent to reside in the water for a prolonged time period, thus enhancing the water purification effect.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side-elevational view of another groundwater pumping and purification apparatus <b>80</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. Many of the details of the present embodiment have been discussed in conjunction with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Accordingly, in the interest of brevity, these details will not be described further. The apparatus <b>80</b> includes more than one pumping stack <b>82</b>, which are positionable within the excavation <b>62</b> so that parallel pumping paths are established. The more than one pumping stack <b>82</b> includes one or more of the water transfer and treatment unit <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the water transfer unit <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which may be serially coupled to fully extend into the water pool <b>64</b> located in the excavation <b>62</b>. As noted previously, the pumping stack <b>82</b> may also include a supporting structure that is fixedly coupled to each of the water transfer units to impart a structural rigidity to the pumping stack <b>82</b>. A main collector <b>68</b> is also provided to collect water that is pumped upwardly by the pumping stack <b>82</b>, and which may also include a gas emitter interface <b>72</b> coupled to the gas generation unit <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to other advantages previously described, the foregoing embodiment advantageously allows water to be extracted along more than a single pumping path, thus affording greater flow control while also providing at least one redundant water flow path so that the overall reliability of the apparatus is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart that will be used to describe a method <b>90</b> of extracting and purifying water recovered from a groundwater source, according to another embodiment of the invention. At block <b>92</b>, a water lifting unit is extended into the extractable groundwater source, which may include subterranean sources, as well as surface bodies of water that contain extractable amounts of water. At block <b>94</b>, a gas generation source is coupled to the water lifting unit. The gas generation source is configured to generate a gas at a predetermined pressure and volume. The gas may include air that is compressed to the predetermined pressure and volume by an air compression device, as previously described in detail. At block <b>96</b>, a water purification agent may be added to the gas before the gas is introduced to the water lifting unit. At block <b>98</b>, the gas that includes the purification agent is supplied to the water lifting unit. Accordingly, water is continuously moved from one end of the water lifting unit to an opposing end of the unit by forming a gas-water mixture having reduced density. While the water is moving through the water lifting unit, the water purifying agent advantageously continuously purifies the water extracted from the groundwater source.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While various embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
