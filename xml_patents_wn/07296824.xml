<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a front body structure for vehicles, and more particularly to a vehicle front body structure having an upper member extending forwardly from the lower end of a front pillar.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vehicle front body structures of the type having an apron frame (upper member) disposed outward of a front side frame and extending along an upper portion of a front wheel house are known heretofore, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent (JP-B2) No. 2,516,212.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> hereof, the disclosed vehicle front body structure <b>100</b> includes a front side frame <b>103</b> extending longitudinally of the vehicle body and disposed on a lower side edge of a wheel house <b>102</b>, and an apron frame (upper member) <b>105</b> disposed outwardly of the front side frame <b>101</b>. The apron frame <b>105</b> has a central portion <b>106</b> curved or bent into a curvature extending along an upper edge of the wheel house <b>101</b>. The thus curved central portion <b>106</b> has a steep down-slope when viewed in a forward direction of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With this arrangement, when the apron frame <b>105</b> is subjected to a backward force or load acting on a front end <b>108</b> thereof, as indicated by a profiled arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the curved central portion <b>106</b> of the apron frame <b>105</b> will undergo yielding or deformation in a radial inward direction of the wheel house <b>101</b>. Thus, the apron frame <b>105</b> with curved central portion <b>106</b> does not contribute to distribution of the load to a front pillar disposed rearward of the apron frame <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another example of the known vehicle front body structure is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (JP-A) No. 2003-40142. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> hereof, the disclosed vehicle front body structure <b>110</b> includes a front side frame <b>111</b> extending in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle body, and an upper member <b>114</b> extending forwardly on the down grade from the lower end of a front pillar <b>112</b> and having a front end <b>116</b> connected via a connecting member <b>117</b> and a side down member <b>118</b> to a front end portion <b>122</b> of the front side frame <b>111</b>. The upper member <b>112</b> includes a rear end portion <b>113</b> extending forwardly from the lower end of the front pillar <b>112</b>, a downwardly inclined central portion <b>119</b> extending forwardly from a front end of the rear end portion <b>113</b>, and a substantial vertical front end portion <b>121</b> extending vertically downward from a front end of the central portion <b>119</b>. A lower end of the vertical end portion <b>121</b> forms the front end <b>116</b> of the upper member <b>114</b> that is connected via the connecting member <b>117</b> and the side down member <b>118</b> to the front end portion <b>122</b> of the front side frame <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">By thus connecting the vertical front end portion <b>121</b> to the front side frame <b>111</b> via the connecting member <b>117</b> and the side down member <b>118</b>, the upper member <b>114</b> is structurally reinforced. However, due to the use of the connecting member <b>117</b> and the side down member <b>118</b>, a corresponding increase in weight of the entire vehicle front body structure <b>110</b> is inevitable. Additionally, due to the presence of the connecting member <b>117</b> and the side down member <b>118</b>, a space <b>123</b> provided on a lateral outer side of the front end portion <b>122</b> of the front side frame <b>111</b> is relatively small and this poses a certain limit or restriction to the design and arrangement of a vehicle part such as a front fog light adapted to be installed in the space <b>123</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is, therefore, an objective of the present invention to provide a vehicle front body structure, which is able to distribute a load applied to the front end of an upper member to a front pillar with high efficiencies, can reduce the overall weight of the vehicle body, and has a relatively high degree of freedom in designing and arranging a vehicle part such as a front fog light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the invention, there is provided a front body structure for a vehicle, which comprises a front side frame extending in a longitudinal direction of a body of the vehicle, a front pillar disposed upwardly and rearward of the front side frame, and an upper member extending from a lower end of the front pillar in a forward direction of the vehicle body, the upper member being disposed outward of the front side frame in a transverse direction of the vehicle body. The upper member has a substantially rectilinear configuration and is arranged to slope upward in a backward direction of the vehicle body so that a load applied to a front end portion of the upper member can be born by the front pillar.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By virtue of the rectilinear configuration, the upper member is rigid enough to withstand a force or load applied to the front end portion thereof in a backward direction of the vehicle body. Additionally, since the upper member is arranged to slope upward toward the lower end of the left front pillar, the load applied to the front end portion of the upper member is effectively distributed through the upper member to the front pillar and eventually born by the front pillar. The load can thus be absorbed efficiently. Furthermore, since the upper member of the substantially rectilinear configuration is rigid in itself against the load acting in the backward direction of the vehicle body, it is no longer necessary to provide a reinforcing member to the front end portion of the upper member. This contributes to the reduction of the overall weight of the vehicle front body structure and provides a relatively large space in the vicinity of the front end portion of the upper member for installation of a front fog light or the like vehicle parts or accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the upper member has a front end enlarged in a vertical direction and having a larger height than the remaining part of the upper member. By thus enlarging the vertical dimension or height of the front end, the upper member now has a relatively large range of abutment relative to a structural part of an oncoming vehicle, which forms a fore end of the oncoming vehicle at the time of a collision and which varies in height depending on the type and/or model of the oncoming vehicle. This arrangement ensures that the vehicle front body structure can achieve shock-absorbing operation with high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one preferred form of the invention, the front end portion of the upper member is flared in vertical direction toward the vertically enlarged front end.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The upper member may have a front part including the front end portion, and a rear part contiguous with the front part and including a rear end portion connected to the lower end of the front pillar. In this instance, the front part and the rear part of the upper member are curved downward and upward, respectively, to a limited extent that the upper member as a whole extends substantially linearly on the up grade from the front end portion to the rear end portion of the upper member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rear body structure may further comprise a sensor for activating an air-bag module, the sensor being disposed on the upper member in the vicinity of the front end portion thereof, and the front end portion of the upper member being located rearward of a front end of the front side frame. With this arrangement, the sensor is not sensitive to a load applied to a front end of the vehicle front body structure until the load causes the font end portion of the upper member to undergo deformation or yielding subsequent to complete deformation or yielding of the front end portion of the front side frame. It is, therefore, possible to prevent accidental activation of the air-bag module which may otherwise occur when the vehicle front body structure is subjected to a relatively small impact force.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to the drawings and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in particular, there is shown in perspective a front body structure <b>10</b> of a motor vehicle according to an embodiment of the present invention. The vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> generally comprises left and right front side frames <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> extending longitudinally of a body of the motor vehicle and disposed on left and right sides, respectively, of a front portion of the vehicle body, and left and right upper members <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> disposed outward of and above the left and right front side frames <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, respectively, so as to form, together with the front side frames <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, a skeleton framework of an engine room <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> further includes a bumper beam <b>17</b> extending between front end portions <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>a </i>of the left and right front side frames <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, a front bulkhead lower cross member <b>18</b> disposed below the bumper beam <b>17</b> and extending between the front end portions <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>a </i>of the left and right front side frames <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, a center extension member <b>19</b> disposed on a central portion of a front surface of the bumper beam <b>17</b>, left and right extension member <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> projecting forwardly from the respective front end portions <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>a </i>of the left and right front side frames <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and a front bumper <b>24</b> disposed forwardly of the left, center and right extension members <b>21</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>22</b>. A bulkhead upper frame <b>29</b> of generally U-shaped configuration is disposed between central portions of the left and right upper members <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The left front side frame <b>11</b>, the left upper member <b>13</b>, and the left extension member <b>21</b> are symmetrical with the right front side frame <b>12</b>, the right upper member <b>14</b> and the right extension member <b>22</b>, respectively, about a longitudinal center line of the vehicle body. In view of the symmetric structure, a description given below will be directed only to the left front side frame <b>11</b>, the left upper member <b>13</b> and the left extension member <b>21</b>, and description of the right front side frame <b>12</b>, the right upper member <b>14</b>, and the right extension member <b>22</b> will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The left front side frame <b>11</b> extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body and has a beaded portion <b>25</b> formed by bulging on an outer sidewall <b>11</b><i>b </i>along a front part of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The left extension member <b>21</b> extends forwardly from the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The front bumper <b>24</b> is disposed so as to locate in the vicinity of a front end <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the left extension member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A left front pillar <b>27</b> is disposed above a rear end of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The left front pillar <b>27</b> has a lower end <b>27</b><i>a </i>from which the left upper member <b>13</b> extends forwardly. The left upper member <b>13</b> is disposed outward (leftward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The left upper member <b>13</b> is formed into a substantially straight or rectilinear configuration and arranged to slope upward toward a rear end of the vehicle body so that a load applied to a front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> can be transmitted through the left upper member <b>13</b> to the left front pillar <b>27</b> and born by the front pillar <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is connected to a left end of the bumper beam <b>17</b> via a connection member <b>28</b> and the left front side frame <b>11</b>. A sensor <b>31</b> for activating an air-bag module (not shown) is disposed in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sensor <b>31</b> is an impact sensor which is constructed to detect an impact force applied to the vehicle body and generates a detection signal when it detects a preset impact force. The detection signal from the impact sensor <b>31</b> is supplied to an electronic control unit, ECU, (not shown), which, on the basis of the detection signal, outputs a signal to activate or deploy the air-bag module.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows in side view the vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> of the invention. As shown in this figure, the left front pillar <b>27</b> is disposed above the rear end of the left front side frame <b>11</b>, and the left upper member <b>13</b> extends forwardly from the lower end <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the left front pillar <b>27</b>. The left upper member <b>13</b> is disposed outward of the left front side frame <b>11</b> in a transverse direction of the vehicle body. The left front side frame <b>11</b> extends longitudinally of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The left upper member <b>13</b> has a front part <b>13</b><i>d </i>including the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a, </i>and a rear part <b>13</b><i>e </i>contiguous with the front part <b>13</b><i>d </i>and including a rear end portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>opposite the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a. </i>The front part <b>13</b><i>d </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is slightly curved or bent downward, while the rear part <b>13</b><i>e </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is slightly curved or bent upward. The degrees of bent or curvatures of the front and rear parts <b>13</b><i>d, </i><b>13</b><i>e </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> are determined such that the left upper member <b>13</b> as a whole has a straight or rectilinear configuration that extends straight or linearly on the up grade from the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>attached to front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b> to the rear end <b>13</b><i>b </i>connected to the lower end <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the left front pillar <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The beaded portion <b>25</b> is formed on the outer sidewall <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the left lower front frame <b>11</b>, and the left extension member <b>21</b> is attached by a plurality of screws <b>37</b> to the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The left extension member <b>21</b> extends forwardly from the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The front part <b>13</b><i>d </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is slightly curved downward for the purpose of providing a necessary space above the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> for installation of a headlight or the like vehicle accessory. Similarly, the rear part <b>13</b><i>e </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is slightly curved upward for the purpose of providing a necessary space below the upper member <b>13</b> for installation of a left front wheel <b>34</b>. The left upper member <b>13</b> is desirably configured to assume a single straight line when viewed in side elevation while providing necessary spaces for installation of the headlight and the left front wheel <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By thus forming the left upper member <b>13</b> into a substantially straight or rectilinear configuration, the left upper member <b>13</b> is made rigid enough to withstand a load applied to the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>in a backward direction of the vehicle body. Additionally, since the left upper member <b>13</b> is arranged to slope upward toward the lower end <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the left front pillar <b>27</b>, the load applied to the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is effectively distributed through the left upper member <b>13</b> to the left front pillar <b>27</b> and eventually born by the left front pillar <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, since the left upper member <b>13</b> of the substantially rectilinear configuration is rigid in itself against the load acting in the backward direction of the vehicle body, it is no longer necessary for the vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> to provide a reinforcing member to the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b>. Due to the absence of the reinforcing member, the vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> is relatively light in weight and has a relatively large space in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b>, which increases the degree of design freedom in determining the location of vehicle parts or accessories including a front fog light <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As is well known, the left upper member <b>13</b> is subjected to vertical forces or loads during travel of the vehicle. The left upper member <b>13</b> that is formed into a substantially straight or rectilinear configuration is also highly rigid against the vertical loads.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is configured such that a vertical dimension or height increases gradually in a direction from a rear end toward a front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a. </i>Stated in other words, the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>is flared in a vertical direction so that the front end portion has a larger height than the remaining portion of the left upper member <b>13</b> and the height of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>is maximum H<b>1</b> at the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a. </i>By thus enlarging the vertical dimension of the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a, </i>the left upper member <b>13</b> can engage or abut with structural parts of various different oncoming vehicles with increased reliability when a collision occurs, as will be understood from a description given below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The impact sensor <b>31</b> for activating the air-bag module (not shown) is disposed in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b> of the left upper member <b>13</b>. As clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is disposed rearward of a front end of the left front side frame <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With this arrangement, when the left front side frame <b>11</b> is subjected to a backward force or load acting on the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>thereof, if the backward force is of a relatively small level just causing slight deformation of the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b>, the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> remains in its original shape and does not undergo any deformation. Since the backward force is absorbed by the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the front side frame <b>11</b> through deformation of the latter, and since the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is free from deformation, the impact sensor <b>31</b> is not sensitive to the backward force and remains in the inactive state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, if the backward force acting on the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b> is relatively large so that that the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is caused to undergo deformation or yielding subsequent to complete deformation of the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b>, the impact sensor <b>31</b> disposed in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>being deformed is now responsive to the backward force and turns to the active state. The sensor <b>31</b> generates a detection signal in response to which the ECU (not shown) generates a signal to activate or deploy the air-bag module (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows in plan view a left half of the vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> according to the present invention. As shown in this figure, the left front side frame <b>11</b> extends longitudinally of the vehicle body, and the left upper member <b>13</b> is disposed substantially parallel to and outward of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is connected via the connection member <b>28</b> to the outer sidewall <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. The bumper beam <b>17</b> extends transversely from the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b> toward the front end portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the right front side frame <b>12</b>. The center extension member <b>19</b> projects forwardly from a central portion of the bumper beam <b>17</b>. The left extension member <b>21</b> is bolted to the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b> and extends forwardly from the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a. </i>The front bumper <b>24</b> is disposed forwardly of the left extension member <b>21</b>, the center extension member <b>19</b> and the right extension member <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A left front wheel house <b>39</b> is provided between the left front side frame <b>11</b> and the left upper member <b>13</b> for covering an upper part of the left front wheel <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Operation of the vehicle front body structure <b>10</b> of the foregoing construction will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> diagrammatically illustrate, for comparative purposes, the behavior of a left upper member <b>150</b> in a comparative example and the behavior of the left upper member <b>13</b> of the present invention that are observed when the upper members <b>150</b>, <b>13</b> are subjected to a front end collision.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the upper member <b>150</b> in the comparative example has a curvilinear configuration including a central portion <b>151</b> extending along an arcuate upper edge portion of the left front wheel house (not shown). The left upper member <b>150</b> is bent downward at an upper end <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>151</b> and further bent upward at a lower end <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the central portion <b>151</b>. The central portion <b>151</b> in itself is generally straight and slopes steeply from a rear part (not designated) to a front part (not designated) of the left upper member <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the left upper member <b>150</b> is subjected to a front end collision involving a backward force or load F<b>1</b> acting on a front end portion <b>150</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>150</b>, the left upper member <b>150</b>, due to its curvilinear configuration described above, is likely to yield or further bend at the upper and lower ends (bent portions) <b>151</b><i>a, </i><b>151</b><i>b </i>of the central portion <b>151</b>. With this yielding, the left upper member <b>150</b> cannot effectively distribute the load F<b>1</b> to a left front pillar <b>152</b> of the vehicle body, thereby lowering the shock-absorbing efficiency of the vehicle front body structure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the left upper member <b>13</b> of the present invention has a substantially straight or rectilinear configuration extending substantially straight or linearly from the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the rear end portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>thereof. Furthermore, the left upper member <b>13</b> is arranged to slope upward in a backward direction of the vehicle body, and the rear end portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is connected to the lower end <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the left front pillar <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the left upper member <b>13</b> is subjected to a front end collision involving the backward force or load F<b>1</b> acting on the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b>, the left upper member <b>13</b>, owing to its rectilinear configuration, is able to withstand the load F<b>1</b> without yielding and distributes the load F<b>1</b> effectively to the left front pillar <b>27</b>, thus increasing the shock-absorbing efficiency of the vehicle front body structure.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> diagrammatically show, for comparative purposes, operations of a front end portion <b>160</b><i>a </i>of a left upper member <b>160</b> according to a comparative example and a front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> according to the invention. In the comparative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the front end portion <b>160</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>160</b> has a uniform height H<b>2</b> throughout the length thereof. On the other hand, according to the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> is flared in a vertical direction toward a front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>thereof so that the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>has a larger height than the remaining part of the left upper member <b>13</b>. The height H<b>1</b> of the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> of the invention is larger than the height H<b>2</b> of the front end <b>160</b><i>b </i>of the left upper member <b>160</b> in the comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As indicated by hatching shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the level of a structural part of an oncoming vehicle, which forms a fore end of the oncoming vehicle when a collision occurs, varies depending on the type and/or model of the oncoming vehicle. In case of the comparative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, since the height H<b>2</b> of the front end portion <b>160</b><i>a </i>is uniform throughout the length thereof and is smaller than the height H<b>1</b> at the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the upper member <b>13</b> of the invention, the front end portion <b>160</b> has a relatively small range of abutment relative to the structural part of the oncoming vehicle. Especially, when a collision occurs relative to a structural part <b>162</b> or <b>163</b> of the oncoming vehicle, the front end portion <b>160</b><i>a </i>of the upper member <b>160</b> cannot undertake reliable abutment with the structural part <b>162</b>, <b>163</b> because the structural part <b>162</b>, <b>163</b> lies in a plane either above an upper edge of the front end <b>160</b><i>b, </i>or below a lower edge of the front end <b>160</b><i>b, </i>of the front end portion <b>160</b><i>a. </i>This will result in insufficient distribution and hence absorption of an impact energy.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In case of the upper member <b>13</b> according to the present invention, the front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>is enlarged in height, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, so that the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>has a larger range of abutment relative to the structural part of the oncoming vehicle than the front end portion <b>160</b><i>a </i>in the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> does. Even at the time of a collision with the structural part <b>162</b> lying at a higher level or with the structural part <b>163</b> lying at a lower level, the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>with vertically enlarged front end <b>13</b><i>c </i>can undertake reliable abutment with the structural part <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>. This will ensure efficient distribution of an impact force or load to the front pillar and resulting sufficient absorption of the impact energy.</p>

Accordingly, the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> does not undergo deformation even when the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side fame <b>11</b> is slightly deformed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, under the effect of a relatively small force or load F<b>2</b> acting on the front end of the left front side frame <b>11</b>. In this instance, since the force or load F<b>2</b> is absorbed solely by the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>through deformation or yielding of the latter and does not give any influence on the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b>, the impact sensor <b>31</b> provided in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>for activating the air-bag module (not shown) is not sensitive to the load F<b>2</b> and hence is in the inactive state.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the left front side frame <b>11</b> is subjected to a relatively large force or load F<b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the front end portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>undergoes complete deformation or yielding, causing the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the left upper member <b>13</b> to start deformation or yielding under the effect of the backward force or load F<b>3</b>. The impact sensor <b>31</b> disposed in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>being deformed is now responsive to the load F<b>3</b> and generates a detection signal to activate or evolve the air-bag module.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">By thus providing the sensor <b>31</b> on the left upper member <b>13</b> in the vicinity of the front end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>thereof that is located rearward of the front end of the left front side frame <b>11</b>, it is possible to control operation of the sensor <b>31</b> such that the sensor <b>31</b> remains in its inactive state until the force acting on a front end of the vehicle body exceeds a predetermined value. This arrangement prevents accidental activation of the air-bag module which may otherwise occur when the vehicle front body structure is subjected to a relatively small impact force.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Obviously, various minor changes and modifications are possible in the light of the above teaching. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
