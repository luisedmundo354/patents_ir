<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In one embodiment, a latency circuit generates the latency signal based on CAS latency information and read information. For example, the latency circuit may include a clock signal generating circuit generating a plurality of transfer signals and generating a plurality of sampling clock signals based on and corresponding to the plurality of transfer signals such that a timing relationship is created between the transfer signals and the sampling clock signals. The latency circuit may further include a latency signal generator selectively storing the read information based on the sampling clock signals, and selectively outputting the stored read information as the latency signal based on the transfer signals. The latency signal generator may also delay the read information such that the delayed, read information is stored based on the sampling clock signals.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a prior art memory device. The memory device <b>100</b> includes a memory cell array <b>110</b>, a clock synchronizing circuit block <b>120</b>, a read command path block <b>130</b>, a data output buffer <b>140</b>, a mode register <b>150</b> and a latency circuit <b>160</b>. In operation, data is written into the memory cell array <b>110</b> and read out from the memory cell array <b>110</b>. If a read command is asserted to the memory device <b>100</b>, data is read out from the memory cell array <b>110</b> according to an externally received address. A buffer <b>116</b> receives and temporarily stores the address. A row decoder <b>112</b> receives the stored address and decodes a row address of the memory cell array <b>110</b> from the address. A column decoder <b>114</b> receives the stored address and decodes a column address of the memory cell array <b>110</b> from the address. The memory cell array <b>110</b> outputs the data addressed by the row and column addresses. The data output buffer <b>140</b> receives the data output from the memory cell array <b>110</b>, and outputs the data based on a latency signal from the latency circuit <b>160</b> and an internal data output clock signal CLKDQ.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The clock synchronizing circuit block <b>120</b> generates the data output clock signal CLKDQ based on an external clock signal ECLK. The external clock signal ECLK serves as a reference clock signal for most commands of the memory device <b>100</b>. Specifically, most commands are asserted to the memory device <b>100</b> in synchronization with the external clock signal ECLK. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the clock synchronizing circuit block <b>120</b> is a delay locked loop (DLL) circuit. The DLL circuit <b>120</b> includes a variable delay <b>122</b>, a data output buffer replica <b>124</b> and a phase detector <b>126</b>. The DLL circuit <b>120</b> is a well known circuit such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,855; and therefore, will not be described in detail. The DLL circuit <b>120</b> generates the data output clock signal CLKDQ as a phase lead version of the external clock ECLK. Namely, the data output clock signal CLKDQ has the same frequency as the external clock ECLK, but the pulses of the data output clock signal CLKDQ precede the pulses of the external clock signal ECLK by a data output time tSAC. The data output time is a measurement of the time it takes the data output buffer <b>140</b> to output data. Accordingly, the DLL circuit <b>120</b> causes data to be output from the data output buffer <b>140</b> in synchronization with the external clock ECLK.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The read command path block <b>130</b> receives the read command and the external clock signal ECLK. An internal clock generator <b>132</b> receives the external clock signal ECLK and generates an internal clock signal PCLK from the external clock signal ECLK. Specifically, the internal clock signal PCLK is a buffered version of the external clock signal ECLK. Therefore, the internal clock signal PCLK has the same frequency as the external clock signal ECLK and the level of the internal clock signal PCLK swing is a CMOS level (VSS-VCC) buffered signal delayed from the external clock signal ECLK. The internal clock signal PCLK is used to control peripheral circuits (not shown) such as data sense amplifiers, data multiplexers, etc., in the memory device <b>100</b>. A read command buffer <b>134</b> in the read command path block <b>130</b> receives the read command and the internal clock signal PCLK. The read command buffer <b>134</b> inputs the read command synchronized with the internal clock signal PCLK, and outputs an internal read signal PREAD, which is supplied to the latency circuit <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The memory device <b>100</b> has several modes of operation. The mode register <b>150</b> stores a mode register set (MRS) command asserted to the memory device <b>100</b>. The MRS command indicates the mode of the memory device <b>100</b>. CAS latency information is determined by the MRS command. The CAS latency information indicates the CAS latency mode, which is the number of clock cycles of the external clock signal ECLK that should occur between the receipt of a read command or column address until data is output by the memory device <b>100</b>. Stated another way, data is output from the memory device in a CAS latency number of clock cycles after receipt of the read command (a column address being asserted together with the read command).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The latency circuit <b>160</b> receives the CAS latency information from the mode register <b>150</b> and generates a latency signal such that the data output buffer <b>140</b> is enabled to output the data according to the desired CAS latency. More specifically, the data output buffer <b>140</b> outputs the stored data in response to the data output clock signal CLKDQ while the latency signal is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a prior art latency circuit <b>160</b>. As shown, the latency circuit <b>160</b> includes first, second and third D-flip flops <b>215</b>, <b>225</b> and <b>235</b> connected in cascade. Each D-flip flop receives the data output clock signal CLKDQ at its clock input. The internal read signal PREAD is supplied to the D input of the first D-flip flop <b>215</b>. The internal read signal PREAD and Q output of each of the first-third D-flip flops <b>215</b>, <b>225</b> and <b>235</b> are respectively connected to first-fourth switches <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>240</b>. The first-fourth switches <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> are respectively controlled by a CAS latency indicator CL<b>1</b>, CL<b>2</b>, CL<b>3</b> and CL<b>4</b> decoded from the CAS latency information. Namely, the CAS latency information is N bits that indicate the CAS latency mode. The N bits are decoded by a simple logic decoder (not shown) to produce the CAS latency indicators CL<b>1</b>-CL<b>4</b> associated with each CAS latency mode. As will be appreciated, the CAS latency indicator for the activated CAS latency mode will be, for example, logic high, while the other CAS latency indicators will be logic low. The output of the first-fourth switches <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> serve as the latency signal. In operation, only one of the CAS latency modes will be logic high; therefore, only one of the first-fourth switches <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> will transfer a signal for output as the latency signal. For example, when the CAS latency is 1, CL<b>1</b> is logic high and turns on first switch <b>210</b>. At this time, the other CAS latency indicators CL<b>2</b>, CL<b>3</b>, and CL<b>4</b> are logic low. The internal read signal is then transferred as the latency signal via the first switch <b>210</b>. When the CAS latency is two (i.e., CL equals 2), then CL<b>2</b> is logic high, while CL<b>1</b>, CL<b>3</b> and CL<b>4</b> are logic low. Thus, the internal read signal PREAD is transferred as the latency signal via the first D-flip flop <b>215</b> and the second switch <b>220</b>. The first D-flip flop <b>215</b> is triggered by the data output clock signal CLKDQ and delays the internal read signal PREAD being output as the latency signal by about one clock cycle. The operation when the CAS latency is three or four is similar to that discussed above with respect to the CAS latency of two, and therefore will not be repeated for the sake of brevity. Additionally, it will be understood that CAS latencies greater than four could be handled by the addition of more D-flip flops and switches.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a timing diagram of the read operation when the CAS latency is 1. At a clock cycle C<b>0</b>, a read command <b>310</b> is asserted, and an internal read signal PREAD is generated by the read command path block <b>130</b> after an internal delay time tREAD. The latency signal is then enabled in response to the internal read signal PREAD as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the DLL circuit <b>120</b> generates the data output clock signal CLKDQ such that the rising edge of the data output clock signal CLKDQ precedes the rising edge of the external clock signal ECLK by a period of time tSAC, where the time period tSAC equals the delay between enabling data output from the data output buffer <b>140</b> and the actual output of data from the memory device <b>100</b>. As further discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the data output buffer <b>140</b> outputs data when triggered by the data output clock signal CLKDQ only when the latency signal is enabled. Because the CAS latency has been set to 1 in this example, the latency signal is enabled prior to receipt of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. As a result, data is output from the memory device <b>100</b> in synchronization with the first clock pulse C<b>1</b> of the external clock signal ECLK following the clock pulse C<b>0</b> of the external clock signal ECLK when the read command <b>310</b> was received. The time delays tREAD and tSAC are internal delays set according to current process technology. Minimizing these delays improves the timing margin as to when the latency signal must be enabled before receipt of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. As the frequency of operation increases (i.e., the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK increases), the period between clock pulses of the external clock signal ECLK decreases. This reduces the timing margin for supplying the latency signal. Consequently, above a certain operating frequency, the latency signal enables after the data output clock signal CLKDQ, and the data is no longer output at the desired CAS latency. This results in a data read operation failure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates another example of where the operation frequency is low enough such that a proper data read operation takes place for a CAS latency of 2. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows the operation of the memory device <b>100</b> during a high frequency operation, wherein a data read operation failure takes place. As shown in this example, tREAD plus tSAC is greater than the period tCC of the external clock signal ECLK such that the internal read signal PREAD is asserted after the rising edge of a pulse CDQ<b>1</b> of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. The latency signal thus becomes enabled after a pulse CDQ<b>4</b> of the data output clock signal CLKDQ for the desired CAS latency. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the desired CAS latency is 4, and as is shown, data is output according to a CAS latency of 5 instead of a CAS latency of 4. As a result, a data read operation failure takes place.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the memory device according to the present invention. As shown, the memory device <b>400</b> includes a memory cell array <b>110</b>, a clock synchronizing circuit block <b>120</b>, a read command path block <b>130</b>, a data output buffer <b>140</b>, a mode register <b>150</b>, and a latency circuit <b>500</b>. Like reference numerals have been used to designate like components between the memory device <b>400</b> and the prior art memory device <b>100</b> described in the Background of the Invention section. Accordingly, a description of these same components will not be repeated for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the latency circuit <b>500</b> in greater detail. As shown, the latency circuit <b>500</b> includes a latency signal generator <b>502</b> generating the latency signal based on the data output clock CLKDQ, a master clock signal PCLKD, the internal read signal PREAD, and the CAS latency information. A read command path block replica <b>460</b> in the latency circuit <b>500</b> generates the master clock signal PCLKD based on a buffered version of the data output clock signal CLKDQ, which is generated by the data output buffer replica <b>124</b> in the clock synchronizing circuit block <b>120</b>. As such, the latency circuit <b>500</b> has been illustrated as sharing the data output buffer replica <b>124</b> with the clock synchronizing circuit block <b>120</b>. The operation of the read command path block replica <b>460</b> and the latency signal generator <b>502</b> will described in greater detail below after the discussion of a second embodiment of the latency circuit <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the latency circuit <b>500</b>. In this embodiment, the latency circuit <b>500</b> does not include the data output buffer replica <b>124</b> or the read command path block replica <b>460</b>. Instead, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, these elements are external to the latency circuit <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the read command path block replica <b>460</b> and the latency signal generator <b>502</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The read command path block replica <b>460</b> includes an internal clock generator replica <b>462</b> that receives a buffered version of the data output clock signal CLKDQ from the data output buffer replica <b>124</b>. The data output buffer replica <b>124</b> replicates the output delay of the data output buffer <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the buffered clock signal CLKF is a delayed version of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. The internal clock generator replica <b>462</b> is a replica of the internal clock generator <b>132</b>, and generates a replica internal clock signal PCLKR. A master clock generator <b>700</b> receives-the internal clock signal PCLK and the replica internal clock signal PCLKR and generates a master clock signal PCLKD.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the master clock generator <b>700</b>. As shown, an inverter <b>704</b> receives the replica internal clock signal PCLKR. The output of the inverter <b>704</b> controls the operation of a PMOS transistor <b>706</b>, which is connected in series with an NMOS transistor <b>708</b> between a power supply voltage VCC and a reference or ground voltage VSS. The operation of the NMOS transistor <b>708</b> is controlled by a reset signal. An enable signal is generated at the node connecting the PMOS transistor <b>706</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>708</b>. This enable signal is latched by a latch <b>720</b>, which is comprised of inverters <b>722</b> and <b>724</b> connected in a loop configuration to the enable signal node EN. An AND gate <b>710</b> receives the enable signal and a delayed internal clock signal PCLK<b>2</b>. A delay unit <b>702</b> receives and delays the internal clock signal PCLK to generate the delayed internal clock signal PCLK<b>2</b>. The period of the delay substantially equals the period of time to generate the enable signal based on the replica internal clock signal PCLKR. The output of the AND gate <b>710</b> serves as the master clock signal PCLKD.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the operation of the master clock generator <b>700</b>. As shown, when the reset signal is enabled, the NMOS transistor <b>708</b> pulls the enable signal to logic low. As a result, the AND gate <b>710</b> generates a logic low master clock signal PCLKD. When the reset signal is no longer enabled, the replica internal clock signal PCLKR controls the state of the enable signal such that at the rising edge of the replica internal clock signal PCLKR, the enable signal transitions to a logic high state. As a result, the AND gate <b>710</b> will output the delayed internal clock signal PCLK<b>2</b> as the master clock signal PCLKD. The-replica internal clock signal PCLKR is generated from output of the DLL circuit <b>120</b>. As a result, the replica internal clock signal PCLKR experiences some jitter, which decreases the frequency performance of the memory device. By using the replica internal clock signal PCLKR to enable the master clock signal PCLKD and by outputting the master clock signal PCLKD as a delayed version of the internal clock signal PCLK, which has not experienced such jitter, the master clock generator <b>700</b> generates a master clock signal PCLKD without jitter. Furthermore, because the internal clock signal PCLK is used as an internal clock signal for many of the peripheral circuits in the memory device <b>400</b>, the internal clock signal PCLK experiences a large load. By contrast, the master clock signal. PCLKD is not as loaded, and therefore can be used as a clock signal of the latency circuit <b>500</b> as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the latency signal generator <b>502</b>. As shown, the latency signal generator <b>502</b> includes a sampling signal generator <b>510</b> generating first-fourth sampling signals S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b> that, in this embodiment, serve as first-fourth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>4</b>, respectively. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the sampling signal generator <b>510</b> serves as a sampling clock signal generator, which generates the sampling clock signals based on the master clock signal PCLKD. Similarly, a transfer signal generator <b>550</b> generates first-fourth transfer signals T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> based on the data output clock signal CLKDQ. The sampling clock signal generator <b>510</b> and the transfer signal generator <b>550</b> include first and second ring shift registers <b>520</b> and <b>560</b>, respectively, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, first-fourth D-flip flops <b>521</b>-<b>524</b> are connected in cascade. First-fourth AND gates <b>525</b>-<b>528</b> have one input connected to a Q output of the first-fourth D-flip flops <b>521</b>-<b>524</b>, respectively. The other input of the first-fourth AND gates <b>525</b>-<b>528</b> and the clock inputs of the first-fourth D-flip flops <b>521</b>-<b>524</b> receive the master clock signal PCLKD in the case of the sampling clock signal generator <b>510</b> or the data output clock signal CLKDQ in the case of the transfer signal generator <b>550</b>.

Lastly, the reset inputs of the first-fourth D-flip flops <b>521</b>-<b>524</b> receive the reset signal. The first D-flip flop <b>521</b> is a settable D-flip flop and the second-fourth D-flip flops <b>522</b>-<b>524</b> are resettable D-flip flops.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The logic high signal will load into the first D-flip flop <b>521</b> on the rising edge of the received clock signal, and this pulse will be transferred to the second-fourth D-flip flops <b>522</b>-<b>524</b> as each clock signal pulse is received.

The clock pulses of the output data clock signal CLKDQ have also been numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the relationship between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the external clock signal ECLK. The master clock generator <b>700</b> begins generating the master clock signal PCLKD, a time period equal to tSAC plus tREAD after the output data clock signal CLKDQ is generated. The time period tSAC has been discussed in detail above. The time period tREAD is the period of time between receipt of the read command and generation of the internal read signal PREAD by the read command buffer <b>134</b>. The pulses of the master clock signal PCLKD illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref> have also been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the correspondence between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the external clock signal ECLK.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9F-9I</figref> with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, once the transfer signal generator <b>550</b> begins receiving clock signal pulses of the output data clock signal CLKDQ, pulses of the first-fourth transfer signals T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> are generated. As demonstrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9F-9I</figref>, each transfer signal has a frequency equal to the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK divided by the maximum number of supported CAS latency modes.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9J-9M</figref> with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref> illustrate that the first-fourth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>4</b> are generated by the sampling clock signal generator <b>510</b> when the master clock generator <b>700</b> begins generating pulses of the master clock signal PCLKD. As with the transfer signals, the sampling clock signals also have a frequency that is equal to the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK divided by the maximum number of supported CAS latency modes. Namely, the frequency of the first-fourth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>4</b> is determined by the number of D-flip flops in the first ring shift register <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The above discussed operation of the embodiment according to the present invention holds for any of the four possible CAS latency modes two-five, supported by this embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9F-9I</figref> include parentheticals that show which of the first-fourth transfer signals T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> are mapped to the first-fourth output transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>4</b> when the CAS latency mode is 4. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9O-9T</figref> illustrate the output signals LS<b>1</b>-LS<b>4</b>, the latency signal, and the data output from the memory device <b>400</b> when the CAS latency mode is 4 and a read command is received by the memory device <b>400</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, in this operational example, the read command signal is received when clock signal pulse <b>3</b> of the external clock signal ECLK transitions to logic high. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9N</figref>, the internal read signal PREAD is generated after an internal delay of tREAD, by the read command path block <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9F-9I</figref>, when the CAS latency is 4, the first-fourth transfer signals T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> are mapped by the mapping unit <b>540</b> to the second, third, fourth and first output signals TCLK<b>2</b>, TCLK<b>3</b>, TCLK<b>4</b> and TCLK<b>1</b>. Stated another way, first-fourth switches <b>535</b>-<b>538</b> receive the fourth, first, second and third transfer signals T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b>, respectively. As such, when the internal read signal PREAD transitions to logic high as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9N</figref>, the third sampling clock signal SCLK<b>3</b> causes the third latch <b>533</b> to latch the logic high PREAD signal. The other latches will have latched logic low PREAD. Accordingly, only the third output signal LS<b>3</b> from the third latch <b>533</b> will have a logic high state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9O-9R</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Then, when the second transfer signal T<b>2</b> transitions to logic high, the third switch <b>537</b> supplies a logic high signal to the output latch <b>539</b>, which in turn supplies a logic high latency signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9S</figref>. Because the latency signal is logic high when the output data clock signal CLKDQ transitions high at pulse <b>7</b> of the output data clock signal CLKDQ, the memory device <b>400</b> will output data D<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9T</figref> at the rising edge of pulse <b>7</b> of the external clock signal ECLK as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. Accordingly, with the read command having been received during pulse <b>3</b> of the external clock signal ECLK and the data being output from the memory device <b>400</b> at pulse <b>7</b> of the external clock signal ECLK, a CAS latency of 4 is achieved for the high frequency operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. In this embodiment, a single data word is output; however, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. Instead, by increasing the length of the read command, the number of data words output can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As will be appreciated, the mapping unit <b>540</b> selectively associates the transfer signals with the sampling clock signals based on the CAS latency to create a desired timing relationship between the sampling and transfer signals. This relationship then controls the time period between the receipt of a read command and the output of data by the memory device <b>400</b>. More specifically, this relationship controls the time period between receipt of the internal read signal PREAD and the generation of the latency signal. Here, the sampling clock signals trigger the first-fourth latches <b>531</b>-<b>534</b> and thus serve to designate a point in time when the read command is received. The association of the transfer signals with the sampling clock signals then serves as a second pointer in time as to when the latency signal should be generated. Through this arrangement and methodology, read operation errors during high frequency operation are prevented.</p>

As a result, the first-third sampling clock signal SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>3</b> and the first-third transfer clock signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>3</b> will be activated, but not the fourth sampling clock signal SCLK<b>4</b> or the fourth transfer clock signal TCLK<b>4</b>.</p>

Pulses of the external clock signal ECLK have been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., in order to provide an understanding of the relationship between the external clock signal ECLK and both the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the master clock signal PCLKD. As was described previously, the output data clock signal CLKDQ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> precedes the external clock signal ECLK by a time period tSAC. The clock pulses of the output data clock signal CLKDQ have also been numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the relationship between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the external clock signal ECLK. As also discussed above, the master clock generator <b>700</b> begins generating the master clock signal PCLKD, a time period equal to tSAC plus tREAD after the output data clock signal CLKDQ is generated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 17E</figref>, the internal read command PREAD is generated a time period tREAD after receiving the read command. The pulses of the master clock signal PCLKD illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref> have also been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the correspondence between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the external clock signal ECLK.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, in this operational example, the read command signal is received when clock signal pulse zero of the external clock signal ECLK transitions to logic high. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>, the-internal read signal PREAD is generated after an internal delay of tREAD, by the read command path block <b>130</b>. When the internal read signal PREAD transitions to logic high as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>, the first sampling clock signal SCLK<b>1</b> causes the first latch <b>531</b> to latch the logic high PREAD signal. The other latches will have latched logic low PREAD. Accordingly, only the first output signal LS<b>1</b> from the third latch <b>531</b> will have a logic high state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17N-17Q</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Then, when the first transfer clock signal TCLK<b>1</b> transitions to logic high, the first switch <b>535</b> supplies a logic high signal to the output latch <b>539</b>, which in turn supplies a logic high latency signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17R</figref>. Because the latency signal is logic high when the output data clock signal CLKDQ transitions high at pulse <b>4</b> of the output data clock signal CLKDQ, the memory device <b>400</b> will output data D<b>0</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9S</figref> at the rising edge of pulse <b>4</b> of the external clock signal ECLK as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. Accordingly, a CAS latency of 4 is achieved for the high frequency operation shown in FIG. <b>17</b>A. In this embodiment, a single data word is output; however, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. Instead, by increasing the length of the read command, the number of data words output can be increased.</p>

As the timing diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> are readily understood from the description of the timing diagrams in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the timing diagrams in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> will not be described in detail for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The latency signal generator <b>502</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> supports four CAS latency modes as evidenced by the four D-flip flops, latches, switches and multiplexers in the circuits forming the latency signal generator <b>502</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to supporting four CAS latency modes, and could support greater or fewer CAS latency modes by increasing or decreasing the number of D-flip flops, latches, switches and multiplexers forming the latency circuit <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As will be appreciated, the sampling clock signal generator <b>1410</b> and the transfer clock signal generator <b>1420</b> selectively activate the sampling and transfer clock signals and control the frequency of the activated sampling and transfer clock signals based on the CAS latency to create a desired timing relationship between the sampling and transfer clock signals. This relationship then controls the time period between the receipt of a read command and the output of data by the memory device <b>400</b>. More specifically, this relationship controls the time period between receipt of the internal read signal PREAD and the generation of the latency signal. As with previous embodiments, the sampling clock signals trigger the first-fourth latches <b>531</b>-<b>534</b> and thus serve to designate a point in time when the read command is received. The association of the transfer clock signals with the sampling clock signals then serves as a second pointer in time as to when the latency signal should be generated. Through this arrangement and methodology, read operation errors during high frequency operation are prevention.</p>

The clock signal generating circuit <b>810</b> includes seven delay elements <b>831</b>-<b>837</b> connected in parallel that respectively receive seven transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>7</b> that are output in parallel from a transfer signal generator <b>820</b>, which will be described in detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The delay elements <b>831</b>-<b>837</b> each receive a respective transfer signal TCLK and output a respective one of the sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>7</b>. The seven sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>7</b> respectively control first switches <b>850</b> of the latency signal generator <b>840</b>, and the seven transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>7</b> respectively control second switches <b>860</b> of the latency signal generator <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The latency signal generator <b>840</b> comprises one flip flop circuit <b>870</b> that latches the internal read signal PREAD on the rising edge of the internal clock signal PCLK to produce a pre-latency signal. Seven first switches <b>850</b> are each connected to the flip flop circuit <b>870</b>. First-seventh latches <b>841</b> through <b>847</b> latch the output from respective ones of the seven first switches <b>850</b>, and seven second switches <b>860</b> are respectively connected to the outputs of the first-seventh latches <b>841</b>-<b>847</b>. The output of the seven second switches <b>860</b> provides the latency signal LATENCY.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating the transfer signal generator <b>820</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the transfer signal generator <b>820</b> includes first-seventh D-flip flops <b>821</b>-<b>827</b> connected in series or cascade. Outputs of the first-sixth D-flip flops <b>821</b>-<b>826</b> are respectively connected to inputs of the second-seventh D-flip flops <b>822</b>-<b>827</b>. Each clock input CLK of the first-seventh D-flip flops <b>821</b>-<b>827</b> receives the buffered clock signal CLKF. The buffered clock signal CLKF has a frequency equal to a frequency of the data output clock signal CLKDQ generated by the DLL circuit <b>120</b>, and a phase leading a phase of the data output clock signal CLKDQ.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A PMOS transistor MP is connected between a power supply voltage and the reset input of the first D-flop flop <b>821</b>. The PMOS transistor MP receives a START signal at its gate and generates the reset signal RESET. While not shown for the sake of brevity, the reset signal is also supplied to the reset inputs of the second-seventh D-flip flops <b>821</b>-<b>827</b>. The first D-flip flop <b>821</b> is a settable D-flip flop and the second-seventh D-flip flops <b>822</b>-<b>827</b> are resettable D-flip flops. Accordingly, the first D-flip flop <b>821</b> is initialized as ‘1”, and the second-seventh D-flip flops <b>822</b>-<b>827</b> are initialized as “0”. The start signal START may be enabled after a period of time from the time when power is applied to a semiconductor memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">An output of the fourth D-flip flop <b>824</b> is connected to the input of the first D-flip flop <b>821</b> via a first switch SW<b>1</b>. An output of the fifth D-flip flop <b>825</b> is connected to the input of the first D-flip flop <b>821</b> via a second switch SW<b>2</b>, an output of the sixth D-flip flop <b>826</b> is connected to the input of the first D-flip flop <b>821</b> via a third switch SW<b>3</b>, and an output of the seventh D-flip flop <b>827</b> is connected to the input of the first D-flip flop <b>821</b> via a fourth switch SW<b>4</b>. The first-fourth switches SW<b>1</b>-SW<b>4</b> are controlled by a respective CAS latency CLi. When the CAS latency is 5, the first switch SW<b>1</b> is closed, when the CAS latency is 6, the second switch SW<b>2</b> is closed; when the CAS latency is 7, the third switch SW<b>3</b> is closed; and when the CAS latency is 8, the fourth switch SW<b>4</b> is closed. While not shown for the sake of clarity, the fifth-seventh D-flip flops <b>825</b>-<b>827</b> may also be reset in response to the CAS latency CLi. To be more specific, when the CAS latency is 5, the fifth-seventh D-flip flops <b>825</b>-<b>827</b> are reset; when the CAS latency is 6, the sixth and seventh D-flip flops <b>826</b> and <b>827</b> are reset; and when the CAS latency is 7, the seventh D-flip flop <b>827</b> is reset. As such, the transfer signal generator may function as a right shift register with each position of the ring shift register serving as a transfer signal; and wherein the switches form part of a control logic that selectively controls a length of the ring shift register.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As stated above, the latency circuit <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> latches the internal read signal PREAD in a flip flop circuit <b>870</b> on the rising edge of the internal clock signal, and the timing relationship between the sampling clock signals and transfer clock signals control the gating or timing with which the output of the D-flip flop <b>870</b> becomes the latency signal LATENCY. Because of the involvement of the D-flip flop <b>870</b>, the timing relationship of the sampling and transfer clock signals, as compared to the previous embodiments, is one less than the CAS latency (CLi−1). For example, when CL=5, while the latency circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>5</b>, the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>4</b>. When CL=6, while the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>6</b>, the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>5</b>. When CL=7, while the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>7</b>, the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>6</b>. When CL=8, while the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>8</b>, the latency circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> generates the transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>7</b>. Namely, the transfer signal generator <b>820</b> demultiplies the buffered clock signal CLKF by the CAS latency minus one.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Furthermore, it will be understood that more than one D-flip flop may be connected in series to delay the read signal PREAD and create the pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY. For each additional D-flip flop, the number flip flops in the transfer signal generator, and therefore, the number of transfer signals is reduced. This also reduces the number of latches and switches in the clock signal generator <b>840</b>. Also, it will be appreciated that the transfer signal generator <b>820</b> demultiplies the buffered clock signal CLKF by the CAS latency minus the number of flip flops delaying the read signal PREAD to create the signal PRE-LATENCY.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Next, operation of the memory device according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B or <b>4</b>C and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref> will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25S</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25S</figref> illustrate waveforms of the signals generated by or received by the memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B or <b>4</b>C having a latency circuit as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> when the CAS latency is 6. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A</figref>, <b>25</b>C, <b>25</b>F and <b>25</b>R illustrate the external clock signal ECLK, internal clock signal PCLK, buffered clock signal CLKF, and the data output clock CLKDQ, respectively. The pulses of the external clock signal ECLK, the buffered clock signal CLKF, the data output clock signal CLKDQ, and the internal clock signal PCLK have been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc. . . . in order to provide an understanding of correlations therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The internal clock generator <b>132</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C generates an internal clock signal PCLK, and generates the internal read signal PREAD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25D</figref> in response to the internal clock signal PCLK and an external read command READ CMD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>. The internal read signal PREAD is internally enabled after tREAD from when the external read command READ CMD is synchronized with and input in a first clock cycle <b>1</b> of the external clock signal ECLK. The data output clock signal CLKDQ is generated by the DLL circuit <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C. The buffered clock signal CLKF has a frequency equal to a frequency of the data output clock signal CLKDQ and a leading phase with respect to a phase of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>, the transfer signal generator <b>820</b> generates the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>5</b> in response to the buffered output clock signal CLKF. The first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>5</b>, that are delayed by a transfer sampling time tTS from the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>6</b>, respectively, are generated by the seven delay elements <b>831</b>-<b>837</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25G-25K</figref> illustrate the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>5</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25L-25P</figref> illustrate the first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>5</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25Q</figref> illustrates the latency signal LATENCY, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25S</figref> illustrates the output data DOUT from the data output buffer <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The internal read signal PREAD is latched by the D-flip flop <b>870</b> to generate the delayed version of the internal read signal called the pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY. The pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY is latched by the first-fifth latches <b>841</b>-<b>845</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> in response to the first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>5</b>. In this case, the pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY at a high level is latched by the second and third latches <b>842</b> and <b>843</b> in response to the second and third sampling clock signals SCLK<b>2</b> and SCLK<b>3</b>. The pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY at a low level is latched by other latches. The first-fifth latches <b>841</b>-<b>845</b> maintain previous data up to a next latch point by the first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK<b>1</b>-SCLK<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Data stored in the first-fifth latches <b>841</b>-<b>845</b> are generated as the latency signal LATENCY in response to the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK<b>1</b>-TCLK<b>5</b>, respectively. The latency signal LATENCY is enabled at a high level in response to the second and third transfer signals TCLK<b>2</b> and TCLK<b>3</b> and the latency signal LATENCY is disabled in a state of a low level in response to the fourth transfer signal TCLK<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The output data DOUT is output in synchronization with the data output clock signal CLKDQ while the latency signal LATENCY is enabled in the state of the high level. The output data DOUT in synchronization with the data output clock signal CLKDQ is output to a bus after tSAC.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Output data D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in synchronization with seventh and eighth clock cycles <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> of the data output clock signal CLKDQ are synchronized with seventh and eighth clock cycles <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> of the external clock signal ECLK and output to the bus. Since the valid output data DOUT is output in the seventh clock cycle <b>7</b> of the external clock signal ELCK in response to the external read command READ CMD which is input in the first clock cycle <b>1</b> of the external clock signal ELCK, the CAS latency is 6. Furthermore, as with previous embodiments, this embodiment is not limited to outputting the number of data words as described.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">This embodiment of the present invention supports a CAS latency of CL<b>8</b> at a maximum. The latency circuit <b>500</b> may increase or decrease a maximum value of the CAS latency supported by the latency circuit <b>500</b> by increasing or decreasing the number of D-flip flops, delay elements, switches and latches. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the latency circuit <b>500</b> may adjust the CAS latency by adjusting the number and position of switches SW<b>1</b>-SW<b>4</b> of the latency signal generator <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described above, in the timing diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25S</figref>, the internal clock signal PCLK is latched to create the delayed read signal PRE-LATENCY. Like the latency circuits of previous embodiments, the latency circuit of this embodiment then latches and stores the delayed internal read signal PRE-LATENCY using a plurality of sampling clock signals and generates the latched delayed internal read signal PRE-LATENCY as the latency signal LATENCY at a desired output clock CLKDQ based on a plurality of transfer signals. Also, the number and pulse interval of sampling clock and transfer signals generated according to the CAS latency makes a difference in timing or relationship therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The invention can be modified in many ways. However, all such modifications obvious to one skilled in the art are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and are within the scope of the invention.</p>
