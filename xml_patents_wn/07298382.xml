<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A figure selection method and device including a retrieval operation of a figure element adjacent to a designated figure element where a figure is formed by a plurality of figure elements. According to an aspect of the present invention, the retrieval operation is configured to retrieve a figure element neighboring the designated figure element such that the designation is automatically accomplished without individually designating each of the figure elements neighboring the designated figure element. The retrieval operation is further configured to perform a retrieval process a predetermined number of times such that figure elements adjacent to or in the neighborhood of figure elements are automatically designated the predetermined number of times. Further, the figure selection method of the present invention includes displaying the figure element retrieved by the retrieval operation according to a style different from that of other figure elements, and allows the automatically-designated figure elements to be distinguished from other figure elements.</p>
<p id="p-0002" num="0000">Further, a computer-readable storage medium of the present invention stores a figure selection program to retrieve a figure element adjacent to the designated figure element in a storage medium storing a figure selection program for selecting a figure formed by a plurality of figure elements. Accordingly, designation is automatically accomplished without the need to individually designate figure elements adjacent to the designated figure element.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a figure selection method, a figure selection device, and a storage medium storing a figure selection program when an arbitrary figure is selected for editing to make correction, transfer, copy, cancellation, grouping, conversion into 2D(two dimension)/3D(three dimension), and so on, in a CAD system or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">A selection operation of a figure to be edited is frequently repeated for editing to make correction, transfer, copy, cancellation, grouping, conversion into 2D(two dimension)/3D(three dimension) and and so on, in a CAD system or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">A figure is generally represented by a point, a line, a plane, a solid, or a collection thereof or a part thereof (edge or the like). A figure element is a basic unit to form a figure, and it is broadly represented by a point, a line, a plane, a solid, or a collection thereof or a part thereof (edge or the like). Narrowly speaking, however, a figure element is represented by a line, but in the present specification, it is represented by linear data including a straight line, a curved line, a circle, an arc, a spline curved line and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram explaining a pick-method of the first prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to select a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5100</figref> formed by figure elements <b>5101</b>, <b>5102</b>, <b>5103</b>, <b>5104</b>, <b>5105</b>, <b>5106</b>, <b>5107</b> and <b>5108</b> using a pick-method, an arrow-shaped pointer <b>5110</b> is displayed on a display using an input unit such as a mouse or the like, and the mouse is clicked placing a head of the pointer <b>5110</b> on at least six figure elements <b>5101</b>, <b>5102</b>, <b>5103</b>, <b>5104</b>, <b>5106</b>, and <b>5108</b>, thereby selecting the desired <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5100</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram explaining a chain retrieval method of the second prior art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in order to select a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5200</figref> formed by figure elements <b>5201</b> to <b>5104</b> using a chain retrieval method, an arrow-shaped pointer <b>5210</b> is displayed on a display using an input unit such as a mouse or the like similarly to the pick-method, and the mouse is clicked placing a head of the pointer <b>5210</b> on the figure element <b>5201</b> which is one of the figure elements forming the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5200</figref> to be selected. Thus, the system automatically selects figure elements <b>5202</b>, <b>5203</b>, and <b>5204</b> which uniformally follow the figure element <b>5201</b>, thereby selecting the desired <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5200</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram explaining a maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method of the third prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an arrow-shaped pointer <b>5320</b> is displayed on a display using an input unit such as a mouse or the like, and the mouse is clicked placing a head of the pointer <b>5320</b> on a figure element <b>5301</b> which is one of the figure elements. Thus, in the maximum closed-loop retrieval method, the system retrieves a maximum closed-loop <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5330</figref> formed by figure elements <b>5301</b>, <b>5302</b>, <b>5303</b>, <b>5304</b>, <b>5305</b>, <b>5306</b>, <b>5307</b> and <b>5308</b>. In the minimum closed-loop retrieval method, the system retrieves a minimum closed-loop <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5340</figref> formed by figure elements <b>5301</b>, <b>5308</b>, <b>5309</b>, and <b>5310</b>. Thus, desired figures <b>5330</b> and <b>5340</b> are selected.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">As the forth prior art, there is a combination method of combining more than two methods of the above-mentioned pick-method, chain retrieval method, and maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method. When a desired figure is selected by the combination method, a desired figure is selected while selecting the respective methods depending on each mode in such a way that the pick-method is used in a pick-mode, the chain retrieval method is used in a chain retrieval mode, the maximum closed-loop retrieval method is used in a maximum closed-loop retrieval mode, and the minimum closed-loop retrieval method is used in a minimum closed-loop retrieval mode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">In the figure selection method described in each prior art, however, there have been the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">In the case of the pick-method of the first prior art, operations should be performed many times for the selection of a desired figure. The mouse should be clicked on a figure element at least six times in order to select, for example, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5100</figref> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">In the case of the chain retrieval method of the second prior art, the mouse is clicked on a figure element only one time, but only the figure formed by a group of figure elements following the mouse-clicked figure element can be selected. Therefore, the shape of a figure which can be selected is restricted. For example, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 5200</figref> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be selected by clicking the figure element <b>5201</b> one time using a mouse. This is because the figure elements <b>5202</b>, <b>5203</b> and <b>5204</b> are sequentially and uniformally determined following the figure element <b>5201</b>. That is, only a figure in which another figure element is not connected with the connection part of two figure elements can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">In the case of the maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method of the third prior art, a figure element is clicked only one time using a mouse similarly to the chain retrieval method. Further, a figure in which another figure element is connected with the connection part of two figure elements can be selected. The thus-selected figure is an outermost closed-loop figure, or an innermost closed-loop figure which contains a mouse-clicked figure element.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">In the case of the combination method of the forth prior art, a figure can be selected making use of each advantage of the above-mentioned conventional figure selection methods described in the first to third prior arts. However, an additional operation such as the switching of each mode is required.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">When the chain retrieval method or the maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method is used, figure elements to be connected cannot be retrieved by these methods in the following cases:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">(1) Two figure elements to be connected are not connected in the case where errors are generated while a figure is being prepared or in the case where existing data stored in an old CAD system which uses precision data with single precision are transferred to a new CAD system which uses precision data with double precision; and
<br/>
(2) A cause-and-effect relationship exists between two figure elements even if they are not really connected as in the case where the figure elements are omitted or the figure elements are hidden lines.
</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">The present invention has been developed to solve the above-mentioned problems, and aims at realizing a figure selection method, a figure selection device, and a storage medium storing a figure selection program, for selecting a desired figure with a minimum number of operations.</p>

The end-connected-element retrieval unit <b>212</b> performs the end-connected-element retrieval process (step S<b>6</b>), the crossed-element retrieval unit <b>211</b> performs the crossed-element retrieval process (step S<b>7</b>), and the shape-corrected branch element retrieval unit <b>213</b> performs the shape-corrected branch element retrieval process (step S<b>8</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a flowchart of the end-connected-element retrieval process. In step S<b>61</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the end-connected-element retrieval unit <b>212</b> accesses the figure element storage DB <b>114</b> based on the information about a reference element, which is registered in Tables 3 and 4 of the retrieval candidate storage DB <b>122</b>. Then, the unit retrieves figure elements which are connected with the reference element under the end-connected state. In step S<b>62</b>, when a figure element which is connected with the reference element under the end-connected state, is detected (step S<b>62</b>: Yes), information about the detected figure element is registered as new information about the reference element in Tables 3 and 4, and Tables 9 and 10, in step S<b>62</b>. However, in the case where a figure element which is connected with the reference element under the end-connected state is not detected in step S<b>62</b> (step S<b>62</b>: No), in step S<b>64</b>, the ID (Nth ID) of the last figure element registered in Table 1 is registered in Table 3 as new information about the reference element.

In step S<b>72</b>, when a figure element which crosses the reference element under the end-connected state, is detected (step S<b>72</b>: Yes), information about the detected figure element is registered in Tables 3 and 4, and also in Tables 5 and 6, in step S<b>73</b>. However, when a figure element which crosses the reference element under the end-crossed state is not detected in step S<b>72</b> (step S<b>72</b>: No), it is determined in step S<b>74</b> whether or not branches are retrieved up to a predetermined Nth generation which is registered in Table 7. In the case where it is determined in step S<b>74</b> that branches are not retrieved up to the Nth generation registered in Table 7 (step S<b>74</b>: No), in step S<b>75</b>, new information about the reference element is registered in Tables 3 and 4 based on the information in Tables 5 and 6, and the new information is also registered in Tables 7 and 8 based on the information in Tables 7 and 8. When it is determined in step S<b>74</b> that branches are retrieved up to the Nth generation registered in Table 7 (step S<b>74</b>: Yes), ID of the last figure element (Nth) registered in Table 1 is registered in Table 3, in step S<b>77</b>.

<p id="p-0213" num="0211">Next, the continuous-line-group extraction process will be specifically explained using some examples in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 to 50</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0212">In a figure in which 11 figure elements <b>4201</b>, <b>4202</b>, <b>4203</b>, <b>4204</b>, <b>4205</b>, <b>4206</b>, <b>4207</b>, <b>4208</b>, <b>4209</b>, <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> are drawn as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the operation for an operator to select an arbitrarily desired <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 4230</figref> and its display will be explained hereinafter. Assume that two generations have been determined to be displayed as candidate branches. That is, 2 is registered in item “generation” in Table 7.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0213">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, an operator places the head of an arrow-shaped pointer <b>4320</b> on the figure element <b>4201</b> using an input unit such as a mouse or the like, and clicks the mouse. Thus, the figure element <b>4201</b> is designated as the head figure element of the continuous-line-group <b>4230</b> desired by the operator. Then, the ID of the figure element <b>4201</b> is registered in item “figure element ID” in Table 1, setting the figure element <b>4201</b> as a reference element. The ID of the figure element <b>4201</b> is registered in item “figure element ID”, and a coordinate value of the pointer <b>4320</b> is registered in item “reference point coordinate value”, in Table 3. Then, the figure element <b>4201</b> is echo-displayed in a predetermined color (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the element is displayed by a bold line).</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0214">Next, a retrieval processes for the first generation (the crossed-element retrieval process, the end-connected-element retrieval process, the shape-corrected branch element retrieval process, or the like) are performed based on the information registered in Table 3. Since a branch element observed from the figure element <b>4201</b> is only the figure element <b>4202</b> retrieved by the crossed-element retrieval process as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, 1 is registered in item “crossed element number” in Table 5, and the ID of the figure element <b>4202</b> is registered in item “crossed figure element ID”. Further, the figure element <b>4202</b> is displayed in a predetermined candidate color (in the figure, a dotted line). Then, information about the figure element <b>4202</b> is registered as a branch candidate in Tables 7 and 8.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0215">Since the figure element retrieved by the retrieval process for the first generation is only figure element <b>4201</b>, a retrieval process for the second generation is performed setting the figure element <b>4201</b> as a reference element. Next, three figure elements such as the figure elements <b>4203</b> and <b>4204</b> retrieved by the crossed-element retrieval process and a figure element <b>4203</b> retrieved by the end-connected-element retrieval process are recognized as branch candidates observed from the figure element <b>4202</b>. Then, information about the figure elements are registered in the respective tables. When a branch candidate retrieved by the end-connected-element retrieval process is one for the respective ends of the reference element, or when a branch candidate retrieved by the end-connected element retrieval process is an end of the other side in the case where a reference candidate is the branch retrieved by the end-connected-element retrieval process, the end-connected-element retrieval process is recursively performed regardless of the established number of generations. Five figure elements such as figure elements <b>4203</b>, <b>4204</b>, and <b>4209</b> to <b>4211</b> are recognized as branch candidates observed from the figure element <b>4202</b> by the retrieval process for the second generation including the recursively performed end-connected-element retrieval process. The information about the figure elements are registered in the respective tables. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the figure elements are displayed in a predetermined candidate color. Since the established generation number is 2, the process will enter an input-waiting state.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0216">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, an operator places the head of the pointer <b>4520</b> on the figure element <b>4204</b>, and clicks the mouse to designate a figure element <b>4204</b>, which is one of the branch candidates.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0217">When the figure element <b>4204</b> is designated, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is displayed by the coordinate value of the pointer <b>4520</b>, which is registered in Table 3 as a reference point coordinate value of figure element <b>4204</b>, crossed coordinate values of the figure elements <b>4202</b> and <b>4204</b> are registered in Table 6, the direction (arrow in the figure) is registered in Table 4 and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0218">Further, by designating the figure element <b>4204</b>, a retrieval process for the new first generation is performed by setting the figure element <b>4204</b> as a reference element. The difference from the above-mentioned retrieval process for the first generation lies in the fact that information about the direction is registered in Table 4. In a retrieval process for the new first generation, a figure element retrieved by the respective retrieval processes as a branch candidate based on the information about the direction is only a figure element <b>4208</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>. Although a figure element <b>4207</b> crosses the figure element <b>4204</b>, the element <b>4207</b> is not regarded as a branch candidate since it is located ahead of the reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0219">As mentioned above, the continuous-line-group extraction process is performed, and an operator can select the desired <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 4230</figref> by designating only figure elements <b>4201</b> and <b>4204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0220">With respect to a method of displaying a figure element which is a candidate for selection or a designated figure element, any method is available if the above-mentioned figure element can be distinguished from the other elements. For example, a method of displaying the figure element in a bold line, in a different color, or flashing is also available. Another example is a method of relatively highlighting the figure element by coloring the other figure elements gray. Still another example is a method of displaying the element figure in a separate window after it is reduced or simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0221">The present invention can apply to any single device, any system or any integrated device composed of several devices, or any system performing a process via a network such as LAN, WAN or the like, if the functions of the present invention can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0222">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the present invention can be realized by a system composed of a CPU <b>4901</b> connected with a bus <b>4909</b>, a memory <b>4902</b> such as ROM or RAM, an input device <b>4903</b>, an output device <b>4904</b>, an external storage device <b>4905</b>, a medium drive device <b>4906</b>, a portable storage medium <b>4910</b>, and a network connection device <b>4907</b>. That is, the present invention can also be realized by installing a system or a device the memory <b>4902</b> such as ROM or RAM, the external storage device <b>4905</b>, and the portable storage medium <b>4909</b> which store the program code of software for realizing a system of each above-mentioned embodiment, so that a computer (or CPU <b>4901</b> or MPU) of the system or the device reads out the program code to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0223">In this case, the program code which is read out by each storage medium can realize a new function of the present invention. Therefore, the portable storage medium <b>4910</b> which stores the program code forms the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0227" num="0225">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the function of the above-mentioned embodiment is realized by executing a program code which is read out from a memory <b>5001</b> via a computer <b>5000</b>. In addition, the function is also realized by performing part or all of the processes via an OS on the computer <b>5000</b> based on the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0226">Further, the function can be realized in such a way that after a program code which is read out by the portable storage medium <b>5010</b> is written in a memory accommodated in (1) an expansion board installed in the computer <b>5000</b> or (2) a function expansion unit connected with the computer, a CPU accommodated in the function expansion board or the function expansion unit performs part or all of the processes based on the instructions of the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0227">As mentioned above, using a figure selection method, a figure selection device, and a storage medium storing a figure selection program of the present invention, an operator can reduce the number of operations for selecting a desired figure. Therefore, he/she can efficiently select the desired figure in a short time.</p>
