<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to fiber optics, including fiber optics used in Fiber Channel interconnections and other interconnections.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Optical fibers are used in various systems. For example, Fiber Channel systems use optical fibers. The Fiber Channel standard was developed and adopted by the American National Standard for Information Systems (ANSI). Briefly, Fiber Channel is a switched protocol that allows concurrent communication among servers, workstations, and various peripherals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a block diagram of a representative Fiber Channel architecture. A Fiber Channel network <b>100</b> is presented. Systems such as a workstation <b>120</b> and servers <b>122</b> are interconnected with various subsystems (for example, a tape subsystem <b>126</b>, a disk subsystem <b>128</b>, and a display subsystem <b>130</b>) via a Fiber Channel fabric <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Fiber Channel fabric <b>110</b> is a system that interconnects various node ports (N_ports) attached to the fabric <b>110</b>. The fabric <b>110</b> receives frames of data from a source node port and, using a Fiber Channel protocol, route the frames to a destination node port. In a preferred embodiment, the first protocol is the Fiber Channel protocol. Similar protocols, such as the a synchronous transfer mode (ATM), may be used in other similar embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each of the various systems (for example, server <b>122</b>) and subsystems (for example, disk subsystem <b>128</b>) connected to the Fiber Channel fabric <b>110</b> includes an associated node port <b>140</b>. Each node port comprises a hardware communication device at the node end of a link.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fabric ports (F_ports) <b>142</b> are access points of the fabric <b>110</b> for physically connecting the various node ports <b>140</b>. The fabric <b>110</b> has the capability of routing data frames based upon information contained within the frames as specified by a class of service. The node port <b>140</b> typically manages the point-to-point connection between itself and the fabric <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Interconnections between the node ports <b>140</b> and fabric ports <b>142</b> typically include fiber optic cables. As the use of fiber optics has grown in Fiber Channel systems and other systems, a need for fiber management techniques has arisen.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is desirable to improve the management of fiber optics used in Fiber Channel systems and in other systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment of the invention pertains to a manufactured multi-fiber cable for optical systems. The multi-fiber cable is manufactured to include a plurality of individual fiber cables, each individual fiber cable including a single optical fiber surrounded by a protective covering. There is a main cable hose around the individual fiber cables, and there is a connector on each end of each individual fiber cable. The individual fiber cables in the multi-fiber cable are preconfigured to be visually distinct from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment pertains to a manufactured multi-fiber cable for Fiber Channel systems that includes a plurality of individual fiber cables, a main cable hose around the individual fiber cables, a protective reinforcement along the main cable hose, a connector on each end of each individual fiber cable, labels that are thermally attached to each end of the individual fiber cables during manufacture of the multi-fiber cable, and labels that are thermally attached to each end of the main cable hose during manufacture of the multi-fiber cable. Distinctive colors are used on the coverings of the individual fiber cables so as to provide said visual distinctness between the individual fiber cables of the multi-fiber cable. The individual fiber cables each comprise a single optical fiber surrounded by a covering, and the individual fiber cables extend outward past the main cable hose by less than one meter. Each connector comprises a precision ceramic ferrule.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Disadvantages and Difficulties with Conventional Techniques</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The management of optical fibers presents concerns than were not faced in conventional copper wire systems. For example, consider the management of the multitude of single optical fibers in a typical Fiber Channel system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A first concern is that optical fibers require significantly greater care than do copper wires, as they cannot be bent sharply, crimped, or twisted. Since optical fibers and their assemblies tend to be expensive, it is desirable to avoid damage to the optical fibers during system installation and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A second concern is that determining or verifying identification of individual optical fibers is considerably more difficult than for copper wires. With copper wires, the correspondence between wires at the ends of a long cable may be readily verified, for example, by shorting two wires at one end and checking for connectivity at the other end, or by using inexpensive testing devices. On the other hand, verifying the correspondence between optical fibers at the ends of an optical cable require more complex and expensive test equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, today in data centers, numerous single fiber cables are typically used between a server and a Fiber Channel switch (or storage array). A typical set-up may require 100 to 350 single fiber cables. These cables need to be laid very carefully into a raised floor or in overhead trays. During the lay process, the cables are vulnerable to be damaged. In addition, the ends of the individual fiber cables conventionally require laborious manual identification and manual labeling. Debugging errors due to incorrect connections are painstaking.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Solutions Provided by the Present Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure provides solutions to the above-discussed problems. By using the multi-fiber cable configured as disclosed herein, labor to lay the fiber cables is minimized. Hence, higher quality work is achievable at a faster rate when laying the fiber cables.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Specific Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a multi-fiber (multi-string) Fiber Channel cable is disclosed. The multi-fiber Fiber Channel cable may be implemented with two, four, six, eight, or sixteen individual fiber cables per multi-fiber cable. The multiple individual fiber cables are tied together and configured together within a hose to form the multi-fiber cable.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a multi-fiber cable <b>200</b> for efficient manageability in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The particular cable depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a four-fiber cable. However, as mentioned above, other multi-fiber cables implemented in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may include other numbers of fibers, such two, four, six, eight, or sixteen individual fiber cables per multi-fiber cable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The multi-fiber cables are preferably formed in standard lengths. For example, the standard lengths may be two meters, five meters, ten meters, fifteen meters, thirty meters, and one hundred meters. Other standard lengths are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The ends of each individual fiber cable <b>202</b> of the multi-fiber cable <b>200</b> are configured to extend outside the hose (or wrap or coat) <b>206</b> of the main multi-fiber cable <b>200</b>. Each end of an individual fiber cable <b>202</b> is further pre-configured with a connector <b>204</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the connector <b>204</b> is a precision ceramic ferrule, such as an LC connector or an SC connector.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each individual fiber cable <b>202</b> is preferably coated with a protective coating of a unique color and/or pattern. In other words, each individual fiber cable <b>202</b> in the multi-fiber cable is individually identifiable by the color and/or the pattern of its outer coating.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment, the multi-fiber cable <b>200</b> may be constructed with a main label <b>208</b> on each end. In addition, each individual (independent) cable <b>202</b> may also be constructed with an individual fiber label <b>210</b>. The labels may be attached, for example, using a thermal transfer process, and the attachment may be performed using an automated label applicator machine.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a multi-fiber cable <b>300</b> for efficient manageability with a protective reinforcement in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is again a 4-fiber cable, but other embodiments would have other numbers of individual cables.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The difference between the multi-fiber cable <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the multi-fiber cable <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that an additional protective reinforcement is added. As illustrated, the protective reinforcement may comprise, for example, a metal spiral <b>302</b>. The metal spiral <b>302</b> is depicted as implemented on the outside of the main cable hose <b>206</b>, but may also be implemented on the inside or embedded within the main cable hose <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Advantageously, the protective reinforcement further prevents damage from external forces. For example, the metal spiral <b>302</b> may prevent damage from a person stepping on the cable <b>300</b> with his or her foot. As another example, the metal spiral <b>302</b> may prevent damage from a person strongly bending the cable <b>300</b> by limiting the amount of bend inflicted on the cable <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a multi-fiber cable <b>400</b> for efficient manageability with protective reinforcement and a spare fiber cable <b>402</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is again a 4-fiber cable, but other embodiments would be designed for other numbers of individual cables.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The difference between the multi-fiber cable <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the multi-fiber cable <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the spare (redundant) fiber cable <b>402</b> is added. The spare fiber cable <b>402</b> may be conveniently used to make a connection in case one of the other cables (or one of the connectors) has a fault or breaks. The spare cable <b>402</b> may also be used if need for an additional connection arises.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present application discloses a multi-fiber cable for efficient manageability of Fiber Channel or other systems. There are various advantages of using the multi-fiber cable as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, compared with the conventional technique of laying hundreds of individual cable fibers, using the multi-fiber cables substantially reduces the number of (main) cables to lay. This advantageously reduces labor time required.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Second, using the multi-fiber cables substantially reduces risk of damage to the individual fiber cables. The bundle of individual fiber cables is difficult to bend at a sharp angle, and the main cable hose further protects the individual cable fibers from damage.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Third, the multi-fiber cables (after being laid) are easier to remove. The bundling of the individual fiber cables reduces the number of cables to remove and also reduces the chance of damage to the individual fiber cables. The main cable hose provides an additional protection for the fragile individual fiber cables.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Fourth, the labor required to label the cables is reduced due to the built-in labels. In one embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, labels are built-in both on each end of the main cable hose and on each end of the individual fiber cables.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fifth, trouble shooting is simplified and facilitated using the multi-fiber cable as disclosed herein. The coloring of the individual fiber cables makes it easier to distinguish and identify each independent fiber. In addition, the built-in labeling may be used to further distinguish and identify each main cable and each independent fiber therein.</p>
