<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a ventilation system for a convergent divergent nozzle equipping a turbojet for military use.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It relates more precisely to a bypass turbojet comprising an afterburn chamber of axis X delimited by an annular wall situated radially inside an annular casing, said annular wall and said casing defining an annular passage through which circulates a stream of cooling air, a convergent divergent axisymmetric nozzle arranged downstream of said afterburn chamber and comprising a circle of convergent flaps hinged at the downstream end of said casing and a circle of divergent flaps hinged at the downstream end of said convergent flaps, each circle of flaps comprising alternately a plurality of controlled flaps, and a plurality of follower flaps, a circle of cold flaps arranged radially outside said nozzle and hinged at their upstream end to a conical shell linked to the downstream part of said casing, means for creating a film of cooling air on the internal faces of said convergent flaps and means of cooling said divergent flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,127 relates to a turbojet of the type mentioned above in which the cooling of the divergent flaps is achieved through a mixing of the nacelle air stream with a tapping off of air from the downstream part of the annular duct through which the stream for cooling the annular wall circulates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The air is tapped off directly by bleeding from the duct with an adjustment valve at the bleed outlet. Downstream of the bleed elbow is placed a jet spout which carries out the mixing between the high-pressure engine air and the unpressurized nacelle air. The exact disposition of the tap-off is not indicated in this document. However, direct tap-off from the duct might not be effective for tapping off sizeable quantities of flow from the cooling stream, since it disturbs the operation of the ventilation. Hot gases might be reintroduced therein under the annular wall and there might be poor feeding of the film for cooling the convergent flaps. Moreover, it is difficult to house such a device within the footprint of the nozzle, since this environment is very cluttered with the jacks for controlling the flaps and the levers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The aim of the invention is to efficiently and uniformly feed the divergent flaps of a convergent divergent nozzle cooled with a device which has a high degree of integration with the existing components.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention achieves its aim through the fact that the means of cooling said divergent flaps comprise:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">an annular plenum chamber delimited downstream by said conical shell and fed with cooling air through drillings made in a boundary wall between said plenum chamber and the downstream end of said annular passage,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">a plurality of distribution cells surrounding the plenum chamber and linked to the latter, said cells being delimited downstream by said conical shell and being arranged around the X axis in the planes of symmetry of the follower flaps, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">telescopic pipelines each linking a cell to the follower divergent flap situated in the same plane of symmetry as said cell.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">Thus the structure of the plenum chamber and of the cells is constituted by the conical shell and by complementary walls which strengthen the conical shell. Moreover, the follower divergent flaps are fed with pressurized cooling air issuing from the annular duct delimited by the annular wall and the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">The plenum chamber makes it possible to slow the speed of the air received and to increase the pressure of the air for cooling the follower divergent flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">The following arrangements are furthermore advantageously adapted:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">the follower divergent flaps are partitioned and cooled by the air delivered by the telescopic pipelines while the controlled divergent flaps have a single skin;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">the convergent flaps are of the single skin type;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0015">the conical wall comprises openings between the cells to allow the circulation of a nacelle air in the space surrounding the convergent divergent nozzle;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0016">the stream of cooling air circulating through the annular duct is divided into two streams by means of a stationary ring integral with the boundary wall, the radially inner stream being injected upstream of the convergent flaps via a slot and the radially outer stream being injected into the plenum chamber through the drillings of the boundary wall.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">This latter arrangement makes it possible to avoid the creation of pressure reductions in regard to the bleeds of the prior art and the reintroduction of hot gases. This ensures, furthermore, homogeneity of the cooling of the convergent flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">Advantageously, the means for cooling the divergent flaps furthermore comprise means for adjusting the flow rate of cooling air for said flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">The flow rate adjustment means preferably comprise a ring mounted movably in a slide integral with the boundary wall, said ring and said slide each comprising a plurality of flow rate adjustment holes capable of being matched up with the drillings of the boundary wall by displacement of said ring.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">According to a first embodiment, the ring is mounted movably in rotation about the X axis and is driven in rotation by a rack and pinion system by means of an actuator driving said pinion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">According to a second embodiment, the ring is mounted movably in translation parallel to the X axis and is displaced by a plurality of synchronized jacks.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0033">This convergent divergent nozzle <b>10</b> comprises a first circle of convergent flaps comprising controlled convergent flaps <b>11</b>, hinged to the downstream end of the casing <b>4</b> and alternating circumferentially with follower convergent flaps <b>12</b> also hinged to the downstream end of the casing <b>4</b>, and a second circle of divergent flaps alternately exhibiting controlled divergent flaps <b>13</b> hinged at the downstream end of the controlled convergent flaps <b>11</b>, and follower divergent flaps <b>14</b> hinged at the downstream end of the follower convergent flaps <b>12</b>, the number of convergent flaps being even and equal to the number of divergent flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">Around the nozzle <b>10</b> are provided cold flaps <b>15</b> hinged at their downstream end to a conical shell <b>16</b> integral with the downstream part of the casing <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">At the downstream end of the annular duct <b>6</b> is provided a ring <b>20</b> which splits the cold secondary stream F<b>2</b> into a radially inner stream F<b>3</b> which emerges through a slot tangentially to the internal wall of the convergent flaps, in such a way as to form a film of cold air driven by the hot stream F<b>1</b> and licking the convergent flaps, the latter thus being able to be of the single skin type, and into a radially outer stream F<b>4</b> intended for the cooling of the divergent flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">As is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, via openings <b>21</b> made in the end wall <b>22</b> of the casing <b>4</b> and situated downstream of the conical shell <b>16</b>, the stream F<b>4</b> enters an annular plenum chamber <b>23</b> of axis X, delimited upstream by the radially inner part <b>17</b> of the conical shell <b>16</b>, and downstream by the structure <b>24</b> for fixing the convergent divergent nozzle <b>10</b>, integral with the casing <b>4</b>. The end wall <b>22</b>, comprising the openings <b>21</b>, forms the boundary between the annular duct <b>6</b> and the plenum chamber <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">Right around the plenum chamber <b>23</b> are provided a plurality of cells <b>30</b>, each arranged in the plane of symmetry of a follower convergent flap <b>12</b> and of the follower divergent flap <b>14</b> hinged to said follower convergent flap <b>12</b>. Each cell <b>30</b> is delimited upstream by a mid portion <b>18</b> of the conical shell <b>16</b>, and circumferentially by two substantially parallel walls <b>19</b> formed in one piece with the conical shell <b>16</b>, as is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is delimited downstream by a shut-off wall <b>31</b> which connects the fixing structure <b>24</b> to the upper part <b>32</b> of the conical shell <b>16</b>, this shut-off wall <b>31</b> comprising an orifice <b>33</b>, the use of which will be explained later in the present document.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">Between two consecutive cells <b>30</b>, the plenum chamber <b>23</b> is shut off by a substantially axial wall <b>34</b>, visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which connects the radially inner ends of two adjacent walls <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">It may also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> that the conical shell <b>16</b> furthermore exhibits a wall <b>35</b>, steeply inclined, which extends between the downstream edge of the axial wall <b>34</b>, the downstream edges of said two adjacent walls <b>19</b> and the upstream edge of the upper part <b>32</b>, between two adjacent cells <b>30</b>. This wall <b>35</b> exhibits several orifices <b>36</b> allowing the circulation of unpressurized nacelle air F<b>5</b> so as to cool the various devices for controlling the flaps of the convergent divergent nozzle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">The orifice <b>33</b> of each cell comprises a link <b>40</b> for fastening the upstream end of a telescopic tube or pipeline <b>41</b> linked to the follower divergent nozzle <b>14</b> situated in the same axial plane passing through the X axis.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">The follower divergent flaps <b>14</b> are of the partitioned type and the interior of these flaps <b>14</b> receives a part of the air stream F<b>4</b>, which is pressurized. Appropriate orifices make it possible to discharge this air into the stream F<b>1</b> and toward the inner wall of the controlled divergent flaps <b>13</b> which may advantageously be of the single skin type.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">The radially outer stream F<b>4</b> is injected into the plenum chamber <b>23</b> through the drilled boundary partition <b>22</b>. The stream F<b>4</b> then divides, on exiting the chamber <b>23</b>, between the various cells <b>30</b> serving to feed the telescopic tubes <b>41</b> and then the follower divergent flaps <b>14</b>. The plenum chamber <b>23</b> allows regular tapping off at the level of the end of the annular duct <b>6</b> and makes it possible to feed the cells <b>30</b> with a uniform pressure and uniform flow rate. In this way, the film for cooling the inner walls of the convergent flaps <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is not disturbed even when the stream F<b>4</b> is heavily tapped off.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">Furthermore, the shape given to the conical shell <b>16</b> as is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> makes it possible to produce the circuit for cooling the divergent flaps <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> without an excessive footprint and makes it possible to stiffen this conical shell <b>16</b>, by virtue of the partitions <b>19</b> delimiting the cells <b>30</b> and by virtue of the walls <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044">Advantageously, there is furthermore provided a device <b>50</b> for progressively controlling the flow rate F<b>4</b> injected at the level of the follower divergent flaps <b>14</b>. This device <b>50</b> comprises a controlled ring <b>51</b> making it possible to shut off the entrance of the plenum chamber <b>23</b> according to the flight conditions. Shut-off need not be highly leaktight, since the aim is to appreciably reduce the cooling flow rate F<b>4</b>, which is expensive in respect of performance under certain engine operating conditions. Conversely, in certain cases, one will wish to cool the nozzle with a high flow rate so as to obtain the lowest possible temperature on the flaps in order to decrease the infrared signature for example, even at the cost of a slight loss in engine performance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a first embodiment of the device <b>50</b>. The ring <b>51</b> is mounted rotatably about the X axis and its position is adjusted by an actuator <b>52</b>. The ring <b>51</b> is situated radially inside the boundary partition <b>22</b> facing the openings <b>21</b>. On its lower face, the ring <b>51</b> is held in place by another stationary partition <b>53</b> in which are made openings <b>54</b> facing the openings <b>21</b>. A pinion <b>55</b> mounted on the rod of the actuator <b>52</b> drives the ring <b>51</b> in rotation via a rack integral with the ring <b>51</b>. Leaktightness segments <b>56</b> limit the leaks between the ring <b>51</b> and the plenum chamber <b>23</b> when the ring is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">The ring <b>51</b> also exhibits openings <b>57</b> which, in the position of maximum flow, are aligned with the openings <b>21</b> and <b>54</b>. During the rotation of the ring <b>51</b> about the X axis, the openings <b>57</b> shift circumferentially with respect to the openings <b>21</b> and <b>54</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, between the position of maximum opening and a position of total shut-off, in which there is practically no more flow, except for leaks. It is thus possible to meter the flow continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a second embodiment of the device <b>50</b> which also comprises a ring <b>51</b> exhibiting openings <b>57</b> that can be arranged opposite the openings <b>21</b> of the boundary wall <b>22</b> and the openings <b>54</b> of a stationary partition <b>53</b> integral with the downstream end of the casing <b>4</b>. Instead of being mounted rotatably about the X axis, the ring is able to be displaced parallel to the X axis by means of a plurality of synchronized jacks <b>60</b>, for example three jacks, whose shafts <b>61</b> slide in guides <b>62</b>. The connection between the shafts <b>61</b> and the ring is achieved by means of rods <b>63</b> passing through the casing <b>4</b> through leaktight passages <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">In the position of maximum flow, the openings <b>57</b> are arranged facing the openings <b>21</b> and <b>54</b> and the system produces a flow. In another position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the ring <b>51</b>, the openings <b>21</b> and <b>54</b> are shut off by the ring <b>51</b> and there is practically no flow, except for the flows of leaks. For an intermediate position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), it is possible to meter the flow of air continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">In both embodiments of the device <b>50</b>, the leaktightness between the ring <b>51</b> and the stationary parts may be ensured by segments, so as to retard rapid wearing of the seals.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050">The device <b>50</b> offers the possibility of regulating the flow tapped off within a certain range so as to adapt it to the conditions of operation of the engine and to the operational circumstances.</p>
