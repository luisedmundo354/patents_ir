<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY STATEMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of PCT Application No. PCT/JP03/09734 filed on Jul. 31, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an element having a three-dimensional structure that is formed accurately on a substrate such as a silicon wafer using a sacrificial layer and a method of manufacturing the element. In particular, the invention relates to an optical switch that is formed using a sacrificial layer and a method of manufacturing the optical switch.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, a method of forming a sacrificial layer on a substrate such as a silicon wafer, forming a thin film structure patterned in a desired shaped on the sacrificial layer, and thereafter forming a desired three-dimensional structure by removing the sacrificial layer has been attracting attention. Since it is possible to form a large number of fine three-dimensional structures accurately and at a high density with this method, the method is suitable for manufacturing a spatial light modulation element and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a method of removing the sacrificial layer present between the substrate and the thin film structure in such a method of manufacturing a three-dimensional structure using a sacrificial layer, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-13426 and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-129798 disclose use of a solution for wet etching such as a hydrofluoric acid water solution. However, in the solution for etching like the hydrofluoric acid water solution that uses water as a solvent, a phenomenon in which water molecules adhere to the thin film structure at the time of etching and the thin film structure adheres to the substrate due to a surface tension of the water molecules tends to occur. When the fine thin film structure adheres to the substrate once, it is not easy to peel off the thin film structure. Thus, the thin film structure may keep adhering to the substrate after drying, making it impossible to obtain a desired three-dimensional shape. In particular, when a thin film structure of a three-dimensional shape including a movable portion is formed, if the thin film structure adheres to a substrate, a function of the movable portion cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, as another method of removing a sacrificial layer, a method of removing a sacrificial layer with a dry process such as ashing has been proposed. For example, when the ashing is used, it is known that an organic resist film is used as the sacrificial layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the method of removing a sacrificial layer using the dry process such as the ashing, since water molecules do not adhere to the thin film structure and the substrate, it is possible to prevent the thin film structure from sticking to the substrate. However, according to experiments performed by the inventors, it has been found that, in the removal method using the ashing, a large temperature difference occurs in an area where the sacrificial layer is sandwiched between the thin film structure and the substrate and an area where only the sacrificial layer is exposed on the substrate even if the areas are on the same substrate. More specifically, whereas temperature reaches as high as several hundred degrees at the time of the ashing in the area where only the sacrificial layer is exposed on the substrate, temperature does not rise to such high temperature in the area where the sacrificial layer is sandwiched between the thin film structure and the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is surmised that such a large temperature distribution occurs because of a distribution of reaction rates. In the portion where the sacrificial layer is sandwiched between the thin film structure and the substrate, since a gas supplied at the time of the ashing reacts with the sacrificial layer while invading between the substrate and the thin film structure, the reaction proceeds slowly. On the other hand, in the portion where only the sacrificial layer is placed on the substrate, a reaction rate is high because the gas reacts with the sacrificial layer while coming into contact with the sacrificial layer from an entire upper surface thereof without stopping, and heat of reaction is generated rapidly. In the portion where only the sacrificial layer is placed on the substrate, since temperature reaches several hundred degrees at the time of the ashing, the temperature may be higher than substrate temperature at the time of formation of the thin film structure and heat treatment temperature. On the other hand, in the portion where the sacrificial layer is sandwiched between the thin film structure and the substrate, temperature does not rise to such high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consequently, for example, in the case of an element in which plural thin film structures are arranged precisely in a part of an effective area on the substrate and the substrate is exposed in a peripheral area of the part, high heat generated at the time of the ashing of the peripheral area is conducted to a peripheral portion of the effective area to bring the peripheral portion into a state of being subjected to high heat treatment. Consequently, in the effective area, there is a problem in that a difference occurs in a residual stress of the thin film between the thin film structure in the peripheral edge and the thin film structure in the center and fluctuation occurs in a shape of the thin film structure or fluctuation occurs in an amount of distortion of the thin film structure that utilizes distortion by the residual stress. When the fluctuation occurs in the amount of distortion, a drive unit for displacing the thin film structure is required to change a drive signal for each amount of distortion, which complicates a control system.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A three-dimensional structure element according to this embodiment includes a substrate <b>11</b>, an effective area <b>20</b> provided in the center of the substrate <b>11</b>, a dummy area <b>21</b> surrounding the effective area <b>20</b>, and an ineffective area <b>22</b> around the dummy area <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the effective area <b>20</b>, plural three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> are arranged, that is, sixteen three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> are arranged vertically and horizontally, respectively (16×16 three-dimensional structures <b>1</b>) (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for convenience of illustration, eight three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> are arranged vertically and horizontally, respectively). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) in a plan view and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in a sectional view, the three-dimensional structure <b>1</b> has a displacement portion <b>13</b> of a cantilever shape and a reflecting mirror <b>2</b> placed at one end of the displacement portion <b>13</b>. The displacement portion <b>13</b> has a configuration in which two thin films of different materials are stacked and has two legs <b>52</b> at ends on the opposite side of an end where the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> is placed. The two legs <b>52</b> are fixed to the substrate <b>11</b>. In a state in which no force is applied from the outside, the displacement portion <b>13</b> is bent as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by an internal stress of the thin films forming the displacement portion <b>13</b> to come into a state in which the displacement portion <b>13</b> lifts the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> to a position apart from the substrate <b>11</b>. In addition, a not-shown wiring pattern layer is formed in the displacement portion <b>13</b>. On the substrate <b>11</b>, a wiring pattern layer <b>58</b> is arranged in a position, where the legs <b>52</b> of the displacement portion <b>13</b> are in contact with the substrate <b>11</b>, and electrically connected to the wiring pattern layer of the displacement portion <b>13</b> to feed an electric current to the wiring pattern layer of the displacement portion <b>13</b>. On the other hand, in a portion on the substrate <b>11</b> and below the reflecting mirror <b>2</b>, a wiring pattern layer <b>16</b> for generating a magnetic field is arranged. With such a configuration, an electric current is fed to the wiring pattern layer of the displacement portion <b>13</b> and an electric current is fed to the wiring pattern layer <b>16</b> to generate a magnetic field, whereby it is possible to draw the displacement portion <b>13</b> toward the substrate <b>11</b> with the Lorentz force and lower the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> to the position of the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, plural dummy structures <b>33</b> are arranged in the dummy area <b>21</b> on the substrate <b>11</b>. These dummy structures <b>33</b> are arranged to prevent the dummy area <b>21</b> from being heated to high temperature in a process of removing a sacrificial layer in a manufacturing method to be described later. The dummy structures <b>33</b> are formed in the same shape as the displacement portions <b>13</b> of the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> and have legs <b>352</b> that are the same as the legs <b>52</b> of the displacement portions <b>13</b>. In addition, the dummy structures <b>33</b> are arranged vertically and horizontally at the same pitch as the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> in the effective area <b>20</b>. However, the reflecting mirrors <b>2</b> and the wiring pattern layers are not formed in the dummy structures <b>33</b> in order to simplify a configuration thereof. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to make it easy to distinguish the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> from the dummy structures <b>33</b>, dot patterns and hatchings are added, respectively, in the figure for convenience. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows shapes of upper surfaces of the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> and the dummy structures <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> and the dummy structures <b>33</b> are not arranged in the ineffective area <b>22</b> on the substrate <b>11</b>. Although not shown in the figure, wiring pattern layers <b>58</b> and <b>16</b> are arranged for drawing around wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, a method of manufacturing a three-dimensional structure element according to this embodiment will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this embodiment, a wafer-like silicon substrate is used as the substrate <b>11</b>, a large number of the three-dimensional structure elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are arranged two-dimensionally, and finally cut out to complete the three-dimensional structure elements. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6G</figref> to be referred to in the following explanation, only a sectional part of one three-dimensional structure <b>1</b> of one three-dimensional structure element is shown. However, treatments such as the film formation, the photolithography, and the etching are applied to the entire wafer-like substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, a silicon oxide film <b>57</b> is formed over an entire upper surface of the wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> by a thermal oxidation method, an Al film to be the wiring pattern layer <b>58</b> and the wiring pattern layer <b>16</b> is formed on the silicon oxide film <b>57</b>, and by the photolithography and etching, the Al film is patterned into respective shapes of the wiring pattern layer <b>58</b> and the wiring pattern layer <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). A resist layer to be a sacrificial layer <b>80</b> is formed over the entire upper surface of the wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> in this state by application and baking, and an opening <b>80</b><i>a </i>is formed in a position to be the legs <b>52</b> by the photolithography and the etching (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, a resist layer <b>81</b> to be a sacrificial layer is formed over the entire surface of the wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) by application and baking, and the resist layer <b>81</b> is left in a predetermined shape, for example, an island shape around the positions of the legs <b>52</b> and in a position where the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> is placed, by the photolithography and the etching (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>c</i>)). This left sacrificial layer <b>81</b> is arranged in order to form steps <b>59</b> and <b>158</b> in the displacement portion <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It is possible to increase strength of the displacement portion <b>13</b> by forming the steps <b>59</b> and <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, according to steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6D to 6F</figref>, the displacement portions <b>13</b> and the legs <b>52</b> are formed in the effective area <b>20</b> using an Al film <b>73</b>, an SiN film <b>71</b>, and an Al film <b>72</b> and the dummy structures <b>33</b> having the same structure as the displacement portion <b>13</b> are formed in the dummy area <b>21</b>. In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the displacement portion <b>13</b> is formed to be made up of three portions, namely, a base <b>61</b> warped upward, a tip portion <b>62</b> warped downward, and a connecting portion <b>63</b> connecting the base <b>61</b> and the tip portion <b>62</b>. The directions of the warps of the base <b>61</b> and the tip portion <b>62</b> are set to be opposite in this way, whereby, even if a distance from the leg <b>52</b> to the tip of the displacement portion <b>13</b> is long, it is possible to reduce a space between the tip and the substrate <b>11</b>. Consequently, it is possible to switch a position where the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> is lifted to a position where the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> is drawn toward the substrate <b>11</b>, by a small Lorentz force. In order to realize the upward warp with internal stresses of the films, the base <b>61</b> has a configuration in which the SiN film <b>71</b> and the Al film <b>72</b> are stacked from the base <b>11</b> side. Conversely, in order to realize the downward warp, the tip portion <b>62</b> has a configuration in which the Al film <b>73</b> and the SiN film <b>71</b> are stacked from the base <b>11</b> side. The connecting portion <b>63</b> is constituted such that these films overlap partially. The legs <b>52</b> are formed integrally with the base <b>61</b>. Note that, when the Al films <b>73</b> and <b>72</b> and the SiN film <b>71</b> are formed, the substrate <b>11</b> is heated to a predetermined temperature in order to control internal stresses of the respective films.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A specific procedure will be explained. First, after an Al film to be the Al film <b>73</b> of the tip portion <b>62</b> is formed over the entire wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> with vapor deposition, sputtering, or the like, the Al film is patterned by the photolithography and the etching to have respective shapes of the tip portion <b>62</b> and the connecting portion <b>63</b> of the displacement portion <b>13</b> in the effective area <b>13</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b> in the dummy area <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>d</i>)). Next, after an SiN film to be the SiN film <b>71</b> of the base <b>61</b> and the tip portion <b>62</b> is formed over the entire wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> with the plasma CVD or the like, the SiN film is patterned by the photolithography and the etching to have shapes of the base <b>61</b>, the legs <b>52</b>, and the tip portion <b>62</b> of the displacement portion <b>13</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>e</i>)). At this point, an opening is provided in the SiN film <b>71</b> in a position of a bottom of the opening <b>80</b><i>a </i>to be the legs <b>52</b>. Consequently, the Al film <b>72</b> and the wiring pattern layer <b>58</b> to be formed next are connected. Further, after an Al film to be the Al film <b>72</b> of the base <b>61</b> is formed over the entire wafer-like substrate <b>11</b>, the Al film is patterned to have shapes of the base <b>61</b>, the legs <b>52</b>, and the connecting portion <b>63</b> of the displacement portion <b>13</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>f</i>)). With the procedure described above, the displacement portion <b>13</b> and the legs <b>52</b> having a shape, in which the Al film <b>72</b> of the base <b>61</b> and the Al film <b>73</b> of the tip portion <b>62</b> overlap in the connecting portion <b>63</b>, are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, after a resist layer to be the sacrificial layer <b>82</b> is applied thick over the entire wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> and baked, an opening of a shape of the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> is formed by exposure and development in a position where the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> should be formed. Thereafter, Au, Ni, or another metal is grown by electrolytic plating to fill the opening. Consequently, the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With the process described above, in the respective three-dimensional structure elements of the wafer-like substrate <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>g</i>), the portions of the effective areas <b>20</b> and the dummy area <b>21</b> have a structure in which the displacement portion <b>13</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b> are sandwiched between the sacrifice layer <b>80</b> and the sacrifice layer <b>82</b>. On the other hand, the portion of the ineffective area <b>22</b> has a structure in which the sacrificial layer <b>80</b> and the sacrificial layer <b>82</b> are stacked directly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this state, groove-like slits are formed in boundaries of the respective three-dimensional structure elements of the wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> by dicing or the like. The slits do not completely cut the substrate <b>11</b> but is formed in a shape of a groove. Thus, the substrate <b>11</b> maintains the wafer shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the sacrificial layer <b>80</b>, the sacrificial layer <b>82</b>, and the sacrificial layer <b>81</b> are removed by plasma ashing. Consequently, the displacement portion <b>13</b> in the effective area <b>20</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b> in the dummy area <b>21</b> stand from the substrate <b>11</b> to form a three-dimensional structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a plasma ashing process, heat of reaction is generated by a reaction of the sacrificial layers <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> and the sacrificial layer <b>81</b> and the plasma. In particular, in the ineffective area <b>22</b>, since the sacrificial layer <b>80</b> and the sacrificial layer <b>82</b> overlap directly, the reaction with the plasma quickly develops from the entire upper surface to the substrate <b>11</b>. Thus, an ashing rate is high. Consequently, heat of reaction is generated suddenly in the ineffective area <b>22</b>, and temperature of the ineffective area <b>22</b> rises. On the other hand, in the effective area <b>20</b> and the dummy area <b>21</b>, since the displacement portion <b>13</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b> are sandwiched between the sacrificial layer <b>80</b> and the sacrificial layer <b>82</b>, after the sacrificial layer <b>82</b> on the upper side is removed by the reaction with the plasma, the plasma reacts with the sacrificial layers <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> while gradually invading from gaps of the displacement portion <b>13</b> and the dummy structure <b>33</b>. Thus, a reaction rate of the effective area <b>20</b> and the dummy area <b>21</b> is low compared with that of the ineffective area <b>22</b>, and temperature of the effective area <b>20</b> and the dummy area <b>21</b> does not rise to high temperature like that of the ineffective area <b>22</b>. When the inventors performed an experiment to check a temperature distribution of a substrate, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), temperature of the ineffective area <b>22</b> rose to high temperature of several hundred degrees, which was higher than a substrate temperature at the time of formation of the Al films <b>73</b> and <b>72</b> and the SiN film <b>71</b> constituting the displacement portion <b>13</b>. On the other hand, temperature of the effective area <b>20</b> and the dummy area <b>21</b> was lower than the substrate temperature at the time of formation of the films.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since heat of the high-temperature ineffective area <b>22</b> was conducted to a portion where the dummy area <b>21</b> was in contact with the ineffective area <b>22</b>, a temperature distribution in the dummy area <b>21</b> occurred. However, since the heat of the ineffective area <b>22</b> was not conducted to the effective area <b>20</b>, the temperature distribution was uniform. In this way, by providing the dummy area <b>21</b> and preventing temperature rise in the dummy area <b>21</b>, it is possible to prevent high heat generated in the ineffective area <b>22</b> from being conducted to the effective area <b>20</b>. Consequently, in the ashing process, since temperature of the Al films <b>73</b> and <b>72</b> and the SiN film <b>71</b> constituting the displacement portion <b>13</b> in the effective area <b>20</b> does not rise to temperature higher than that at the time of formation of the films uniformly, an internal stress of the 16×16 displacement portions <b>13</b> in the effective area <b>20</b> is kept in a state to be controlled by the substrate temperature at the time of formation of the films. Thus, shapes of warp of the 16×16 displacement portions <b>13</b> do not fluctuate, and it is possible to form all the displacement portions <b>13</b> in a predetermined three-dimensional structure. Note that, in this embodiment, a width of the dummy area <b>21</b> is kept at a width of about 500 μm. By giving a width of this level to the dummy area <b>21</b>, heat generated in the ineffective area <b>22</b> is prevented from being conducted to the effective area <b>20</b> significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Finally, by dividing the wafer-like substrate <b>11</b> in positions of the grooves in the boundaries of the three-dimensional structure elements, individual three-dimensional structure elements can be completed. Note that it is also possible to adopt a procedure for cutting off the substrate <b>11</b> for each of the three-dimensional structure elements with the dicing before the ashing process and apply the ashing process to the individual three-dimensional structure elements.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Note that, in the case of the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of this embodiment, since a part of the ineffective area <b>22</b> is allocated to the dummy area <b>21</b>, it is possible to reduce an area in which heat generation is large at the time of the ashing. Compared with the case in which dummy area <b>21</b> is not provided, a difference in temperature between a portion of high temperature and a portion of low temperature on a wafer is reduced. Thus, heat generated in the ineffective area <b>22</b> become less likely to be conducted to the effective area <b>20</b>, which makes it easy to manufacture the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> with a uniform shape on the entire surface of the effective area.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As a comparative example, when a three-dimensional structure element of a structure not including the dummy area <b>21</b> was created as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>) to check a temperature distribution at the time of the ashing, the result was as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>). In the case of the configuration of the comparative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), since an area of the ineffective area <b>22</b> is large, temperature of the ineffective area <b>22</b> is higher than the temperature of the ineffective area <b>22</b> in this embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 10B</figref>. In addition, in the case of the comparative example, since the ineffective area <b>22</b> and the effective area <b>20</b> are in direct contact with each other, heat of the ineffective area <b>22</b> is conducted to an outer peripheral portion (an area A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>)) of the effective area <b>20</b> to cause a temperature distribution in the effective area <b>20</b>. Consequently, the area A of the effective area <b>20</b> is heated to temperature higher than the substrate temperature at the time of formation of the films, and internal stresses of the films constituting the displacement portion <b>13</b> change. Thus, fluctuation occurs in three-dimensional shapes of the 16×16 displacement portions <b>13</b> of the effective area <b>20</b>. Therefore, even in the effective area <b>20</b>, shapes of the displacement portions <b>13</b> become different depending on a place, and it is impossible to form the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> having the same shape over the entire surface in the effective area <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Note that the method of removing a sacrificial layer is not limited to the plasma ashing, and it is also possible to use ion ashing, dry etching, and the like. In this case, it is also possible to prevent heat of reaction of an ineffective area from being conducted to an effective area by providing a dummy area in a boundary of the effective area and the ineffective area.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is possible to form an optical switch by superimposing the three-dimensional structure element of this embodiment on an optical waveguide substrate <b>190</b> in which plural optical waveguides such as optical waveguides <b>193</b> and <b>194</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Although only a part of the optical waveguide substrate <b>190</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a large number of optical waveguides such as the optical waveguides <b>193</b> and <b>194</b> are arranged in the optical waveguide substrate <b>190</b> to cross in a diamond lattice shape at fixed intervals, and a groove <b>196</b> is formed to traverse a point where the optical waveguides intersect. A pitch of the 16×16 three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> arranged on the substrate is defined to coincide with the intervals of the points where the optical waveguides of the optical waveguide substrate <b>190</b> intersect. Thus, by arranging and superimposing the three-dimensional structure element and the optical waveguide substrate <b>190</b>, it is possible to insert each of the reflecting mirrors <b>2</b> of the three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> in the groove <b>196</b> in the position where the optical waveguides of the optical waveguide substrate <b>190</b> intersect as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). Consequently, for example, in the case of the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, light propagated through the optical waveguide <b>193</b> can be emitted from a facet <b>193</b><i>b</i>, reflected on the reflecting mirror <b>2</b>, and made incident on a facet <b>194</b><i>b </i>of the optical waveguide <b>194</b>. On the other hand, by lowering the displacement portion <b>13</b> of the three-dimensional structure <b>1</b> with the Lorentz force as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>), it is possible to remove the reflecting mirror <b>2</b> from the groove <b>196</b> and, for example, advance straight the light propagated through the optical waveguide <b>193</b> directly. In this way, by controlling an electric current fed to the wiring pattern layers <b>58</b> and <b>16</b>, it is possible to realize an optical switch that switches a traveling direction of light with the reflecting mirror <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Incidentally, in the embodiment described above, the dummy structure <b>33</b> is formed in the stacked structure of the Al films <b>73</b> and <b>72</b> and the SiN film <b>71</b> in the same manner as the displacement portion <b>13</b>. However, since the dummy structure <b>33</b> only has to set a reaction rate of the dummy area <b>21</b> at the time of the ashing to the same level as a reaction rate of the effective area <b>20</b>, it is possible to constitute the dummy structure <b>33</b> with any one of the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A pattern shape of the dummy structure does not have to be the same as that of the displacement portion <b>13</b>. It is possible to form the dummy structure in a shape in which several displacement portions <b>13</b> of the three-dimensional structure <b>1</b> are continuously formed as in the dummy structure <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> and form the dummy structure in a size larger than the displacement portion <b>13</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in order to prevent the dummy structure <b>34</b> from sticking to the substrate <b>11</b> at the time of the ashing or curling up to make the sacrificial layer <b>80</b> on the substrate <b>11</b> side easily subjected to the ashing, columns <b>35</b> for fixing the substrate <b>11</b> are formed in plural places in the peripheral portion of the dummy structure <b>34</b>. The columns <b>35</b> have the same configuration as the legs <b>52</b> of the displacement portion <b>13</b> and can be formed integrally with thin films constituting the dummy structure <b>34</b>. By arranging the dummy structure <b>34</b> in this way, as in the dummy structure <b>33</b> described above, the dummy structure <b>34</b> has an action of substantially equalizing an ashing rate of the dummy area <b>21</b> with the ashing rate in the effective area <b>20</b>. Thus, it is possible to make a temperature distribution in the effective area <b>20</b> substantially constant. Note that, in this example, a width of the dummy area is also set to 500 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An example of still another configuration of a dummy structure will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In a dummy structure <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the entire dummy area <b>21</b> in the peripheral portion of the effective area <b>20</b> is covered by one continuous thin film. Consequently, an ashing rate of the dummy area <b>21</b> is set smaller than that of the ineffective area <b>22</b>. In the dummy structure <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the plural columns <b>35</b> are also arranged at fixed intervals to prevent the dummy structure <b>36</b> from sticking to the substrate <b>11</b> at the time of the ashing or curling up to make the sacrificial layer <b>80</b> on the substrate <b>11</b> side easily subjected to the ashing. Note that, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a width of the dummy area <b>22</b> is set to about 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Therefore, in this embodiment, a shape of a dummy structure formed in the dummy area <b>21</b> is not limited, and any shape may be adopted as long as the dummy structure can cover the sacrificial layer <b>80</b> to thereby set an ashing rate of the dummy area <b>21</b> smaller than that of the ineffective area <b>22</b>. Thus, it is possible to select a shape and a dimension of the dummy area <b>21</b> freely.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, according to the present invention, since the dummy area <b>21</b> including dummy structures is arranged to be in contact with the outer side of the effective area <b>20</b>, temperature of the dummy area <b>21</b> does nor rise to high temperature compared with the ineffective area <b>22</b> even during the ashing process and is not largely different from temperature in the effective area. Thus, in the three-dimensional structure elements <b>1</b> in the effective area <b>20</b> after completion, there is no distribution in a residual stress, and amounts of distortion of the three-dimensional structure elements <b>1</b> after removing a sacrificial layer are uniform. In addition, by constituting an optical switch using such a three-dimensional structure element, it is possible to control plural switching mechanisms with substantially the same control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Note that, in this embodiment, the three-dimensional structure element, in which the 16×16 three-dimensional structures <b>1</b> are arranged two-dimensionally in the effective area <b>20</b>, is described as a three-dimensional structure element. However, in the present invention, the number of three-dimensional structures and an arrangement thereof are not limited to this configuration. For example, the present invention is also effective for a shape in which one three-dimensional structure is arranged for the entire effective area <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, as in this embodiment, it is possible to constitute a micro device other than the optical switch, such as an infrared ray sensor or a digital mirror device, using a three-dimensional structure element including a three-dimensional structure of a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a three-dimensional structure element including plural three-dimensional structures, in a configuration that the three-dimensional structures can be formed uniformly without causing fluctuation in a shape of the three-dimensional structures.</p>
