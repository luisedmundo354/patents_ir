<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority on Japanese patent applications No.2003-381358 and No. 2004-014092, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, the entire contents of literatures cited in this specification are incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a steel roll for metal rolling, more specifically to a roll for forming irregularities on a surface of an aluminum plate by embossing and to a support for a lithographic printing plate obtained by use of the roll.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a method of manufacturing a support for a lithographic printing plate by forming irregularities on a surface of an aluminum plate by embossing or the like with a steel roll provided with irregularities in advance, a roll for metal rolling formed by shot-blasting the surface of the steel roll has been known (JP 60-36196 A). There are also disclosed other related methods, namely, a rolling method using a steel roll fabricated by honing (forming 500 pieces/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more irregularities each having an Ra of 0.5 to 1.5 μm and a depth of 0.6 μm or above) while applying a draft of 2% to 20% (JP 62-25094 A), a rolling method using a roll fabricated by chemical etching or honing so as to form 500 pieces/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more irregularities each having an Ra of 0.5 to 1.5 μm and a depth of 0.6 μm or above while applying a draft of 2% to 20% (JP 62-111792 A), and a rolling method using a roll fabricated by electric discharge machining (forming 500 pieces/mm<sup>2 </sup>or more irregularities each having an Ra of 0.7 to 1.7 μm and a depth of 0.6 μm or above) while applying a draft of 2% to 20% (JP 62-218189 A).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Concerning the surface of the roll for metal rolling, the conventional techniques have proved that the life duration of the roll is enhanced by regulating positions of peaks of the irregularities formed on the surface of the roll (such positions may be hereinafter referred to as “levels of peaks on the roll surface” when appropriate). However, the conventional roll for rolling an aluminum plate for a support for a lithographic printing plate has been formed with a roughened surface by hitting the surface with abrasives through blasting such as air blasting or shot blasting. Accordingly, the levels of the peaks on the roll surface tended to be uneven. In this way, it has been difficult to obtain the roll surface having desired irregularities sufficient for embossing, and having sufficiently regulated levels of the peaks on the roll surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, by use of the rolls according to the conventional techniques, it has been difficult to obtain an aluminum support formed by providing an aluminum plate with irregularities using the roll, which has excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets, sensitivity, stain resistance, and ink spread resistance when formed into an aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate or more specifically an aluminum support for a CTP plate (which stands for the computer-to-plate technique for manufacturing a lithographic printing plate directly without using a lithographic film by scanning and exposing a presensitized plate to highly convergent radiant rays such as laser beams carrying digitalized image information).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, as a surface roughening method for a surface of a stainless steel plate, a method of obtaining a stainless steel plate having excellent adhesion to various covering materials by performing an alternating current electrolysis in a ferric chloride aqueous solution has been known (JP 10-259499 A).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">As a result of extensive studies and researches, the inventors of the present invention have found out that it was possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets and sensitivity by performing an appropriate electrolytic treatment without using blasting to obtain a roll having an uneven structure, that is, a roll having irregularities formed on a surface thereof and forming a support for a lithographic printing plate through rolling of an aluminum plate using the roll. Here, the uneven structure is characterized by having regulated positions of levels of peaks on a surface of the roll, a large number of peaks thereon, and fine pitches among the peaks. In this way, the inventors have invented a roll for metal rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">A roll for metal rolling of the present invention can be used for embossing all kinds of metal. Among them, the roll is suitable for embossing an aluminum plate, and particularly preferable for embossing an aluminum plate to be used as a support for a lithographic printing plate. The most preferable use of the roll for metal rolling of the present invention is an application to a roll for embossing an aluminum plate for a support for a CTP lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">(Roll for Embossing Aluminum Plate)</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(1) Material and Pretreatment of Roll</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">A roll is made of steel, or more particularly forged steel. The material used for the roll in the present invention is not particularly limited, and it is possible to use various kinds of steel such as ordinary steel, tool steel (SKD) generally used for rolls for metal rolling, high-speed steel (SKH), high carbon chromium bearing steel (SUJ), or forged steel containing alloy elements of carbon, chromium, molybdenum and vanadium. It is also possible to use high chromium alloyed cast iron containing chromium in a range of about 10 to 20 wt % to increase the roll life.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">The roll for metal rolling is polished in advance by use of a grindstone or the like in order to improve cylindricity and parallelism. When observed microscopically, there are striped irregularities on a surface thereof. It is possible to eliminate the striped irregularities by further subjecting the roll to mirror surface finish, thus obtaining the peaks having the regulated levels easily when the surface of the roll is etched in a subsequent electrolytic treatment. The mirror surface finish may include grinding with a grindstone, a buffing treatment, an electrolytic polishing treatment, and the like. Among these treatments, the buffing treatment is particularly preferred. It is preferable to perform a hardening treatment, such as quenching or a radial nitriding treatment, before performing an electrolytic treatment applying the roll used in the present invention as an anode.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0043">It is preferable to set the average surface roughness Ra of the surface of the roll before performing an electrolytic treatment in an electrolytic solution while using the roll as an anode in a range of 0.01 to 0.3 μm and a maximum level Ry in a range of 0.01 to 3 μm. It is more preferable to set the Ra in a range of 0.15 to 0.25 μm and the Ry in a range of 0.05 to 2 μm. It is difficult to obtain a surface having the Ra less than 0.01 μm at low costs. When the Ra exceeds 0.3 μm, the levels of the peaks on the surface of the roll are not regulated when the roll is subjected to the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, the roll life may be shortened. It is difficult to obtain a surface having the Ry less than 0.01 μm at low costs. When the Ry exceeds 3 μm, the levels of the peaks on the surface of the roll are not regulated when the roll is subjected to the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, the roll life may be shortened.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(2) Electrolytic Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">The surface of the roll is roughened by performing an electrolytic treatment in an electrolytic solution while using the roll as an anode. As the electrolytic solution, it is possible to use any kinds of aqueous solution of acids generally applied to surface roughening treatments on metal, such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, chromic acid, phosphoric acid, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">The surface of the roll can be roughened by performing an electrolytic treatment in an aqueous solution of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, while using the roll as the anode. The electrolytic solution is the aqueous solution of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the phosphoric acid, and may be a bath not containing chromic acid. The use of chromic acid is often avoided because chromic acid imposes high burdens on the environment occasionally. By performing an electrolysis using the aqueous solution of at least one strong acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, it is possible to obtain finer peaks on the roughened surface. It is preferable to form a support for a lithographic printing plate by rolling an aluminum plate using this roll, because it is possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets, sensitivity, stain resistance, and ink spread resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">It is preferable that this electrolytic solution contain metal ions which are contained in the roll to be subjected to surface roughening. When necessary, it is preferable to add the metal ions contained in the roll in the form of a relevant metal salt.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">As for concrete conditions of the electrolytic treatment, although it is possible to use both an alternating current and a direct current as a power source waveform, it is particularly preferable to use the direct current.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">When using the alternating current, it is possible to use any of a sinusoidal wave, a rectangular wave, a trapezoidal wave, and a triangular wave. A frequency of such a wave can be selected from a range of 0.1 to 120 Hz. Moreover, a ratio Q<sub>R</sub>/Q<sub>F </sub>between a total quantity of electricity Q<sub>F </sub>applied when performing an anodic reaction and a total quantity of electricity Q<sub>R </sub>applied when performing a cathodic reaction can be selected from a range of 0.1 to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">When using the direct current, it is possible to use any of a smooth direct current, a direct current subjected to three-phase full-wave rectification, a direct current subjected to single-phase full-wave rectification, and the like. In any case, it is particularly preferable to use a direct current having a ripple rate equal to or below 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">The current density is set preferably in a range of 20 to 150 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, or more preferably in a range of 30 to 100 A/dm<sup>2</sup>. It is difficult to achieve uniform surface roughening if the current density is below 20 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, and power costs are increased because of a high electrolytic voltage if the current density is above 150 A/dm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">When performing the surface roughening treatment in the electrolytic solution of the strong acid while using the roll as the anode, the quantity of electricity is set preferably in a range of 500 to 30000 C/dm<sup>2</sup>, or more preferably in a range of 800 to 15000 C/dm<sup>2</sup>. Sufficient surface roughness cannot be obtained if the quantity of electricity is below 500 C/dm<sup>2</sup>, and the surface tends to be uneven if the quantity of electricity is above 30000 C/dm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">The quantity of electricity for obtaining the same Ra varies depending on the material of the roll, conditions for a thermal treatment of the roll, the type of the electrolytic solution used therein, and conditions for the electrolysis. Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the quantity of electricity while considering these various conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">Solution temperature is set preferably in a range of 20° C. to 60° C., or more preferably in a range of 30° C. to 55° C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">Temperature locality (uneven distribution) may be caused by heat generation attributable to the Joule heat generated in the course of the electrolysis if the solution temperature is below 20° C. When the temperature locality is present, an electric current tends to flow more on a high-temperature portion, and resultantly the surface of the roll is not roughened uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">On the contrary, water evaporation is excessive if the solution temperature is above 60° C. Such high temperature is not preferable because frequent concentration management or liquid amount management is required.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">The concentration of the electrolytic solution will be adjusted as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">1) Electrolytic Solution Containing Sulfuric Acid as Main Ingredient</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">The sulfuric acid concentration is set preferably in a range of 100 to 500 g/L, or more preferably in a range of 200 to 400 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">It is difficult to achieve uniform surface roughening if the concentration is below 100 g/L. On the contrary, if the concentration is above 500 g/L, it is difficult to control the shape of the surface due to an increase in chemical solubility of the solution attributable to high corrosiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">In an aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid as the main ingredient, it is preferable to dissolve metal that liquates out of the roll beforehand from the viewpoint of reproducibly obtaining the shape of the roughened surface. In particular, it is preferable to add iron ions in the form of iron sulfate and to set the iron ion concentration in a range of 0.5 to 5 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">Hydroxides of substances such as dissolved iron may be formed on a surface of a counter electrode to the roll, and such formation of hydroxides may cause an increase in the electrolytic voltage. Accordingly, it is particularly preferable to add sodium sulfate to the aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid as the main ingredient in a range of 10 to 100 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">2) Electrolytic Solution Containing Nitric Acid as Main Ingredient</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">The nitric acid concentration is set preferably in a range of 50 to 200 g/L, or more preferably in a range of 80 to 150 g/L. It is difficult to achieve uniform surface roughening if the concentration is below 50 g/L. On the contrary, if the concentration is above 200 g/L, it is difficult to control the shape of the surface due to an increase in chemical solubility of the solution attributable to high corrosiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">In an aqueous solution containing nitric acid as the main ingredient, it is preferable to dissolve metal that liquates out of the roll beforehand from the viewpoint of reproducibly obtaining the shape of the roughened surface. In particular, it is preferable to add iron ions in the form of iron nitrate and to set the iron ion concentration in a range of 0.5 to 5 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065">Hydroxides of substances such as dissolved iron may be formed on the surface of the counter electrode to the roll, and such formation of hydroxides may cause an increase in the electrolytic voltage. Accordingly, it is particularly preferable to add sodium nitrate to the aqueous solution containing nitric acid as the main ingredient in a range of 10 to 100 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">3) Electrolytic Solution Containing Hydrochloric Acid as Main Ingredient</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">The hydrochloric acid concentration is set preferably in a range of 1 to 150 g/L, or more preferably in a range of 30 to 80 g/L. It is difficult to achieve uniform surface roughening if the concentration is below 1 g/L. On the contrary, if the concentration is above 150 g/L, it is difficult to control the shape of the surface due to an increase in chemical solubility of the solution attributable to high corrosiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">In an aqueous solution containing hydrochloric acid as the main ingredient, it is preferable to dissolve metal that liquates out of the roll beforehand from the viewpoint of reproducibly obtaining the shape of the roughened surface. Upon preparation of a bath of the electrolytic solution containing hydrochloric acid as the main ingredient, it is particularly preferable to set the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion concentration in a range of 10 to 150 g/L by use of ferric chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">Hydroxides of substances such as dissolved iron may be formed on the surface of the counter electrode to the roll, and such formation of hydroxides may cause an increase in the electrolytic voltage. Accordingly, it is particularly preferable to add sodium chloride to the aqueous solution containing hydrochloric acid as the main ingredient in a range of 10 to 100 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">4) Electrolytic Solution Containing Phosphoric Acid as Main Ingredient</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">The phosphoric acid concentration is set preferably in a range of 1 to 500 g/L, or more preferably in a range of 30 to 400 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072">It is difficult to achieve uniform surface roughening if the concentration is below 1 g/L. On the contrary, if the concentration is above 500 g/L, it is difficult to control the shape of the surface due to an increase in chemical solubility of the solution attributable to high corrosiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">It is possible to use a mixture of phosphoric acid with other acids. For example, it is possible to use a mixture of phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid or a mixture of phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">In an aqueous solution containing phosphoric acid as the main ingredient, it is preferable to dissolve metal that liquates out of the roll beforehand from the viewpoint of reproducibly obtaining the shape of the roughened surface. In particular, it is preferable to add iron ions in the form of iron phosphate and to set the iron ion concentration in a range of 0.5 to 150 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">Hydroxides of substances such as dissolved iron may be formed on the surface of the counter electrode to the roll, and such formation of hydroxides may cause an increase in the electrolytic voltage. Accordingly, it is particularly preferable to add sodium phosphate to the aqueous solution containing phosphoric acid as the main ingredient in a range of 10 to 100 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076">5) Electrolytic solution using a mixture of acids The above-described nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid can be used either independently or in a mixture of two or more acids.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0077">6) Electrolytic Solution Containing Chromic Acid as Main Ingredient</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0078">A bath containing chromic anhydride (chromium trioxide) with addition of a small amount of sulfuric acid, a fluoride or a silicofluoride as a catalyst is used. It is possible to use an electrolytic solution as used in a chromium plating bath to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0079">As a concrete bath composition, it is possible to cite a mixture of chromic acid in a range of 150 to 400 g/L or more preferably in a range of 200 to 350 g/L, sulfuric acid in a range of 1 to 5 g/L or more preferably in a range of 2 to 4 g/L, and iron equal to or below 7 g/L or more preferably in a range of 0.01 to 5 g/L, for example. It is possible to cite a Sargent's bath containing chromic anhydride and sulfuric acid, for example, which is generally known as a hard chromium plating bath. When performing the electrolytic treatment in an anode electrolytic bath similar to a plating bath for chromium plating of the roll for metal rolling to be described later, it is possible to use the same bath in the electrolytic treatment as well as in the plating process.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0080">As a material for the counter electrode to the roll used as the anode, it is possible to use iron, aluminum, lead, a lead alloy, carbon, and the like. However, carbon is particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0081">To use the roll for metal rolling to roll an aluminum plate for an aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate, it is preferable to set the average surface roughness Ra on the surface of the roll after the electrolytic treatment in a range of 0.5 to 2.0 μm and to set the average interval of irregularities Sm in a range of 10 to 200 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0082">If the Ra is below 0.5 μm, it is not possible to transfer sufficient irregularities onto the aluminum plate. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack shininess. Levels of peaks are not regulated when the surface of the roll having the Ra above 2.0 μm is formed by the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack sensitivity. It is difficult to obtain the sufficient Ra on the aluminum plate after rolling by use of the roll having the Sm below 10 μm. On the contrary, when the Sm is above 200 μm, it is not possible to obtain the sufficient number of printed sheets when manufactured into the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0083">The maximum level Ry on the surface of the roll after the electrolytic treatment is set preferably in a range of 5 to 25 μm (more preferably in a range of 7 to 15 μm), and average inclination pitch Δa is set preferably in a range of 5 to 25 degrees (more preferably in a range of 8 to 20 degrees).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0084">Here, the Ra, the Ry (R<sub>max</sub>), the Sm (R<sub>sm</sub>), and the Δa can be measured in accordance with the ISO 4287. Two-dimensional roughness measurement is conducted by use of a probe-type roughness measuring instrument (such as “sufcom 575” made by Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd.), and the arithmetic average roughness Ra is measured five times and an average value of the measured values is defined as the average roughness. The maximum level Ry concerning a standard length, the average interval of irregularities (an average value within the standard length) Sm, and the average inclination pitch Δa are measured similarly.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0085">By regulating the levels of the peaks, it is possible to increase the life of the roll for metal rolling. Further, when the roll is used for providing the irregularities in the process of cold rolling the aluminum support for use in the lithographic printing plate, depths of dents of the aluminum plate provided with the irregularities become uniform and pitches of the dents become finer, whereby formation of locally deep dents are avoided. Accordingly, the lithographic printing plate using this aluminum plate has good sensitivity. Such an effect is significant when manufacturing a CTP lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0086">(3) Chromium Plating</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0087">As a chromium plating bath, a bath containing chromic anhydride (chromium trioxide) with addition of a small amount of sulfuric acid, a fluoride or a silicofluoride as a catalyst is used. As for the anode, a lead alloy is cited as an insoluble anode, for example. Trivalent chromic acid generated in a plating solution due to an electrolytic reaction is contained in the plating solution. An optimum value exists for the trivalent chromic acid, and the concentration thereof is set preferably in a range of 1 to 7 g/L. Current efficiency is degraded when the trivalent chromium is either too high or too low. Although the trivalent chromium is generated in a chromium plating electrolytic reaction, a reducer such as glucose, tartaric acid, chromium carbonate, or oxalic acid is often added to generate the trivalent chromium. Among them, chromium carbonate is particularly preferred as the reducer.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0088">As a concrete bath composition, it is possible to cite the chromic acid concentration in a range of 150 to 400 g/L or more preferably in a range of 200 to 350 g/L, the sulfuric acid concentration in a range of 1 to 5 g/L or more preferably in a range of 2 to 4 g/L, and the iron concentration equal to or below 7 g/L or more preferably in a range of 0.01 to 5 g/L, for example. It is most preferable to use a so-called Sargent's bath containing chromic anhydride and sulfuric acid, for example, which is generally used as a hard chromium plating bath.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0089">It is possible to use the same bath for the bath to perform the electrolytic treatment in the electrolytic solution containing chromic acid as the main ingredient while using the roll as the anode and for the bath to perform the hard chromium plating. However, iron liquates out during the electrolytic treatment in the electrolytic solution while using the roll as the anode, and such an increase in iron complicates fine plating. Accordingly, it is preferable to use mutually different baths. When using different baths, the activity of the surface of the roll is degraded because the roll travels in the air, and such degradation in activity complicates fine plating. Therefore, it is preferable to perform a reverse electrolytic treatment (an etching treatment) by applying current density in a range of 20 to 80 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>for 10 to 60 seconds immediately before the chromium plating in order to activate the surface again.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0090">As for the plating conditions, the solution temperature is set preferably in a range of 20° C. to 70° C. or more preferably in a range of 40° C. to 60° C., and the current density is set preferably in a range of 20 to 80 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>or more preferably in a range of 25 to 60 A/dm<sup>2</sup>. It is possible to use either a direct current or an alternating current as the power waveform. However, it is preferable to use the direct current. The direct current preferably contains a ripple component of not more than 5%. Concerning the electric current, it is preferable to raise the current from low current density to high current density gradually in a period from 1 to 100 seconds and to retain the constant current thereafter. According to this method, it is easier to achieve uniform plating.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0091">The thickness of the hard chromium plating is set preferably in a range of 1 to 15 μm or most preferably in a range of 3 to 9 μm. Sufficient abrasion resistance cannot be achieved if the thickness is below 1 μm. If the thickness is above 15 μm, the surface is smoothened by plating. In this case, it is not possible to exert the effect of the irregularities provided by the electrolytic treatment while using the roll as the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0092">It is preferable to set the average surface roughness Ra on the surface of the roll after the hard chromium plating treatment in a range of 0.5 to 2.0 μm and to set the Sm in a range of 10 to 200 μm. If the Ra is below 0.5 μm, it is not possible to transfer the sufficient irregularities. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack shininess. The levels of peaks are not regulated when the surface of the roll having the Ra above 2.0 μm is formed by the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack sensitivity. It is difficult to obtain the sufficient Ra on the aluminum plate after rolling by use of the roll having the Sm below 10 μm. On the contrary, when the Sm is above 200 μm, it is not possible to obtain the sufficient number of printed sheets when manufactured into the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">The Ry on the surface of the roll after the hard chromium plating treatment is set preferably in a range of 5 to 25 μm (more preferably in a range of 7 to 15 μm), and the Δa is set preferably in a range of 5 to 25degrees (more preferably in a range of 8 to 20 degrees).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094">Concerning the peaks after the electrolytic treatment on the surface of the roll while using the roll as the anode or after the hard chromium plating in the present invention, it is preferable that the peaks be uniformly dispersed when projecting the surface from immediately above in a planar shape, and that the number of the peaks be in a range of 10 to 1000 pieces in each 400-μm square area or more preferably 50 to 500 pieces in the unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0095">In light of the abrasion resistance, it is preferable to set the hardness of the surface of the roll in a range of 700 Hv to 1000 Hv. Moreover, after the hard chromium plating, it is preferable to set the hardness in a range of 800 Hv to 1200 Hv.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0096">(4) Preferred Use of Roll for Metal Rolling</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0097">It is preferable to use the roll for metal rolling of the present invention to provide irregularities onto surfaces of aluminum plates, or more specifically to provide irregularities onto surfaces of aluminum plates for forming aluminum plates for lithographic printing plates. Among them, it is most preferable to use the roll to provide irregularities onto a surface of an aluminum plate for forming an aluminum plate for a CTP lithographic printing plate. As compared to conventional surface roughening treatments using only abrasives and brushes, according to the present invention, it is possible to suppress generation of deep and steep dents and thereby to form a support having favorable sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0098">When embossing the aluminum plate for use in the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate while using the roll of the present invention, the draft is set preferably in a range of 0.5% to 20%, more preferably in a range of 1% to 8%, or most preferably in a range of 1% to 5%. It is also possible to perform such rolling works for the pattern transfer through 1 to 3 paths.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0099">Parameters for the shape of the surface of the aluminum plate formed with the uneven pattern by the roll for metal rolling according to the present invention are preferably set so that the Ra is in a range of 0.4 to 1.0 μm, the Sm in a range of 30 to 150 μm, the Ry in a range of 1 to 10 μm, and the Δa in a range of 1 to 10 degrees, respectively in accordance with the JIS definitions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0100">(Aluminum Support)</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Aluminum Plate (Rolled Aluminum))</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0101">The aluminum plate used as a substrate of a support for a lithographic printing plate according to the present invention is made of metal containing dimensionally stable aluminum as the main ingredient, namely, aluminum or an aluminum alloy. In addition to a pure aluminum plate, it is also possible to use an alloy plate containing aluminum as the main ingredient and small amounts of foreign elements, and a plastic film or a sheet of paper on which aluminum or the aluminum alloy is laminated or vapor-deposited. Furthermore, it is also possible to use a compound sheet as disclosed in JP 48-18327 B formed by attaching an aluminum sheet onto a polyethylene terephthalate film.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0102">In the following description, the above-mentioned various substrates made of aluminum or aluminum alloys, and various substrates including layers made of aluminum or aluminum alloys will be hereinafter referred to as the aluminum plates collectively. The allowable foreign elements in the aluminum alloys include silicon, iron, manganese, copper, magnesium, chromium, zinc, bismuth, nickel, titanium, and the like. The content of the foreign elements in the alloys should be set equal to or below 10 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0103">In the present invention, it is preferable to use the pure aluminum plate. However, since it is difficult to manufacture completely pure aluminum in light of the smelting technology, an aluminum plate used in the present invention may contain small amounts of the foreign elements. Compositions of the aluminum plates used in the present invention are not particularly limited. For example, it is possible to use publicly known aluminum alloy plates designated as JIS A1050, JIS A1100, JIS A3005, International registered alloy 3103A, and the like as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0104">The thickness of the aluminum plate used in the present invention is set preferably in a range of 0.1 to 0.6 mm, more preferably in a range of 0.15 to 0.4 mm, or most preferably in a range of 0.2 to 0.3 mm. The thickness can be changed as appropriate depending on the size of a printing machine, the size of the printing plate, user's requests, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0105">When forming the aluminum alloy into a plate member, it is possible to adopt the following method, for example. Firstly, aluminum alloy molten metal adjusted to given contents of alloy components is subjected to a cleaning treatment and then cast in accordance with a conventional method. As for the cleaning treatment, in order to remove unnecessary gas in the molten metal such as hydrogen, a flux treatment, a degasification treatment using argon gas, chlorine gas or the like, a filtering treatment using any of a so-called rigid media filter such as a ceramic tube filter or a ceramic foam filter, a filter applying alumina flakes or alumina balls as a filtering element, a glass cloth filter, and the like, or a combined treatment of the degasification treatment and the filtering treatment is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0106">It is preferable that these cleaning treatments be carried out to prevent the occurrence of defects attributable to foreign substance in the molten metal such as non-metal intermediates or oxides, and defects attributable to gas dissolved in the molten metal. Techniques related to filtering of molten metal are disclosed in various publications, namely, JP 6-57432 A, JP 3-162530 A, JP 5-140659 A, JP 4-231425 A, JP 4-276031 A, JP 5-311261 A, JP 6-136466 A, and the like. Meanwhile, techniques related to degasification of molten metal are disclosed in various publications, namely, JP 5-51659 A, JP 5-49148 U, and the like. The applicant of the present invention has also proposed a technique concerning degasification of molten metal in JP 7-40017 A.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0107">Subsequently, casting is performed by use of the molten metal subjected to the cleaning treatment as described above. Casting methods include a method using a fixed mold as typified by the DC casting method, and a method using a mobile mold as typified by the continuous casting method.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0108">In the DC casting method, solidification takes place at a cooling rate in a range of 0.5 to 30° C./sec. When the cooling rate is below 0.5° C./sec, a large amount of coarse intermetallic compounds are often formed. When the DC casting is performed, an ingot having a plate thickness of 300 to 800 mm can be fabricated. The ingot is treated according to a conventional method and is subjected to facing as appropriate to cut the surface layer usually in a range of 1 to 30 mm or preferably 1 to 10 mm. Before or after the facing, the ingot is subjected to a homogenization treatment as appropriate. When the homogenization treatment is performed, a heat treatment is performed at 450 to 620° C. for 1 to 48 hours to prevent coarse intermetallic compounds from being produced. Sufficient effect of the homogenization treatment is often not attained when the heat treatment time is shorter than one hour. In execution of the homogenization treatment is advantageous in the cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0109">Thereafter, hot rolling and cold rolling are performed to obtain an aluminum flat-rolled plate. The initial temperature of the hot rolling is appropriately in a range of 350 to 500° C. An intermediate annealing treatment may be performed before, after, or in mid-course of the hot rolling. Conditions of the intermediate annealing treatment may be heating for 2 to 20 hours at 280° C. to 600° C. or preferably for 2 to 10 hours at 350° C. to 500° C. by use of a batch annealing furnace, or heating for 6 minutes or less at 400° C. to 600° C. or preferably for 2 minutes or less at 450° C. to 550° C. by use of a continuous annealing furnace. It is also possible to form fine crystalline structures by heating at a temperature rising rate of 10 to 200° C./sec with the continuous annealing furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0110">The aluminum plate finished into the given thickness as in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm by the above-described processes may be further treated to improve the flatness by use of a reformation apparatus such as roller leveler or a tension leveler. Although it is possible to perform the improvement in flatness after cutting the aluminum plate into sheets, it is preferable to perform the improvement in flatness in a state of a continuous coil to enhance productivity. It is also possible to feed the aluminum plate into a slitter line so as to form the aluminum plate into a given plate width. Moreover, it is possible to provide thin oil films on surfaces of the aluminum plates to prevent occurrence of scratches due to friction between the aluminum plates. Such oil films may be volatile or nonvolatile as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0111">Industrially practiced continuous casting methods include methods using cooling rolls as typified by the twin roll method (the Hunter method) and the 3C method, and methods using cooling belts or cooling blocks as typified by the twin belt method (the Hazelett method) and the Alusuisse Caster II. When using the continuous casting method, solidification takes place at a cooling rate in a range of 100 to 1000° C./sec. In general, the continuous casting method has a higher cooling rate as compared to the DC casting method, and therefore has a characteristic that the continuous casting method can increase solid solubility of alloy components relative to an aluminum matrix. Concerning the continuous casting method, the applicant of the present invention has proposed techniques as disclosed in various publications, namely, JP 3-79798 A, JP 5-201166 A, JP 5-156414 A, JP 6-262203 A, JP 6-122949 A, JP 6-210406 A, JP 6-26308A, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0112">In the case of performing the continuous casting, when the method using cooling rolls such as the Hunter method is applied, for example, various advantages are obtained such as a possibility to cast a plate in a plate thickness of 1 to 10 mm directly and continuously and a possibility to omit a hot rolling process. In the meantime, when the method using cooling belts such as the Hazelett method is applied, it is possible to cast a plate in a plate thickness of 10 to 50 mm. Generally, it is possible to obtain a plate in a plate thickness of 1 to 10 mm by arranging a hot rolling mill immediately after casting to perform rolling continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0113">These continuously cast flat-rolled plates are finished into a given thickness, such as a plate thickness of 0.1 to 0.5 mm, through processes such as cold rolling, intermediate annealing, flatness improvement and slitting. Concerning the conditions for intermediate annealing and the conditions for cold rolling when using the continuous casting method, the applicant of the present invention has proposed techniques as disclosed in various publications, namely, JP 6-220593 A, JP 6-210308 A, JP 7-54111 A, and JP 8-92709 A.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0114">It is preferable that the aluminum plate used in the present invention be well-tempered in accordance with H18 as defined in JIS.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0115">The aluminum plate manufactured as described above is expected to have various characteristics as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0116">Concerning the strength of the aluminum plate, in order to obtain flexure strength required for the support for a lithographic printing plate, it is preferable to set the 0.2% proof stress equal to or above 120 MPa. Moreover, in order to obtain a certain degree of flexure strength in case of performing a burning treatment as well, it is preferable to set the 0.2% proof stress equal to or above 80 MPa after heating at 270° C. for 3 to 10 minutes. In this case, it is more preferable to set the 0.2% proof stress equal to or above 100 MPa. In particular, it is possible to adopt an aluminum material having additional Mg or Mn to seek the flexure strength in the aluminum plate. However, an increase in the flexure strength causes degradation in fitness to a plate cylinder of a printing machine. Accordingly, appropriate material quality and amounts of addition of minor components are selected depending on the usage. In this regard, the applicant of the present invention has disclosed the related techniques in JP 7-126820 A, JP 62-140894 A, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0117">Meanwhile, concerning the aluminum plate, it is preferable to set the tensile strength at 160±15 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, the 0.2% proof stress at 140±15 MPa, and stretch as defined in JIS Z2241 and Z2201 in a range of 1% to 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0118">It is preferable that a crystal structure of the aluminum plate on the surface be not too large because the crystal structure on the surface of the aluminum plate may cause defects in the surface quality when performing a chemical surface roughening treatment or an electrochemical surface roughening treatment. Concerning the crystal structure on the surface of the aluminum plate, the width is set preferably equal to or below 200 μm, more preferably equal to or below 100 μm, or even more preferably equal to or below 50 μm. Meanwhile, the length of the crystal structure is set preferably equal to or below 5000 μm, more preferably equal to or below 1000 μm, or even more preferably equal to or below 500 μm. In this regard, the applicant of the present invention has disclosed the related techniques in JP 6-218495 A, JP 7-39906 A, JP 7-124609 A, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0119">It is preferable that distribution of the alloy components of the aluminum plate be not too uneven because the uneven distribution of the alloy components on the surface of the aluminum plate may cause defects in the surface quality when performing a chemical surface roughening treatment or an electrochemical surface roughening treatment. In this regard, the applicant of the present invention has disclosed the related techniques in JP 6-48058 A, JP 5-301478 A, JP 7-132689 A, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0120">In the present invention, the above-described aluminum plate is provided with the irregularities in its final rolling process and the like by means of press rolling, transfer or the like using the roll for metal rolling of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0121">Among them, it is preferable to apply a method of forming the uneven pattern on the surface of the aluminum plate by pressing the surface provided with the irregularities onto the aluminum plate and thereby transferring the uneven patterns simultaneously with cold rolling for adjusting the aluminum plate to a final thickness or finish cold rolling for finishing the shape of the surface after adjusting the aluminum plate to the final thickness. It is possible to reduce costs drastically by simplifying the process while transferring the irregularities onto the surface of the aluminum plate simultaneously with the final cold rolling. To be more precise, it is possible to apply the method disclosed in JP 6-262203 A.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0122">By use of the aluminum plate having the uneven pattern on the surface, it is possible to obtain the uneven pattern with uniform average pitches and depths as compared to an uneven pattern formed by use of brushes and abrasives. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the stain resistance. Moreover, it is possible to reduce energy consumption in subsequent alkaline etching treatment and surface roughening treatment and to facilitate control of an amount of a fountain solution on a printing machine (excellent in shininess). Furthermore, it is possible to reduce an etching amount to about 10 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or less in a first alkaline etching treatment to be described later, and thereby to reduce the costs. In addition, a surface area of the obtained support for a lithographic printing plate is increased by use of the aluminum plate having the uneven pattern. Accordingly, the support for a lithographic printing plate has excellent press life.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0123">It is particularly preferable to perform the transfer in a final cold rolling process of a normal aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0124">Moreover, it is preferable to form the irregularities on both surfaces of the aluminum plate by the transfer. In this way, the stretch ratios on the top surface and the bottom surface of the aluminum plate can be adjusted to approximately the same degree. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain the aluminum plate excellent in flatness.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0125">The aluminum plates used in the present invention are either continuous belt-shaped sheet materials or plate materials. In other words, it is possible to use aluminum webs or leaf plates cut into the size corresponding to the presensitized plates shipped as the products.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0126">Scratches on the surface of the aluminum plate may cause defects when the plate is formed into the support for a lithographic printing plate. Accordingly, it is necessary to suppress generation of scratches to the least possible degree at the stage prior to a surface treatment process for forming the support for a lithographic printing plate. In this regard, it is preferable to apply appropriate packaging which is stable and scratch-proof during transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0127">As the packaging in case of the aluminum web, for example, a hard board and a felt sheet are laid over an iron palette, and donut plates made of a cardboard are attached to both ends of the product. Then, the entire product is wrapped with a polyethylene tube, and a donut made of wood is inserted in the internal circle of a coil. Subsequently, another felt sheet is attached to the outer periphery of the coil, then the product is bound by iron hoops and indications are put on the outer periphery thereof. Here, it is possible to use a polyethylene film as a wrapping material, and to use needle felt and hard boards as cushioning materials. Although there are various other packaging methods, the method is not limited to the foregoing as long as it is possible to transport the aluminum plate stably and without causing scratches thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0128">(Surface Roughening of Aluminum Plate after Transfer of Irregularities)</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0129">The aluminum plate after transfer of the irregularities is further subjected to appropriate surface roughening treatments (an alkaline etching treatment, a desmutting treatment, an electrochemical surface roughening treatment, an anodic oxidation treatment, a hydrophilic treatment, and a sealing treatment) to manufacture the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate. Then, the aluminum support is coated with a recording layer such as a photosensitive layer to manufacture the presensitized plate.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0164">(Mechanical Surface Roughening Treatment)</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0165">In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the foregoing aluminum plate having the uneven pattern on the surface may be or may not be subjected to a mechanical surface roughening treatment using a rolling brush and an abrasive to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0166">By performing the mechanical surface roughening treatment using the brush and the abrasive, it is possible to secure a large surface area by means of a subsequent brush graining treatment even if the aluminum plate has a small surface area after transfer of the uneven pattern. In this way, it is possible to achieve appropriate water retentivity. In the meantime, the mechanical surface roughening treatment can also solve the problems of the conventional surface roughening using only the brush and abrasive that sharp irregularities are formed on the surface to catch waste films, and that stains tend to remain in edge portions. In addition, the mechanical surface roughening treatment is able to reduce the amounts of alkaline etching to be performed later, and is therefore advantageous in light of manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0167">Now, a brush graining method advantageously used as the mechanical surface roughening treatment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0168">Generally, the brush graining method uses a roller brush implanted with numerous bristles such as synthetic resin bristles made of nylon (trademark), propylene or polyvinyl chloride resin onto a surface of a cylindrical drum, and the method is performed by scrubbing one or both surfaces of the aluminum plate while spraying a slurry solution containing an abrasive onto the rotating roller brush. Instead of the roller brush and the slurry solution, it is also possible to use an abrasive roller which is a roller provided with an abrasive layer on a surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0169">When using the roller brush, a bend elastic constant of bristles for use is preferably in a range of 10,000 to 40,000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, or more preferably in a range of 15,000 to 35,000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, elastic strength of the bristles is preferably equal to or below 500 g, or more preferably equal to or below 400 g. The diameter of each bristle is generally in a range of 0.2 to 0.9 mm. The length of each bristle can be appropriately determined in accordance with the outside diameter of the roller brush and the diameter of the drum. However, the length of each bristle is generally in a range of 10 to 100 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0170">In the present invention, it is preferable to use a plurality of nylon brushes. To be more precise, it is preferable to use three or more brushes, and is more preferable to use four or more brushes. By adjusting the number of brushes, it is possible to adjust wavelength components of dents which are formed on the surface of the aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0171">Meanwhile, the load of a drive motor for rotating the brush is preferably greater by at least 1 kW as compared to the load before pushing the brush roller against the aluminum plate. The difference in load is more preferably equal to or above 2 kW, and is even more preferably equal to or above 8 kW. By adjusting the load, it is possible to adjust depths of the dents formed on the surface of the aluminum plate. The number of revolution per minute of the brush is preferably not less than 100 or more preferably not less than 200.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0172">Publicly known abrasives can be used herein. For example, it is possible to use abrasives such as pumice stone, silica sand, aluminum hydroxide, alumina powder, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, volcanic ash, carborundum, or emery; and a combination thereof. Among these abrasives, pumice stone and silica sand are preferable. Silica sand is excellent in surface roughening efficiency because silica sand is harder and more durable than pumice stone. On the other hand, aluminum hydroxide grains crack upon application of an excessive load. Accordingly, aluminum hydroxide is suitable for preventing generation of locally deep dents.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0173">The median diameter of the abrasive is preferably in a range of 2 to 100 μm, or more preferably in a range of 20 to 60 μm, in terms of excellent surface roughening efficiency and a narrow graining pitch capability. By adjusting the median diameter of the abrasive, it is possible to adjust the depths of the dents formed on the surface of the aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0174">The abrasive is suspended in water, for example, and is used as the slurry solution. In addition to the abrasive, the slurry solution may contain a thickener, a dispersing agent (such as a surfactant), an antiseptic, and the like. The specific gravity of the slurry solution is preferably in a range of 0.5 to 2.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0175">As an apparatus suitable for the mechanical surface roughening treatment, it is possible to cite an apparatus as disclosed in JP 50-40047 B, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0179">In the surface roughening treatment, the processes of the aspects 1 to 5 are preferably performed.

<p id="p-0150" num="0184">The first alkaline etching treatment, which is performed prior to the first electrolytic treatment, aims at forming uniform dents in the first electrolytic treatment, or aims at removing rolling oil, stains, a natural oxide film, and the like on the surface of the aluminum plate (flat-rolled aluminum).</p>

When the lower limit of the etching amount remains in the above-described ranges, it is possible to form uniform pits in the first electrolytic treatment and further to prevent occurrence of unevenness in the treatment. When the upper limit of the etching amount remains in the above-described range, the amount of the alkaline aqueous solution used therein is reduced, and it is therefore economically advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0186">The alkali to be used in the alkaline solution may be caustic alkali and alkali metal salt. To be more precise, the caustic alkali includes caustic soda and caustic potash, for example. Meanwhile, the alkali metal salt includes, for example: alkali metal silicate such as sodium metasilicate, sodium silicate, potassium metasilicate, or a potassium silicate; alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate; alkali metal aluminate such as sodium aluminate or potassium aluminate; alkali metal aldonate such as sodium gluconate or potassium gluconate; alkali metal hydrogenphosphate such as sodium secondary phosphate, potassium secondary phosphate, sodium primary phosphate, or potassium primary phosphate.

<p id="p-0157" num="0191">When the aluminum plates are continuously subjected to the etching treatment, the aluminum ion concentration in the alkaline solution is increased and the etching amounts of the aluminum plates thereby vary. Accordingly, it is preferable to manage compositions of the etching solution as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0192">Specifically, either a matrix of conductivity, specific gravity and temperature, or a matrix of conductivity, propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves and temperature is formed in advance, each of the matrices corresponding to a matrix of caustic soda concentration and the aluminum ion concentration. Then, the compositions of the solution are measured in terms of the conductivity, the specific gravity and the temperature or in terms of the conductivity, the propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves and the temperature, and caustic soda and water are added thereto so as to achieve target control values for the compositions of the solution. Thereafter, the etching solution, which is increased in volume by adding caustic soda and water, is allowed to overflow from a circulation tank so as to maintain the constant volume. As for caustic soda for such addition, it is possible to use one for industrial use which contains 40 to 60 wt % therein.</p>

When the electrochemical surface roughening treatment is carried out by use of the above-described aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, uniform surface shapes are obtained by the surface roughening treatment. Accordingly, unevenness does not occur in the surface roughening treatment regardless of whether a low-purity aluminum flat-rolled plate or a high-purity aluminum flat-rolled plate is used. As a result, it is possible to satisfy excellent press life and stain resistance when such an aluminum flat-rolled plate is formed into a lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0232">Temperature of the aqueous solution containing hydrochloric acid is preferably equal to or above 25° C. or more preferably equal to or above 30° C. Meanwhile, the temperature is preferably equal to or below 55° C. or more preferably equal to or below 40° C.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0233">Concerning additives for the aqueous solution containing hydrochloric acid, apparatuses, power sources, current density, flow rates, and temperature, it is possible to apply publicly known techniques for use in electrochemical surface roughening. Although both of an alternating current and a direct current are applicable to the power source used in electrochemical surface roughening, an alternating current is particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0234">Hydrochloric acid itself possesses high aluminum dissolving power. Accordingly, it is possible to form fine irregularities on the surface only by applying a small current. Such fine irregularities have an average pore size in a range of 0.01 to 0.4 μm and are generated uniformly on the entire surface of the aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0235">When the quantity of electricity is raised further, larger pits having an average pore size in a range of 1 to 15 μm provided with smaller pits having an average pore size in a range of 0.01 to 0.4 μm on the surfaces of the larger pits are formed. To obtain such grains, the total quantity of electricity contributing to the anodic reaction of the aluminum plate at the point of termination of the electrolytic reaction is preferably equal to or above 10 C/dm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably equal to or above 50 C/dm<sup>2</sup>, or even more preferably equal to or above 100 C/dm<sup>2</sup>. Meanwhile, the total quantity of electricity is preferably equal to or below 2000 C/dm<sup>2</sup>, or more preferably equal to or below 600 C/dm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0236">It is also possible to simultaneously form a crater-like large undulation by increasing the total quantity of electricity used for an anodic reaction to 150 to 2,000 C/dm<sup>2 </sup>in the first electrolysis in hydrochloric acid. Also in this case, pits having an average pore size in a range of 1 to 15 μm are formed, with fine irregularities having an average pore size in a range of 0.01 to 0.4 μm being formed on the surfaces thereof. Current density in this case is preferably in a range of 20 to 100 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>in terms of a peak current value.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0237">When the aluminum plate is subjected to the electrolysis in hydrochloric acid while applying such a large quantity of electricity, it is possible to form large undulation and fine irregularities at the same time. It is possible to improve stain resistance by homogenizing the large undulation by the second alkaline etching to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0238">The first electrolytic treatment using the aqueous solution containing nitric acid or hydrochloric acid can be performed in accordance with electrochemical graining methods (electrolytic graining methods) as disclosed in JP 48-28123 B and GB 896563 B, for example. Although these electrolytic graining methods use an alternating current having a sinusoidal waveform, it is also possible to use a special waveform as disclosed in JP 52-58602 A. It is also possible to use a waveform as disclosed in JP 3-79799 A. Meanwhile, it is also possible to apply methods disclosed in JP 55-158298 A, JP 56-28898 A, JP 52-58602 A, JP 52-152302 A, JP 54-85802 A, JP 60-190392 A, JP 58-120531 A, JP 63-176187 A, JP 1-5889 A, JP 1-280590 A, JP 1-118489 A, JP 1-148592 A, JP 1-178496 A, JP 1-188315 A, JP 1-154797 A, JP 2-235794 A, JP 3-260100 A, JP 3-253600 A, JP 4-72079 A, JP 4-72098 A, JP 3-267400 A, and JP 1-141094 A.

<p id="p-0207" num="0241">When the aluminum plates are continuously subjected to the electrolytic surface roughening treatment, the aluminum ion concentration in the solution is increased and the shapes of irregularities on the aluminum plate formed by the first electrolytic treatment thereby vary. Accordingly, it is preferable to manage compositions of a nitric acid electrolytic solution or a hydrochloric acid electrolytic solution as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0242">Specifically, either a matrix of conductivity, specific gravity and temperature, or a matrix of conductivity, propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves and temperature is formed in advance, each of the matrices corresponding to a matrix of a nitric or hydrochloric acid concentration and the aluminum ion concentration. Then, the compositions of the solution are measured in terms of the conductivity, the specific gravity and the temperature or in terms of the conductivity, the propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves and the temperature, and nitric or hydrochloric acid and water are added thereto so as to achieve target control values for the compositions of the solution. Thereafter, the electrolytic solution, which is increased in volume by adding nitric or hydrochloric acid and water, is allowed to overflow from a circulation tank so as to maintain the constant volume. As for nitric acid for such addition, it is possible to use one for industrial use which contains 30 to 70 wt % therein. As for hydrochloric acid for such addition, it is possible to use one for industrial purposes which contains 30 to 40 wt % therein.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0243">A conductivity detector and a gravimeter used therein are preferably temperature compensated, respectively. Here, it is preferable to use a gravimeter of a differential pressure type.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0244">In order to achieve higher accuracy, it is preferable that a sample collected from the electrolytic solution for measurement of the compositions of the solution be used for such measurement after controlling the solution to certain temperature (such as 40±0.5° C.) with a heat exchanger apart from one for the electrolytic solution.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0245">The electrolytic current waveform used in the electrochemical surface roughening treatment is not particularly limited, and a sinusoidal wave, a rectangular wave, a trapezoidal wave, a triangular wave, and the like are applicable. However, it is preferable to use any of the sinusoidal wave, the rectangular wave, and the trapezoidal wave. Among those waves, the trapezoidal wave is particularly preferred. In the case of the first electrolysis in hydrochloric acid, the sinusoidal wave is particularly preferred because it is easier to generate uniform pits having an average diameter equal to or above 1 μm. The sinusoidal wave is the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0246">The trapezoidal wave is the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In terms of this trapezoidal wave, time (TP) consumed by a current to reach from zero to a peak is preferably in a range of 0.5 to 3 msec. If the time TP exceeds 3 msec, an aluminum plate becomes susceptible to minor components in the electrolytic solution typified by ammonium ions which are spontaneously increased by the electrolytic treatment particularly when using the aqueous solution containing nitric acid. Accordingly, it is difficult to achieve uniform graining. As a result, stain resistance tends to be reduced when the aluminum plate is formed into a lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0247">It is possible to use an alternating current having a duty ratio (ta/T; ratio of the anodic reaction time in one cycle) in a range of 1:2 to 2:1. However, as disclosed in JP 5-195300 A, it is preferable to apply an alternating current having a duty ratio of 1:1 in an indirect feeding mode where a conductor roll is not used for aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0248">It is possible to use an alternating current having a frequency in a range of 0.1 to 120 Hz. However, in light of facilities, it is preferable to use an alternating current having a frequency in a range of 50 to 70 Hz. When the frequency is below 50 Hz, a carbon electrode which is a main electrode tends to be dissolved easily. On the contrary, when the frequency is above 70 Hz, the current condition is susceptible to inductance components on a power circuit and power costs are thereby increased.</p>

By shunting a part of a current as a direct current into the auxiliary anodes provided apart from the two main electrodes in a different tank through a rectifier or a switching element, it is possible to control the ratio between a current value contributing to an anodic reaction acting on the aluminum plate opposed to the main electrodes and a current value contributing to a cathodic reaction. The ratio of the quantity of electricity contributing to the anodic reaction and the cathodic reaction (the quantity of electricity at the cathodic reaction/the quantity of electricity at the anodic reaction) on the aluminum plate opposed to the main electrodes is preferably in a range of 0.3 to 0.95.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0251">Any types of publicly known electrolytic tanks applied to surface treatments, such as a vertical type, a flat type, or a radial type, can be used as the electrolytic tank.

To be more precise, it is possible to use an electrolytic solution which is similar to the electrolytic solution used in the above-described electrochemical surface roughening treatment applying the alternating current.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0253">The direct current power source waveform used in the electrochemical surface roughening treatment is not particularly limited as long as the current does not change polarity, and a comb-shaped wave, a continuous direct current, a wave obtained by subjecting a commercial alternating current to full-wave rectification with a thyristor, and the like are applicable. However, it is preferable to use a smoothed continuous direct current.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0254">Although it is possible to perform the electrochemical surface roughening treatment applying the direct current in accordance with any of the batch method, the semicontinuous method, and the continuous method. However, it is preferable to adopt the continuous method.</p>

<p id="p-0224" num="0258">The electrodes are not particularly limited. It is possible to use publicly known electrodes which are conventionally used in electrochemical surface roughening treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0259">As for the anode, it is preferable to use: an anode formed by plating or cladding platinum-group metal on valve metal such as titanium, tantalum or niobium; an anode formed by coating or sintering a platinum-group metal oxide on the valve metal; aluminum; stainless steel, for example.

<p id="p-0256" num="0290">In the third desmutting treatment, it is preferable to use the acidic solution containing an acid in a range of 5 to 400 g/L and aluminum ions in a range of 0.5 to 8 g/L. To be more precise, when using sulfuric acid, it is preferable to use the solution prepared by dissolving aluminum sulfate in a sulfuric acid aqueous solution having the sulfuric acid concentration in a range of 100 to 350 g/L, so as to adjust the aluminum ion concentration to a range of 1 to 5 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0291">In the third desmutting treatment, the treating time is preferably equal to or above 1 second, or more preferably equal to or above 4 seconds. Meanwhile, the treating time is preferably equal to or below 60 seconds, or more preferably equal to or below 15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0292">In the third desmutting treatment, when the same type of solution as the electrolytic solution to be used in the subsequent anodic oxidation treatment is used as a desmutting solution, it is possible to omit draining and a water washing treatment by use of a nip roller after the desmutting treatment.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">&lt;Anodic Oxidation Treatment&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0293">The aluminum plate after the above-described treatments is further subjected to the anodic oxidation treatment. The anodic oxidation treatment can be carried out in accordance with a method conventionally practiced in this field. In this case, it is possible to form an anodized film by applying electricity to the aluminum plate as the anode in a solution having the sulfuric acid concentration in a range of 50 to 300 g/L and the aluminum ion concentration equal to or below 5 wt %. As for the solution used in the anodic oxidation treatment, it is possible to use any one of or a combination of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, chromic acid, oxalic acid, sulfamic acid, benzensulfonic acid, amidosulfonic acid, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0294">At this time, at least any components normally contained in the aluminum plate, the electrodes, tap water, underground water, and the like may be contained in the electrolytic solution. Further, second and third components may be added thereto. The second and third components cited herein may be: metal ions of Na, K, Mg, Li, Ca, Ti, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and the like; positive ions such as ammonium ions; and negative ions such as nitrate ions, carbonate ions, chloride ions, phosphate ions, fluoride ions, sulfite ions, titanate ions, silicate ions, or borate ions, for example. Such components may be contained in a concentration of about 0 to 10000 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0295">Conditions of the anodic oxidation treatment vary depending on the electrolytic solution to be used and therefore cannot be determined universally. However, in general, it is preferable to use the concentration of the electrolytic solution in a range of 1 to 80 wt %, the temperature of the solution in a range of 5° C. to 70° C., the current density in a range of 0.5 to 60 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, the voltage in a range of 1 to 100 V, and the time for electrolysis in a range of 15 seconds to 50 minutes. These conditions are appropriately adjusted to form a desired amount of the anodized film.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0296">Meanwhile, it is also possible to apply methods disclosed in JP 54-81133 A, JP 57-47894 A, JP 57-51289 A, JP 57-51290 A, JP 57-54300A, JP 57-136596 A, JP 58-107498 A, JP 60-200256 A, JP 62-136596 A, JP 63-176494 A, JP 4-176897 A, JP 4-280997 A, JP 6-207299 A, JP 5-24377 A, JP 5-32083 A, JP 5-125597 A, and JP 5-195291 A.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0297">Among these methods, as disclosed in JP 54-12853 A and in JP 48-45303 A, it is preferable to use a sulfuric acid solution as the electrolytic solution. The sulfuric acid concentration in the electrolytic solution is preferably in a range of 10 to 300 g/L (1 to 30 wt %), or more preferably in a range of 50 to 200 g/L (5 to 20 wt %). Meanwhile, the aluminum ion concentration is preferably in a range of 1 to 25 g/L (0.1 to 2.5 wt %), or more preferably in a range of 2 to 10 g/L (0.2 to 1 wt %). Such an electrolytic solution can be prepared by adding aluminum sulfate or the like to dilute sulfuric acid having a concentration in a range of 50 to 200 g/L, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0298">The compositions of the electrolytic solution are preferably managed by conductivity, specific gravity and temperature, or, by conductivity, propagation velocity of ultrasonic waves and temperature corresponding to a matrix of the sulfuric acid concentration and the aluminum ion concentration, by using a method as used in the above-described electrolysis in nitric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0299">The temperature of the electrolytic solution is preferably in a range of 25° C. to 55° C., or more preferably in a range of 30° C. to 50° C.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0300">When performing the anodic oxidation treatment in the electrolytic solution containing sulfuric acid, a direct or alternating current may be applied between the aluminum plate and the counter electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0301">When a direct current is applied to the aluminum plate, the current density is preferably in a range of 1 to 60 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, or more preferably in a range of 5 to 40 A/dm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0302">When performing the anodic oxidation treatment continuously, it is preferable to apply a current at low current density in a range of 5 to 10 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>in the beginning of the anodic oxidation treatment and then to raise the current density up to a range of 30 to 50 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>or even higher along with the progress of the anodic oxidation treatment, so as not to cause so-called “burning” (by which the film becomes thicker than surrounding portions) owing to the current which is focused on a part of the aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0303">To be more precise, it is preferable to distribute currents from a direct current power source such that a current from the direct current power source on a downstream side is equal to or higher than a current from the direct current power source on an upstream side. By adopting such current distribution, generation of a so-called burning is suppressed. As a consequence, it is possible to perform the anodic oxidation treatment at a high rate.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0304">When performing the anodic oxidation treatment continuously, it is preferable to carry out a liquid power supply method configured to supply electricity to the aluminum plate through the electrolytic solution.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0305">A porous film provided with numerous holes called pores (micropores) is obtained by performing the anodic oxidation treatment under the conditions described above. Normally, the average pore size thereof is in a range of about 5 to 50 nm, and the average pore density thereof is in a range of about 300 to 800 pcs/μm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0306">The quantity of the anodized film is preferably in a range of 1 to 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The plate easily causes flaws when the quantity is below 1 g/m<sup>2</sup>. On the contrary, when the quantity exceeds 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, a large quantity of electricity is required for manufacturing and it is therefore economically disadvantageous. The quantity of the anodized film is more preferably in a range of 1.5 to 4 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, it is preferable to perform the anodic oxidation treatment such that a difference in quantity of the anodized film between the central portion and the vicinity of edge portions of the aluminum plate is equal to or below 1 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0307">As for an electrolytic apparatus for use in the anodic oxidation treatment, it is possible to use techniques disclosed in JP 48-26638 A, JP 47-18739 A, JP 58-24517 B, and JP 2001-11698 A.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0308">Among these techniques, an apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is preferably used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an example of an apparatus configured to perform an anodic oxidation treatment on a surface of an aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0309">In an anodic oxidation apparatus <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a power supply tank <b>412</b> is disposed on an upstream side in a traveling direction of an aluminum plate <b>416</b> and an anodic oxidation treatment tank <b>414</b> is disposed on a downstream side in order to supply electricity to the aluminum plate <b>416</b> through an electrolytic solution. The aluminum plate <b>416</b> is conveyed as indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by way of path rollers <b>422</b> and <b>428</b>.

Here, the aluminum plate <b>416</b> constitutes a cathode. Accordingly, a cathodic reaction takes place on the aluminum plate <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0310">Cathodes <b>430</b> which are connected to negative terminals of the direct current power sources <b>434</b> are disposed in the anodic oxidation treatment tank <b>414</b> to which the aluminum plate <b>416</b> is subsequently introduced.

<p id="p-0277" num="0311">Clearance between the aluminum plate <b>416</b> and the cathodes <b>430</b> is preferably in a range of 50 to 200 mm. Aluminum is used for the cathodes <b>430</b>. In order to allow hydrogen gas generated in the anodic reaction to escape easily from the system, it is preferable to form the anodes <b>430</b> not as electrodes having large areas but as electrodes which are split into multiple pieces along with the traveling direction of the aluminum plate <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0312">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, between the power supply tank <b>412</b> and the anodic oxidation treatment tank <b>414</b>, it is preferable to provide a tank called an intermediate tank <b>413</b> which drains off an electrolytic solution. By providing the intermediate tank <b>413</b>, it is possible to suppress bypassing of the current from the anodes <b>420</b> to the cathodes <b>430</b> instead of passing through the aluminum plate <b>416</b>. It is preferable to provide nip rollers <b>424</b> in the intermediate tank <b>413</b> for draining so as to minimize the bypass current. The electrolytic solution removed by draining is discharged from a solution outlet <b>442</b> to the outside of the anodic oxidation apparatus <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0313">To reduce voltage losses, an electrolytic solution <b>418</b> to be stored in the power supply tank <b>412</b> has a higher temperature and/or a higher concentration than an electrolytic solution <b>426</b> to be stored in the anodic oxidation treatment tank <b>414</b>.

<p id="p-0280" num="0314">The electrolytic solutions are supplied to the power supply tank <b>412</b> and the anodic oxidation treatment tank <b>414</b> by squirting the electrolytic solutions from solution supply nozzles <b>436</b> and <b>438</b>. In order to distribute the electrolytic solution constantly and to prevent local current concentration on the aluminum plate <b>416</b> in the anodic oxidation treatment tank <b>414</b>, the solution supply nozzles <b>436</b> and <b>438</b> are provided with slits and are thereby configured to stabilize the squirted solutions in the width direction.</p>

<p id="h-0021" num="0000">&lt;Sealing Treatment&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0316">In the present invention, it is possible to carry out a sealing treatment for sealing the micropores which exist on the anodized film when appropriate. A presensitized plate for a lithographic printing plate having more excellent development property (sensitivity) can be obtained by performing the sealing treatment after the anodic oxidation treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0317">It is widely known that the anodic oxidation film is a porous film provided with numerous small holes called pores in the substantially perpendicular direction to the film surface. In the present invention, it is particularly preferable to subject the porous film to the sealing treatment at high sealing rate. The sealing rate is set preferably equal to or above 50%, more preferably equal to or above 70%, or even more preferably equal to or above 90%. Here, the sealing rate (percent) is defined by the following equation:

<p id="p-0284" num="0318">The above-mentioned surface areas are the values measured by use of the QUANTASORB (made by Yuasa Ionics Co., Ltd.) which adopts the simplified BET mode.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0319">The aluminum plate after the anodic oxidation treatment is further subjected to the sealing treatment and the hydrophilic treatment, and is thereby formed into a more favorable aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0320">The sealing treatment can be carried out by use of publicly known methods such as a hot water treatment, a boiling water treatment, a water vapor treatment, a dichromate treatment, a nitrite treatment, an ammonium acetate treatment, an electrodeposition treatment, or a sodium silicate treatment.

<p id="p-0289" num="0323">The fluorozirconate treatment is another preferable example of the sealing treatment. The fluorozirconate treatment is performed by use of a fluorozirconate salt such as sodium fluorozirconate or potassium fluorozirconate. It is particularly preferable to use an aqueous solution containing sodium fluorozirconate. In this way, it is possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent development property (sensitivity) upon exposure and development.

3. Fabrication of Support for Lithographic Printing Plate
</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0453">The support for a lithographic printing plate was formed by subjecting each of the above-described aluminum plates to the following treatments sequentially (the surface treatment described below will be abbreviated as Surface Treatment 1).</p>
<p id="h-0061" num="0000">(Surface Treatment)</p>
<p id="h-0062" num="0000">&lt;1&gt; Etching Treatment in Alkaline Aqueous Solution</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0454">The etching treatment for the aluminum plate was performed by spraying an aqueous solution containing 370 g/L of NaOH and 100 g/L of aluminum ions at 60° C. on the aluminum plate with a spray tube. An amount of dissolution on the surface of the aluminum plate subject to the electrochemical surface roughening treatment in the subsequent step was 3 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0455">Thereafter, the solution was drained off with a nip roller, then the plate was subjected to water washing, and then the water was drained off with the nip roller. This water washing treatment was performed by use of an apparatus configured to perform a water washing treatment with a liquid film of a free-fall curtain shape. Thereafter, the plate was washed for 5 seconds with water splashing in a fan shape out of a spray tip which was fitted to the spray tube.</p>
<p id="h-0063" num="0000">&lt;2&gt; Desmutting in Acidic Aqueous Solution</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0456">Next, the desmutting treatment was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0457">A nitric acid waste fluid used in the subsequent electrochemical surface roughening treatment was used herein. The fluid temperature was 35° C. The desmutting treatment was performed by spraying the desmutting solution for 5 seconds with a spray. Thereafter, the solution was not drained off with the nip roller. Instead, the aluminum plate was handled to the next step while leaving nitric acid attached thereto. After passing through the desmutting tank, the handling time while leaving nitric acid attached to the plate accounted for 25 seconds.</p>
<p id="h-0064" num="0000">&lt;3&gt; Electrochemical Surface Roughening Treatment in Nitric Acid Aqueous Solution</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0458">An electrolytic solution was prepared by adding aluminum nitrate to an aqueous solution having the nitric acid concentration of 10.4 g/L at the fluid temperature of 35° C., and thereby controlling the aluminum ion concentration to 4.5 g/L.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0459">An electrolytic solution having the same compositions and the same temperature as the nitric acid electrolytic solution used in the electrochemical surface roughening treatment was sprayed on the aluminum plate immediately before starting the electrochemical surface roughening treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0460">The electrochemical surface roughening treatment was performed by use of a power source generating an alternating current. The frequency of the alternating current was 60 Hz, and the time Tp consumed by the current to reach from 0 to a peak was 1.2 msec. The duty of the alternating current (ta/T) was 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0461">The current density at the peak of the alternate current was 60 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>at the anodic reaction of the aluminum plate. A ratio between the total quantity of electricity at the anodic reaction of the aluminum plate and the total quantity of electricity at the cathodic reaction thereof was 0.95. The quantity of electricity applied to the aluminum plate was 215 C/dm<sup>2 </sup>in terms of the total quantity of electricity at the anodic reaction of the aluminum plate.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0462">Two radial-type tanks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> were used as the electrolytic tanks. A relative velocity between the aluminum plate and the electrolytic solution was 1.5 m/sec (1 to 2 m/sec) on an average inside the electrolytic tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0463">Subsequently, the solution was drained off with the nip roller, and the plate was subjected to water washing. Thereafter, the plate was washed for 5 seconds with water splashing in a fan shape out of the spray tip which was fitted to the spray tube. Then, the water was drained off with the nip roller.</p>
<p id="h-0065" num="0000">&lt;4&gt; Etching Treatment in Alkaline Aqueous Solution</p>

<p id="p-0475" num="0511">The obtained lithographic printing plate was set on Lithrone Press (made by Komori Corporation) for printing by use of black ink DIC-GEOS (N) made by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Incorporated. Press life was evaluated by the number of printed sheets at the time of visual detection of the start of solid image fading. Results are shown in Table 4.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0512">A: The number of printed sheets is 40000 or above</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0513">B: The number of printed sheets is 30000 or above but less than 40000</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0514">C: The number of printed sheets is 20000 or above but less than 30000</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0515">D: The number of printed sheets is less than 20000</p>
<p id="h-0082" num="0000">(2) Sensitivity</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0516">The presensitized plate was exposed by use of TrendSetter made by Creo equipped with a semiconductor laser having the output power of 500 mW, the wavelength of 830 nm, and the beam diameter of 17 μm (1/e<sup>2</sup>) and under the conditions of the main scanning speed of 5 m/sec and the plate surface energy quantity of 140 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. For the purpose of evaluation of the sensitivity, several samples were prepared by exposing the sensitized plate with the plate surface energy quantities in a range of 45 to 180 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>while varying the quantities by 5 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>pitches.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0517">The development was performed by use of Automatic Processor PS900NP (made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) filled with the developer B and under the conditions of the development temperature of 25° C., and the time of 12 seconds. After completion of the development, the plate was subjected to water washing and processed with gum (GU-7 (1:1)) and the like. In this way, the plate making was completed and the lithographic printing plate was obtained. The sensitivity was measured by determining the smallest exposure amount with which image could be formed after the development while using the samples having the various plate surface energy quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0518">Results are shown in Table 4. In Table 4, the following criteria were used for evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0519">A: Energy quantity less than 50 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0520">B: Energy quantity 50 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or above but less than 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0521">C: Energy quantity 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or above but less than 150 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0522">D: Energy quantity 150 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or above</p>
<p id="h-0083" num="0000">(3) Stain Resistance</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0523">The lithographic printing plate as obtained in the above-described evaluation of (1) Press life was set on Mitsubishi DAIYA F2 Press (made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.) for printing by use of red ink DIC-GEOS (s). After printing 10000 sheets, stains on a blanket were evaluated visually.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0524">Results are shown in Table 4. In Table 4, the following criteria were used for evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0525">A: very few stains on the blanket</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0526">B: a few stains on the blanket</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0527">B-C: the blanket is stained but is still acceptable</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0528">C: the blanket is stained and a printed sheet is apparently stained</p>
<p id="h-0084" num="0000">(4) Ink Spread Resistance</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0529">Depending on the ink type, when a fountain solution is reduced, ink spreading at a shadow part (halftone dots having high image-area rates), that is, adhesion of the ink to a non-image portion (such a phenomenon will be hereinafter referred to as “ink spreading”, and resistance to occurrence of such ink spreading will be referred to as “ink spread resistance”) may occur. The lithographic printing plate as obtained in the above-described evaluation of (1) Press life was set on SOR-M Press made by Heidelberg for printing. Here, black ink DIC-GEOS (H) made by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Incoroprated was used to reduce a fountain solution. In this way, degrees of ink spreading in halftone dots were evaluated by three grades. Results are shown in Table 4. Evaluation was based on the following criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0530">A: Excellent ink spread resistance</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0531">A-B: A little ink spreading observed</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0532">B: Ink spreading observed</p>
