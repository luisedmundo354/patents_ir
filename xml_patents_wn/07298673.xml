<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to clocks and time keeping apparatuses. More particularly, the present invention relates to a time keeping apparatus specifically designed for monitoring employee time, such as at a job construction site or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is common practice for employees to “clock-in” and “clock-out” when checking in and checking out of work, such as when arriving at work, taking a lunch break and leaving for the day. The use of time clocks for tracking the time when an employee checks in and checks out is common place.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, an employee or supervisor must collect the time cards at the end of the shift or work period (usually every week or two) and calculate the hours worked each day for each employee. This is a time consuming and expensive task. Moreover, in some work environments, such as a construction job site, it is difficult to monitor when employees check in and check out. This is due to the fact that such work sites are often outdoors and not conducive to the traditional time clock apparatuses. A company can lose thousands of dollars per year when employees arrive fifteen minutes late and leave fifteen minutes early, but do not reflect it on the written timesheets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Applicant, ExakTime, Inc., currently offers a time attendance clock which is particularly suited for outdoor use, such as at job construction sites and the like, and which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. The time clock apparatus is sold under the Jobclock™ name, and was modeled after an electronic lock disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,564,600. The Jobclock™ includes a touch button detector, which detects touch buttons owned by each employee. When the touch button is brought into contact with the clock, the identity of the employee and the time is saved in an electronic record. Checking in and checking out can be tracked over time. A hand-held device, such as a Palm Pilot or the like, can be used to retrieve the data. The data is then processed through a software program to generate a report of the employee's time over the work period.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While overcoming the many disadvantages of the manual time tracking procedures, and being much more durable then traditional time clock apparatuses, the Jobclock™ also presents several drawbacks. Proprietary software protocol is used for tracking the time of each employee and for interfacing with the hand-held device. This has created incompatibility issues, which have increased over time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another drawback of the Jobclock™ apparatus is that the battery tends to fall out from the electrical contact periodically, and particularly in hotter weather, rendering the clock useless. Due to the design and configuration of the Jobclock™, it is very difficult to disassemble and then reassemble the clock in order to change or reinsert the battery. This is due to the need to disassemble several back plates, untwist the back plates from one another in one direction, and then during reassembly, fit the pieces together, properly align them, and twist them in the opposite direction. Those not familiar with the assembly of the Jobclock™ find it very difficult to disassemble and reassemble the apparatus. Due to the tendency for the battery to fall out from the electrical contact and the fact that the battery life is limited to no more than approximately four or five months, disassembly and reassembly must be undertaken periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The Jobclock™ also includes an opening which serves as an audio outlet for a single tone buzzer to audibly indicate that a key has been detected and read. However, this opening permits water to enter into the clock which can create electrical shorts and operational problems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When placing a touch button into contact with the clock, a single red light emitting diode visually indicates when the key is detected and read. However, this visual indicator is not visible when the key is brought to the detector area as it is immediately adjacent to the contact area. If the single audible tone is not heard, such as when placed against a wall or other flat surface, or otherwise not operational, there is confusion as to whether one has clocked in or out.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another drawback of the Jobclock™ apparatus is that it only has the capacity of approximately 3500 time records. Due to the proprietary communication protocol and software, the download speed is relatively slow. Moreover, when the records are downloaded, they are not retrievable by the user from the Jobclock™ memory. If, for whatever reason, the time records are lost before being processed, they cannot be easily retrieved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a time clock apparatus which automates the time keeping procedure, while being specifically designed for outdoor use, such as at job construction sites and the like, while overcoming the drawbacks of the existing time keeping apparatuses. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides other related advantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to a time attendance clock, and related time attendance system, which overcomes the disadvantages described above. The time attendance system of the present invention utilizes portable touch buttons which include a passively readable code unique to the holder of the touch button. The touch button is brought into contact with the time attendance clock, which reads the touch button and creates a time attendance record, including the readable code and time of contact. Means for communicating with the time attendance clock is provided, such as a hand-held electronic device having an infrared signal protocol to communicate with the transceiver of the time clock so as to extract time records therefrom. The communicating means may also comprise an electronic cable port, such as a serial or USB port, built into the time attendance clock.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The time attendance clock used in accordance with the present invention includes a housing sealed against water intrusion. The housing includes a front housing member and a back housing member, with a gasket disposed between them to provide a water tight seal therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A touch button contact extends through the front housing member so as not to be in electrical contact therewith. An electronic circuit disposed within the housing is electrically connected to the touch button contact so as to receive signals therefrom as the touch button interfaces with the touch button contact, typically by bringing the touch button into physical contact with the touch button contact detector. The electronic circuit includes a real time clock, a processor and memory adapted to store a time attendance record comprising the touch button code received from the touch button contact, and a time of touch button interface.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A plurality of visual indicators, such as differently colored light emitting diodes, are operably connected to the electronic circuit. The visual indicators are spaced from the touch button contact so as to be viewable through the front housing member as the touch button is moved into proximity to the touch button contact. Typically, the light emitting diodes are disposed in a lens assembly abutting a window formed in the front housing member. A transceiver is disposed adjacent to the visual indicators and adapted to receive and transmit IRDA signals. Using the transceiver, the hand-held device can extract stored time attendance records from the clock, and otherwise interact with the clock as needed, such as resetting the clock to avoid drift.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a particularly preferred embodiment, a multi-tone speaker is operably connected to the electronic circuit and adapted to emit an audible notification upon occurrence of predetermined events, such as clocking in and out, extracting records, etc. The back housing member preferably includes a plurality of apertures generally aligned with the speaker to facilitate the transmission of the audible notification from the speaker. Typically, the back housing member also includes projections on a rear face thereof to permit the audible notification to be heard when the time clock is placed against a flat surface. An air permeable, but liquid impermeable, membrane is disposed over the apertures of the back housing member to prevent water from entering the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The time attendance clock is typically battery powered, and includes a battery tray disposed in the housing adjacent to the electronic circuit. A battery receptacle accepts the replaceable battery, and includes battery orientation symbols. The battery receptacle also includes at least one spring loaded prong adapted to securely hold the battery in the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A housing guard is removably attached to the front housing member. Typically, the housing guard includes plurality of prongs adapted to be snap-fit over depressions in the front housing member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Typically, the housing includes a projection having an aperture for hanging the time attendance clock from an object, such as pad lock or the like. The projection comprises at least one plate disposed between the front and back housing members, and defining the projection extending upwardly from the housing. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a first plate is attached to the back housing member, and a second plate to the front housing member. The first and second plates have alignable apertures when the front and back housing members are attached to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

A time attendance clock <b>10</b> is activated by a touch button <b>12</b>, having an element on an end thereof capable of being read and transmitting a code representing the identity of the touch button <b>12</b> so that the time for that particular employee can be monitored as the touch button is brought into contact with the time attendance clock <b>10</b>. As will be more fully described herein, the time attendance clock <b>10</b> is a self-powered and portable unit which includes the necessary electronics for reading and recognizing the identity of the touch buttons, and creating a log or time attendance record of each time that a touch button is read, while associating a time with that occurrence.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Periodically, such as every week or two, the time attendance records are downloaded from the time attendance clock. In a particularly preferred embodiment, this occurs in a wireless manner by use of a hand-held electronic device <b>14</b>, such as a personal digital assistant, Palm Pilot™ and the like. The communications protocol utilized by the time attendance clock <b>10</b> and the hand-held device <b>14</b> is by means of IrDA, which is the industry standard. In this manner, the time attendance clock <b>10</b> can communicate with a wide variety of hand-held devices using the industry standard communications protocol. Communication between the hand-held device <b>14</b> and the time attendance clock <b>10</b> can also serve other purposes, such as resetting the internal clock of the time attendance clock <b>10</b>, so as to synchronize the clock and avoid drift, which can create inaccurate time records over time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The hand-held device is then interfaced with a computer <b>16</b>, such as a laptop or desktop computer. This may occur by means of a docketing station <b>18</b>, or tables, in a wireless manner, etc. The time attendance records are then downloaded into a software program stored on the computer <b>16</b> for analysis and the creation of time attendance timesheets for each employee over the period of time. The time attendance records can be edited, printed, etc., at the computer <b>16</b> as necessary. The software on the computer <b>16</b> also enables the employer to track labor costs, insert job codes for billings at different rates, prepare a payroll for the company's employees, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the time attendance clock <b>10</b> itself can be interfaced with the computer <b>16</b>, using cables or the like, typically, however, the hand-held device is used to extract the information while the time attendance clock <b>10</b> is left in its location, such as at a remote job site.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the time clock apparatus <b>10</b> is shown from front and back views, as well as an exploded perspective view to show the various component parts thereof. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the clock <b>10</b> is manufactured so as to be very durable. The clock <b>10</b> is designed so as to withstand temperature extremes in the range of −10° F. to 150° F. As will be more fully described herein, the clock <b>10</b> is also designed so as to be waterproof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the clock <b>10</b> includes a front housing member <b>100</b> and a back housing member <b>102</b> which are attachable to one another so as to cooperatively form a housing or case. The housing members <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> are preferably comprised of electroless nickel plated aluminum, or other such durable material. A gasket <b>104</b> is disposed between the front and back housing members <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> so as to create a waterproof seal therebetween to prevent incursion of water into the housing which can harm delicate electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A metallic touch button contact or detector <b>106</b> extends through the front housing member <b>100</b>, typically through a mating front insulator <b>108</b>, such that the detector <b>106</b> is kept in electrical isolation relative to the front housing member <b>100</b>. Preferably, both the touch button detector <b>106</b> and insulator member <b>108</b> include adhesive or other sealant so as to prevent water from entering the clock <b>10</b> through the front housing member <b>100</b>. The front housing member <b>100</b> includes a recess and aperture <b>110</b> for receiving the insulator <b>108</b> and touch button contact detector <b>106</b>, such that they are flush or reside within a depression therein. Preferably, this depression is encircled about by a lip <b>112</b>, which serves as a guide to the employees when bringing their touch buttons <b>12</b> into contact with the detector <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A printed circuit board <b>114</b> with the necessary electronic components, such as a microcontroller or microprocessor, memory, etc., resides within the clock <b>10</b> and is electronically connected to the touch button contact detector <b>106</b>, so as to receive and interpret codes from the touch buttons coming into contact therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary electronic logic diagram is shown. When an employee's touch button <b>12</b> is brought into contact with the touch button contact or detector <b>106</b>, the integrated circuit housed within a stainless steel container of the touch button <b>12</b> (illustrated as the circular end portion thereof), the code is read and relayed to the microcontroller. The touch button contact or detector <b>106</b> can be any device which can read a touch button <b>12</b> and send a signal corresponding to the touch button <b>12</b> to the microcontroller or microprocessor <b>116</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the contact detector <b>106</b> uses a touch button system sold under the trade name Touch Memory Button by Dallas Semiconductor of Dallas, Tex. The system operates by providing a touch button <b>12</b> which contains an integrated circuit housed within a stainless steel container. The system is passive, in that the touch button <b>12</b> has no power source. The detector <b>106</b>, in response to being touched by the stainless steel container of the touch button <b>12</b> sends a signal to read the code of the touch button <b>12</b> encoded in the integrated circuit thereof. Every touch button <b>12</b> code is unique. After reading the code of the touch button <b>12</b>, the detector <b>106</b> sends a signal to the microcontroller <b>116</b> corresponding to the code of the touch button <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each time a touch button <b>12</b> is brought into contact with the touch button contact detectors <b>06</b>, its unique code is relayed to the microcontroller <b>116</b> for storage. At this time, the time of this occurrence is obtained from a real time clock in the electronic circuit which is in electronic communication with the microcontroller <b>116</b>. The received and interpreted code as well as the extracted time is saved in a memory <b>120</b> as a time attendance record.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Visual indicators such as light emitting diodes <b>122</b> are powered so as to visually notify the employee that the touch button has been properly brought into contact with the detector <b>106</b> and that the employee has clocked in or out. The clock <b>10</b> preferably includes a plurality of visual indicators, in the form of red and green light emitting diodes. In a particularly preferred embodiment, an audible notification is also given by a multi-tone speaker <b>124</b>. The multi-tone speaker <b>124</b> is capable to emitting a range of notification tones. These tones are distinct in sound so as to be unique and easily understood. In this manner, the employee can quickly determine if the touch button <b>12</b> has not been completely brought into contact with the detector <b>106</b>, as the red LED instead of the green LED will be lit and a different audible notification will be heard. The LED <b>122</b> and speaker <b>124</b> can also be used to notify of other conditions. The following table describes the LED and audio under different conditions (configurable items are indicated with the x<sub>t</sub>):</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The time attendance clock <b>10</b> interfaces with the external world via not only the touch button electronic contacts, but also with infrared and peripheral serial interface ports. The electronic circuitry includes an IrDA interface <b>126</b> which is in electronic communication with an infrared transceiver <b>128</b> for receiving and transmitting infrared signals. In the clock <b>10</b> of the present application, these infrared signals are non-proprietary and conforming to the industry standard so as to enable the communication of the clock <b>10</b> with a wide variety of existing hand-held devices. The protocol is open and releasable, instead of being proprietary, so as to further facilitate communication. When the time attendance records need to be retrieved, as described above, the hand-held device wirelessly communicates with the transceiver <b>128</b> to extract a copy of the time attendance records from the memory <b>120</b>. The clock <b>10</b> of the present invention can store at least 10,000 such records. Another feature of the clock <b>10</b> of the present invention is that instead of deleting these records or rendering them inaccessible once they have been retrieved, the records can be retrieved multiple times. This solves the problem of losing the records either in the hand-held device, or when connecting the hand-held device to the computer. With prior devices, extracting the records again from the clock was extremely difficult and could not be done by the clock owner, if at all.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the LEDs <b>122</b> and the transceiver <b>128</b> being disposed on opposite ends of the electronic circuit, in a particularly preferred embodiment, these items are housed within a lens assembly <b>130</b> which is disposed between the printed circuit board <b>114</b> and the front housing member <b>100</b> so as to be aligned with a front window <b>132</b> thereof. The window <b>132</b> is spaced apart from the touch button contact detector <b>106</b>, and outside of the raised lip <b>112</b> such that when an employee brings a touch button into contact with the detector <b>106</b>, he or she can still see the lit LEDs <b>122</b> through the window <b>132</b>. Moreover, a user seeking to extract records from the clock <b>10</b> will naturally point the hand-held device towards the window <b>132</b>, where the transceiver is positioned adjacent to the LEDs <b>122</b>. The clock <b>10</b> of the present invention also includes in-circuit programming ports and a serial port so as to connect to other peripherals, such as directly to the computer <b>116</b>, as described above. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the electronic circuit board includes a multi-pin connector <b>134</b> which can be connected to a cable extending between the clock <b>10</b> and a peripheral device or computer. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other such connectors to create a physical connection between the clock <b>10</b> and another electronic device are contemplated by the present invention. In order to retain the waterproof nature of the clock <b>10</b> of the present invention, the connector <b>134</b> is disposed within the front and back housings <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, and only accessible when the back housing <b>102</b> is removed. In-circuit programming can be achieved either through the physical connection with the contact <b>134</b>, or through the infrared wireless transceiver <b>128</b>. In fact, as discussed above, when time attendance records are retrieved from the clock <b>10</b>, the hand-held device resets the internal clock <b>118</b> via the transceiver <b>128</b>. This not only avoids drift in the real time clock <b>118</b>, but also synchronizes the various job clocks <b>10</b> used on one or more jobsites. In this manner, as an employee clocks in and out using different clocks at different sites, which can be common in a construction business, the time is synchronized to within seconds so as to record and track an accurate time for the employee.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A battery tray <b>136</b> is disposed adjacent to the printed circuit board <b>114</b> and configured to hold a battery, typically a CR123 3VDC lithium manganese dioxide battery, which is designed to draw no more than 300 μA so as to last for at least six to nine months. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the battery tray <b>136</b> includes a battery receptacle <b>138</b> having battery pole symbol markings <b>140</b> so as to orient the user as to the position and polarity of the battery insert therein. Moreover, the receptacle <b>138</b> includes at least one spring loaded clip <b>142</b> for retaining the battery securely therein, even in excessive temperatures which would enable the battery to slip out in previous clocks. The battery tray <b>136</b> also includes a receptacle <b>144</b> for receiving a transducer or speaker <b>146</b> therein. With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, aside from the primary battery <b>148</b>, the clock <b>10</b> includes back-up power in the form of a back-up batter <b>150</b>, which provides power in the absence of a battery, such as when the primary battery <b>148</b> is replaced. The back-up power is provided preferably for at least one hour. This will ensure that the clock <b>10</b> remains operational after battery replacement. The clock <b>10</b> has the ability to monitor the battery voltage such that a user can be informed when the battery needs to be replaced, such as via the LEDs or audible notification, as indicated above. The clock <b>10</b> supports three states of power management, namely, running, idle, or sleep. The clock is in running mode when processing a transaction, such as data from a touch button, a peripheral serial interface, or a wireless transaction through the IRDA signal in hand-held device. The running state requires the most power and is the least common state over time. The clock <b>10</b> transitions from a running state to the idle state when the transaction processing is complete. The processor sleeps during the idle state, and all peripherals are placed with the lowest power consumption during this state. In this manner, battery power is conserved. The sleep state only occurs when commanded via peripheral interface, such as the hand-held device or the like. This occurs, for example, when the clock <b>10</b> is not to be used for some time, such as when in storage or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a housing guard <b>152</b> includes a plurality of prongs <b>154</b> configured to be snap fit over recesses or depressions <b>156</b> formed in the periphery of the front housing member <b>100</b>. The housing guard <b>154</b> is preferably comprised of a durable plastic material, and is typically of a different color than the front housing member <b>100</b>, so as to create an aesthetically pleasing appearance, while also distinguishing between different job clocks <b>10</b>. Thus, for example, one set of workers may utilize the “red” clock, while others utilize the “blue” clock. A bolt <b>158</b> extends through the housing guard <b>152</b>, through the battery tray <b>136</b> and into the front housing member <b>100</b> so as to sandwich the printed circuit board and sensitive components between the housing guard <b>152</b> and the front housing member <b>100</b>. The clock <b>10</b> when fully assembled is waterproof, and resistant to various solvents and liquids. Moreover, the clock <b>10</b> is capable of operating in vibrating conditions, high humidity conditions, high temperature or low temperature conditions, or other harsh environments. The clock <b>10</b> can survive a drop from up to twelve feet onto a concrete floor on each of the three orthogonal axes. If the housing guard <b>152</b> is damaged, it can be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A plate, typically a metallic plate <b>160</b>, is attached via bolt <b>162</b> to the housing guard <b>152</b>. The plate <b>160</b> includes an extension defining an aperture <b>164</b>, by which the clock <b>10</b> can be hung from an object, such as a pad lock or the like. The plate <b>164</b>, housing guard <b>152</b>, and front housing member <b>100</b> are typically interconnected with one another. The rear housing member <b>102</b> is connected to another plate <b>166</b>, also having an extension defining an aperture <b>168</b>, which is generally alignable with the aperture <b>164</b> of the other plate <b>160</b>. A bolt or screw interconnects the plate <b>166</b> with the back housing member <b>102</b>. The gasket <b>104</b> typically rests within a recess <b>172</b> of the back housing member <b>102</b>, which also includes threads for being threadedly connected to the front housing member <b>100</b>. A bolt <b>174</b> extends through the back housing member <b>102</b> and into the front housing member <b>100</b>, or the front housing member guard <b>152</b>, so as to interconnect the plate <b>166</b> and back housing member <b>102</b> to completely assemble the clock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The back housing member <b>102</b> includes plurality of apertures <b>176</b> generally aligned with the speaker <b>124</b>. This enables the speaker sound to be clearly emitted through the clock <b>10</b>. The speaker apertures <b>176</b> are covered with a membrane <b>178</b> which allows air to pass therethrough, but is resistant to water. The preferable membrane material is comprised of Gortex material. Typically, an outer label <b>180</b> is adhered over the membrane <b>178</b> and onto the rear face of the back housing member <b>102</b>, to securely hold the membrane <b>178</b> in place, and also provide identification markings, instructions the like. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, instead of being flat, the rear housing <b>102</b> includes projections <b>182</b>, or is otherwise irregular in surface such that the sounds from the speaker <b>124</b> can be clearly heard even when the clock <b>10</b> is placed against a flat surface, such as a wall or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The internal components of the clock <b>10</b> can be easily accessed, such as when replacing the battery <b>148</b> or accessing the physical electrical contacts <b>134</b>, by merely removing bolt <b>174</b>, and unscrewing the back plate <b>166</b> and housing <b>102</b> assembly from the front housing assembly, containing the remaining components from the front housing member <b>100</b> through the front plate <b>160</b>. This will expose the battery within the battery receptacle <b>138</b>, and the multi-pronged serial cord connector. This can be done in a matter of seconds without skilled labor. This can also be done, for example, if the clock <b>10</b> is dropped and the housing guard <b>152</b> is damaged and needs to be replaced. This is easily done by removing bolt <b>158</b>, and removing the snap-fit connection between the housing guard <b>152</b> and front housing member <b>100</b>, and replacing it with a new housing guard <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although several embodiments have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims.</p>
