<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When a high frequency laminated component is structured, a circuit electrode is formed horizontally and a via-hole electrode is formed vertically in a multilayer substrate having a certain dielectric constant, so that the circuit electrode and the via-hole electrode are easily interfered with each other. In general, the via-hole electrode and the circuit electrode, which is not directly connected thereto, have to be placed separately each other at a certain distance for restraining the mutual interference therebetween. On the contrary, according to a high frequency laminated component of the present invention, a dielectric layer (i.e., a first dielectric layer) around a via-hole electrode has a lower dielectric constant than that of other areas, so that the high frequency laminated component can be downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments are demonstrated hereinafter with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a high frequency laminated component used in a high frequency apparatus such as a high frequency filter or a high frequency switch. Circuit electrodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, which forms a high frequency circuit, and via-hole electrode <b>3</b>, which couples circuit electrodes <b>21</b> and <b>23</b>, are formed inside multilayer substrate <b>100</b> made of dielectric <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, a method of manufacturing the high frequency laminated component is described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, a via-hole for via-hole electrode <b>3</b> is formed at a certain position of a dielectric sheet which forms dielectric layer <b>11</b> (i.e., a second dielectric layer) of multilayer substrate <b>100</b>. Second, the via-hole is filled with electrode paste, and circuit electrodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> are applied on dielectric layer <b>11</b>. Third, the dielectric sheets, where circuit electrodes <b>21</b>-<b>23</b> and via-hole electrode <b>3</b> are formed, are piled so as to construct a laminated member. Last, the laminated member <b>10</b> is baked, whereby the high frequency laminated component is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When ceramic material containing low-melting glass is used as material of the dielectric sheet forming dielectric layer <b>11</b>, the dielectric sheet and the electrode paste can be simultaneously baked.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the manufacturing method of the present invention, a laser is used in a boring process for forming via-hole electrode <b>3</b> in the dielectric sheet. By forming the via-hole using the laser, a glass ingredient which has been contained in the dielectric sheet is deposited at an inner circumference of the via-hole, so that a glass layer is formed at a circumference of via-hole electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Specifically, in a case where material of the dielectric sheet is formed of dielectric material which has a dielectric constant of approximately 10 and contains glass having a dielectric constant of approximately 5, a dielectric constant of the dielectric sheet after baking becomes approximately 7. On the other hand, low dielectric layer <b>4</b> (i.e., a first dielectric layer), which is formed of glass having a dielectric constant of approximately 5, is formed with a certain thickness near via-hole electrode <b>3</b> bored by the laser.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, via-hole electrode <b>3</b> extending vertically in multilayer substrate <b>100</b> is surrounded with low dielectric layer <b>4</b>. Accordingly, mutual interference between circuit electrode <b>22</b> and via-hole electrode <b>3</b> is restrained, though circuit electrode <b>22</b> is formed horizontally and two dimensionally for dielectric layer <b>11</b> and easy to be electrically contacted with via-hole electrode <b>3</b>. As a result, the high frequency laminated component can be downsized because circuit electrode <b>22</b> and via-hole electrode <b>3</b> can be formed closely each other compared with a conventional one.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A carbon dioxide laser having a great power is preferably used as the laser in the boring process. Deposition of the glass becomes greater by using the great power laser, so that low dielectric layer <b>4</b> can be formed thicker.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the other hand, in the high frequency laminated component discussed above, according to development of a high frequency of a frequency band and downsizing of a frequency component in recent years, via-hole electrode <b>3</b>, which was conventionally used only as an electrode for connecting, has been utilized as inductance. Therefore, high impedance of via-hole electrode <b>3</b> is necessary for forming inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a word, electrical coupling between an earth electrode, which is one of circuit electrodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> formed in multilayer substrate <b>100</b>, and via-hole electrode <b>3</b> is restrained by surrounding via-hole electrode <b>3</b> with low dielectric layer <b>4</b> for performing high impedance. Accordingly, via-hole electrode <b>3</b> can be effectively utilized as inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, according to the high frequency laminated component of the present embodiment, a diameter of via-hole electrode <b>3</b>, which is formed across multilayered dielectric layers <b>11</b>, is not constant in a direction of thickness. At a connecting point of via-hole electrodes <b>3</b> between dielectric layers <b>11</b>, an upper part of via-hole electrodes <b>3</b> differs from a lower part thereof in a diameter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which is an enlarged view of a part of the via-hole, the via-hole formed through dielectric layers <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> is processed to be tapered from an upper side to a lower side. As a result, at a connecting point between via-hole electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, which are formed by filling two via-holes with an electric conductor, diameter D2 of via-hole electrode <b>32</b> is larger than diameter D1 of via-hole electrode <b>31</b>. Besides, via-hole electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are respectively surrounded with low dielectric layers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Using the structure discussed above, SIR (Step-Impedance-Resonator) effect that impedance varies inside a series of via-hole electrode <b>3</b> is induced, so that greater inductance can be added to via-hole electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As discussed above, as the method for forming different diameters at the upper part and the lower part of the connecting point of via-hole electrodes <b>3</b>, converged beam <b>5</b> of the laser can be used in the boring process of the dielectric sheet as shown in a broken line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Using the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, via-hole <b>7</b> having taper for dielectric sheet <b>6</b> is easy to be manufactured without using a particular process.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a word, in a case where the via-hole electrode is formed across the plurality of dielectric layers, inductance formed of the via-hole electrode itself becomes greater by changing impedance at the connecting point between dielectric layers. As a result, the high frequency laminated component can be more downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the high frequency laminated component of the present embodiment discussed above, all high frequency components are constructed by circuit electrodes <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> formed in multilayer substrate <b>100</b>. However, the same effect can be obtained by mounting active components such as a diode or a FET on multilayer substrate <b>100</b> for structuring a certain kind of high frequency component.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the present invention discussed above, a dielectric constant near a via-hole electrode is formed to be lower than that of other areas in a multilayer substrate, so that interference between a circuit electrode and the via-hole electrode can be restrained. As a result, a downsized high frequency laminated component can be provided because the circuit electrode and the via-hole electrode can be formed closely each other compared with a conventional one.</p>
