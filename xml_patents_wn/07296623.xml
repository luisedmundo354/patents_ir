<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to methods and apparatus for connecting threaded members while ensuring that a proper connection is made.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When joining lengths of tubing (i.e., production tubing, casing, drill pipe, etc.; collectively referred to herein as tubing) for oil wells, the nature of the connection between the lengths of tubing is critical. It is conventional to form such lengths of tubing to standards prescribed by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Each length of tubing has an internal threading at one end and an external threading at another end. The externally-threaded end of one length of tubing is adapted to engage in the internally-threaded end of another length of tubing. API type connections between lengths of such tubing rely on thread interference and the interposition of a thread compound to provide a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For some oil well tubing, such API type connections are not sufficiently secure or leakproof. In particular, as the petroleum industry has drilled deeper into the earth during exploration and production, increasing pressures have been encountered. In such environments, where API type connections are not suitable, it is conventional to utilize so-called “premium grade” tubing which is manufactured to at least API standards but in which a metal-to-metal sealing area is provided between the lengths. In this case, the lengths of tubing each have tapered surfaces which engage one another to form the metal-to-metal sealing area. Engagement of the tapered surfaces is referred to as the “shoulder” position/condition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Whether the threaded pipe members are of the API type or are premium grade connections, methods are needs to ensure a good connection. One method involves the connection of two co-operating threaded pipe sections, rotating the pipe sections relative to one another by means of a power tong, measuring the torque applied to rotate one section relative to the other and the number of rotations or turns which one section makes relative to the other. Signals indicative of the torque and turns are fed to a controller which ascertains whether the measured torque and turns fall within a predetermined range of torque and turns which are known to produce a good connection. Upon reaching a torque-turn value within a prescribed minimum and maximum (referred to as a dump value), the torque applied by the power tong is terminated. An output signal, e.g. an audible signal, is then operated to indicate whether the connection is a good or a bad connection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As indicated above, a leakproof metal-to-metal seal is to be achieved, and in order for the seal to be effective, the amount of torque applied to effect the shoulder condition and the metal-to-metal seal is critical. In the case of premium grade connections, the manufacturers of the premium grade tubing publish torque values required for correct makeup utilizing a particular tubing. Such published values may be based on minimum, optimum and maximum torque values, an optimum and maximum torque values, or an optimum torque value only. Current practice is to makeup the connection to within a predetermined torque range while plotting the applied torque vs. rotation or time, and then make a visual inspection and determination of the quality of the makeup. However, in addition to being highly subjective, such an approach fails to take into consideration other factors which can result in final torque values indicating a good final make-up condition when, in fact, a leakproof seal may not necessarily have been achieved. Such other factors include, for example, the coefficient of friction of the lubricant, cleanliness of the connection surfaces, surface finish of the connection parts, manufacturing tolerances, etc. In general, the most significant factor is the coefficient of friction of the lubricant which will vary with ambient temperature and change during connection make-up as the various components of the lubricant break down under increasing bearing pressure. Eventually, the coefficient of friction tends to that of steel, whereupon the connection will be damaged with continued rotation.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As indicated above, a leakproof metal-to-metal seal is to be achieved, and in order for the seal to be effective, the amount of torque applied to effect the shoulder condition and the metal-to-metal seal is critical.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a first embodiment, a method of connecting threaded members is provided. The method comprises the steps of: rotating two threaded members relative to one another; detecting an event during relative rotation between the two threaded members; and stopping relative rotation between the threaded members when reaching a predefined value from the detected event. Preferably, the two threaded members define a shoulder seal, the event is a shoulder condition, and the predefined value is a rotation value. Further, an apparatus is provided for carrying out this method.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a second embodiment, the applied torque and rotation are measured at regular intervals throughout a pipe connection makeup. The rate of change of torque with rotation (derivative) is calculated for each set of measurements. These three values (torque, rotation and rate of change of torque) are then compared either continuously or at selected rotational positions, with minimum and maximum acceptable predetermined values, and a decision made whether to continue rotation or abort the makeup. Additionally, the derivative (rate of change of torque) is compared with predetermined threshold values to determine seal and shoulder contact points. The change in torque and rotation between these two detected contact points is checked to ensure that the change is within a predetermined acceptable range. When the shoulder contact is detected, a predetermined torque value and/or rotation value is added to the measured torque and/or rotation values, respectively, at shoulder contact and rotation continued until this calculated value(s) is reached. The application of torque is terminated and the reverse rotation of a tubing length is monitored as the connection relaxes. If the relaxation is within an acceptable predetermined range and the above conditions are met then the makeup is considered acceptable.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention generally provides methods and apparatus for characterizing pipe connections. In particular, an aspect of the present invention provides for characterizing the make-up of premium grade tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, premium grade tubing refers to tubing wherein one length can be connected to another by means of a connection incorporating a shoulder which assists in sealing of the connection by way of a metal-to-metal contact.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Premium Grade Tubing</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one form of a premium grade tubing connection to which aspects of the present invention are applicable. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a tapered premium grade tubing assembly <b>100</b> having a first tubing length <b>102</b> joined to a second tubing length <b>104</b> through a tubing coupling or box <b>106</b>. The end of each tubing length <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> has a tapered externally-threaded surface <b>108</b> which co-operates with a correspondingly tapered internally-threaded surface <b>110</b> on the coupling <b>106</b>. Each tubing length <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> is provided with a tapered torque shoulder <b>112</b> which co-operates with a correspondingly tapered torque shoulder <b>114</b> on the coupling <b>106</b>. At a terminal end of each tubing length <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, there is defined an annular sealing area <b>116</b> which is engageable with a co-operating annular sealing area <b>118</b> defined between the tapered portions <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> of the coupling <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">During make-up, the tubing lengths <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> (also known as pins), are engaged with the box <b>106</b> and then threaded into the box by relative rotation therewith. During continued rotation, the annular sealing areas <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> contact one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This initial contact is referred to herein as the “seal condition”. As the tubing lengths <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are further rotated, the co-operating tapered torque shoulders <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> contact and bear against one another at a machine detectable stage referred to as a “shoulder condition” or “shoulder torque”, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The increasing pressure interface between the tapered torque shoulders <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> cause the seals <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> to be forced into a tighter metal-to-metal sealing engagement with each other causing deformation of the seals <b>116</b> and eventually forming a fluid-tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It will be appreciated that although aspects of the invention have been described with respect to a tapered premium grade connection, the invention is not so limited. Accordingly, in some embodiments aspects of the invention are implemented using parallel premium grade connections. Further, some connections do not utilize a box or coupling (such as box <b>106</b>). Rather, two tubing lengths (one having external threads at one end, and the other having cooperating internals threads) are threadedly engaged directly with one another. The invention is equally applicable to such connections. In general, any pipe forming a metal-to-metal seal which can be detected during make up can be utilized. Further, use of the term “shoulder” or “shoulder condition” is not limited to a well-defined shoulder as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. It may include a connection having a plurality of metal-to-metal contact surfaces which cooperate together to serve as a “shoulder.” It may also include a connection in which an insert is placed between two non-shouldered threaded ends to reinforce the connection, such as may be done in drilling with casing. In this regard, the invention has application to any variety of tubulars characterized by function including: drill pipe, tubing/casing, risers, and tension members. The connections used on each of these tubulars must be made up to a minimum preload on a torque shoulder if they are to function within their design parameters and, as such, may be used to advantage with the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Characterizing Tubing Behavior</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During make-up of tubing lengths torque may be plotted with respect to time or turns. According to an embodiment of the present invention, torque is preferably measured with respect to turns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a typical x-y plot (curve <b>400</b>) illustrating the (idealized) acceptable behavior of premium grade tubulars, such as the tapered premium grade tubing assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a corresponding chart plotting the rate of change in torque (y-axis) with respect to turns (x-axis). Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4–5</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. Shortly after the tubing lengths engage one another and torque is applied (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the measured torque increases substantially linearly as illustrated by curve portion <b>402</b>. As a result, corresponding curve portion <b>502</b> of the differential curve <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is flat at some positive value. During continued rotation, the annular sealing areas <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> contact one another causing a slight change (specifically, an increase) in the torque rate, as illustrated by point <b>404</b>. Thus, point <b>404</b> corresponds to the seal condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and is plotted as the first step <b>504</b> of the differential curve <b>500</b>. The torque rate then again stabilizes resulting in the linear curve portion <b>406</b> and the plateau <b>506</b>. In practice, the seal condition (point <b>404</b>) may be too slight to be detectable. However, in a properly behaved make-up, a discernable/detectable change in the torque rate occurs when the shoulder condition is achieved (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), as represented by point <b>408</b> and step <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By way of illustration only, the following provides an embodiment for calculating the rate of change in torque with respect to turns:</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0042">Once the shoulder condition is detected, some predetermined number of turns or torque value can be added to achieve the terminal connection position (i.e., the final state of a tubular assembly after make-up rotation is terminated). Alternatively, the terminal connection position can be achieved by adding a combination of number of turns and a torque value. In any case, the predetermined value(s) (turns and/or torque) is added to the measured torque or turns at the time the shoulder condition is detected. Various embodiments will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">The above-described torque-turns behavior can be generated using various measuring equipment in combination with a power drive unit used to couple tubing lengths. Examples of a power drive unit include a power tongs unit, typically hydraulically powered, and a top drive unit. According to aspects of the present invention, a power drive unit is operated in response to one or more parameters measured/detected during make-up of a pipe connection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6A</figref> are block diagrams of tubular make-up systems <b>600</b> and <b>600</b><i>a </i>according to embodiments of the invention. Generally, the tubular make-up systems <b>600</b> and <b>600</b><i>a </i>comprise power drive units <b>602</b> and <b>602</b><i>a</i>, power drive control systems <b>604</b> and <b>604</b><i>a</i>, and a computer system <b>606</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the power drive unit is a power tongs unit <b>602</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the power drive unit is a top drive unit. The physical locations of the tie-ins between the top drive control system <b>604</b><i>a </i>and the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>are representative only and may be varied based on specific top drive configurations. The power drive unit may be any variety of apparatus capable of gripping and rotating a tubing length <b>102</b>, the lower end of which is threaded into a box <b>106</b> which, in turn, is threaded into the upper end of a tubing length <b>104</b>. The tubing length <b>104</b> represents the upper end of a pipe string extending into the bore hole of a well (not shown). Since the power tongs unit <b>602</b> may be an apparatus well-known in the industry, it is not shown in detail. The tubing lengths <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and box <b>106</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> but are shown in the figures illustrating more detail of the top drive <b>602</b><i>a</i>, discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">Turns counters <b>608</b> and <b>608</b><i>a </i>sense the rotation of the upper tubing length <b>102</b> and generates turns count signals <b>610</b> and <b>610</b><i>a </i>representing such rotational movement. In one embodiment, the box <b>106</b> may be secured against rotation so that the turns count signals <b>610</b> and <b>610</b><i>a </i>accurately reflect the relative rotation between the upper tubing length <b>102</b> and the box <b>106</b>. Alternatively or additionally, a second turns counter may be provided to sense the rotation of the box <b>106</b>. The turns count signal issued by the second turns counter may then be used to correct (for any rotation of the box <b>106</b>) the turns count signals <b>610</b> and <b>610</b><i>a </i>issued by turns counters <b>608</b> and <b>608</b><i>a</i>. In addition, torque transducers <b>612</b> and <b>612</b><i>a </i>attached to the power tongs unit <b>602</b> and top drive unit <b>602</b><i>a</i>, respectively, generate torque signals <b>614</b> and <b>614</b><i>a </i>representing the torque applied to the upper tubing length <b>102</b> by the power tongs unit <b>602</b> and the top drive unit <b>602</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">Preferably, the turns and torque values are measured/sampled simultaneously at regular intervals. In a particular embodiment, the turns and torque values are measured a frequency of between about 50 Hz and about 20,000 Hz. Further, the sampling frequency may be varied during makeup. Accordingly, the turns count signals <b>610</b> and <b>610</b><i>a </i>may represent some fractional portion of a complete revolution. Alternatively, though not typically or desirably, the turns count signals <b>610</b> and <b>610</b><i>a </i>may be issued only upon a complete rotation of the tubing length <b>102</b>, or some multiple of a complete rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">The signals <b>610</b> and <b>610</b><i>a</i>, <b>614</b> and <b>614</b><i>a </i>are inputs to the power drive control systems <b>604</b> and <b>604</b><i>a</i>. A computer <b>616</b> of the computer system <b>606</b> monitors the turns count signals and torque signals and compares the measured values of these signals with predetermined values. In one embodiment, the predetermined values are input by an operator for a particular tubing connection. The predetermined values may be input to the computer <b>616</b> via an input device, such as a keypad, which can be included as one of a plurality of input devices <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">Illustrative predetermined values which may be input, by an operator or otherwise, include a delta torque value <b>624</b>, a delta turn value <b>626</b>, minimum and maximum turns values <b>628</b>, and minimum and maximum torque values <b>630</b>. As used herein, the delta torque value <b>626</b> and the delta turn value <b>628</b> are values applied to the measured torque and turns, respectively, corresponding to a detected shoulder condition (point <b>408</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Accordingly, the final torque and turns values at a terminal connection position are dependent upon the state of a tubing assembly when the shoulder condition is reached, and therefore these final values may be considered wholly unknown prior to reaching the shoulder condition.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">During makeup of a tubing assembly, various output may be observed by an operator on output device, such as a display screen, which may be one of a plurality of output devices <b>620</b>. The format and content of the displayed output may vary in different embodiments. By way of example, an operator may observe the various predefined values which have been input for a particular tubing connection. Further, the operator may observe graphical information such as a representation of the torque rate curve <b>400</b> and the torque rate differential curve <b>500</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0050">The comparison of measured turn count values and torque values with respect to predetermined values is performed by one or more functional units of the computer <b>616</b>. The functional units may generally be implemented as hardware, software or a combination thereof. By way of illustration of a particular embodiment, the functional units are described as software. In one embodiment, the functional units include a torque-turns plotter algorithm <b>632</b>, a process monitor <b>634</b>, a torque rate differential calculator <b>636</b>, a smoothing algorithm <b>638</b>, a sampler <b>640</b>, and a comparator <b>642</b>. The process monitor <b>634</b> includes a thread engagement detection algorithm <b>644</b>, a seal detection algorithm <b>646</b> and a torque shoulder detection algorithm <b>648</b>. The function of each of the functional units during make-up of a connection will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It should be understood, however, that although described separately, the functions of one or more functional units may in fact be performed by a single unit, and that separate units are shown and described herein for purposes of clarity and illustration. As such, the functional units <b>632</b>–<b>642</b> may be considered logical representations, rather than well-defined and individually distinguishable components of software or hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is one embodiment of a method <b>700</b> for characterizing a pipe connection make-up. The method <b>700</b> may be implemented by systems <b>600</b> and <b>600</b><i>a</i>, largely under the control the functional units of the computer <b>616</b>. The method <b>700</b> is initiated when two threaded members are brought together with relative rotation induced by the power tong unit <b>602</b> or top drive unit <b>602</b><i>a </i>(step <b>702</b>). Illustratively, the threaded members are the tubing length <b>102</b> and the box <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In one embodiment, the applied torque and rotation are measured at regular intervals throughout a pipe connection makeup (step <b>704</b>). The frequency with which torque and rotation are measured is specified by the sampler <b>640</b>. The sampler <b>640</b> may be configurable, so that an operator may input a desired sampling frequency. The measured torque and rotation values may be stored as a paired set in a buffer area of computer memory (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Further, the rate of change of torque with rotation (i.e., a derivative) is calculated for each paired set of measurements by the torque rate differential calculator <b>636</b> (step <b>706</b>). Of course, at least two measurements are needed before a rate of change calculation can be made. In one embodiment, the smoothing algorithm <b>638</b> operates to smooth the derivative curve (e.g., by way of a running average). These three values (torque, rotation and rate of change of torque) may then be plotted by the plotter <b>632</b> for display on the output device <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">These three values (torque, rotation and rate of change of torque) are then compared by the comparator <b>642</b>, either continuously or at selected rotational positions, with predetermined values (step <b>708</b>). For example, the predetermined values may be minimum and maximum torque values and minimum and maximum turn values.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">Based on the comparison of measured/calculated values with predefined values, the process monitor <b>634</b> determines the occurrence of various events and whether to continue rotation or abort the makeup (<b>710</b>). In one embodiment, the thread engagement detection algorithm <b>644</b> monitors for thread engagement of the two threaded members (step <b>712</b>). Upon detection of thread engagement a first marker is stored (step <b>714</b>). The marker may be quantified, for example, by time, rotation, torque, a derivative of torque or time, or a combination of any such quantifications. During continued rotation, the seal detection algorithm <b>646</b> monitors for the seal condition (step <b>716</b>). This may be accomplished by comparing the calculated derivative (rate of change of torque) with a predetermined threshold seal condition value. A second marker indicating the seal condition is stored when the seal condition is detected (step <b>718</b>). At this point, the turns value and torque value at the seal condition may be evaluated by the connection evaluator <b>650</b> (step <b>720</b>). For example, a determination may be made as to whether the turns value and/or torque value are within specified limits. The specified limits may be predetermined, or based off of a value measured during makeup. If the connection evaluator <b>650</b> determines a bad connection (step <b>722</b>), rotation may be terminated. Otherwise rotation continues and the torque shoulder detection algorithm <b>648</b> monitors for shoulder condition (step <b>724</b>). This may be accomplished by comparing the calculated derivative (rate of change of torque) with a predetermined threshold shoulder condition value. When the shoulder condition is detected, a third marker indicating the shoulder condition is stored (step <b>726</b>). The connection evaluator <b>650</b> may then determine whether the turns value and torque value at the shoulder condition are acceptable (step <b>728</b>). In one embodiment the connection evaluator <b>650</b> determines whether the change in torque and rotation between these second and third markers are within a predetermined acceptable range. If the values, or the change in values, are not acceptable, the connection evaluator <b>650</b> indicates a bad connection (step <b>722</b>). If, however, the values/change are/is acceptable, the target calculator <b>652</b> calculates a target torque value and/or target turns value (step <b>730</b>). The target value is calculated by adding a predetermined delta value (torque or turns) to a measured reference value(s). The measured reference value may be the measured torque value or turns value corresponding to the detected shoulder condition. In one embodiment, a target torque value and a target turns value are calculated based off of the measured torque value and turns value, respectively, corresponding to the detected shoulder condition.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">The above-described torque-turns behavior can be generated using various measuring equipment in combination with a power drive unit used to couple tubing lengths. Examples of a power drive unit include a power tongs unit, typically hydraulically powered, and a top drive unit. According to aspects of the present invention, a power drive unit is operated in response to one or more parameters measured/detected during make-up of a pipe connection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6A</figref> are block diagrams of tubular make-up systems <b>600</b> and <b>600</b><i>a </i>according to embodiments of the invention. Generally, the tubular make-up systems <b>600</b> and <b>600</b><i>a </i>comprise power drive units <b>602</b> and <b>602</b><i>a</i>, power drive control systems <b>604</b> and <b>604</b><i>a</i>, and a computer system <b>606</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the power drive unit is a power tongs unit <b>602</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the power drive unit is a top drive unit <b>602</b><i>a</i>. The physical locations of the tie-ins between the top drive control system <b>604</b><i>a </i>and the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>are representative only and may be varied based on specific top drive configurations. The power drive unit may be any variety of apparatus capable of gripping and rotating a tubing length <b>102</b>, the lower end of which is threaded into a box <b>106</b> which, in turn, is threaded into the upper end of a tubing length <b>104</b>. The tubing length <b>104</b> represents the upper end of a pipe string extending into the bore hole of a well (not shown). Since the power tongs unit <b>602</b> may be an apparatus well-known in the industry, it is not shown in detail. The tubing lengths <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and box <b>106</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> but are shown in the figures illustrating more detail of the top drive <b>602</b><i>a</i>, discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055">In one embodiment, system inertia is taken into account and compensated for to prevent overshooting the target value. System inertia includes mechanical and/or electrical inertia and refers to the system's lag in coming to a complete stop after the dump signal is issued (at step <b>734</b>). As a result of such lag, the power drive unit continues rotating the tubing member even after the dump signal is issued. As such, if the dump signal is issued contemporaneously with the detection of the target value, the tubing may be rotated beyond the target value, resulting in an unacceptable connection. To ensure that rotation is terminated at the target value (after dissipation of any inherent system lag) a preemptive or predicative dump approach is employed. That is, the dump signal is issued prior to reaching the target value. The dump signal may be issued by calculating a lag contribution to rotation which occurs after the dump signal is issued. In one embodiment, the lag contribution may be calculated based on time, rotation, a combination of time and rotation, or other values. The lag contribution may be calculated dynamically based on current operating conditions such as RPMs, torque, coefficient of thread lubricant, etc. In addition, historical information may be taken into account. That is, the performance of a previous makeup(s) for a similar connection may be relied on to determine how the system will behave after issuing the dump signal. Persons skilled in the art will recognize other methods and techniques for predicting when the dump signal should be issued.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0056">In one embodiment, the sampler <b>640</b> continues to sample at least rotation to measure counter rotation which may occur as a connection relaxes (step <b>736</b>). When the connection is fully relaxed, the connection evaluator <b>650</b> determines whether the relaxation rotation is within acceptable predetermined limits (step <b>738</b>). If so, makeup is terminated. Otherwise, a bad connection is indicated (step <b>722</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057">In the previous embodiments turns and torque are monitored during makeup. However, it is contemplated that a connection during makeup may be characterized by either or both of theses values. In particular, one embodiment provides for detecting a shoulder condition, noting a measured turns value associated with the shoulder condition, and then adding a predefined turns value to the measured turns value to arrive at a target turns value. Alternatively or additionally, a measured torque value may be noted upon detecting a shoulder condition and then added to a predefined torque value to arrive at a target torque value. Accordingly, it should be emphasized that either or both a target torque value and target turns value may be calculated and used as the termination value at which makeup is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">However, in one aspect, basing the target value on a delta turns value provides advantages over basing the target value on a delta torque value. This is so because the measured torque value is a more indirect measurement requiring more inferences (e.g., regarding the length of the lever arm, angle between the lever arm and moment of force, etc.) relative to the measured turns value. As a result, prior art applications relying on torque values to characterize a connection between threaded members are significantly inferior to one embodiment of the present intention, which characterizes the connection according to rotation. For example, some prior art teaches applying a specified amount of torque after reaching a shoulder position, but only if the specified amount of torque is less than some predefined maximum, which is necessary for safety reasons. According to one embodiment of the present intention, a delta turns value can be used to calculate a target turns value without regard for a maximum turns value. Such an approach is made possible by the greater degree of confidence achieved by relying on rotation rather than torque.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">Whether a target value is based on torque, turns or a combination, the target values are not predefined, i.e., known in advance of determining that the shoulder condition has been reached. In contrast, the delta torque and delta turns values, which are added to the corresponding torque/turn value as measured when the shoulder condition is reached, are predetermined. In one embodiment, these predetermined values are empirically derived based on the geometry and characteristics of material (e.g., strength) of two threaded members being threaded together.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">In addition to geometry of the threaded members, various other variables and factors may be considered in deriving the predetermined values of torque and/or turns. For example, the lubricant and environmental conditions may influence the predetermined values. In one aspect, the present invention compensates for variables influenced by the manufacturing process of tubing and lubricant. Oilfield tubes are made in batches, heat treated to obtain the desired strength properties and then threaded. While any particular batch will have very similar properties, there is significant variation from batch to batch made to the same specification. The properties of thread lubricant similarly vary between batches. In one embodiment, this variation is compensated for by starting the makeup of a string using a starter set of determined parameters (either theoretical or derived from statistical analysis of previous batches) that is dynamically adapted using the information derived from each previous makeup in the string. Such an approach also fits well with the use of oilfield tubulars where the first connections made in a string usually have a less demanding environment than those made up at the end of the string, after the parameters have been ‘tuned’.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">According to embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a method and apparatus of characterizing a connection. Such characterization occurs at various stages during makeup to determine whether makeup should continue or be aborted. In one aspect, an advantage is achieved by utilizing the predefined delta values, which allow a consistent tightness to be achieved with confidence. This is so because, while the behavior of the torque-turns curve <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) prior to reaching the shoulder condition varies greatly between makeups, the behavior after reaching the shoulder condition exhibits little variation. As such, the shoulder condition provides a good reference point on which each torque-turns curve may be normalized. In particular, a slope of a reference curve portion may be derived and assigned a degree of tolerance/variance. During makeup of a particular connection, the behavior of the torque-turns curve for the particular connection may be evaluated with respect to the reference curve. Specifically, the behavior of that portion of the curve following detection of the shoulder condition can be evaluated to determine whether the slope of the curve portion is within the allowed tolerance/variance. If not, the connection is rejected and makeup is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">In addition, connection characterizations can be made following makeup. For example, in one embodiment the rotation differential between the second and third markers (seal condition and shoulder condition) is used to determine the bearing pressure on the connection seal, and therefore its leak resistance. Such determinations are facilitated by having measured or calculated variables following a connection makeup. Specifically, following a connection makeup actual torque and turns data is available. In addition, the actual geometry of the tubing and coefficient of friction of the lubricant are substantially known. As such, leak resistance, for example, can be readily determined according to methods known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">Persons skilled in the art will recognize other aspects of the invention which provide advantages in characterizing a connection.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">As noted above, the present invention has application to any variety of threaded members having a shoulder seal including: drill pipe, tubing/casing, risers, and tension members. In some cases, the type of threaded members being used presents unique problems not present when dealing with other types of threaded members. For example, a common problem when working with drill pipe is cyclic loading. Cyclic loading refers to the phenomenon of a changing stress at the interface between threaded members which occurs in response to, and as a function of, the frequency of pipe rotation during drilling. As a result of cyclic loading, an improperly made up drill string connection (e.g., the connection is to loose) could break during drilling. The likelihood of such problems is mitigated according to aspects of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0065">Upon continuing rotation, the target detector <b>654</b> monitors for the calculated target value(s) (step <b>732</b>). Once the target value is reached, rotation is terminated (step <b>734</b>). In the event both a target torque value and a target turns value are used for a given makeup, rotation may continue upon reaching the first target or until reaching the second target, so long as both values (torque and turns) stay within an acceptable range.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0078">One or more retaining members <b>240</b> may be employed to engage the casing <b>102</b>. As shown, the torque head <b>40</b> includes three retaining members <b>240</b> mounted in spaced apart relation about the housing <b>205</b>. Each retaining member <b>240</b> includes a jaw <b>245</b> disposed in a jaw carrier <b>242</b>. The jaw <b>245</b> is adapted and designed to move radially relative to the jaw carrier <b>242</b>. Particularly, a back portion of the jaw <b>245</b> is supported by the jaw carrier <b>242</b> as it moves radially in and out of the jaw carrier <b>242</b>. In this respect, an axial load acting on the jaw <b>245</b> may be transferred to the housing <b>205</b> via the jaw carrier <b>242</b>. Preferably, the contact portion of the jaw <b>245</b> defines an arcuate portion sharing a central axis with the casing <b>102</b>. It must be noted that the jaw carrier <b>242</b> may be formed as part of the housing <b>205</b> or attached to the housing <b>205</b> as part of the gripping member assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0079">Movement of the jaw <b>245</b> is accomplished by a piston <b>251</b> and cylinder <b>250</b> assembly. In one embodiment, the cylinder <b>250</b> is attached to the jaw carrier <b>242</b>, and the piston <b>251</b> is movably attached to the jaw <b>245</b>. Pressure supplied to the backside of the piston <b>251</b> causes the piston <b>251</b> to move the jaw <b>245</b> radially toward the central axis to engage the casing <b>102</b>. Conversely, fluid supplied to the front side of the piston <b>251</b> moves the jaw <b>245</b> away from the central axis. When the appropriate pressure is applied, the jaws <b>245</b> engage the casing <b>102</b>, thereby allowing the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>to move the casing <b>102</b> axially or rotationally.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0080">In one aspect, the piston <b>251</b> is pivotably connected to the jaw <b>245</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a pin connection <b>255</b> is used to connect the piston <b>251</b> to the jaw <b>245</b>. It is believed that a pivotable connection limits the transfer of an axial load on the jaw <b>245</b> to the piston <b>251</b>. Instead, the axial load is mostly transmitted to the jaw carrier <b>242</b> or the housing <b>205</b>. In this respect, the pivotable connection reduces the likelihood that the piston <b>251</b> may be bent or damaged by the axial load. It is understood that the piston <b>251</b> and cylinder <b>250</b> assembly may include any suitable fluid operated piston <b>251</b> and cylinder <b>250</b> assembly known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary piston and cylinder assemblies include a hydraulically operated piston and cylinder assembly and a pneumatically operated piston and cylinder assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0081">The jaws <b>245</b> may include one or more inserts <b>260</b> movably disposed thereon for engaging the casing <b>102</b>. The inserts <b>260</b>, or dies, include teeth formed on its surface to grippingly engage the casing <b>102</b> and transmit torque thereto. In one embodiment, the inserts <b>260</b> may be disposed in a recess <b>265</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. One or more biasing members <b>270</b> may be disposed below the inserts <b>260</b>. The biasing members <b>270</b> allow some relative movement between the casing <b>102</b> and the jaw <b>245</b>. When the casing <b>102</b> is released, the biasing member <b>270</b> moves the inserts <b>260</b> back to the original position. Optionally, the contact surface between the inserts <b>260</b> and the jaw recess <b>265</b> may be tapered. The tapered surface may be angled relative to the central axis of the casing <b>102</b>, thereby extending the insert <b>260</b> radially as it moves downward along the tapered surface.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0082">Additionally, the outer perimeter of the jaw <b>245</b> around the jaw recess <b>265</b> may aide the jaws <b>245</b> in supporting the load of the casing <b>102</b>. In this respect, the upper portion of the perimeter provides a shoulder <b>280</b> for engagement with the coupling <b>32</b> on the casing <b>102</b> as illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>. The axial load acting on the shoulder <b>280</b> may be transmitted from the jaw <b>245</b> to the housing <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083">A base plate <b>285</b> may be attached to a lower portion of the torque head <b>40</b>. A guide plate <b>290</b> may be selectively attached to the base plate <b>285</b> using a removable pin connection. The guide plate <b>290</b> has an incline edge <b>293</b> adapted and designed to guide the casing <b>102</b> into the housing <b>205</b>. The guide plate <b>290</b> may be quickly adjusted to accommodate tubulars of various sizes. In one embodiment, one or more pin holes <b>292</b> may be formed on the guide plate <b>290</b>, with each pin hole <b>292</b> representing a certain tubular size. To adjust the guide plate <b>290</b>, the pin <b>291</b> is removed and inserted into the designated pin hole <b>292</b>. In this manner, the guide plate <b>290</b> may be quickly adapted for use with different tubulars.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an elevator <b>70</b> operatively connected to the torque head <b>40</b> may be used to transport the casing <b>102</b> from a rack <b>25</b> or a pickup/lay down machine to the well center. The elevator <b>70</b> may include any suitable elevator known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The elevator defines a central opening to accommodate the casing <b>102</b>. Bails <b>85</b> may be used to interconnect the elevator <b>70</b> to the torque head <b>40</b>. Preferably, the bails <b>85</b> are pivotable relative to the torque head <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>has been lowered to a position proximate the rig floor <b>20</b>, and the elevator <b>70</b> has been closed around the casing <b>102</b> resting on the rack <b>25</b>. In this position, the casing <b>102</b> is ready to be hoisted by the top drive <b>602</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0085">The casing string <b>104</b>, which was previously drilled into the formation (not shown) to form the wellbore (not shown), is shown disposed within the hole <b>55</b> in the rig floor <b>20</b>. The casing string <b>104</b> may include one or more joints or sections of casing threadedly connected to one another. The casing string <b>104</b> is shown engaged by the spider <b>60</b>. The spider <b>60</b> supports the casing string <b>104</b> in the wellbore and prevents the axial and rotational movement of the casing string <b>104</b> relative to the rig floor <b>20</b>. As shown, a threaded connection of the casing string <b>104</b>, or the box, is accessible from the rig floor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0086">The top drive <b>602</b><i>a</i>, the torque head <b>40</b>, and the elevator <b>70</b> are shown positioned proximate the rig floor <b>20</b>. The casing <b>102</b> may initially be disposed on the rack <b>25</b>, which may include a pick up/lay down machine. The elevator <b>70</b> is shown engaging an upper portion of the casing <b>102</b> and ready to be hoisted by the cables <b>75</b> suspending the traveling block <b>35</b>. The lower portion of the casing <b>102</b> includes a threaded connection, or the pin, which may mate with the box of the casing string <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0087">Next, the torque head <b>40</b> is lowered relative to the casing <b>102</b> and positioned around the upper portion of the casing <b>102</b>. The guide plate <b>290</b> facilitates the positioning of the casing <b>102</b> within the housing <b>205</b>. Thereafter, the jaws <b>245</b> of the torque head <b>40</b> are actuated to engage the casing <b>102</b>. Particularly, fluid is supplied to the piston <b>251</b> and cylinder <b>250</b> assembly to extend the jaws <b>245</b> radially into contact with the casing <b>102</b>. The biasing member <b>270</b> allows the inserts <b>260</b> and the casing <b>102</b> to move axially relative to the jaws <b>245</b>. As a result, the coupling <b>32</b> seats above the shoulder <b>280</b> of the jaw <b>245</b>. The axial load on the jaw <b>245</b> is then transmitted to the housing <b>205</b> through the jaw carrier <b>242</b>. Because of the pivotable connection with the jaw <b>245</b>, the piston <b>251</b> is protected from damage that may be cause by the axial load. After the torque head <b>40</b> engages the casing <b>102</b>, the casing <b>102</b> is longitudinally and rotationally fixed with respect to the torque head <b>40</b>. Optionally, a fill-up/circulating tool disposed in the torque head <b>40</b> may be inserted into the casing <b>102</b> to circulate fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0088">In this position, the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>may now be employed to complete the make up of the threaded connection. To this end, the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>may apply the necessary torque to rotate the casing <b>102</b> to complete the make up process. Initially, the torque is imparted to the torque head <b>40</b>. The torque is then transferred from the torque head <b>40</b> to the jaws <b>245</b>, thereby rotating the casing <b>102</b> relative to the casing string <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0089">After the casing <b>102</b> and the casing string <b>104</b> are connected, the drilling with casing operation may begin. Initially, the spider <b>60</b> is released from engagement with the casing string <b>104</b>, thereby allowing the new casing string <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to move axially or rotationally in the wellbore. After the release, the casing string <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> is supported by the top drive <b>602</b><i>a</i>. The drill bit disposed at the lower end of the casing string <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> is urged into the formation and rotated by the top drive <b>602</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0090">When additional casings are necessary, the top drive <b>602</b><i>a </i>is deactuated to temporarily stop drilling. Then, the spider <b>60</b> is actuated again to engage and support the casing string <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in the wellbore. Thereafter, the torque head <b>40</b> releases the casing <b>102</b> and is raised by the traveling block <b>35</b>. Additional strings of casing may now be added to the casing string using the same process as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0091">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p>
