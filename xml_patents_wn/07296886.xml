<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A recording apparatus has a recording head, a platen, and a first hole. The recording head includes a dot formation element array, and the platen holds a recording medium opposite the recording head. The first hole is disposed in an area of the platen opposite a downstream portion of the dot formation element array and guides ink discarded outside an end of the recording medium when the end is printed without a margin. Alternatively or additionally, a second hole is formed in an area of the platen opposite an upstream portion of the dot formation element array, and the platen guides ink, which is discarded outside an end of the recording medium when the end is printed without a margin, to the second hole.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ink-jet recording apparatus, and more particularly, to an ink-jet recording apparatus having the function of recording without leaving blank space on at least one of the areas above, below, and on either side of a recording medium, as well as to a recording method for use with the apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An example structure of a presently-known platen of an ink-jet recording apparatus will now be described. The ink-jet recording head has a dot formation element array (hereinafter referred to as a “nozzle array”) in which a plurality of dot formation elements (hereinafter referred to as “nozzles”) are arranged in a secondary scanning direction. A platen is provided opposite the recording head and functions to hold recording paper in position during a recording operation performed by a printer. A plurality of ribs are provided on the surface of the platen at given intervals in the primary scanning direction. Flat surfaces of the ribs support the recording paper, thus holding the recording paper in position relative to the recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a normal printing operation of the ink-jet recording apparatus, data are printed while the top and bottom margins of the recording paper are maintained blank. However, on some occasions, data are printed from the top end of the recording paper without leaving a margin. In a case where data are printed without leaving_ a margin (hereinafter often called “margin-free printing”), a presently-known platen structure cannot prevent the ink squirted outside the top end of the recording paper (hereinafter referred to as “discarded ink”) from adhering to the surface of the platen. The ink which has adhered to the platen adheres to another sheet of recording paper, thus making a stain on the other sheet of recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To prevent occurrence of such a stain, there has already been proposed a printer in which a large hole is formed in the surface of the platen so as to extend over the entire area of the surface opposite the nozzle array of the recording head. The discarded ink is received by the large hole, thus preventing adherence of the discarded ink to the platen. However, presence of the large hole makes the leading edge of recording paper supplied by a paper feed roller (which may also be called a roller for feeding the recording medium) likely to collide with the wall of the large hole. In the event of such a collision, a so-called paper jam is likely to arise at this location. Further, the presence of a large hole results in the platen encountering difficulty in firmly supporting recording paper in a position opposite the nozzle array, thereby resulting in a change in the distance between the recording head and the recording paper. Consequently, print quality is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These problems arise even in a case where data are printed without leaving an end margin on recording paper. Problems resulting from data being printed without leaving an end margin are in principle the same as those arising in a case where data are printed from a top end of recording paper without leaving a margin, and hence repeated explanations of the problems are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 169155/1996 describes a printer as an example ink-jet recording apparatus of the background art capable of printing data on a recording material without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to enable printing which eliminates a margin on either side of the recording medium, an ink-jet recording head of this printer is arranged so that the primary scanning range can be set to extend outside either side of the recording medium. Further, the printer is equipped with ink recovery means for recovering ink droplets squirted from the recording head at positions outside either side of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above-described printer is a printer specifically designed for use in printing in which the printing medium ultimately assumes solid form; for example, solid and compact coating of a recording medium, such as a tape. The problems solved by the printer are elimination of non-coated areas from a tape during a solid coating process and staining of a recording medium to be transported, which would otherwise be caused when the ink droplets squirted during the solid coating process adhere to a guide member or a like member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the following technical demands are not taken into consideration in the design of this printer: a demand for enabling easy and reliable printing of an image of a certain photographic image data set on paper while leaving a margin on either side of the paper, and printing of the photographic image on paper of the same size while leaving a margin on either side of the paper (hereinafter often called a “lateral-margin-free printing”); and a demand for sufficiently reducing the portion of image data, which would be located outside either side edge of the paper and discarded when the image data are printed without leaving a margin on either side of the paper, to thereby effectively print the image data so as to minimize wastage of image data during lateral-margin-free printing. Lateral-margin-free printing of text data must inevitably be avoided. However, the printer of the background art fails to refer to or even suggest lateral-margin-free printing of text data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The ink recovery means of the background art can recover the ink droplets squirted outside the edges of paper. However, the ink recovery means is not designed in consideration of preventing minute staining of paper edges, which would otherwise be caused by airborne ink mist stemming from discarded ink droplets. The airborne ink mist arises during the course of squirting of ink droplets. Hence, in a case where ink droplets are squirted over a long distance, airborne ink mist is likely to arise. Further, in a case where paper is carried while being laid on a mesh screen or a like component, a portion of ink collides with not perforations of the mesh screen but with the framework of the mesh screen, also causing airborne ink mist. An ink-jet recording apparatus capable of effecting printing of photographic quality is highly susceptible to influence of deterioration of print quality stemming from airborne ink mist.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the present invention is aimed at providing an ink-jet recording apparatus which records data on a recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end, a margin on the bottom end, or a margin on either side edge and without involvement of staining of the recording medium, which would otherwise be caused by discarded ink; which firmly supports the recording medium; which holds the recording medium in position during a recording operation; and which prevents deterioration of recording quality, as well as a recording method for use with the ink-jet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is also aimed at providing an ink-jet recording apparatus which can readily and unfailingly record a certain photographic image data set on paper while leaving a margin on either side of the paper and which can readily and unfailingly record the image data set on paper of the same size without leaving a margin on either side of the paper; and which sufficiently reduces a portion of the image data set, which would be formed outside either side of the paper when the image data are recorded without leaving a margin on either side of the paper, to thereby minimize wastage of image data and enable effective recording of image data even at the time of recording of image data without leaving a margin, as well as a recording method for use with the ink-jet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is further aimed at providing an ink-jet recording apparatus capable of diminishing the chance of occurrence of airborne ink mist and the chance of side portions of a recording medium being stained by airborne floating mist; in other words, capable of maintaining photograph-quality printing even in the side portions of the recording medium, and diminishing the chance of deterioration of print quality.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is further aimed at providing an ink-jet recording apparatus capable of simultaneously fulfilling the features of the ink-jet recording apparatus and those of recording methods, as described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To achieve the objects, the present invention provides an ink-jet recording apparatus comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a recording head having a dot formation element array including a plurality of dot formation elements arranged along a secondary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">a platen for holding a recording medium in position opposite the recording head during a printing operation while the recording head is caused to scan in a primary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">a recording-medium feed roller disposed upstream of the recording head;</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">an output roller disposed downstream of the recording head; and</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">a first hole which is formed in an area of the platen opposite a downstream portion of the dot formation element array with respect to the secondary scanning direction, the platen guiding to the first hole the ink that has been discarded outside a top end of the recording medium when data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present invention, the first hole is not formed over the <b>25</b> entire surface of the platen but locally at a position corresponding to the top end of a recording material when data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end. A positioning-function section for holding the recording material in position is left in the area on the surface of the platen opposite the recording head. When data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium, the ink squirted outside the top end is guided to the first hole. The recording material is firmly held in position relative to the recording head. In a case where data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium, the chance of the recording material being stained with the thus-discarded ink is significantly lowered. During a printing operation, the recording material is firmly held in position, thus preventing a decrease in quality.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention further provides an ink-jet recording apparatus comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">a recording head having a dot formation element array including a plurality of dot formation elements arranged along a secondary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">a platen for holding a recording medium in position opposite the recording head during a printing operation while the recording head is caused to scan in a primary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">a recording-medium feed roller disposed upstream of the recording head;</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">an output roller disposed downstream of the recording head; and</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">a second hole which is formed in an area of the platen opposite an upstream portion of the dot formation element array with respect to the secondary scanning direction, the platen guiding to the second hole the ink that has been discarded outside a top end of the recording medium when data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present invention, the second hole is not formed over the entire surface of the platen but locally at a position corresponding to the top end of a recording material when data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end. A positioning-function section for holding the recording material in position is left in the area on the surface of the platen opposite the recording head. When data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium, the ink squirted outside the top end is guided to the second hole. The recording material is firmly held in position relative to the recording head. In a case where data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium, the chance of the recording material being stained with the thus-discarded ink. During a printing operation, the recording material is firmly held in position, thus preventing a decrease in quality.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, a second hole is formed in an area of the platen opposite an upstream portion of the dot formation element array with respect to the secondary scanning direction, and there is guided to the second hole the ink that has been discarded outside a top end of the recording medium when data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As a result, in a case where data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end and bottom end of the recording medium, the chance of the recording material being stained with the thus-discarded ink. During a printing operation, the recording material is firmly held in position, thus preventing a decrease in quality.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, the recording head is arranged so as to be able to selectively perform a standard interlaced recording operation for recording data by actuation of all the dot formation elements of the dot formation element array, and a limited interlaced recording operation for limitedly actuating a portion of the dot formation elements, through use of a dot drive control section, and the limited interlaced recording operation is performed when the top end of the recording medium is situated at the first hole and when the bottom end of the recording medium is situated at the second hole.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a case where data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the top end and bottom end of the recording medium, the limited interlaced recording operation is performed, thereby reducing the amount of ink to be discarded and the amount of image data to be discarded along with wastage of the ink. Therefore, the extent of paper cockle arising in the top or bottom end can be diminished. In the areas of the recording material other than the top end and bottom end thereof, an interlaced recording operation is performed. Consequently, high-quality recording can be effected without involvement of a reduction in throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, in the area of the surface of the platen opposite the dot formation array, there are located flat tops which come into contact with the recording medium and support the recording medium from below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a result, the recording material can be stably, securely held in position relative to the recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, in a downstream position outside the area of the surface of the platen opposite the dot formation array, there are located flat tops which come into contact with the recording medium and support the recording medium from below. As a result, even if ink erroneously adheres to the portion of the surface of the platen opposite the dot formation element array while data are recorded on the recording material though us of all the dot formation elements, the recording material is prevented from being sustained with the ink until output. Further, the distance between the recording material feed roller and the flat top can be set to a large value, thereby rendering the load of transporting a recording material lighter, thereby particularly improving the ability of the paper feed roller to feed thick paper.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, an ink-absorbing material is provided within each of the first and second holes. The ink absorbing material enables stable storage of discarded ink without involvement of leakage and can be easily replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, a water repellent net is provided so as to cover an opening of each of the first and second holes, and ink-absorbing material is provided in each hole so as to be in contact with the hole. Since the opening of the first and second holes are covered with nets, the recording material is transported as if the first and second holes had not been formed in the platen, thereby firmly holding the recording material in position. Further, the discarded ink droplets collide with and adhere to the nets. However, the nets have a property of repelling water, and hence the ink that has adhered to the nets is immediately absorbed by the ink-absorbing member, thus substantially eliminating residual ink from the surface of the platen which is to contact the recording material. Accordingly, the recording material is held firmly in position, thereby substantially eliminating the chance of the discarded ink re-adhering to the recording material.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, a reclosable closure is attached to the opening of each of the first and second holes, and the closure is opened when data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on either the top or bottom end of the recording medium, the closure being closed when data are recorded on the recording medium while leaving a margin. When an image is recorded on the recording paper without leaving a margin on either the top end or the bottom end, the first hole or the second hole is opened by the closure. During a printing operation other than a margin-free printing operation, the closures are held in a closed position, thus preventing functional wastage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the closure has a pivot located below the opening of the corresponding hole and is pivotally opened or closed by being pivoted around the pivot. The configuration of the recording apparatus obviates a necessity for providing, in the travel path of the recording material, a mechanism for opening and closing the closures. Accordingly, there can be prevented an increase in the likelihood of a paper jam, which would otherwise be caused when a new member is provided in the recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the present invention provides a recording method for recording data on a recording medium without leaving a margin through use of an ink-jet recording apparatus, the apparatus including:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">a recording head having a dot formation element array including a plurality of dot formation elements arranged along a secondary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">a platen which holds a recording medium in position opposite the recording head during a printing operation while the recording head is caused to scan in a primary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">a recording-medium feed roller disposed upstream of the recording head; and</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">an output roller disposed downstream of the recording head, wherein</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">ink is squirted while the end portion of the recording medium is situated within the range of the dot formation element array in the secondary scanning direction, and a portion of the ink is discarded into a hole locally formed in the area of the surface of the platen opposite the end portion of the recording medium situated thereat, to thereby record data on the recording medium without leaving a margin on the edge of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a case where data are recorded on the recording material without leaving a margin on the top end of the recording material, the recording method prevents a reduction in print throughput, the chance of recording material being sustained with discarded ink, and a reduction in recording quality by firmly holding the recording material in position during a recording operation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Preferably, the recording head performs an interlaced recording operation for actuating one of the dot formation elements located at a position close to the end portion of all the dot formation elements when data are recorded on the end portion of the recording medium without leaving a margin, or an interlaced recording operation for recording data on the recording medium by actuation of all dot formation elements when the data are recorded in a record region other than the end portion. Therefore, there is yielded the same advantage as that yielded by the recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the present invention provides an ink-jet recording apparatus comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">an ink-jet recording head on which a plurality of dot formation elements are arranged along a secondary scanning direction and which is reciprocally moved in a primary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">a platen which is disposed opposite the recording head and holds a recording medium in position by supporting the recording medium from below when data are recorded, by means of the recording head, on the recording medium to be intermittently transported in the secondary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">a control section for controlling, on the basis of recorded data, intermittent transportation of the recording medium in the secondary scanning direction, reciprocal movement of the recording head in the primary scanning direction, and the squirting of ink from the recording head;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">ink-receiver open holes which are formed in the areas of the platen corresponding to the right and left sides of one type of recording medium of predetermined size or the right and left sides of two or more types of recording media of predetermined sizes, from among the recording media to be transported over the platen in the secondary scanning direction, the holes being formed so as to extend beyond the respective right and left sides of the employed recording medium and formed to longitudinally extend beyond the range of the dot formation elements in the secondary scanning direction; and</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">the control section having
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0055">a first operation mode in which a recording operation is performed by means of expanding recorded data within a record region inside the right and left sides of the employed recording medium of predetermined size, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0056">a second operation mode in which a recording operation is performed by means of expanding the recorded data of the same within a record region outside either side of the employed recording medium of the same size and inside an outer edge of the ink-receiver open hole, wherein</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">in a case where data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, the second operation mode is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">The control section has two operation modes; i.e., a first operation mode and a second operation mode. In the first operation mode, the control section expands recorded data and records the data in a recording region set inside either side of the recording medium of any of predetermined sizes. In a second operation mode, the control section expands the same recorded data and records the data within a record region which extends beyond either side of the recording medium of the same size and is positioned inside a non-reference-side edge of the recording medium within the corresponding one of the through holes. In the first operation mode, a certain photographic image data set can be normally recorded on the recording material of a single size while a margin is left on either side thereof. In the second operation mode, the image data set can be recorded on the recording material without a margin being left on either side thereof. In other words, since the control section is provided with the first and second operation modes, a certain photographic image data set can be readily and unfailingly recorded on the recording medium of a single size with or without a margin being left on either side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Further, since the control section is determined to operate according to either the first or second operation mode for the recording medium of a predetermined size, the second mode can be readily set such that the amount of image data to be produced and wasted outside either side of the recording medium is sufficiently reduced. Accordingly, image data can be effectively recorded without a margin being left, by means of minimizing wastage of image data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">The present invention further provides an ink-jet recording apparatus comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">an ink-jet recording head on which a plurality of dot formation elements are arranged along a secondary scanning direction and which is reciprocally moved in a primary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">a platen which is disposed opposite the recording head, has a flat upper surface on which a plurality of protuberances protruding the same distance are formed at predetermined intervals in the primary scanning direction, and holds the recording medium in position by supporting the recording medium from below through use of flat tops of the plurality of protuberances when data are recorded, by means of the recording head, on the recording medium to be intermittently transported in the secondary scanning direction;</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">a control section for controlling, on the basis of recorded data, intermittent transportation of the recording medium in the secondary scanning direction, reciprocal movement of the recording head in the primary scanning direction, and the squirting of ink from the recording head;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">ink-receiver open holes which are formed in the flat areas of the upper surface of the platen in which the protuberances are not formed, as well as in the areas of the upper surface of the platen corresponding to the right and left sides of one type of recording medium of predetermined size or the right and left sides of two or more types of recording media of predetermined sizes, from among the recording media to be transported over the platen in the secondary scanning direction, the holes being formed so as to extend beyond the respective right and left sides of the respective recording media and formed to longitudinally extend beyond the range of the dot formation elements in the secondary scanning direction; and</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">the control section having
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0066">a first operation mode in which a recording operation is performed by means of expanding recorded data within a record region inside the right and left sides of the employed recording medium of predetermined size, and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0067">a second operation mode in which a recording operation is performed by means of expanding the recorded data of the same within a record region outside either side of the employed recording medium of the same size and inside an outer edge of the ink-receiver open hole, wherein</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">in a case where data are recorded on the recording medium without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, the second operation mode is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Protuberances protruding by the same distance are formed at predetermined intervals in the primary scanning direction and in an upper surface of the platen. When the recording head records image data on the recording medium while the recording medium is intermittently transported in the secondary scanning direction, the platen supports the recording medium from below, to thereby hold the recording medium in position relative to the recording head. The protuberances enable regular generation of paper cockle, which is usually caused when the recording medium is soaked with ink, thereby rendering stable the position of the recording medium in its widthwise direction. Therefore, setting of the record region for the second operation mode does not involve a necessity for taking into consideration a large positional offset of the recording paper attributable to paper cockle. Accordingly, the recording region for the second operation mode can be made small, thus enabling a further reduction in the amount of image data to be wasted during a margin-free recording operation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">Preferably, the recording region for the second mode is set to be wider than the width of the recording medium by 4.5 mm to 5.5 mm. By virtue of such an allowance, image data can be recorded on the recording medium without a margin being left on either side thereof and without being substantially influenced by a tolerance stemming from the design or manufacture of a path for transporting the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">Preferably, in both the first and second operation modes, the control section assumes, as a speed at which the recording head reciprocally travels in the primary scanning direction, a single acceleration gradient at which the recording head is to shift from a stationary state to a constant-speed state and a single deceleration gradient at which the recording head is to shift from the constant-speed state to the stationary state, and a travel distance attained by the recording head of the second operation mode in the constant-speed state is longer than a travel distance attained by the recording head of the first operation mode in the constant-speed state, and travel distance in an acceleration side and travel distance in a deceleration side are substantially equal. At the time of implementation of the first and second operation modes, the control required for reciprocally moving the recording head in the primary scanning direction can be facilitated. Recording throughput can be optimized in both the first and second operation modes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">Preferably, an ink-absorbing material is provided in each of the ink-receiver open holes, and the ink-absorbing material is situated within corresponding ink-receiver open hole such that the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material is located in the vicinity of the opening of the through hole opposite the recording head. Accordingly, the distance over which the ink droplets are squirted and wasted outside either side of the recording medium can be shortened. Further, the ink-absorbing material, which is disposed in each of the through holes such that the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material is situated in the vicinity of the opening opposite the recording head, immediately captures the ink droplets, thus significantly reducing the chance of occurrence of airborne ink mist.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">Preferably, an ink-absorbing material is provided in each of the ink-receiver open holes, and the ink-absorbing material is situated within corresponding ink-receiver open hole such that the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material is located in the vicinity of the opening of the through hole opposite the recording head. As a result, there is yielded the same advantage as that mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">Preferably, a first removal stopper is provided along the edge of the opening of each of the ink-receiver open holes disposed opposite the recording head, for preventing removal of the ink-absorbing material toward the recording head. Since the upper surface of the ink absorbing material is firmly retained in position, generation of airborne ink mist can be stably prevented. Further, the chance of the upper surface of the ink absorbing material rubbing against the recording material being transported or the chance of the upper surface of the ink absorbing material rubbing against the recording material because of paper cockle can be reduced thoroughly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">Preferably, the first removal stopper is formed into a step provided along the edge of the opening of each of the ink-receiver open holes disposed opposite the recording head. Thus, the first removal stoppers can be readily formed integrally with the platen, and the thus-formed removal stops can exert a removal effect by means of a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">Preferably, each of the ink-receiver open holes penetrates through the platen from the side opposite the recording head to the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">The through-hole structure enables insertion of the ink-absorbing material into each of the ink receiver open holes by means of pushing only the ink-absorbing material, thus facilitating assembly of ink receiver open holes with ink absorbing material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">Preferably, second removal stoppers are provided in each of the ink-receiver open hole for preventing removal of the ink-absorbing material away from the recording head. The second removal stoppers unfailingly prevent removal of the ink-absorbing material in the direction opposite the recording head. In cooperation with the first removal stoppers, the second removal stoppers can securely hold the ink-absorbing material within the through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">Preferably, the second removal stoppers are formed into raised long lines extending along the interior surface of the ink-receiver open hole in the direction of penetration. The second removal stoppers are formed in raised lines on the interior surface of each of the through holes, the lines aligned in the longitudinal direction thereof. Such a structure of the second removal stopper enables insertion of the ink-absorbing material into each of the through holes by means of pushing only the ink-absorbing material. Further, the second removal stoppers can be readily formed integrally with the through holes and can be readily formed integrally with the through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">Preferably, the second removal stoppers are each formed into a step provided along the edge of corresponding opening of the ink-receiver open hole disposed opposite the recording head. The step-shaped removal stoppers unfailingly prevent removal of the ink-absorbing material through employment of a simple structure and can be readily formed integrally with the through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">Preferably, a tilt section is provided in each of the ink-receiver open holes at an angle from the recording head to the other side so as to maintain the through state of the through hole, and an ink-absorbing material is laid on the tilt section. When image data are recorded on a recording medium without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, the ink which has been squirted from the recording head outside either side of the recording medium directly enters any of the through holes having openings, each opening longitudinally extending beyond the range of the recording head within which range nozzles are arranged. The ink then immediately adheres to the ink-absorbing material laid on the tilt section provided in any of the through holes. Accordingly, the chance of occurrence of airborne ink mist can be substantially obviated. Even when an ink-jet recording apparatus performs photographic-quality printing which does not involve leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, there arises substantially no decrease in print quality of the lateral side areas of the recording medium. When the ink which has adhered to the ink-absorbing material accumulates to a certain level, the ink flows over the surface of the tilt section and is drained from the through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">Preferably, each of the ink-receiver open holes is formed in the form of a through hole, and a tilt section is provided in the through hole at an angle from the recording head to the other side so as to maintain the through state of the through hole, a plurality of ribs being provided on the tilt section at intervals such that holes are formed in the tilting direction, and top surfaces of the ribs being formed so as to be lower than the opening of the through hole. As in the case of the platen mentioned above, when image data are recorded on a recording medium without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, the ink which has been squirted from the recording head outside either side of the recording medium directly enters any of the through holes having openings, each opening longitudinally extending beyond the nozzle range of the recording head. The ink is then guided to the bottom of the holes by the plurality of walls located below the opening of each of the through holes. The walls exhibit an ink-capturing function, as does the ink-absorbing material, thereby substantially obviating the chance of occurrence of airborne ink mist. Even when an ink-jet recording apparatus performs photographic-quality printing which does not involve leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, there arises substantially no decrease in print quality of the lateral side areas of the recording medium. When the ink which has adhered to the bottom of the holes accumulates to a certain level, the ink flows over the surface of the tilt section and is drained from the through holes.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Recording without Leaving Top and Bottom Margins</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0186">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described by reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an ink-jet recording apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention; that is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the principal section of the recording apparatus when data are recorded on recording paper without leaving a margin on the top end of the paper. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the principal section of the ink-jet recording apparatus when data are recorded on the recording paper without leaving a margin on the bottom end of the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0187">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the present embodiment, a first hole <b>11</b> is formed in a portion of the surface of a platen <b>3</b> opposite a downstream-side portion of a nozzle array <b>2</b> in a secondary-scanning direction. When data are recorded on recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on a top end <b>7</b> of the paper <b>4</b>, the first hole <b>11</b> functions to receive all ink droplets <b>12</b> squirted outside the top end <b>7</b> of the paper <b>4</b> (hereinafter often called “discarded ink droplets <b>12</b>”). The first hole <b>11</b> is formed to assume an elongated shape and to extend continuously over the widthwise direction of paper (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> to be described later) or is partially partitioned.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0188">In the present embodiment, the first hole <b>11</b> is formed not over the entire surface of the platen <b>3</b> but locally so as to correspond to the top end <b>7</b> when data are recorded on the top end <b>7</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin. A positioning-function section for holding the recording paper <b>4</b> in position during a recording operation is left in the area on the platen <b>3</b> opposite a recording head <b>1</b>; namely, ribs <b>5</b> and their flat tops <b>6</b> are formed within a range on the platen <b>3</b> opposite the nozzle array <b>2</b>. When data are recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on the top end <b>7</b>, the ink droplets <b>12</b> which have been squirted outside the top end <b>7</b> and become discarded are introduced into the first hole <b>11</b>. Even in such a case, the recording paper <b>4</b> is firmly held in position on the flat tops <b>6</b> of the ribs <b>5</b>. Accordingly, the recording paper <b>4</b> can be stably held in position relative to the recording head <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0189">A second hole <b>13</b> is formed in the portion of the surface of the platen <b>3</b> opposite an upstream portion of the nozzle array <b>2</b> in the secondary scanning direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second hole <b>13</b> is formed so as to guide the discarded ink droplets <b>12</b> which have been squirted outside a bottom end <b>14</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b>. The second hole <b>14</b> performs the same function as that performed by the first hole <b>11</b>. In the drawing, reference numeral <b>8</b> designates a paper feed roller, and <b>9</b> designates a paper output roller. Both the paper feed roller <b>8</b> and the paper output roller <b>9</b> are presently known.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0190">The present embodiment employs the platen <b>3</b> having the first hole <b>11</b> and the second hole <b>13</b>. However, there may also be employed a platen having only one of the holes. Division of the area of the platen <b>3</b> is determined on the basis of the nature of a presumed recording method.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show that the flat top <b>6</b> of the rib <b>5</b> is situated in the range of the platen <b>3</b> opposite the nozzle array <b>2</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the rib <b>5</b> may be constructed such that the flat top <b>6</b> is situated outside the range of the platen <b>3</b> opposite the nozzle array <b>2</b> and in a downstream position in the secondary scanning direction. Even if ink accidentally adheres to the surface of the platen <b>3</b> opposite the nozzle array <b>2</b> while data are being recorded through use of all nozzles, such a structure of the platen <b>3</b> prevents staining of the recording paper <b>4</b> being printed until the paper <b>4</b> is output. Since the distance between the paper feed roller <b>8</b> and the flat top <b>6</b> can be set long, the paper feed roller <b>8</b> is subjected to a light load when feeding the recording paper <b>4</b>, thereby particularly improving the ability of the paper feed roller <b>8</b> to feed thick paper.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0192">A nozzle drive control section <b>23</b> (shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and omitted from the other drawings) for driving the nozzle array <b>2</b> of the recording head <b>1</b> is arranged so as to switchably perform an interlaced recording operation described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,844,585 entitled “Apparatus and Method for Printing High-Quality Color Image at High Speed,” or a limited interlaced recording operation described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 71009/1997 and 291506/1999, in which only some of the nozzles are limitedly actuated in order to minimize a margin left on the top end or the bottom end of recording paper. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b>, when printing at the top end <b>7</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b>, the nozzle drive control section <b>23</b> drives only a portion <b>18</b> of the nozzle array <b>2</b> located at the end in the direction in which paper is to be output (i.e., the downstream end with respect to the paper feed direction), thereby squirting ink to only the top end <b>7</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b>. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>6</b>, when printing at the bottom end <b>14</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b>, the nozzle drive control section <b>23</b> drives only a portion <b>19</b> of the nozzle array <b>2</b>, to thereby squirt ink to only the bottom end <b>14</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0193">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the recording head <b>1</b> is arranged so as to be able to switchably perform a standard interlaced recording operation—in which the dot drive control section <b>23</b> drives all the nozzles of the nozzle array <b>2</b>, to thereby perform a recording operation—and a limited interlaced recording—in which only portions of the nozzles are limitedly driven, to thereby perform a recording operation. There will now be described the manner in which the recording head <b>1</b> performs the limited interlaced recording operation when the top end <b>7</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b> is situated at the first hole <b>11</b> and when the bottom end <b>14</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b> is situated at the second hole <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a schematic representation showing the positions of the nozzles in the secondary scanning direction at the time of the primary scanning operation. The vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> corresponds to the secondary scanning direction. In order to avoid complication of illustration, in representation of the respective primary scanning operations, nozzle positions are sequentially shifted rightward in the drawing. For the sake of clarity, the nozzle array <b>2</b> and the hole formed in the platen <b>3</b> for receiving wasted ink are also illustrated in the drawing. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, reference symbol P<b>1</b> designates a first primary scanning operation, and P<b>2</b> designates a second primary scanning operation. Encircled numerals indicate the positions of the nozzles with respect to the secondary scanning direction during a primary scanning operation. Of these encircled numerals, numerals encircled by a thick circle designate locations at which dots are to be formed, and numerals encircled by a thin circle designate locations at which dots are not to be formed. Values provided in a columnar form on the left-side portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> designate raster numbers (RNs) assigned to respective rasters for convenience. As will be described later, a raster number 0 (RN=0) is assigned to the lowest raster in use while an image is recorded by the recording method of the present invention while the paper feed accuracy during the secondary scanning operation is ensured. Rasters lower than the lowest raster are assigned positive numerals, whereas rasters higher than the lowest raster are assigned negative numerals. Numerals expressed with L (L=) depict, as the number of rasters, a paper feed per of the feed roller <b>8</b> during a secondary scanning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0195">When execution of a standard print processing routine is commenced, dot formation data are set, and dots are formed while a primary scanning operation is performed. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, a nozzle pitch corresponds to four rasters. The dot formation data are formed by sequential extraction of image data from the top of the previously-input image data every four rasters with respect to the primary scanning direction. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, during the primary scanning operation P<b>1</b>, dots are formed every four rasters in a region whose lower edge is at raster number −28 (an area of RN≦−28).</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0196">The paper feed motor <b>23</b> is driven, to thereby perform a secondary scanning operation. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, paper is fed by the amount corresponding to seven rasters, whereupon the recording head <b>1</b> is moved to position P<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. Of various feeds which enable recording of an image without involvement of lack of rasters stemming from an interlacing operation, the paper feed is set so as to enable the most effective use of nozzles. A paper feed can be defined in accordance with a nozzle pitch, the number of nozzles, and the number of repetitions of scanning. A method of setting a paper feed is publicly known, and hence its explanation is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">After completion of the secondary scanning operation, dots are formed in the area designated by the primary scanning operation P<b>2</b>; i.e., the area whose lower edge is at raster number −21. Through repetition of these processing operations, rasters are intermittently formed, thus enabling recording of an image. As is evident from, for example, FIG. <b>43</b>, an image in the area defined between raster number −34 and −25 is completed after the primary scanning operations P<b>1</b> through P<b>4</b> have been performed. These operations are repeatedly performed until formation of an image is completed. In the present embodiment, as will be described later, the standard print processing operation is followed by execution of a printing operation of another print mode. Therefore, completion of formation of an image does not mean completion of printing of the entire input image data, but means completion of formation of an image on the basis of the standard print processing routine.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198">After formation of an image through standard print processing has been completed, printing of an image is performed by means of an intermediate processing operation. The flow of formation of dots performed during an intermediate processing operation is the same as that employed in the standard print processing routine. In the intermediate processing, the paper feed required for the secondary scanning operation differs from that required for the standard printing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">In contrast with a standard print processing operation in which paper is fed by the amount corresponding to seven rasters, paper is fed by the amount corresponding to four rasters during an intermediate processing operation, thus forming a raster (designated by the primary scanning operation P<b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>). The significance of four rasters will be described later. Next, paper is fed by the amount corresponding to three rasters, thus forming rasters (designated by the primary scanning operations P<b>6</b> through P<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>). As in the case of, for example, the first nozzle employed in the primary scanning operation <b>7</b>, a nozzle is present in the raster position where a dot has already been formed. In this case, the nozzle masks the dot formation data so as not to form a dot. The location where the primary scanning operation P<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is performed is a critical location where paper feeding can be effected while the accuracy of paper feeding is ensured. In other words, the bottom of the recording paper <b>4</b> is at a position immediately before release from the paper feed roller <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">Setting of paper feed during an intermediate processing operation will now be described. During an intermediate processing operation of the present embodiment, transient feeding of paper by the amount corresponding to four rasters is followed by feeding of paper by a given amount corresponding to three rasters. The given paper feed corresponds to a paper feed for interlaced printing employed in a case where three nozzles are provided at a nozzle pitch corresponding to four rasters. The transient feeding of paper by the amount corresponding to four rasters, which had been performed at the beginning of the intermediate processing operation, is also set so as to avoid lack of rasters. The transient paper feed is determined in accordance with parameters such as a paper feed employed during the standard print processing operation and a paper feed employed during the intermediate processing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201">Interlaced recording, during which the number of nozzles used is apparently diminished, is performed during the intermediate processing operation, because there can be broadened a region at which an image can be recorded while the accuracy of a paper feed is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">In the thus-broadened print area, dots are recorded while the paper is fed in the secondary scanning direction by the amount corresponding to three rasters. At this time, the paper feed to be employed for effecting an interlaced recording operation is further diminished to three rasters.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">After the foregoing settings have been effected, nozzles to be used are set. Nozzles which are not to be used are subjected to data masking. Here, the expression “data masking” means processing for hindering nozzles from forming dots.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204">Next, an expanded print processing operation is performed. The paper feed employed during the intermediate processing operation differs from that employed during the standard print processing operation. As mentioned previously, during an expanded print processing operation, dots are formed by means of interlaced recording operation while the paper is fed by the amount corresponding to three rasters. At this time, since the image has already been formed in the area located higher than raster number 0 (i.e., an area of RN≦0), the nozzles located in that area are prohibited from forming dots.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">As has been described, a high-quality image can be produced by the interlaced recording method within the area to be subjected to a standard print processing operation. Further, the area where an image can be formed while the accuracy of a paper feed is ensured can be expanded by means of employment of the intermediate processing operation. Even in such a broadened area, an image is recorded by means of the interlaced recording method, thus enabling formation of a high-quality image. The area at which an image can be recorded can be broadened downward, by means of execution of an expanded print processing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0206">The standard interlaced recording method which utilizes actuation of all nozzles and has been described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, and the expanded print processing operation which employs limited use of nozzles; i.e., a limited interlaced recording method, are known techniques, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 291506/1999. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A through 25D</figref> show printing processes during which an image is formed on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on the top end <b>7</b>, by means of performing the standard interlaced recording operation and the limited interlaced recording operation. When the top end <b>7</b> of the recording paper comes to the first hole <b>11</b>, an expanded print processing operation is effected through use of nozzles of the portion <b>18</b> of the nozzle array <b>2</b>, in accordance with the method described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. An image is recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on the top end <b>7</b> while a small amount of ink is squirted toward the first hole <b>11</b>, as illustrated in the drawings, thus effecting top-margin-free printing.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A through 26D</figref> show print processes for printing an image on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on the bottom end <b>14</b>, by means of performing a standard interlaced recording operation and a limited interlaced recording operation. Recording of an image without leaving a margin on the bottom end <b>14</b> is in principle the same as recording of an image without leaving a margin on the top end <b>7</b>, and hence its explanation is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0208">A margin-free recording operation has been described by reference to an example in which a margin-free recording operation is achieved by means of a limited interlaced recording operation. In a case where an image is recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on either the top end <b>7</b> or the bottom end <b>14</b>, the amount of ink to be discarded into the first hole <b>11</b> and the second hole <b>12</b>, which has been described by reference to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can be reduced by means of performing a limited interlaced recording operation. Further, the limited interlaced recording operation enables a reduction in the degree of cockle (wrinkling) arising in the top end <b>17</b> or the bottom end <b>14</b> of the recording paper <b>4</b>. In the area of the recording paper <b>4</b> other than the top end <b>7</b> and the bottom end <b>14</b>, a high-quality image can be recorded without involvement of a reduction in print throughput, by means of performing an ordinary interlaced recording operation.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0209">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the ink droplets <b>12</b>—which have been squirted outside the top end <b>7</b> or the bottom end <b>14</b> while an image is recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on the top end <b>7</b> or the bottom end <b>14</b>—are guided to the first hole <b>11</b> and the second hole <b>13</b>. During the printing operation, the recording paper <b>4</b> is held firmly in position relative to the recording head <b>1</b>, by means of the flat tops <b>6</b> of the ribs <b>5</b>. Thus, in a case where an image is recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on either the top end <b>7</b> or the bottom end <b>14</b>, there is no chance of the recording paper <b>4</b> being stained by re-adhesion of the discarded ink droplets <b>12</b>. Further, the recording paper <b>4</b> is firmly held in position during a recording operation, thus enabling a high-quality recording operation.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another embodiment of the ink-jet recording apparatus of the present invention. The recording apparatus corresponds to the recording apparatus of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> additionally provided with an ink-absorbing member. Specifically, an ink-absorbing member <b>15</b> is provided on the inside bottom of the first hole <b>11</b> and the second hole <b>13</b>. The ink-absorbing member <b>15</b> corresponds to a fibrous bulk; for example, open-cell foamed plastic material or non-woven fiber. The ink-absorbing member <b>15</b> enables stable storage of the discarded ink droplets <b>12</b> without involvement of leakage of the ink. Further, the ink-absorbing member <b>15</b> can be readily replaced with a new one.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows yet another embodiment of the present invention. A water-repellent net <b>16</b> is provided in the opening of the first hole <b>11</b>, and a water-repellent net <b>17</b> is provided in the opening of the second hole <b>13</b>. The ink-absorbing member <b>15</b> is provided within the first and second holes <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> so as to contact the nets <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>. In this embodiment, since the opening of the first hole <b>11</b> is covered with the net <b>16</b> and the opening of the second hole <b>13</b> is covered with the net <b>17</b>, the recording paper <b>4</b> is transported as if the first hole <b>11</b> and the second hole <b>13</b> had not been formed in the platen <b>3</b>, thereby firmly holding the recording paper <b>4</b> in position. Further, the discarded ink droplets <b>12</b> collide with and adhere to the nets <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>. However, the nets <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> have a property of repelling water, and hence the ink <b>12</b> that has adhered to the nets <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> is immediately absorbed by the ink-absorbing member <b>15</b>, thus substantially eliminating residual ink from the surface of the platen <b>3</b> which is to contact the recording paper <b>4</b>. Accordingly, the recording paper <b>4</b> is held firmly in position, thereby substantially eliminating the chance of the discarded ink droplets <b>12</b> re-adhering to the recording paper <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0212"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show still another embodiment of the present invention. A reclosable closure <b>20</b> is provided in the opening of the first hole <b>11</b>, and a reclosable closure <b>21</b> is provided in the opening of the second hole <b>13</b>. When an image is recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on the top end <b>7</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or the bottom end <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), the closures <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are opened. During a printing operation other than a margin-free printing operation, the closures <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are closed. Opening and closing actions of the respective closures <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are controlled by an unillustrated control section. In the present embodiment, a pivot <b>22</b> is provided in a position below the openings of the first and second holes <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>, and the closures <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are pivotally moved about the pivot <b>22</b> so as to open or close the holes <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, by means of an unillustrated drive control section.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0213">In the present embodiment, when an image is recorded on the recording paper <b>4</b> without leaving a margin on either the top end <b>7</b> or the bottom end <b>14</b>, the first hole <b>11</b> or the second hole <b>12</b> is opened by the closure <b>20</b> or <b>21</b>. During a printing operation other than a margin-free printing operation, the closures <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are held in a closed position, thus preventing functional wastage. Further, the pivot <b>22</b> is located at a position below the openings of the first and second holes <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, thereby obviating a necessity for providing, in the travel path of the recording paper <b>4</b>, a mechanism for opening and closing the closures <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>. Accordingly, there can be prevented an increase in the likelihood of a paper jam, which would otherwise be caused when a new member is provided in the recording apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0227" num="0232">The through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> and the way in which the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is fitted into the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> will now be described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view showing the principal section of the platen of the ink-jet recording apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line II-II shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a back view showing the principal section of the platen; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line IV-IV shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0233">As mentioned above, the platen supports a recording medium from below and holds the recording medium in position relative to an ink-jet recording head (not shown), when an image is recorded on the recording medium disposed opposite the recording head while the ink-jet recording head—on which nozzles are arranged in the secondary scanning direction of the recording medium—is being moved so as to scan in the primary scanning direction. The through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are located at positions on the platen corresponding to the sides (the reference side and the other side) of recording media of various sizes to be moved in the secondary scanning direction. The through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> are formed so as to extend beyond either side of the recording medium. Further, the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> are formed as ink receiver holes whose openings are formed to be longer than the nozzle array in the secondary scanning direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> are provided between adjacent protuberances <b>14</b><i>b </i>and <b>14</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0234">The ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is provided in the respective through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b>. In the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b>, the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the opening opposite the recording head such that the top surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is situated below the opening. In the present embodiment, first removal stoppers <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> are provided along the interior edge of the recording-head-opposing opening of each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> and function to prevent removal of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> toward the recording head. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>14</b>, the first removal stoppers <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> are formed into steps, which are provided along the interior edge of the opening, and integrally with the platen. The through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> literally signify that the holes penetrate through the platen from the side opposing the recording head to the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0235">In the present embodiment, a pair of second removal stoppers <b>8</b> is provided in each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> for preventing removal of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> toward the recording head. The second removal stoppers <b>8</b> correspond to a pair of angularly-raised lines which are formed opposite each other on interior walls of the through hole in the longitudinal direction thereof. The end of the raised line <b>8</b> opposing the reverse side of the platen is tapered into a taper <b>9</b>, to thereby facilitate insertion of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0236">Based on the foregoing description, the configuration of the ink-jet recording apparatus for recording data on a recording medium without leaving margin on either side will now be described, by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In an ink-jet-type recording head <b>51</b> (designated by a dotted line) which travels back and forth in the primary scanning direction, nozzles are arranged in the secondary scanning direction. A platen <b>53</b> is disposed opposite the recording head <b>51</b>. When the recording head <b>51</b> records image data on the recording medium <b>50</b> (designated by a dotted line) while the recording medium <b>50</b> is intermittently transported in the secondary scanning direction, the platen <b>53</b> supports the recording medium <b>50</b> from below, to thereby hold the recording medium <b>50</b> in position relative to the recording head <b>51</b>. On the basis of recorded data, a control section <b>52</b> controls the intermittent transportation of the recording medium <b>50</b> in the secondary scanning direction, the reciprocating movement of the recording head <b>51</b> in the primary scanning direction, and the squirting of ink from the recording head <b>51</b>. The through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are formed in the respective areas of the platen <b>53</b> corresponding to either side of recording medium of predetermined sizes to be transported over the platen <b>53</b> in the secondary scanning direction. The through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are formed so as to extend beyond either side of the recording medium and to be longer, in the secondary scanning direction, than the area of the recording head where the nozzles are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0237">The control section <b>52</b> has two operation modes; i.e., a first operation mode and a second operation mode. In the first operation mode, the control section <b>52</b> expands recorded data and records the data in a recording region set inside either side of the recording medium of any of predetermined sizes (a postcard size, an A4-size, or a like size). In a second operation mode, the control section <b>52</b> expands the same recorded data and records the data within a record region which extends beyond either side of the recording medium <b>50</b> of the same size and is positioned inside a non-reference-side edge <b>54</b> of the recording medium <b>50</b> within the corresponding one of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>. In a case where data are recorded on the recording medium <b>50</b>, the control section <b>52</b> operates according to the second operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0238">In the present embodiment, in the first operation mode, a certain photographic image data set can be normally recorded on the recording medium <b>50</b> of a single size while a margin is left on either side thereof. In the second operation mode, the image data set can be recorded on the recording medium <b>50</b> without a margin being left on either side thereof. In other words, since the control section <b>52</b> is provided with the first and second operation modes, a certain photographic image data set can be readily and unfailingly recorded on the recording medium <b>50</b> of a single size with or without a margin being left on either side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0239">Since the control section <b>52</b> operates according to either the first or second operation mode for the recording medium <b>50</b> of a predetermined size, the second mode can be readily set such that the amount of image data to be produced and wasted outside either side of the recording medium <b>50</b> is sufficiently reduced. Accordingly, image data can be effectively recorded without a margin being left, by means of minimizing wastage of image data.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0240">Here, the expression “image data” may signify either text or an image.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0241">Further, in the ink-jet recording apparatus of the present embodiment, protuberances <b>14</b> protruding by the same distance are formed at predetermined intervals in the primary scanning direction and in an upper surface of the platen <b>53</b>. When the recording head <b>51</b> records image data on the recording medium <b>50</b> while the recording medium <b>50</b> is intermittently transported in the secondary scanning direction, the platen <b>53</b> supports the recording medium <b>50</b> from below, to thereby hold the recording medium <b>50</b> in position relative to the recording head <b>51</b>. The protuberances <b>14</b> enable regular generation of paper cockle, which is usually caused when the recording medium is soaked with ink, thereby rendering stable the position of the recording medium <b>50</b> in its widthwise direction. Therefore, setting of the record region for the second operation mode does not involve a necessity for taking into consideration a large positional offset of the recording paper <b>50</b> attributable to paper cockle. Accordingly, the recording region for the second operation mode can be made small, thus enabling a further reduction in the amount of image data to be wasted during a margin-free recording operation.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0242">More specifically, in the ink-jet recording apparatus programmed with the first and second operation modes, the recording region for the second operation mode is set to be wider than the width of the recording medium by 4.5 to 5.5 mm. By virtue of such an allowance, image data can be recorded on the recording medium <b>50</b> without a margin being left on either side thereof and without being substantially influenced by a tolerance stemming from the design or manufacture of a path for transporting the recording medium <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0243">In the ink-jet recording apparatus programmed with the first and second operation modes, the control section <b>52</b> reciprocally actuates the recording head <b>51</b> in the primary scanning direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, in both the first and second operation modes, the control section <b>52</b> assumes a single acceleration gradient at which the recording head <b>51</b> is to shift from a stationary state to a constant-speed state and a single deceleration gradient at which the recording head <b>51</b> is to shift from the constant-speed state to the stationary state. A travel distance <b>59</b> attained by the recording head <b>51</b> of the second operation mode in the constant-speed state is longer than a travel distance <b>58</b> attained by the recording head <b>51</b> of the first operation mode in the constant-speed state, and travel distance is substantially the same length on both an acceleration side and a deceleration side. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the vertical axis represents the traveling speed of a carriage mounted on the recording head <b>50</b>, and the horizontal axis represents an operation region in the primary scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0244">At the time of implementation of the first and second operation modes, the control required for reciprocally moving the recording head <b>51</b> in the primary scanning direction can be facilitated. Recording throughput can be optimized in both the first and second operation modes. The control section <b>52</b> may assume a speed pattern such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> or <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0245">In the ink-jet recording apparatus programmed with the first and second operation modes, the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is provided in each of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>. The ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is provided in the holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> such that the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is situated in the vicinity of the opening of the hole opposite the recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0246">Accordingly, the distance over which the ink droplets are squirted and wasted outside either side of the recording medium <b>50</b> can be shortened. Further, the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b>, which is disposed in each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> such that the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is situated in the vicinity of the opening opposite the recording head, immediately captures the ink droplets, thus significantly reducing the chance of occurrence of airborne ink mist.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0247"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 through 18</figref> show another embodiment of the present invention and correspond to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 14</figref>. In the present embodiment, the second removal stops are embodied by a pair of steps <b>28</b> formed along the bottom edge of each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> opposite the upper edge facing the recording head. In other respects, the recording apparatus of the present embodiment is identical in structure with that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 14</figref>, and hence like reference numerals designate like elements. Repeated description of these reference numerals is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0248">The operation of the recording apparatus of the present embodiment will now be described. When image data are recorded on a recording medium without a margin being left on either side thereof, by setting the range of primary scanning of the ink-jet recording head so as to extend beyond either side of the recording medium, the ink—which has been squirted from the recording head outside either side of the recording medium—is directly received by any of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> formed in the platen, each through hole having an opening larger than the nozzle range of the recording head. Further, the ink immediately adheres to the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> which is provided in the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> such that the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is situated in the vicinity of the entrance of the through hole. Accordingly, substantially no airborne ink mist arises. As mentioned above, even the platen of the present embodiment enables a reduction in the chance of generation of airborne ink mist, thereby diminishing the chance of both sides of a recording medium being stained with airborne ink mist.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0249">So long as the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> is situated in a position below the open entrance of each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b>, a recording medium is prevented from rubbing against the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b>, which would otherwise be caused during transportation of the recording medium. Further, even if the recording medium becomes wavy and deformed for reasons of paper cockle, the recording medium can be prevented from rubbing against the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0250">Further, the first removal stops <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> are provided along the open edge of each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> opposite the recording head, in order to prevent removal of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> toward the recording head. Since the first removal stops <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> securely hold the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b>, generation of airborne ink mist can be stably prevented. Further, rubbing between the upper surface of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> and a recording medium to be transported and rubbing between the recording medium and the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> stemming from paper cockle can be diminished thoroughly.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0251">Since the first removal stops <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> are formed along the open edge of each of the through holes <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> opposite the recording head, the first removal stops <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b> can be readily formed integrally with the platen. The thus-formed removal stops can exert a removal effect by means of a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0252">The second removal stoppers <b>8</b> or <b>28</b> provided in each of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> limit removal of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> in the direction opposite the recording head. The second removal stoppers <b>8</b> or <b>28</b> unfailingly prevent removal of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> in the direction opposite the recording head. In cooperation with the first removal stoppers <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>32</b>, the second removal stoppers <b>8</b> or <b>28</b> can securely hold the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> within the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0253">In one embodiment, the second removal stoppers <b>8</b> are formed in raised lines on the interior surface of each of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the lines aligned in the longitudinal direction thereof. Such a structure of the second removal stopper <b>8</b> enables insertion of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> into each of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> by means of pushing only the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b>. Further, the second removal stoppers <b>8</b> can be readily formed integrally with the through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0254">In another embodiment, the second removal stoppers <b>28</b> are formed in the shape of the steps <b>28</b> along the bottom edge of each of the through holes opposite the recording head. The step-shaped removal stoppers <b>28</b> unfailingly prevent removal of the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> through employment of a simple structure and can be readily formed integrally with the through holes.</p>

<p id="p-0251" num="0256">In the present embodiment, when image data are recorded on a recording medium without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, the ink which has been squirted from the recording head outside either side of the recording medium directly enters any of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> having openings, each opening longitudinally extending beyond the range of the recording head within which range nozzles are arranged (hereinafter referred to as a “nozzle range”). The ink then immediately adheres to the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> laid on the tilt section <b>35</b> provided in any of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>. Accordingly, the chance of occurrence of airborne ink mist can be substantially obviated. Even when an ink-jet recording apparatus performs photographic-quality printing which does not involve leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, there arises substantially no decrease in print quality of the lateral side areas of the recording medium. When the ink which has adhered to the ink-absorbing material <b>7</b> accumulates to a certain level, the ink flows over the surface of the tilt section <b>35</b> and is drained from the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0253" num="0258">In the present embodiment, as in the case of the platen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, when image data are recorded on a recording medium without leaving a margin on either side of the recording medium, the ink which has been squirted from the recording head outside either side of the recording medium directly enters any of the through holes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> having openings, each opening longitudinally extending beyond the nozzle range of the recording head.

<p id="p-0257" num="0262">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, a cut sheet feeder <b>3</b>, which is one of the principal constituent elements of the paper feeder <b>1</b>, is attached to an upper rear portion of a printer main unit (designated by two-dot chain lines) with an upward gradient. The sheet feeder <b>3</b> has a known structure, and the structure of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> is schematically described hereinbelow. The lower base end of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> is secured to the printer main unit by means of screws <b>5</b>. The sheet feeder <b>3</b> comprises a frame <b>7</b>, side walls <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> attached to respective sides of the frame <b>7</b>, and a hopper <b>13</b> interposed between the side walls <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. A plurality of single sheets of cut paper are loaded in the hopper <b>13</b>. The lower end of the hopper <b>13</b> is pivotally moved via an unillustrated hopper spring and a cam mechanism, to thereby come into contact with or depart from a paper feed roller to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0263">The hopper <b>13</b> is provided with an edge guide <b>15</b> for limiting the position of one widthwise end of a single sheet of cut paper, such that the edge guide <b>15</b> can move across the surface of the hopper <b>13</b> in its transverse direction. The side wall <b>9</b> of the two side walls <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> (i.e., the side wall situated near the viewer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>) pairs up with the edge guide <b>15</b> and functions as an edge guide for limiting the position of the other widthwise side of the single sheet of cut paper. More specifically, the interior surface of the stationary side wall <b>9</b> (i.e., the surface of the side wall <b>9</b> opposing the edge guide <b>15</b>) pairs up with the edge guide <b>15</b>, thus limiting either side of the single sheet of cut paper in its widthwise direction, thereby assisting straightforward transportation of a single sheet of cut paper into a print section (not shown) of the printer.</p>

<p id="p-0261" num="0266">A roll-of-paper loading region <b>30</b> is formed between the two arms <b>29</b>, and a receiving section <b>33</b> is formed in the interior surface of the free-end portion of each arm <b>29</b>. As shown in an enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the receiving section <b>33</b> has an widely-open receiving portion <b>35</b>, and a small-pin-receiving section <b>37</b> oriented substantially upward.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0267">A rotary pin <b>41</b> formed on either side of a roll support shaft <b>39</b> is finally fitted into the small-pin-receiving section <b>37</b> by way of the receiving portion <b>35</b>. The roll support shaft <b>39</b> is retained by the receiving sections <b>33</b> so as to be rotatable about its axis and stationary with respect to the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0268">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, a flange <b>43</b> is formed on one side of the roll support shaft <b>39</b>. The flange <b>43</b> assumes a shape similar to a running track formed by separating, by means of two line segments, two semicircular chords located symmetrically with respect to the center of a circle. A linear section of the flange <b>43</b> acts as a rotation limitation section <b>45</b>. When the roll support shaft <b>39</b> is detached from the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> and placed on top of a flat table, the rotation limitation sections <b>45</b> prevent inadvertent rotation of the roll support shaft <b>39</b>. However, these flanges <b>43</b> are not inevitably included as elements of the roll support shaft <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0269">A cutter travel channel <b>26</b> for receiving a cutter for separating the roll of paper <b>19</b> is formed in the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>. The cutter travel channel <b>26</b> acts as a guide channel when the roll of paper <b>19</b> is cut through use of a cutter (not shown). So long as the user causes the cutter to scan along the cutter travel channel <b>26</b>, the roller <b>19</b> is smoothly cut along that guide channel.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0270">The operation of the paper feeder of the first embodiment will now be described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, in a case where a single sheet of cut paper is used, it is not necessary to attach the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> to the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, and a plurality of single sheets of cut paper are loaded on the hopper <b>13</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> such that the sheets of cut paper are delivered one by one to the print section of the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0271">In a case where the roll of paper <b>19</b> is used, the roll support shaft <b>39</b> is inserted into the roll of paper <b>19</b> in an unrestricted manner (i.e., in a state in which the roll of paper <b>19</b> is freely rotatable relative to the roll support shaft <b>39</b>). The rotary pin <b>41</b> provided on either side of the roll support shaft <b>39</b> is fitted into the corresponding shaft bearing <b>37</b> of the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>, thus setting the roll of paper <b>9</b> into the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>. The removable engagement section <b>31</b> of the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> is then fitted into the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, thus attaching the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> to the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is a side view showing the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> and the sheet feeder <b>3</b> when connected together.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0272">The roll of paper <b>19</b> is rolled out from the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>, and the leading edge of the roll of paper <b>19</b> is aligned with the hopper <b>13</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> and set in the paper transport path of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. The edge guide <b>15</b> is moved according to the width of the roll of paper <b>19</b>, to thereby prevent the roll of paper <b>19</b> from wobbling in the horizontal direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>). Thus, the edge guide <b>15</b> can guide either the side edge of a single sheet of cut paper or the side edge of a roll of paper. The horizontal position of the unwound roll of paper <b>19</b> is limited, and during a printing operation the paper unwound from the roll of paper <b>19</b> is straightforwardly supplied to the print section.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0273">Paper is unwound from the roll of paper <b>19</b> by means of the feeding force exerted by a paper feed roller (not shown). Since the roll of paper <b>19</b> is retained by the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> in an unrestricted manner, the roll of paper <b>19</b> stretched by the paper feed roller is excessively rotated by means of inertial force. As a result, paper is excessively unwound, whereupon slack arises in the paper. The slack absorbs back tension, which would otherwise be applied to the paper when the roll of paper <b>19</b> is delivered to the print section, thus improving the accuracy of paper feeding operation.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0274">The paper feeder according to the second embodiment will now be described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. In the first embodiment, in a case where a single sheet of cut paper is subjected to printing, single sheets of cut paper are loaded into the hopper <b>13</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. However, large-size paper, such as A3-size paper or B4-size paper, does not completely fit into the hopper <b>13</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. In such a case, the paper support <b>51</b> has conventionally been attached, as an auxiliary member, to the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. In the present embodiment, the paper support <b>51</b> or the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> can be selectively attached to the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. Alternatively, both the paper support <b>51</b> and the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> can be attached to the sheet feeder <b>3</b> simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0275">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the sheet feeder <b>3</b> and the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> are identical with those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, a removable receiving section <b>53</b> for receiving the paper support <b>51</b> is formed in the center of the interior surface of the roll-of-sheet holder <b>25</b>. A removable engagement section <b>55</b> formed at the lower end of the paper support <b>51</b> can be attached to the removable receiving section <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0276">The removable engagement section <b>55</b> of the paper support <b>51</b> can also be attached to the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. In the second embodiment, the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> is formed so as to be able to connect with the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, by utilization of the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> for removably receiving the paper support <b>51</b>. In other words, the removable receiving section <b>21</b> formed in the sheet feeder <b>3</b> can serve as an attachment point for both the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> and the paper support <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0277">A withdrawable extension support <b>59</b> is provided on the reverse side of the upper end of the paper support <b>51</b>. In a case where a single sheet of cut paper extends beyond the paper support <b>51</b>, the extension support <b>59</b> is withdrawn supplementally, thus supporting the entirety of the single sheet of cut paper.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0278">Next, the operation of the paper feeder according to the second embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> will now be described. As in the case of the paper feeder shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the removable engagement section <b>31</b> of the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> is attached to the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. In this state, the roll of sheet <b>19</b> is set in the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>, whereby a roll of paper can be subjected to printing, as in the case of the paper feeder shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0279">In a case where a long single sheet of cut paper is used for printing, the roll of paper <b>19</b> is detached from the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>, and the removable engagement section <b>55</b> of the paper support <b>51</b> is attached to the removable receiving section <b>53</b> of the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>). Single sheets of cut paper are loaded on the hopper <b>13</b> so as to extend to the paper support <b>51</b>, and the edge guide <b>15</b> is moved, to thereby prevent horizontal displacement of the sheets of cut paper and enable printing. Thus, even in a case where the roll-of-sheet holder <b>25</b> is not used, the paper feeder of the present embodiment obviates a necessity for removing the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> from the sheet feeder <b>3</b> each time the roll-of-sheet holder <b>25</b> is not in use. A long single sheet of cut paper can be printed, so long as the paper support <b>51</b> is attached to the paper feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0280">In a case where use of a roll of paper is not expected for a while, the roll-of-sheet holder <b>25</b> is removed from the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, and the removable engagement section <b>55</b> of the paper support <b>51</b> can be attached directly to the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0281">In the paper feeder of the present embodiment, the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> is structured so as to be attached to the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, thus rendering the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> compact and improving the ease of use thereof. Accordingly, the ink-jet recording apparatus can be prevented from becoming bulky.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0282">The roll-of-sheet holder <b>25</b> is attached to the sheet feeder <b>3</b> such that a roll of sheet to be retained is situated above the upper end of the sheet feeder and in substantially an extension of a paper transport path of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>. As a result, a roll of paper and a sheet of cut paper can be transported over a single common path, thus reducing variations in recording quality. Further, the entirety of the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> can be readily made compact.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0283">As a result of the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> being arranged so as to be shared between the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> and the paper support <b>51</b>, the structure to be used for removal attachment can be simplified. Further, so long as the paper support <b>51</b> is detached from the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b> and the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> is attached to the removable receiving section <b>21</b>, data can be recorded (printed) on a roll of paper. Conversely, so long as the paper support <b>51</b> is attached to the removable receiving section <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, a sheet of cut paper which is long in the feeding direction can be stably transported while the end of the paper is supported by the paper support <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0284">The removable receiving section <b>53</b> for receiving the paper support <b>51</b> is formed in the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>. While the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> is attached to the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, the paper support <b>51</b> can be attached to the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>. Even while the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> remains attached to the sheet feeder <b>3</b>, the paper support <b>51</b> can be additionally attached to the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>. As a result, even when a roll of paper is not used, a single sheet of cut paper which is long in the feeding direction can be used by means of assistance of the paper support <b>51</b> and without involvement of removal of the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b>, thus improving the ease of use of the paper feeder.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Paper Feeding Method</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0285">A method of feeding paper in the ink-jet recording apparatus of <b>20</b> the present invention will now be described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53</figref> through. Throughout these drawings, like reference numerals designate like elements. However, the reference numerals are irrelevant to those employed in other drawings. Hence, the reference numerals may designate different elements from those designated in other drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0286"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> is a diagrammatic representation showing a system for feeding a single sheet of cut paper in an ink-jet recording apparatus of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> is a diagrammatic representation showing a system for feeding a roll of paper in an ink-jet recording apparatus of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the expression “paper P” is employed in the description of paper feed control common to feeding of a single sheet of cut paper and feeding of a roll of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0287">The outline of a system for feeding a singe sheet of cut paper will be described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>. A paper feed apparatus ASF has the function of feeding, one by one, a plurality of single sheets of cut paper Ps stacked into layers. The paper feed apparatus ASF is essentially made up of a hopper <b>1</b> on which a plurality of single sheets of cut paper Ps stacked into layers are loaded; a paper feed roller <b>2</b> for picking up the top single sheet of cut paper Ps loaded on the hopper <b>1</b> and feeding the thus-picked up paper Ps; and a separation pad <b>3</b> for separating other sheets of cut paper Ps, which would otherwise be transported together with the top sheet of paper Ps, from the top sheet of paper Ps.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0288">The paper feed roller <b>2</b> has a D-shaped side cross section and comprises a circular-arc section <b>2</b><i>a </i>which is to be brought into contact with the single sheet of cut paper Ps, and a linear section <b>2</b><i>b </i>which departs from the single sheet of cut paper Ps. At least the surface of the paper feed roller <b>2</b> is formed from high-friction material, such as rubber. During a single rotation of the paper feed roller <b>2</b> in which the circular arc section <b>2</b><i>a </i>remains in contact with the separation pad <b>3</b>, one single sheet of cut paper Ps is fed to a conveyor roller <b>4</b> by way of a paper guide <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0289">After skews have been eliminated from the single sheet of cut paper Ps by means of cooperation of the conveyor roller <b>4</b> and a driven roller <b>5</b>, the single sheet of cut paper is advanced by a certain length, and the single sheet of cut paper Ps is delivered to the area of a recording head <b>6</b> constituting a recording section of the recording apparatus, in accordance with recording timing. In the region of the recording head <b>6</b>, data are recorded on the single sheet of cut paper Ps, and the paper Ps having the data recorded thereon is output by means of an output roller <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0290">The system for feeding a roll of paper will now be described by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>. The single sheet of cut paper Ps is removed from the hopper <b>1</b>, and a roll of paper PR is set to the paper feeder. The leading portion of the roll of paper PR is unwound, and the thus-unwound portion is placed on a single-sheet-of-paper loading section of the hopper <b>1</b>. The leading end of the roll of paper PR is set to the same position at which the leading edge of the single sheet of cut paper Ps had been located. When feeding of paper is commenced, the hopper <b>1</b> is raised, and the paper feed roller <b>2</b> picks up the leading end of the roll of paper P<sub>R</sub>, thus feeding the paper. The roll of paper is advanced without involvement of elimination of skew, and the paper PR is fed to the region of the recording head <b>6</b> in accordance with the recording timing, thus recording data on the paper. The roll of paper P<sub>R </sub>having the data recorded thereon is output by the output roller <b>7</b> and is cut by cutting means, such as a cutter, which is not accommodated in the ink-jet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0291">The example paper feeder to be used with the recording apparatus of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 through 49</figref>, which have been previously employed for description. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 through 49</figref>, the sheet feeder <b>3</b> for use with a single sheet of cut paper Ps, which is one of the principal constituent elements of the paper feeder <b>1</b> (ASF), is attached to an upper rear portion of a printer main unit (designated by two-dot chain lines), with an upward gradient. The sheet feeder <b>3</b> has a known structure.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0292">Paper is unwound from the roll of paper P<sub>R </sub>by means of the feeding force exerted by the paper feed roller <b>2</b>. Since the roll of paper P<sub>R </sub>is retained by the roll-of-paper holder <b>25</b> in an unrestricted manner, the roll of paper P<sub>R </sub>stretched by the paper feed roller <b>2</b> is excessively rotated by means of inertial force. As a result, paper is excessively unwound, whereupon slack arises in the paper. The slack absorbs back tension, which would otherwise be applied to the paper P<sub>R </sub>when the roll of paper P<sub>R </sub>is delivered to the print section, thus improving the accuracy of paper feeding operation.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0293">In the present embodiment, the paper feed roller <b>2</b> and the conveyor roller <b>4</b> are actuated independently by corresponding motors. The motors are controlled according to a selected paper feed sequence. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> shows a paper feed control block.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0294">A control section <b>40</b> receives print information output from a print driver of a main control section (not shown) or a like section of the recording apparatus. On the basis of determination of the print information, the control section <b>40</b> selects one from a plurality of paper feed sequences stored in the control section <b>40</b> in advance and executes the selected paper feed sequence through use of a paper feed instruction. On the basis of the result of detection of paper issued by a paper detector PE (e.g., a leading-end-of-paper detection signal or a trailing-end-of-paper detection signal), the control section <b>40</b> controls a paper feed roller drive section <b>41</b> and a conveyor roller drive section <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0295">Print information comprises information (type-of-paper information) about the type of paper, such as plain paper, coated paper, an OHP sheet, glossy paper, a glossy film, or a post card; information about resolution (resolution information); and mode selection information about a feed rate, a single sheet of cut paper, a roll of paper, and feeding of paper by way of a control panel. The paper feed sequence is formed by combination of an operation for rotating the paper feed roller <b>2</b> and the conveyor roller <b>4</b> at a normal feed rate, an operation for rotating the paper feed roller <b>2</b> at a rate faster than the ordinary feed rate (i.e., a high-speed mode), and an operation for rotating, in the forward or reverse direction, the paper feed roller <b>2</b> and the conveyor roller <b>4</b> at a normal feed rate.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0296">The control section <b>40</b> stores a first paper removal routine and a second paper removal routine. According to the first paper removal routine, there is performed an operation for outputting, to the outside of the ink-jet recording apparatus, the paper which has been fed by way of a control panel by means of causing the paper to advance. According to the second paper removal routine, there is performed an operation for outputting, to the outside of the ink-jet recording apparatus, the paper which has been fed by way of a control panel by means of causing the paper to move in reverse. After advancing the paper over a certain distance has been completed, either the first or second paper removal routine is performed in accordance with an instruction from the user. In a case where the user issues an instruction by means of actuation of a button <b>45</b> provided on the control panel, a button operation awareness section <b>40</b>A gains awareness of operation of the button <b>45</b>, thus determining a paper removal routine to be executed and executing the thus-determined routine. The button operation awareness section <b>40</b>A gains awareness of the way of operation of an existing button (e.g., a control panel paper feed button or a control panel paper output button), the time required for the user to operate the existing button, the way of operation of a paper removal button which can be used for removing a single sheet of cut paper as well as for removing a roll of paper, the time required for the user to operate the paper removal button, operation of a single-sheet-of-paper output button, and operation of a roll-of-paper output button.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0297">There will now be described an embodiment of the button <b>45</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> shows an example use of a known panel paper feed button. The control panel paper feed button is for issuing a paper feed instruction. The control panel paper feed button does not follow an ordinary paper feed instruction operation but is actuated according to, for example, the length of time during which the control panel paper feed button is actuated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> shows an example button by which the user issues an instruction for executing the first paper removal routine or the second paper removal routine. Such an operation of the button is embodied by combination of different operations of the paper removal button. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> show an example button specifically designed for instructing execution of the first paper removal routine and an example button specifically deigned for instructing execution of the second paper removal routine. Execution of the appropriate paper removal routine is effected by operation of a button specifically designed for the routine (i.e., a single-sheet-of-cut-paper removal button and a roll-of-paper removal button).</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0298">The first and second paper removal routines will now be described by reference to diagrammatic illustrations. In the description, the expression “button” typifies buttons shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56 through 58</figref>.</p>

The first paper removal routine corresponds to an output operation applied to a single sheet of cut paper. After advancement of the top of the single sheet of cut paper over a certain distance has been completed in the control panel paper feed mode (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59A</figref>), the single sheet of cut paper is advanced to the outside of the ink-jet recording apparatus, by means of operation of the button provided on the control panel (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0300"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61A and 61B</figref> are schematic representations of the second paper removal routine; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> is a timing chart of the second paper removal routine. The second paper removal routine corresponds to an output operation applied to a roll of paper. After advancement of the top of the roll of paper over a certain distance has been completed in the control panel paper feed mode (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61A</figref>), the single sheet of cut paper is moved in reverse to the outside of the ink-jet recording apparatus, by means of operation of the button provided on the control panel (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0301"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63A through 63E</figref> are schematic representations showing execution of the first and second paper removal routines in combination. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> is a timing chart showing execution of the first and second paper removal routines in combination. In the present embodiment, the paper fed into the recording apparatus is determined to be a single sheet of cut paper or a roll of paper, by means of determining whether or not the trailing end of paper has been detected within a predetermined period of time. Subsequently, a paper removal operation suitable for the nature of the thus-determined paper is performed. If the user operates a button while the recording apparatus is in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63A</figref>, the first paper removal routine is executed. The conveyor roller <b>4</b> is rotated forward, thus advancing the paper (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63B and 63C</figref>). In a case where the trailing end of the paper is detected within a predetermined period of time, the first paper removal routine to be applied to a single sheet of paper is performed continuously, and the forward rotation of the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is also continued (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63D</figref>). In contrast, if the trailing end of the paper has not been detected within a predetermined period of time, the routine is switched to the second paper removal routine to be applied to a roll of paper, whereupon the paper feed roller <b>2</b> and the conveyor roller <b>4</b> are rotated in reverse (see FIG. <b>63</b>E).</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0302">A specific example of paper removal will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> shows a paper removal routine by which removal of paper is selectively performed by means of determination of the length of the time during which the control panel paper feed button is actuated. The paper removal routine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> corresponds to processing to be performed after advancement of the top of the paper over a certain distance has been completed by means of feeding the paper by way of the control panel.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0303">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, a determination is made as to whether or not the control panel paper feed button has been activated for more than three seconds. Further, when the control panel paper feed mode is selected, interaction is adopted. If the control panel paper feed button is not operated before execution of a routine, processing pertaining to the routine is suspended. Accordingly, it is desirable to inform the user of the relationship between the contents of the next routine to be executed and the operation time of a button, as well as to prompt the user to operate the control panel paper feed button by means of outputting a beeping sound.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0304">After advancement of the top of the paper over a certain distance has been completed, the user operates the control panel paper feed button, whereupon the time required for the user to operate the control panel paper feed button is determined (step <b>100</b>). If the button is pressed for three seconds or more, the second paper removal routine to be described later is executed (step <b>101</b>). In contrast, if the button is pressed for less than three seconds, the first paper removal routine to be described later is executed (step <b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0305">According to the first paper removal routine of the present embodiment, the trailing end of the paper is detected through use of a paper detector, to thereby determine whether the paper is a single sheet of cut paper or a roll of paper, thus causing subsequent processing to branch. A determination as to whether or not the paper is a single sheet of cut paper or a roll of paper is made by utilization of the conveyor roller <b>4</b>. If paper is detected when the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is rotated forward a predetermined number of rotations, the paper is determined to be a roll of paper. In contrast, if no paper is detected, the paper is determined to be a single sheet of cut paper. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref> is a flowchart showing the flow of the first paper removal routine according to the present embodiment. When the first paper removal routine is executed, a counter is set to Nfo=0 in order to count the number of rotations made by the conveyor roller <b>4</b> (step <b>200</b>), and the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is rotated forward (step <b>201</b>). The counter is then incremented (Nfo=Nfo+1) (step <b>202</b>), and detection of paper is determined (step <b>203</b>). If presence of paper is detected, a determination is made as to whether or not the count value Nfo has achieved “m” rotations (step <b>204</b>). In the case of Nfo=m, the paper is determined to be a roll of paper, and processing exits the routine; that is, the forward rotation of the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is terminated. In contrast, in the case of Nfo≠m, the forward rotation of the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is continued. If paper depletion is detected before Nfo=m is achieved, the paper is determined to be a single sheet of cut paper, thereby releasing the control section from the roll-of-paper mode and the control panel paper feed mode (step <b>205</b>). Further, the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is rotated forward a predetermined number of rotations (step <b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0306"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> is a flowchart showing the flow of the second paper removal routine according to the present embodiment. When the second paper removal routine is executed, the conveyor roller <b>4</b> is rotated in reverse a given number of rotations (step <b>301</b>). In this operation, the paper can be moved backward only until presence of paper is detected; specifically, when the paper enters the detection range of the paper detector. Accordingly, a paper jam error message is indicated in order to prompt the user to manually remove the paper (step <b>302</b>). After removal of the paper, the paper detector again determines whether or not paper is present (step <b>303</b>). The control section deactivates the roll-of-paper mode and the panel paper feed mode (step <b>304</b>), and, further, deactivates indication of the paper jam error message (step <b>305</b>). If presence of paper is detected in step <b>303</b>, the user presses the control panel paper feed button (the time during which the button is pressed is not counted) (step <b>306</b>). Actuation of the control panel paper feed button resumes reverse rotation of the conveyor roller <b>4</b> (step <b>301</b>), to thereby move the paper backward over a predetermined distance. The round of operations is continued until the paper can be removed from the paper feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0307">According to the paper feed method of the present embodiment, the user instructs removal of the current paper before execution of a printing operation and after advancement of the top of the paper over a certain distance has been completed in the panel paper feed mode, thereby eliminating wastage of paper and rendering a printing operation economical. In the recording apparatus of the present embodiment, a roll of paper is set on the paper feeder through use of the hopper for use with a single sheet of cut paper, thus rendering the recording apparatus compact and easy to operate. Further, the edge guide of the hopper doubles as a guide for a roll of paper. Therefore, even if the leading edge of the roll of paper is cut obliquely, the roll of paper can be properly advanced over a certain distance in the feeding direction. Moreover, the recording apparatus yields the same advantages as those yielded by the paper feed method.</p>
