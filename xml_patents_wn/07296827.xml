<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to DE 102004013332.8 filed Mar. 17, 2004.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a releasable connection arrangement, with a non-positive and positive fit, for two rotationally symmetrical components at a connection point, especially for creating a leak-proof connection between closure elements on power plant valves. A connection arrangement of this kind is known, for example, from the German Utility Model DE 298 22 922 U1.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the known connection arrangement, each tensioning member has the force of a straining screw acting directly upon it, the screw acting between the tensioning members and one shoulder of the first component and bracing the tensioning member like a wedge along the wedge surfaces between the components.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While a connection arrangement of this kind is beneficial from the point of view of the frictional contact connection, it nevertheless possesses the disadvantage that for installation or dismantling purposes, numerous straining screws have to be tightened evenly, which takes a relatively great amount of time. Uneven torque can lead to damage in operation. Apart from that, it is time-consuming and expensive to produce the numerous counter-bearings needed for the straining screws.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention has set itself the objective of improving a connection arrangement of the generic kind, especially with regard to the disadvantages described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention achieves this objective by means of a connection arrangement of the generic kind characterized in that an expanding ring is provided, abutting third wedge surfaces of the tensioning members with an outer expanding surface, and tensioning means are provided, acting between the expanding ring and one of the components, with which the expanding ring can be moved axially and the tensioning members can be moved radially or radially/axially.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thanks to the arrangement in accordance with the invention, with an expanding ring distributing the tensioning forces of the tensioning means over the circumference, fewer or different tensioning means can be provided than is the case in the state of the art, so that assembly or dismantling can be performed more easily and more quickly. Apart from that the flow of forces through the connection can be improved still further.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is preferably provided that the first and second bearing surfaces run radially. The groove can be formed in part of a radial portion of the first or second bearing surface so as to arrange the seal in parallel to the bearing surface proper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is preferably provided that the first clamping surface should include a wedge angle with the second clamping surface, which is matched to a cone angle of the outer expanding surface in such a way that the expanding ring causes self-locking bracing of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It can be provided that the first clamping surface runs radially and the second clamping surface runs conically.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Alternatively, it can be provided that the first clamping surface runs conically and the second clamping surface runs radially.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further alternative, it can be provided that the first and second clamping surfaces run conically.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The expanding ring can be formed continuously in the circumferential direction, or alternatively it can be provided that the expanding ring has radial expansion slots arranged spread out in the circumferential direction and a conically formed inner expanding surface with which it abuts a correspondingly conically formed third expanding surface disposed on the second component, and that it can be, radially expanded by axial displacement. In this context, it can be provided that the outer expanding surface and the third wedge surfaces of the tensioning members are in each case formed axis-cylindrically or conically.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It can be provided that the expansion slots do not extend over an entire axial length of the expanding ring. Alternatively, the invention envisages that the expanding ring is provided with expansion slots arranged in an alternating way in the circumferential direction, in the manner of a collet.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The expanding ring can be formed from separate expanding members disposed spread out over the circumference, and a thrust collar gripping round them.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is provided that there is a retaining ring releasably mounted on the first component, especially on the collar, adjacent to the first clamping surface, which retaining ring has a retaining surface running substantially axis-cylindrically and abutting a locking surface, which runs substantially axis-cylindrically, of the tensioning members and preventing the tensioning members and thus the connection arrangement from being released completely when the expanding ring is released.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The tensioning means can be formed as straining screws distributed over the circumference. The straining screws can be located in a straining ring secured axially to the first component, especially by means of a circumferential groove and a sliding block.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, it can be provided that the straining screws engage through the expanding ring into the first component, especially into the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As a further alternative, it can be provided that the expanding ring has a flange ring formed integrally with it or resting on it, through which the straining screws engage in a circumferential portion of the second component located radially outside the tensioning members.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Finally, it can be provided as an alternative that the tensioning means can be formed by a threaded nut acting on the expanding ring and co-operating with an external or internal thread of the first or second component.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the tensioning members consist of parts of a ring divided along two parallel secant planes which can be mounted, in a manner known per se, at mutual (circumferential) distances that are advantageously small compared to parts obtained by radial sections, i.e. they can be inserted between the first and second components.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention also relates to a set of tensioning members for a connection arrangement according to the invention, formed from parts of a ring divided along two parallel secant planes and having first wedge surfaces formed radially or conically outwardly, second wedge surfaces formed radially or conically outwardly and internal third, axis-cylindrical or conical, wedge surfaces. Whereas the third wedge surfaces may be formed either axis-cylindrically or conically with any combination of angles in the first and second wedge surfaces, either the first wedge surfaces may be radial and the second wedge surfaces conical, or vice versa, or both may be conical.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention will now be explained by reference to various embodiments relating to a novel cover lock of a power plant valve. In power plant valves for new conventional fossil-fuel thermal power plants, which are subject to high stresses, the operating pressures reach up to approx. 300 bar, while the operating temperatures can reach levels of 700° C. and more. The service lives of self-sealing graphite cover seals are not adequate in view of the extreme temperatures and pressures of the media. A graphite seal rapidly oxidizes to CO<sub>2 </sub>when an operating temperature of 500° C. is exceeded, permitting atmospheric oxygen to enter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At operating temperatures on these levels, it is conceivable to use, among other things, a radially operative, high-temperature-resistant metal O-ring seal. From the structural point of view, the cover lock with a metal O-ring seal must be designed in such a way that the metal O-ring is placed in metal-to-metal contact. With conventional flange locks or self-sealing locks, this sealing method is of only limited feasibility or leads to disproportionately large dimensions of the housing and the lock member, which are not suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The construction of the invention makes it possible to design a cover lock for valves in an advantageous manner such that a metal O-ring seal is located in metal-to-metal contact and the pressure forces occurring can be absorbed by the twin action of a rotationally symmetrical cone system. According to the invention, the operating forces are intercepted by positive-locking ring segments provided with a plurality of conical lateral surfaces which are supported outwardly on the housing and inwardly on an expanding ring by means of cone envelope surfaces. If the angle of the cone is selected in the region of self-locking, i.e. the tangent of the angle of incline is smaller than the lowest static friction figure to be expected, this ensures that the axial reaction forces acting on the pre-tensioning members (tensioning means in the form of bolts) are small or virtually zero.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Since the advantageous structural design means that only low pre-tensioning forces are required, which are independent of the operating pressure, relaxation and material fatigue do not occur in the tensioning means, and the dimensions relative to the magnitude of the forces which can be transmitted remain relatively small compared to conventional flange locks. The favorable flow of forces through the components connected to the twin-action, rotationally symmetrical cone system generates the lowest possible folding moments and bending moments and deformations in the housing and cover. In the outer tensioning members, which are in the shape of cone segments, mainly shearing strains occur, whereas in the expanding ring or supporting cone it is mainly tangential strains or, in the case of a slotted expanding ring supported on the inside, only compressive strains, which are easy to control.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> shows different embodiments of a connection arrangement of the invention, in which a first component, which is rotationally symmetrical at least at the connection point and is in this case a cover <b>2</b> of a power plant valve, has a collar <b>4</b> projecting radially outwards, on which are formed a first, radial clamping surface <b>6</b> and a first, likewise radial, bearing surface <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second component <b>10</b>, in this case a housing of a power plant valve, which is likewise formed rotationally symmetrical in the region of the connection point shown at the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> has at an open end a socket <b>12</b>, which surrounds and axially overlaps the collar <b>4</b> of the first component <b>2</b>. Formed in the socket <b>12</b> in order to co-operate with the first bearing surface <b>8</b> of the first component <b>2</b> there is a second bearing surface <b>14</b> likewise running radially, a groove <b>16</b> being formed in a radially inner region of the second bearing surface <b>14</b> to receive a metal O-ring seal <b>18</b> and a groove <b>16</b>′ being formed in the first bearing surface <b>8</b>, a seal <b>18</b>′ being positioned in the groove <b>16</b>′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The seal <b>18</b> is thus arranged in parallel to the bearing surface proper when the two components <b>2</b>, <b>10</b> are fitted together and touching. Thus, the main axial forces are transmitted by the bearing surfaces and not by the seal which is thus subjected to a predetermined amount of axial compression.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the socket <b>12</b> there is formed, at an axial distance from the second bearing surface <b>14</b>, a hollowed out portion <b>20</b> and a second conical clamping surface <b>22</b>, which is opposite the first clamping surface <b>6</b> of the first component <b>2</b> when the components <b>2</b>, <b>10</b> are fitted together as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A number of ring wedge-shaped tensioning members <b>24</b> are distributed over the circumference and are disposed with a first cone envelope or wedge surface <b>26</b> abutting the first clamping surface <b>6</b> and with a second wedge surface <b>28</b> abutting the second clamping surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An expanding ring <b>34</b> with an outer expanding surface <b>32</b> abutting third wedge surfaces <b>30</b> of the tensioning members <b>24</b> is placed in the axial direction <b>36</b> against the tensioning members <b>24</b>. Tensioning means are provided between the expanding ring <b>34</b> and the first component <b>2</b> (cover) in order to move the expanding ring <b>34</b> in the axial direction <b>36</b> and thus to move the tensioning members <b>24</b> along the second clamping surface <b>22</b>, i.e., in the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, both in the axial direction <b>36</b> and also radially outwards. In the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, the tensioning means are formed by straining screws <b>40</b>, which are screwed into threaded holes <b>42</b> of a straining ring <b>44</b>, which, for its part, is supported against a sliding block <b>48</b> inserted into a circumferential groove <b>46</b> of the first component <b>2</b>. Because of the relatively low axial forces that have to be applied through the straining screws <b>40</b>, neither the circumferential groove <b>46</b> nor the sliding block <b>48</b> need to be of any great size, unlike a conventional flange-like connection, in which the straining screws have to absorb the entire compressive force occurring in operation (operating pressure multiplied by the internal area of the cover). If the wedge and cone angles defined by the wedge surfaces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are selected such that self-locking occurs, the straining screws <b>40</b> merely have to apply the tensioning force needed for assembly, whereas no additional load occurs in operation, irrespective of the internal or operating pressure. Since the compressive forces between the cover and the housing (first and second components) are transmitted through compressive and frictional forces, the actual task of the straining screws <b>40</b> is only to immobilize the connection arrangement in its frictional connection and positive locking (first component <b>2</b>, second component <b>10</b>, tensioning members <b>24</b> and expanding ring <b>34</b>), i.e. to prevent the expanding ring <b>34</b> from coming loose because of the inevitable vibrations, shocks and the like which occur in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the region of the hollowed out portion <b>20</b> in the second component <b>10</b>, holes <b>50</b> are inserted on the level of the tensioning members <b>24</b>, so that the tensioning members <b>24</b> can be knocked out in the event of dismantling. Using axial threaded forcing holes and corresponding forcing screws, not shown, the expanding ring <b>34</b> can be pressed out of the conical inner ring formed by the tensioning members <b>24</b>. This ensures that the connection arrangement can be dismantled with no difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Essentially, the further embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 9</figref> differ from the embodiment explained above merely with regard to the design of the expanding ring <b>34</b> and its bracing with different bracing means.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an expanding ring <b>34</b> with axial via holes <b>60</b>, through which stud bolts <b>64</b> are screwed and engage in blind threaded holes <b>62</b> in the first component <b>2</b>, the axial bracing of the expanding ring <b>34</b> being achieved by fastening nuts <b>66</b>. Because of the closed design of the expanding ring <b>34</b>, the stud bolts <b>64</b> are merely subjected to axial strain and not to bending.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a variant in which the expanding ring <b>34</b> is not formed in a continuous, or solid, manner in the circumferential direction, but instead has expansion slots running in the radial direction and spread out in the circumferential direction, one of which is indicated by <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It is possible for there merely to be expansion slots inserted in an axial direction, e.g. from the lower side, each of which extends in accordance with the expansion slot indicated by <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or alternatively the expanding ring <b>34</b> can formed like a collet, wherein successive expansion slots in the circumferential direction extend from alternately opposite axial directions into the expanding ring.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an alternative embodiment, which is not shown, it would also be possible for the expanding ring to be composed of separate expanding members spread out over the circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In all cases, it is appropriate for the expanding ring to be formed with a thrust collar, indicated by <b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, gripping round the individual expanding members or the expanding portions subdivided by expansion slots. The thrust collar can be formed integrally, with expanding portions separated by expansion slots, or alternatively as a separate component.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A feature common to all such embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the expanding ring <b>34</b> not only has an outer expanding surface <b>32</b>, but in addition an inner, conical expanding surface <b>74</b>, which co-operates with a corresponding conically formed third expanding surface <b>76</b> on the second component <b>2</b>. When the tensioning means (straining screws <b>40</b>) are tightened, the thrust collar <b>72</b> thus moves in the axial direction <b>36</b> relative to the first component <b>2</b> in the direction of the collar <b>4</b>, while the inner expanding surfaces <b>74</b> of the slotted portion of the expanding ring <b>34</b> move outwards along the third expanding surface <b>76</b> both in the axial direction <b>36</b> and in the radial direction, i.e. the ring expands.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Because of the above-mentioned radial expansion movement of the slotted portion of the expanding ring <b>34</b>, the third wedge surfaces <b>30</b>—which are shown conically in FIG. <b>3</b>—of the tensioning members <b>24</b> and correspondingly also the outer expanding surface <b>32</b> of the expanding ring <b>34</b> could be formed axis-cylindrically, which simplifies manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a variant of the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in which the expanding ring <b>34</b> has a flange portion or flange ring <b>80</b> formed integrally with it, through which stud bolts <b>64</b> are inserted, which for their part engage in blind threaded holes <b>62</b> in the second component <b>10</b>. As an alternative to the integral embodiment shown, the flange ring <b>80</b> could also be formed as a separate ring gripping over the actual expanding ring <b>34</b>, as will be explained in more detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment in which the tensioning means are formed by a threaded nut <b>90</b> acting on the expanding ring <b>34</b>, the threaded nut <b>90</b> co-operating with an external thread <b>92</b> of the first component <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the threaded nut <b>90</b> could be provided with an external thread and the second component <b>10</b> with an internal thread in an open end portion of the socket <b>12</b> adjacent to the second clamping surface <b>22</b>, with a corresponding axial shortening of the expanding ring <b>34</b> or axial lengthening of the second component <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a variant in which the expanding ring <b>34</b> is formed in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, though in this case there is additionally a retaining ring <b>100</b> fixed to the collar <b>4</b> of the first component <b>2</b> by means of fastening screws <b>102</b>. The retaining ring <b>100</b> has a retaining surface <b>104</b> running axis-cylindrically, with which it abuts correspondingly formed locking surfaces <b>106</b>—which run axis-cylindrically—of the tensioning members <b>24</b>. The diameter of the retaining surface <b>104</b> is in this case selected such that the retaining ring <b>100</b> can be inserted when the connection arrangement is in its assembled but unbraced state, without already bracing the tensioning members <b>24</b>, but at the same time such that the tensioning members <b>24</b> cannot slip out of the hollowed out portion <b>20</b> when the retaining ring <b>100</b> is inserted. In other words, when the fastening nuts <b>66</b> are tightened, a radial gap, which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, appears between the retaining surface <b>104</b> and the locking surfaces <b>106</b>, since the tensioning members <b>24</b> are braced radially outwardly. If the fastening should come loose in operation, for whatever reason, it is still not possible for the cover <b>2</b> to be pressed out of the socket <b>12</b>; instead, there may merely be a more or less slight leak in the connection point in the region of the seal <b>18</b>, because the tensioning members <b>24</b> still prevent any substantial axial movement of the components <b>2</b>, <b>10</b> relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a combination of the variants according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where a flange ring <b>80</b> is formed as a separate part and to a certain extent could also perform the function of a thrust collar, though this function, rather as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, is already performed by the thrust collar <b>72</b> as part of the expanding ring <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a combination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, in which, unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tensioning means are formed by a threaded nut <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a variant in which the tensioning members <b>24</b> do not (each) have, as has been the case so far, a first, radial wedge surface <b>26</b> and a second, conical wedge surface <b>28</b>, but rather a first, conical wedge surface <b>26</b> and a second, radial wedge surface <b>28</b>. It goes without saying that the first clamping surface <b>6</b> of the first component <b>2</b> corresponds to the second, conical wedge surface <b>28</b> and is thus likewise conically formed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also shows that the retaining ring <b>100</b>, which was explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, can be replaced by a radial bearing collar <b>110</b> in the first clamping surface <b>6</b>, the design of the wedge surfaces in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> being particularly well-suited to this. In principle, however, even with a first clamping surface running radially in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>, it is still possible to provide a radial bearing collar in order to achieve the function of preventing the arrangement from coming completely loose.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a set of tensioning members <b>120</b> in accordance with the invention, consisting of four tensioning members <b>24</b> which are formed by dividing a rotationally symmetrical ring with a cross-section in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>along two parallel secant sections <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>. Each individual tensioning member <b>24</b> has, similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first radial wedge surface <b>26</b>, which could also be formed outwardly conically (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a second, outwardly conical wedge surface <b>28</b>, which could also be formed radially (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), and a third wedge surface <b>30</b>, formed inwardly conically, which could also be formed axis-cylindrically, as has been explained in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A major advantage of the set of tensioning members <b>120</b> according to the invention consists in the fact that the original ring is not divided into sectors along radial planes, but along parallel secant planes, which are spaced apart, so that the tensioning members can be assembled with the minimum spacing from one another.</p>
