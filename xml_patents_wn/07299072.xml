<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wireless local area network (LAN), and more particularly to a multi-sector wireless LAN.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A wireless LAN in compliance with IEEE 802.11 standard, for example, has a problem in that, when a server or the like on a wired LAN communicates with a mobile wireless terminal over the wireless LAN, the frequency band to be used by a wireless base station or access point (AP) is narrower than that of the wired LAN. In a wired LAN in compliance with 100 Base-T, the maximum transmission rate is 100 Mbps, and the maximum effective transmission rate is about 80 to 90 Mbps. In contrast, in a wireless LAN employing the OFDM scheme in the 5.2 GHz band in compliance with IEEE 802.11a, the maximum transmission rate is 54 Mbps, and the maximum effective transmission rate is about 20 Mbps. In a wireless LAN employing the spread spectrum scheme of 2.4 GHz band in compliance with IEEE 802.11b, which is most widely used, the maximum transmission rate is 11 Mbps, and the maximum effective transfer rate is about 5 Mbps.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that, in order to address the problem above, an area covered by the base station is divided into a plurality of respective small sectors with a plurality of respective directive antennas of the base station. As long as the sectors are completely separated from one another and are not subject to interference with one another, the separate communications in the respective sectors can be provided concurrently, and the throughput of each terminal in each sector is improved. In the mobile communication system, the frequencies allocated to the respective sectors are typically adjusted between the adjacent sectors to reduce interference between the adjacent sectors. In the wireless LAN, however, the number of channels available without causing interference is limited, and hence it is not desirable to allocate a plurality of channels to one base station.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Kawabata et al. in Japanese Patent Publication JP-A-2000-59287 laid-open on Feb. 25, 2000, for example, disclose a mobile wireless communication system which includes wireless base stations and terminal stations provided with respective directive antennas. The base station has a directivity determining pattern for setting the directivity of its antenna in accordance with timings. Neighboring base stations using the same frequency use different directivity determining patterns. Remote base stations repeatedly use the same directivity determining patterns. The directivity determining patterns are determined by associating the directivities of the antennas with timings which have been derived by equally dividing the frames of communication channels by the number of directivity determining patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Toshimitsu et al. in Japanese Patent Publication JP-A-2001-309424 laid-open on Nov. 2, 2001, for example, disclose a wireless base station which transfers signals in the form of time-division multiplexed frames to and from a plurality of wireless terminals. The wireless base station includes: a beam forming section which simultaneously forms a plurality of spatially divided beams, a plurality of antenna elements for radiating the beams toward the terminals to transfer signals to and from the terminals, and a scheduling processing section for allocating communication bands to the respective wireless terminals for a plurality of frames corresponding to at least one of the beams in a manner to avoid mutual interference between the signals to be transferred in different frames.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Yano et al., Communication Society Conference of The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers 2002, B-8-186 to 189, pp.483-486, proposes integral management of a plurality of base stations having respective directive beams, so that the throughput is improved while avoiding interference between the base stations. In this case, however, the protocol of the wireless LAN is specialized, and hence existing terminals can not access the base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventor has recognized that the throughput per wireless terminal can be improved, by dividing an area covered by a wireless base station into a plurality of sectors, causing the base station using respective directive antennas to communicate with the wireless terminals in the respective sectors, and allocating communications to the adjacent sectors in a time divisional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is to increase the throughput per terminal in a wireless LAN.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the invention is to enable a larger number of wireless terminals over a wireless LAN to communicate with a base station in a narrow frequency band.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for a wireless base station is adapted to communicate with a plurality of wireless terminals in_a_plurality of sectors, and comprises a communication control unit, and a plurality of transceivers associated with the sectors, respectively. The transceivers have respective directive antennas associated with the respective sectors. During a first period of time, the communication control unit enables one or more of the plurality of transceivers that are associated with respective one or more of the plurality of sectors that are not adjacent to each other, to communicate with wireless terminals, and the communication control unit disables remaining one or more transceivers other than the enabled one or more transceivers, from communicating with wireless terminals. During a second period of time following the first period of time, the communication control unit enables further one or more of the plurality of transceivers that are associated with respective further one or more of the plurality of sectors that are not adjacent to each other, to communicate with wireless terminals, in which the further one or more transceivers are disabled in the first period of time from communicating, and the communication control unit disables further remaining one or more transceivers other than the enabled further one or more transceivers, from communicating with wireless terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a wireless terminal adapted to communicate with a wireless base station in any one of a plurality of sectors, the wireless terminal comprises a control unit for communicating with the wireless base station during a first period of time, receiving a packet containing a description representative of a length of a second period of time subsequent to the first period of time, and for disabling transmission during the second period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also relates to a program for an apparatus in such a wireless base station.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention also relates to a method for communication in such a wireless base station.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention also relates to a method for communication in such a wireless terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the invention, the throughput per terminal can be increased in a wireless LAN, and a larger number of wireless terminals over a wireless LAN can communicate with a base station in a narrow frequency band.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a wireless LAN in accordance with the principle of the present invention. The wireless LAN is comprised of a wireless base station or access point (AP) <b>10</b>, and a plurality of mobile wireless terminals or stations <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, . . . and <b>33</b>, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or notebook personal computers (PC). The wireless base station <b>10</b> pre-divides an outdoor or indoor area in which it communicates with the mobile wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b>, into an even number 2N, e.g. eight, of sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>2</b>, . . . and #<b>8</b> with respect to the angle. The wireless base station allocates its separate wireless or radio transceivers having respective directive antennas to the sectors, respectively. For example, in one channel of the 2.4 GHz band in compliance with IEEE 802.11b, or in one channel of the 5.2 GHz band in compliance with IEEE 802.11a, the wireless base station communicates with the mobile wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b> in the sectors #<b>1</b> to #<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows overlaps <b>40</b> between the ranges of coverage of the transceivers of the wireless base station <b>10</b>, each overlap appearing in the vicinity of a boundary between two different adjacent ones of the sectors #<b>1</b> to #<b>8</b>. Thus, when the wireless base station <b>10</b>, using all of the directive antennas, simultaneously and independently communicates with the mobile wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b> in all of the sectors, RF signals may be subject to interference, disturbance or crosstalk in the overlaps <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with the invention, the wireless base station <b>10</b> is set to be in an enabled mode of communication during one period of time ti for odd-numbered sectors which are not adjacent to each other, to communicate with the mobile wireless terminals <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, and it is set to be in an enabled mode of communication during another period of time t<sub>i+1 </sub>for even-numbered sectors which are not adjacent to each other, to communicate with the mobile wireless terminals <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. This prevents RF signals from being subject to interference, disturbance or crosstalk, which may occur in the communication with the wireless terminals in the overlaps <b>40</b> between the adjacent sectors. Thus the wireless base station <b>10</b> can simultaneously communicate with the wireless terminals in the plurality, N, of sectors in the same frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As long as the interference does not occur between the sectors which are not adjacent to each other or every second sectors, the number of sectors can be determined to be larger as the total number of wireless terminals becomes larger, to thereby allow the wireless base station <b>10</b> to communicate with a larger number of wireless terminals in the same frequency band. When interference occurs even between every second sectors, the communications may be simultaneously implemented in a set of every third sectors during one period of time. In this case, during a subsequent period of time, the communications may be simultaneously implemented in another set of every third sectors, and, during a further subsequent period of time, the communications may be simultaneously implemented in a further set of every third sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the configuration of the wireless base station <b>10</b>.

The transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, . . . and <b>316</b> are coupled to respective directive antennas <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, . . . and <b>346</b>. The directive antennas <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, . . . and <b>346</b> are associated with the sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>2</b>, . . . and #<b>8</b>, respectively.

In this enabled mode of all-sector communication, the communication control unit <b>32</b> of the wireless base station <b>10</b> sequentially communicates with all of the wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b>, to determine locations of the wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b> in the sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During a second period of time t<sub>1 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the communication pattern P<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is established, and the every second, odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b> are caused to be in the enabled mode of communication, so that the odd-numbered transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> of the wireless base station <b>10</b> are enabled to communicate with the wireless terminals <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>. During the second period of time t<sub>1</sub>, the even-numbered sectors #<b>2</b>, #<b>4</b>, #<b>6</b> and #<b>8</b> are caused to be in a disabled mode of communication, so that the communication control unit <b>32</b> disables the even-numbered transceivers <b>304</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>316</b> of the wireless base station <b>10</b> from communicating with the wireless terminals <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>.</p>

During the third period of time t<sub>2</sub>, the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b> are caused to be in the disabled mode of communication, so that the communication control unit <b>32</b> disables the odd-numbered transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> of the wireless base station <b>10</b> from communicating with the wireless terminals <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">During a fourth period of time t<sub>3</sub>, the communication pattern P<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> similar to that during the second period of time t<sub>1 </sub>is established again in the sectors #<b>1</b> to #<b>8</b>. During a fifth period of time t<sub>4</sub>, the communication pattern P<b>2</b> similar to that during the third period of time t<sub>2 </sub>is established again in the sectors #<b>1</b> to #<b>8</b>. The sequence of the communication patterns P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref> may be sequentially repeated once or more. When a wireless terminal is moved from one sector to another sector, the other sector in which the wireless terminal is located is identified in the enabled mode of all-sector communication (P<b>0</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> during the next period of time t<sub>0</sub>, whereby the moved wireless terminal is enabled to communicate with the base station <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus the pattern P<b>1</b> which represents a combination of the enabled mode of communication in the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b> with the disabled mode of communication in the even-numbered sectors #<b>2</b>, #<b>4</b>, #<b>6</b> and #<b>8</b>, and the other pattern P<b>2</b> which represents a combination of the disabled mode of communication in the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b> in combination with the enabled mode of communication in the even-numbered sectors #<b>2</b>, #<b>4</b>, #<b>6</b> and #<b>8</b> are sequentially and alternately produced. Thus, the RF signals can be prevented from being subject to interference, disturbance and crosstalk in the vicinity of the boundary between the adjacent sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a communication procedure for the time-division multi-sector wireless LAN which is implemented by the communication control unit <b>32</b> of the wireless base station <b>10</b>, in accordance with the invention. At Step <b>502</b>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> starts the time-division multi-sector wireless LAN communication. At Step <b>504</b>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> enters into the enabled mode of all-sector communication of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in which it sequentially communicates with all of the wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b> in the sectors #<b>1</b> to #<b>8</b>, using all of the transceivers <b>302</b> to <b>316</b>, to detect current locations of the wireless terminals in the respective sectors. For this purpose, under the control of the communication control unit <b>32</b>, the transceivers <b>302</b> to <b>316</b> polls the wireless terminals <b>21</b> to <b>33</b> with using a location determining packet to allow them to sequentially send responses. In accordance with the identification of the transceiver (e.g., the transceiver <b>302</b>) of the base station <b>10</b> that has received the response, it is determined which one of the sectors (e.g., the sector #<b>1</b> ) the wireless terminal (e.g., the terminal <b>21</b>) that has sent the response is located in, and then the identification code of the wireless terminal located in the determined sector is recorded in the location management table <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When two adjacent transceivers receive a response from the same wireless terminal, the communication control unit <b>32</b> may determine which one of the sectors the wireless terminal is located in, in accordance with the received power levels of the received RF signals from the same wireless terminal in the respective transceivers. Alternatively, the communication control unit <b>32</b> may determine which one of the sectors the wireless terminal is currently located in, in view of the sector in which the wireless terminal is previously located. For example, the sector which the wireless terminal is previously located in may be determined as the current sector. Alternatively, it may be predicted that the wireless terminal will move from one of the sectors to the other sector, and for example the other sector may be determined as the current sector.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At Step <b>506</b>, in the last portion of the period of time to in the mode of all-sector communication and before the switching time, the communication control unit <b>32</b> causes the wireless transceivers <b>304</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>316</b> to broadcast a switching packet indicative of disabling communication to the wireless terminals <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> in the even-numbered sectors #<b>2</b>, #<b>4</b>, #<b>6</b> and #<b>8</b>. The switching packet contains data indicating the time when the next enabled mode of communication is established, such as the length of the period of disabled communication, the length of the period of time to be elapsed before the communication resumes, or time of the day when the communication resumes.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At Step <b>508</b>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> disables the transceivers <b>304</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>316</b> from transmitting an RF signal in the even-numbered sectors #<b>2</b>, #<b>4</b>, #<b>6</b> and #<b>8</b>, so that communications between the transceivers <b>304</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>316</b> and the wireless terminals <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> are disabled. In the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b>, the transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> transmit and receive data to and from the wireless terminals <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>. When the transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> receive the RF signals from the wireless terminals in the sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> determines which ones of the sectors the wireless terminals are located in, in accordance with the identification codes of the wireless terminals. When the wireless terminal has changed its location in the sectors, the communication control unit <b>32</b> updates the location management table <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At Step <b>510</b>, similarly to the operation in Step <b>506</b>, in the last portion of the period of time t<sub>1 </sub>during which the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b> are in the enabled mode of communication, and before the switching time, the communication control unit <b>32</b> causes the wireless transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> to broadcast a switching packet indicative of disabling transmission to the wireless terminals <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> in the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At Step <b>512</b>, similarly to the operation in Step <b>508</b>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> disables the transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> from transmitting an RF signal in the odd-numbered sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b>, so that communications between the transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> and the wireless terminals <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> are disabled.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At Step <b>514</b>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> determines whether Steps <b>506</b> to <b>514</b> have been repeatedly executed a predetermined number, M, of times. The predetermined number M is an arbitrary integer of one or larger. As the predetermined number M becomes larger and hence the frequency of occurrences of the mode of all-sector communication becomes lower, the efficiency of communication becomes higher. On the other hand, as the predetermined number M becomes smaller and hence the frequency of occurrences of the mode of all-sector communication becomes higher, the number of wireless terminals whose current locations in the sectors are not known because of the movement between the sectors becomes smaller. If it is determined that the steps have not been repeatedly executed the predetermined number of times, the procedure returns to Step <b>504</b>. If it is determined that the steps have been repeatedly executed the predetermined number of times, the communication control unit <b>32</b> at Step <b>516</b> switches all the transceivers <b>302</b> to <b>316</b> to enter the enabled mode of all-sector communication of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Thereafter, the procedure returns to Step <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When a wireless terminal is moved from a sector in the disabled mode of communication, in which it has been located, into another sector in the enabled mode of communication, and the moved wireless terminal in the sector in the enabled mode of communication further transmits a signal to the transceiver, the communication control unit <b>32</b> detects the movement or location of the wireless terminal in accordance with its identification code contained in the transmitted signal, and updates the location management table <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When a wireless terminal is moved from one sector in the enabled mode of communication, in which it has been located for a while, to another sector in the disabled mode of communication, and even if the communication control unit <b>32</b> tries to transmit data via the transceiver to the wireless terminal previously located in the sector in the enabled mode of communication, the communication control unit <b>32</b> cannot receive a response from it, and hence cannot determine the location of the wireless terminal. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the communication control unit <b>32</b> prepares a list of wireless terminals whose current locations in the sectors are not known. Thereafter, when all of the sectors are in the enabled mode of all-sector communication, the communication control unit <b>32</b> preferentially transmits a packet for determining the locations to the wireless terminals whose locations cannot have been determined, or polls the wireless terminals to cause them to send responses, to thereby detect the movement or locations of the wireless terminals. The location management table <b>324</b> is then updated. Thereafter, if the location of the wireless terminal cannot be determined, the identification code of the wireless terminal is deleted from the table <b>324</b> immediately or after elapse of a predetermined period of time.</p>

If it is determined that it is not time to start carrier detection, the procedure returns to Step <b>604</b> and Steps <b>604</b> and <b>606</b> are repeated until it becomes time to start carrier detection.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If it is determined at Step <b>610</b> that no carrier or the RF signal is transmitted in each sector, the communication control unit <b>32</b> broadcasts a packet P<sub>SW </sub>indicative of switching from the enabled mode of communication to the disabled mode of communication, to the wireless terminals in the sectors, when the carrier is not detected, or when the minimum time interval Δ elapses after the carrier is not detected. The communication control unit <b>32</b> completes the broadcasting of the switching packet P<sub>SW </sub>before the switching time t<sub>SW </sub>at the latest. Accordingly, the time t<sub>CS </sub>of detecting the carrier is determined so that the length of time (t<sub>SW</sub>−t<sub>CS</sub>) is longer than the length of time (the maximum packet length+the length of an ACK packet+t<sub>p</sub>+3×Δ). While a certain wireless terminal transmits signals at the minimum packet intervals Δ (e.g., in fragmentation), The communication control unit <b>32</b> transmits the switching packet P<sub>SW </sub>instead of transmitting an ACK back. When the wireless terminal next enters into the enabled mode of communication of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> or <b>4</b>C, it retransmits the data which it has been failed to transmit.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If it is determined at Step <b>806</b> that it is time to start the enabled mode of communication, the communication control unit <b>32</b> and the wireless terminals enable at Step <b>808</b> communications in the even-numbered or the odd-numbered sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the communication conditions around the switching time t<sub>SW </sub>between the enabled mode of communication and the disabled mode of communication in the sectors #<b>1</b> to #<b>8</b>. In each of the sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b> in the enabled mode of communication, each of the transceivers <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>316</b> transmits and receives data to and from one wireless terminal in the sector at an arbitrary time. Then the ACK is transmitted back. In the sectors #<b>1</b>, #<b>3</b>, #<b>5</b> and #<b>7</b>, at the carrier detection time t<sub>CS</sub>, the transceivers in the respective sectors start the detection of the received carriers. After the ACK is transmitted back, the communication control unit <b>32</b> causes the corresponding transceivers in the sectors to broadcast the switching packet P<sub>SW </sub>for switching between the periods of time.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Accordingly, the transceivers and the wireless terminals in the sectors of the enabled mode of communication stop transmission before the switching time t<sub>SW</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The sectors in the disabled mode of communication enter into the enabled mode of communication after the switching time t<sub>SW</sub>, so that the transceivers and the wireless terminals in the sectors resume transmission and reception.</p>
