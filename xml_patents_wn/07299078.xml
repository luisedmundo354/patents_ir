<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a mobile terminal, and more particularly to a mobile terminal implementing surround-sound through installation of a plurality of speakers at the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mobile terminals have recently been developed which allow users to download music files or video clips from the Internet as well as transmit or receive voice signals and access the Internet. In fact, the functionality of mobile terminals are being extended every day.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a related-art mobile terminal which includes a main body <b>110</b> having various circuit components installed therein, a menu button <b>102</b> and a dial button <b>104</b> provided at its front surface, a battery <b>106</b> mounted at its rear surface, and a folder <b>120</b> rotatably connected by a hinge connection unit <b>112</b> to the main body and having an inner LCD <b>116</b> for displaying user-desired information.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A microphone <b>122</b> is installed at the main body to transmit a voice signal of a user. In addition to the inner LCD <b>116</b>, a receiver <b>126</b> is mounted at an inner side of the folder for transferring the voice of another party to the user. At an outer side of the folder, an outer LCD <b>130</b> is attached and two speakers <b>124</b> for implementing three-dimensional surround-sound are installed with a certain spacing interval therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the related-art mobile terminal downloads a music file or video clip and executes it, three-dimensional surround-sound is implemented through the two speakers <b>124</b>. However, since the two speakers are fixed within folder <b>120</b>, the spacing distance between the two speakers significantly limited. That is, because the amount by which the width of the folder can be increased is limited, it is difficult to space the two speakers a significant distance apart. This causes a problem in that the user can not feel the three-dimensional surround-sound effect. Also, with the related-art arrangement, even if the spacing can be increased, the surround-sound effect can be hardly perceived, by the user with the two speakers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to solve one or more problems of the related-art and/or to achieve at least one of the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile terminal with enhanced product value by slidably installing speakers at a folder, to thereby widen the distance between the speakers and thus to maximize the three-dimensional surround-sound effect.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve these and other objects and advantages, the present invention provides a mobile terminal which according to one preferred embodiment includes: a folder hinged at a main body and an LCD attached thereto, a plurality of speakers (at least two) mounted at the folder for implementing three-dimensional surround-sound, and a sliding unit for slidably extending a position of at least one of the speakers relative to the folder when the speakers produce the three-dimensional surround-sound effect.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The speakers are slidably mounted on a mounting part formed at an inner surface of the folder. The following features are provided on the surface of the mounting part: a first connection terminal electrically connected to the speaker when the speaker is in a state of having been received in the folder, and a second connection terminal electrically connected to the speaker when the speaker is in a state of having been moved in a width direction of the folder. The speakers are preferably disposed to face the mounting part, and at least one of the speakers slides in a predetermined (e.g., width) direction of the folder.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The speaker includes a speaker case slidably disposed at the mounting part formed at the folder; a sound generator installed in the speaker case and generating a sound; and a speaker terminal formed at a lower surface of the speaker case and electrically connected one of the first connection terminal and the second connection terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The sliding unit includes: a guide rail formed in a width direction of the folder at the mounting part of the folder; and a guide groove formed at a lower surface of the speaker case and slidably inserted into the guide rail.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A stopper is formed between the speaker case and the mounting part in order to prevent the speaker from releasing from the folder when the speaker is slidably moved.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each speaker unit may also include a stopper arrangement formed between the speaker case <b>40</b> and mounting part <b>32</b>. The stopper arrangements are provided to prevent the speakers <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> from releasing from the folder <b>26</b> after sliding for more than a predetermined distance. Each of the stopper arrangements includes a first stopper <b>56</b> protruding from the surface of the mounting part <b>32</b> and a second stopper <b>58</b> protruding from a lower surface of the speaker case <b>40</b>, which is caught by the first stopper when the speakers slide as long as the predetermined distance. While these stopper arrangements are preferable, other stopper arrangements may alternatively be used. Operation of the aforementioned embodiment of the mobile terminal will now be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show different operational states of the mobile terminal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if the mobile terminal is used for a voice transmission and reception or for purposes other than the three-dimensional surround-sound, the speakers <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are disposed in a retracted position, e.g., in contact with each other, on mounting part <b>32</b> of the folder. In this case, speaker terminal <b>44</b> formed at the lower surface of the speaker case <b>40</b> contacts the first connection terminal <b>34</b> in order to input an electric signal into the speakers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, if a user desires to implement three-dimensional surround-sound, the user may take and pull the speaker case <b>40</b> in the width direction of the folder. As a result of these pulling forces, the speaker case <b>40</b> slides outwardly from the folder along guide rail <b>48</b> formed at the mounting part, thereby widening the space between the speakers. In this extended position, the speakers are prevented from falling out of the folder as a result of the first stopper <b>56</b> formed at the mounting part contacting the second speaker <b>58</b> formed at the speaker case <b>40</b>. In this position, speaker terminal <b>44</b> contacts the second connection terminal <b>36</b> formed at the mounting part <b>32</b>. If desired, the sliding unit may be configured so that only one of the speakers slides relative to one or more other speakers, which, for example, may be placed at a fixed position in the folder.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a perspective view of a mobile terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the speakers are preferably installed at an inner side of the folder. That is, a receiver <b>80</b> for receiving a voice from another party is installed at a center of the inner side of the folder <b>26</b>, and plurality of speakers (e.g., two) <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> are installed to be movable in a width direction of the folder at respective sides of the receiver. A sliding unit for moving the speakers may be the same as the sliding unit of the former embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the mobile terminal, a voice of the other party is received through the receiver <b>80</b> mounted at an inner side of the folder, and three-dimensional surround-sound is implemented by moving the speakers apart from one another in the width direction to widen the space between the speakers.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As so far described, the mobile terminal of the present invention has the following advantages. For example, in implementing three-dimensional surround-sound at least one of a plurality of speakers slides in a width direction of the folder to widen the space between the speakers. As a result, three-dimensional surround-sound effect can be maximized and thus performance of the mobile terminal can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. It should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.</p>
