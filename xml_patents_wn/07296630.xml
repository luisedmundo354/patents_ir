<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus for raising or lowering a tubular in a well wherein bails are conventionally coupled to elevator ears and locking assemblies secured to the outer sides of the lower bail eyes for remote controlled clamping to nipples integral with and extending from the elevator ears. The locking assemblies contain upper and lower jaws which, by a remotely controlled actuator, move in linear relation to each other and have concave clamping surfaces which join together to form a circular opening for receiving the elevator ear nipples. The nipples have enlarged diameters at their distal ends to prevent removal from the closed jaws. A remotely controlled link spreading mechanism spreads the bails to accommodate an elevator. Elevator ears may contain internal conduits for communication of power and control signals between the suspended elevator and the bails. The passages mate with a remotely actuated connector assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to drilling equipment used particularly in the hydrocarbon production industry and specifically to a method and apparatus for mechanized coupling and locking of bails to elevator ears and the concomitant coupling of power and control circuits between the bails and the suspended elevator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the hydrocarbon production industry, tubular goods, including drill strings, casings and tubing and often referred to simply as tubulars, must at varying stages be run, i.e. lowered, into or raised from a well. Elevators are devices which support the tubular for the purpose of raising or lowing it. An elevator may clamp along the side of a tubular using slips and dies to exert a radial clamping force on the tubular wall, or an elevator may use a bushing to support the tubular at the lower lip of a box connector. The latter method is preferable for deep water production as a slip can exert damaging crushing forces on the tubular under high hook loads.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show one typical elevator setup of prior art where an elevator (<b>10</b>) is suspended from a top drive mechanism (<b>9</b>) by a pair of bails, or links (<b>14</b>), which have eyes (<b>16</b>, <b>18</b>) at both ends. The top drive mechanism (<b>9</b>) is in turn suspended by a traveling block (<b>12</b>) and wire rope (<b>19</b>) rigged from a crown block (not shown) located in the top of the drilling rig. The upper eyes (<b>16</b>) of the pair of bails (<b>14</b>) are hooked to the link supports (<b>20</b>) of the top drive (<b>9</b>), and the lower eyes (<b>18</b>) of the pair of bails (<b>14</b>) are hooked to the ears (<b>22</b>) protruding from the elevator (<b>10</b>). The bails (<b>14</b>) are secured to the elevator ears (<b>22</b>) by locking mechanisms (<b>25</b>) to prevent the bails (<b>14</b>) from inadvertently becoming uncoupled from the elevator (<b>10</b>). The elevator (<b>10</b>) and the supported tubular (<b>24</b>) are thus raised and lowered by the traveling block (<b>12</b>)/top drive (<b>9</b>) and bails (<b>14</b>). All the components in this series are designed to carry the expected loads.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The top drive (<b>9</b>) is used in place of a conventional rotary table and Kelly bushing to rotate the tubular during rotary drilling. Using hydraulic or electric motors (<b>11</b>) and a gear train (<b>13</b>) suspended above the drill string (<b>24</b>) enables the drill string to be rotated continuously while being lowered into or raised from a well. The top drive mechanism slides up and down along frame members (<b>15</b>) to check rotation of the top drive in reaction to the spinning of the tubular (<b>24</b>) while allowing free vertical movement of the device. Although a top drive mechanism (<b>9</b>) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, an elevator may alternatively be suspended directly from the traveling block (<b>12</b>) using links (<b>14</b>). In this case, the drilling platform is preferably equipped with a rotary table.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A spider, much like an elevator, is a device which holds a tubular to prevent it from descending into a well when it is not held by an elevator. Unlike an elevator, however, the spider is designed to remain on the drilling deck and is not moved vertically. When the elevator, connected to the traveling block, nears its high limit of travel (when raising a tubular) or its low limit or travel (when running a tubular), it must be repositioned in order to continue the operation. The spider holds the tubular prior to the elevator releasing the tubular. Thus, the tubular is held in place while the elevator is repositioned. Once the elevator holds the tubular at a new location, the spider is disengaged allowing the tubular to freely pass through the spider or for the spider to be moved completely clear of the tubular.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is common practice to use a first elevator as a temporary substitute for a spider to support a tubular and a second elevator, coupled to the traveling block, to lower the tubular string. When the second traveling elevator is holding the tubular, the first elevator is moved clear of the tubular. The second elevator and tubular are lowered. When the second elevator has been lowered to the rig floor, the bails are removed from the second elevator and attached to the nearby first elevator. The second elevator now acts as the spider, while the first elevator is repositioned towards the top of the string where it is clamped to the tubular. The second elevator releases the tubular and is moved clear of the tubular, and the first elevator lowers the tubular into the well. When the first elevator reaches the rig floor, the elevators are again swapped in a process sometimes referred to as circulating the elevators. The same process is used in a reverse sequence for raising a tubular. Because both elevators change their location continuously during this process, there is no need for elevator/spider differentiation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the prior art, coupling the bails to the elevators is done in a time-consuming labor-intensive manual process. Extreme care must be taken when working with the heavy bails in order to avoid possibly severe injury to the rigger. Further, each bail must be securely fixed to the corresponding elevator ear, requiring another time-consuming step in the rigging process of manually engaging a locking device. A method to automate the repeated coupling, locking, unlocking, uncoupling of bails and elevators is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, many elevators used today employ powered internal mechanisms, e.g., power doors and/or power slips. When circulating the elevators, power and control lines to the elevators can interfere with deck operations, becoming entangled or snagging on objects. However, uncoupling and re-coupling supply and control lines is also a burdensome manual process, particularly if the elevator is hydraulically operated. A method which simplifies the supply of power to the elevators when circulating the elevators is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">3. Identification of Objects of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A primary object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for increasing the efficiency of drilling operations by automating the process of connecting and locking bails or links to an elevator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus which prevents the need for riggers or other personnel to manually operate the bails or the elevator for coupling or uncoupling the two.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for providing power and control to a suspended elevator in a manner which does not cause power or control lines to hamper or otherwise interfere with deck operations.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for automatically coupling and uncoupling power and control lines to an elevator when the elevator is coupled or uncoupled to bails or links.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of the invention is to promote operator safety by providing for total hands-free operation of the elevator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The objects identified above, as well as other features and advantages of the invention are incorporated in a method and apparatus for raising or lowering a tubular in a well. One embodiment preferably includes an elevator for holding a tubular and designed to be suspended from a traveling block or a top drive mechanism by a pair of bails or links. The bails have eyes for being conventionally coupled to elevator ears which extend from the elevator, and additionally, the bails each have a locking assembly, secured to the outer side of the lower bail eye, which clamps to the distal end of the elevator ear for capturing the ear within the eye of the bail without the need for manual handling by riggers or other personnel. Each bail locking assembly contains upper and lower jaws having concave clamping profiles which join together to form a generally circular opening. The upper and lower jaws move in linear relation to one another. When the upper and lower jaws abut, they clamp tightly around a nipple which protrudes from the distal end of the elevator ear. The nipple has a radially extending protuberance at the tip which is larger in diameter than the circular opening formed by the closed jaws which prevents the captured nipple from being pulled from the closed jaws. When the distance between the upper and lower jaws is increased, the size of the opening increases to allow the nipple, including its enlarged end, to freely pass through. The upper and lower jaws are controlled by an actuator equipped for remote operation, so that manual intervention is not required lock the bails to the elevator.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, a link spreading mechanism, consisting of an actuator coupled between the upper portion of the pair of bails, is designed to spread the two bails apart so that they may freely accept an elevator without manual handling by riggers. The link spreading actuator then contracts to bring the bails together with the lower bail eyes receiving the bail posts.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, one or more elevator ears may contain one or more internal conduits for communication of power and control signals between the suspended elevator and the bails. The passages exit the elevator ear at ports located in the distal face of the ear, which is designed to mate with a multi-coupling system connector assembly. The corresponding bail locking assembly is equipped with the multi-coupling system connector assembly which mates with the conduits by a remotely controlled actuator. Elevator control and power circuits are routed through the internal conduits of an elevator ear for automated coupling to the multi-coupling system connector assembly, which is connected to the power and control source for the elevator through one or more conduits strapped alongside the bail.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, the whole process of coupling and uncoupling the elevator, including spreading and drawing in the bails, locking and unlocking the bail eyes to and from the elevator bail posts, and coupling and uncoupling power and control lines to the elevator, is preferably controlled remotely and can be automated. The method preferably uses hydraulic actuators for the link spreading device, the bail locking assemblies, and the optional bail post connector assemblies.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> illustrate a top drive mechanism <b>58</b> according to one embodiment of the invention equipped with a link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> for hands-free movement of the suspended links <b>56</b>. Top drive <b>58</b> is similar to the prior art top drive <b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, preferably having a motor <b>11</b>, gear train <b>13</b>, link supports <b>20</b>, and sliding frame members <b>15</b>. Additionally, the top drive <b>58</b> may include an air cooling system (not shown), a rotary hose connection (not shown), a rotary manifold (<b>51</b>), and a lower well control valve (<b>71</b>). As these top drive features are well known in the art, they are not discussed further herein. The link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> is ideally disposed at the lower portion of the top drive <b>58</b> near the link supports <b>20</b>. The link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> preferably includes an inverted generally U-shaped frame <b>77</b> with each distal end of frame <b>77</b> acting as a fulcrum for a rigidly connected curved control arm <b>79</b>/lever <b>83</b> pair. The distal end of each curved control arm <b>79</b> is coupled to a longitudinal portion of one of the links <b>56</b> by a collar <b>81</b>. The distal end of each lever <b>83</b> is pivotably coupled to a hydraulic actuator <b>80</b> located in the center of the U-shaped frame <b>77</b>. The hydraulic actuator <b>80</b> moves the two levers <b>83</b>, which in turn move the control arms <b>79</b> and the links <b>56</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> illustrate the top drive <b>58</b> with the link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> in the contracted position, wherein the lower eyes <b>62</b> of links <b>56</b> are engaged about the ears <b>54</b> of elevator <b>50</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates top drive <b>58</b> with the link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> in an expanded position, wherein the lower eyes <b>62</b> of links <b>56</b> are spread apart away from the elevator ears <b>54</b>. Although the link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> is shown as part of a top drive mechanism <b>58</b>, the link spreader mechanism may be attached directly to the traveling block <b>12</b> if a top drive mechanism is not used. Other suitable mechanical arrangements and actuators may be used for the link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> in place of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown and includes an elevator <b>50</b> for holding a tubular <b>52</b>, at least two structural post-style elevator ears <b>54</b>, one bail <b>56</b> for each elevator ear <b>54</b> for suspending the elevator <b>50</b> from link supports <b>20</b> on top drive <b>58</b>, a bail locking assembly <b>60</b> attached to the outer side of the lower eye <b>62</b> of each bail <b>56</b>, and one or more optional multi-coupling system (MCS) connector assemblies <b>64</b> for communication of power and control signals with the suspended elevator <b>50</b>. Elevators are well known in the art, and the specific construction of the elevator is not discussed further, except to specify that the elevator has post-style elevator ears <b>54</b> as described herein and may utilize a slip assembly, a bushing for seating a box connector profile, or other means to hold a tubular <b>52</b>. The elevator ears <b>54</b> are preferably cast steel, integral with the elevator frame, and sized to withstand the expected loads with adequate safety margin. The elevator <b>50</b> may have electric, pneumatic, or preferably hydraulic systems therein. Control and power circuits are preferably routed through the center portion of one or more elevator ears <b>54</b> for quick coupling to a MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>, which is in turn connected to the power and control source(s) for the elevator <b>50</b> through one or more conduits <b>66</b> strapped along side the bail(s) <b>56</b>. Bails are also well known in the art, and for that reason the construction of the bails <b>56</b> is not discussed further. The lower eyes <b>62</b> of the bails <b>56</b> receive the elevator ears <b>54</b> and cradle them along concave surfaces <b>68</b> on ears <b>54</b>. Each elevator ear <b>54</b> contains a nipple <b>70</b> for being received into and locked within the bail locking assembly <b>60</b> which is attached to the outer side of the lower eye <b>62</b>. The nipple <b>70</b> has a radially extending protuberance at the distal end <b>82</b> which prevents the nipple <b>70</b> pulling axially out of the locked bail locking assembly <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is the link spreading mechanism <b>78</b> incorporated in top drive <b>58</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. The link spreading mechanism <b>78</b> consists of an inverted generally U-shaped frame <b>77</b>, an actuator <b>80</b>, and two levers <b>83</b>, each lever <b>83</b> rigidly fixed to a curved control arm <b>79</b>. The two distal ends of the U-shaped frame <b>77</b> each act as a fulcrum about which the rigid lever/control arm combination pivots. The distal ends of the levers <b>83</b> are moved by actuator <b>80</b>, causing a concomitant movement of the distal ends of the curved control arms <b>79</b>. Because the distal ends of the control arms <b>79</b> are coupled to the links <b>56</b> by collars <b>81</b>, when the actuator <b>80</b> is moved, the links <b>56</b> are moved. The link spreading actuator <b>80</b> is preferably a hydraulic piston/cylinder arrangement. The link spreader mechanism is designed and arranged to extend the two control arms <b>79</b> and attached bails <b>56</b> apart so that the lower bail eyes <b>62</b> may be placed around an elevator <b>50</b> without manual handling by riggers. The link spreading actuator <b>80</b> then draws the bails <b>56</b> together when the lower bail eyes <b>62</b> are positioned to receive the elevator ears <b>54</b>. Top drive <b>58</b> has link supports <b>20</b> which serve as pivot points for the bails <b>56</b>. Because the linear travel of the actuator <b>80</b> near the traveling block <b>58</b> is mechanically amplified at the lower ends of the bails <b>56</b>, the actuator <b>80</b> need not have the capability to extend far in order to sufficiently spread the lower eyes <b>62</b> of the bails. While the link spreading mechanism <b>78</b> has been shown using a linear actuator <b>80</b> and a particular arrangement of linkages and control arms, it is within the scope of the invention to employ other suitable means for spreading the bails <b>56</b>. Although the link spreading mechanism <b>78</b> helps to keep the links <b>56</b> from inadvertently separating from an attached elevator <b>50</b>, the bail locking mechanisms <b>60</b> cooperate with the link spreading mechanism <b>78</b> to provide a much higher level of safety.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are explosion diagrams which illustrate a lower bail eye <b>62</b> (equipped with a bail locking apparatus <b>60</b>) and a corresponding elevator ear <b>54</b> according to one embodiment. The locking assembly <b>60</b> contains an upper jaw <b>72</b> and a lower jaw <b>74</b>. The lower jaw <b>74</b> preferably has two guide posts <b>104</b> fixed thereto, and the upper jaw <b>72</b> has an equal number of guide apertures <b>103</b> formed therethrough. Guide apertures <b>103</b> are positioned and sized to slidingly receive guide posts <b>104</b> so that upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> have a fixed position relative to one another in all but one axis of movement. The upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> each have concave clamping surfaces <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> which form a generally circular aperture when the upper and lower jaws abut together.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, the elevator ears <b>54</b> are generally cylindrical in shape with a concave surface <b>68</b> for mating with the interior surface of lower eye <b>62</b> of the bail <b>56</b>. The system is designed for the lower bail eye <b>62</b> to cradle the elevator ear <b>54</b> along surface <b>68</b>, which allows the ear <b>54</b> to pivot and rotate with respect to the bail <b>56</b>. A nipple portion <b>70</b> of elevator ear <b>54</b> extends past the concave surface <b>68</b> for being received between the concave clamping surfaces <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> of the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the bail locking apparatus <b>60</b>. The nipple <b>70</b> is sized so that it just fits within the aperture formed by the closed jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the bail locking mechanism <b>60</b>. In other words, the upper and lower jaws are designed to join together to clamp tightly around the nipple <b>70</b>. The tip <b>82</b> of the nipple <b>70</b> has a larger diameter than the body of the nipple <b>70</b>. The larger tip <b>82</b> is sized so that it may pass through the open jaws <b>72</b>, <b>72</b> but not the closed jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the bail locking mechanism <b>60</b>. Thus, when the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the bail locking assembly <b>60</b> are shut around the bail post nipple <b>70</b>, the radially extending protuberance at the tip <b>82</b> of nipple <b>70</b> prevents the bail locking assembly <b>60</b>, and thus lower bail eye <b>62</b>, from being removed from the elevator ear <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, one or more actuators <b>105</b> control the relative distance between the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The preferred embodiment uses a hydraulic piston/cylinder arrangement <b>105</b>, although other suitable actuators may be used. Cylinder <b>108</b> is attached to the top of upper jaw <b>72</b>. A piston <b>109</b> is connected to a piston rod <b>110</b>, which is in turn attached to lower jaw <b>74</b> via a bracket <b>112</b> mounted to the outer face of lower jaw <b>74</b>. Upper and lower ports <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> in cylinder <b>108</b> connect to a source of hydraulic fluid (not shown) to operate the piston <b>109</b> within cylinder <b>108</b>. When fluid flows into the cylinder <b>108</b> through lower port <b>114</b>, the piston <b>109</b> is forced upwards, displacing fluid from the cylinder through upper port <b>115</b> and causing the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to clamp together. When the direction of the hydraulic fluid flow is reversed, the jaws open.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the bail locking assembly <b>60</b> includes a frame <b>89</b> having a back plate <b>90</b> and two side plates <b>92</b> mounted thereto. The frame <b>89</b> is supported on bail <b>56</b> by pins <b>96</b> which rest on the outer shoulders of lower eye <b>62</b>. The frame <b>89</b> is secured to the bail <b>56</b> by clamping members <b>132</b>. The black plate <b>90</b> generally does not extend to the lower edges of the side plates <b>92</b> so that the elevator ear <b>54</b> may pass freely between the side plates <b>92</b>. Alternatively, back plate <b>90</b> may extend lower if it contains an aperture or slot <b>93</b> centered between side plates <b>92</b> to accommodate the elevator ear <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, which are slideably interconnected by guide posts <b>104</b> and guide apertures <b>103</b> and where clamping motion, i.e., the distance between the jaws, is controlled by piston/cylinder arrangement <b>105</b> and bracket <b>112</b>, form a complete jaw subassembly <b>94</b> which is slideably housed in frame <b>89</b> between the two side plates <b>92</b>. Bolts <b>98</b> fit through slots <b>100</b> in side plates <b>92</b> and screw into threaded holes <b>97</b> in the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. Thus, the jaw subassembly <b>94</b> is slideably captured by bolts <b>98</b> in slots <b>100</b> of side plates <b>92</b>. If the elevator ear <b>54</b> is positioned clear of the bail locking assembly <b>60</b>, the jaw subassembly <b>94</b> can freely slide up and down between side plates <b>92</b> with bolts <b>98</b> confined by slots <b>100</b>. The distance between the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> is controlled solely by piston/cylinder arrangement <b>105</b> and is not a function of the frame <b>89</b>. Obviously, the amount of travel of jaw subassembly <b>94</b> allowed by slots <b>100</b> is greater when the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are abutted together in the locked position than when they are separated in the open position, because in the abutted position, the bolts <b>98</b> in the upper jaw <b>72</b> and the bolts <b>98</b> in the lower jaw <b>74</b> are spaced closer together than when the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are separated, which allows the abutted jaw subassembly <b>94</b> to slide a further distance in slots <b>100</b> than the jaw subassembly <b>94</b> with jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> in the open separated position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> must be positioned apart by piston/cylinder arrangement <b>105</b> in order to insert elevator ear <b>54</b> into the lower bail eye <b>62</b> and attached bail locking apparatus <b>60</b>. When elevator ear <b>54</b> is inserted in lower eye <b>62</b> of bail <b>56</b> such that the concave surface <b>68</b> transversely aligns with the bail, the elevator ear nipple <b>70</b> transversely aligns between clamping surfaces <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> of the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and the nipple tip <b>82</b> (having the radial protuberance) transversely extends beyond the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. When piston/cylinder arrangement <b>105</b> is actuated in the closing direction by supplying hydraulic fluid to port <b>114</b>, upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> close around nipple <b>70</b> wherever it may be vertically positioned between the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For instance, assume elevator <b>50</b> is seated on the deck of a drilling platform. In order to suspend elevator <b>50</b>, bails <b>56</b> are extended outwards of elevator ears <b>54</b> by link spreader mechanism <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Ideally, when the bails <b>56</b> are drawn inward to receive the elevator ears <b>54</b>, the bails <b>56</b> are positioned so that the elevator ears <b>54</b> are centered within the lower eyes <b>62</b>. When the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the two bail locking assemblies <b>60</b> are drawn together by piston/cylinder arrangements <b>105</b>, the jaws clamp around nipples <b>70</b> of the two elevator ears <b>54</b> with bolts <b>98</b> generally vertically centered in slots <b>100</b>. Before the elevator <b>50</b> can be suspended, the play between the inner lower surfaces of the lower eyes <b>62</b> and the lower concave surfaces <b>68</b> of the elevator ears <b>54</b> must be removed. As traveling block <b>12</b>/top drive <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) is first raised, bails <b>56</b> and attached frames <b>89</b> of bail locking assemblies <b>60</b> move upward while jaw subassemblies <b>94</b> remain stationary, fixed around nipples <b>70</b> of elevator ears <b>54</b> until the ears <b>54</b> are supported by the lower inner surfaces of lower eyes <b>62</b>. Once the play is removed, upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are no longer vertically centered in slots <b>100</b>. Rather, when the elevator <b>50</b> is fully carried by bails <b>56</b> and the jaw subassemblies <b>94</b> are closed around nipples <b>70</b>, the bolts <b>98</b> are positioned near the lower portions of slots <b>100</b>. At these lower bolt positions, angled cross-slots <b>102</b> are formed in the side plates <b>92</b>. Cross slots <b>102</b> allow the suspended elevator <b>50</b>, with elevator ears <b>54</b>, nipples <b>70</b>, and jaw subassemblies <b>94</b> clamped thereto, to pivot with respect to bails <b>56</b>, attached frames <b>89</b>, and side plates <b>92</b>, as described more fully below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">One or more optional hydraulic, pneumatic or electric passages may pass through one or more elevator ears <b>54</b> for powering and controlling the elevator <b>50</b>. The passages exit the elevator ear <b>54</b> at quick connectors <b>84</b> located in the distal face <b>86</b> of the elevator ear <b>54</b>. The quick connectors <b>84</b> and the distal face <b>86</b> are designed to mate with the inner side <b>124</b> of an optional MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>. Bracket <b>112</b> must have an opening <b>130</b> formed therein if use of the optional MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> is desired. The MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> mounts to bracket <b>112</b>. The inner face <b>124</b> of the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> has complementary quick connectors <b>125</b> which mate with the quick connectors <b>84</b> located in the distal face <b>86</b> of nipple <b>70</b>. The MCS connector assembly preferably has one or more guide pins <b>123</b>, and the distal face <b>86</b> of nipple <b>70</b> has complementary guide sockets <b>85</b> for receiving the guide pins <b>123</b> to ensure proper alignment and mating of the quick connector pairs <b>84</b>, <b>125</b> and to protect the quick connector pairs from shear forces and side loads.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of the bail locking assembly <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> attached to the lower eye of bail <b>56</b>, with upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> open and with elevator ear <b>54</b> and nipple <b>70</b> of elevator <b>50</b> (not shown) received therein. The bail locking assembly <b>60</b> includes the optional MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>. The bail locking assembly <b>60</b> includes a frame <b>89</b> having a back plate <b>90</b> and two side plates <b>92</b>. The frame <b>89</b> is supported on bail <b>56</b> by pins <b>96</b> which rest on the shoulders of lower eye <b>62</b>. Upper jaw <b>72</b> and lower jaw <b>74</b> each move up and down between side plates <b>92</b>. Preferably, the upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> each have two bolts or pins <b>98</b> which extend through slots <b>100</b> in the side plates <b>92</b>. Angular cross slots <b>102</b> allow the closed jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, when positioned around a nipple <b>70</b> of a suspended elevator <b>50</b>, to collectively pivot in and out with respect to the frame <b>89</b>. In other words, because when in use the frame <b>89</b> is rigidly attached to the bail <b>56</b> and the jaws are clamped around the bail post nipple <b>70</b>, the angular cross slots <b>102</b> allow the bails <b>56</b> to pivot slightly with respect to the suspended elevator <b>50</b>. Upper jaw <b>72</b> has two vertical holes <b>103</b> which pass completely through it for sliding on guide posts <b>104</b> which are fixed to lower jaw <b>74</b>. Thus, regardless of how the jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> collectively pivot with respect to frame <b>89</b>, upper jaw <b>72</b> and lower jaw <b>74</b> are always in alignment with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are clamped around nipple <b>70</b>, MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>, if installed, mates with elevator ear face <b>86</b>, using guide sockets <b>85</b> and quick connectors <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to establish fluid and/or electrical connections with elevator <b>50</b>. MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> preferably consists of an inner movable cylinder <b>116</b> coaxially disposed within an outer fixed cylinder <b>118</b> and which can be moved axially with respect to the outer cylinder <b>118</b> toward or away from elevator ear <b>54</b>. Inner cylinder <b>116</b> contains one or more longitudinal passages <b>122</b> which are individually connected to the complementary quick connectors <b>123</b> located at the inner end <b>124</b> of the MCS connector assembly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). At the outer end <b>126</b> of inner cylinder <b>116</b>, passages <b>122</b> connect to flexible conduits (not shown) which are preferably routed along side the bails <b>56</b> to connect to elevator power and control sources.</p>

The bail locking assembly <b>60</b> is attached to bail <b>56</b> by a clamp assembly <b>132</b> which is secured about the bail just above the lower eye <b>62</b>. Pins <b>96</b> help to vertically support the locking assembly <b>60</b> on the lower eye <b>62</b>. The upper jaw <b>72</b> and the lower jaw <b>74</b> have complementary concave profiles <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> to form clamping surfaces which when closed fits around nipple <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>) but will not allow bail post tip <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to pull through the clamped jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are perspective views of the bail locking apparatus <b>60</b> according to one embodiment without the optional MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>) installed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the bail locking apparatus <b>60</b> with upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> open, ready to receive elevator ear <b>54</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows elevator ear <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) clamped between upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, which prevents bail eye <b>62</b> from being removed from elevator ear <b>54</b>. The upper jaw <b>72</b> slides on guide cylinders <b>104</b> which are fixed to lower jaw <b>74</b>, and the spacing between the upper and lower jaws is controlled by actuator <b>105</b>. The jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are slideably connected to the frame <b>89</b> by bolts or pins <b>98</b> which extend from the jaws through slots <b>100</b> in side plates <b>92</b>. Angular cross slots <b>102</b> allow the jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to pivot in and out with respect to the frame <b>89</b> in directions <b>145</b>, <b>146</b>, respectively (i.e., radially with respect to tubular <b>52</b> when suspended in the locked position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The degree of freedom in the direction of arrows <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> allowed by cross slots <b>102</b> is preferably +/−4 degrees of pivot. Also, because nipple <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is cylindrical and the aperture formed by clamping surfaces <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> of closed jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> is generally cylindrical, locking assembly <b>60</b> may coaxially rotate about elevator ear <b>54</b> as shown by arrows <b>138</b>. At least fifty degrees of free coaxial rotation is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates how angular cross-slots <b>102</b> allow bails <b>56</b> to pivot in and out with respect to elevator <b>50</b>. The left hand bail <b>56</b>A is pivoted in toward elevator <b>50</b> by θ<sub>A </sub>degrees from vertical. Upper bolt <b>98</b>A, attached to upper jaw <b>72</b>A which is clamped around elevator ear <b>54</b>A, does not move when bail <b>56</b>A is pivoted. As bail <b>56</b>A is pivoted inward, bail locking apparatus frame back plate <b>90</b>A and side plates <b>92</b>A are likewise pivoted. Upper angular cross-slot <b>102</b>A allows clearance for upper bolt <b>98</b>A as the link is pivoted. Bolt <b>98</b>A is positioned in the lower outer portion of cross-slot <b>102</b>A, and the upper inner portion of cross-slot <b>102</b>A is exposed. The same effect occurs for lower bolt <b>98</b>C, but because it is closer to the lower inner surface of lower eye <b>62</b>A, the pivot point for bail <b>56</b>A, the travel in the lower cross slot is not as great. Bracket <b>112</b>A, which is attached directly to the lower jaw <b>74</b>A and indirectly to the upper jaw <b>72</b>A via the piston/cylinder arrangement <b>105</b>A, remains stationary with elevator ear <b>54</b>A while bail <b>56</b>A is pivoted inward. Thus, the optional MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> (not shown), which attaches to bracket <b>112</b>, is held stationary to prevent side forces from acting on the quick connectors at the tip <b>82</b>A of the elevator ear.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Similarly, on the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, bail <b>56</b>B is pivoted away from the elevator <b>50</b> by θ<sub>B </sub>degrees from vertical. Upper bolt <b>98</b>B, attached to upper jaw <b>72</b>B which is clamped around elevator ear <b>54</b>B, does not move when bail <b>56</b>B is pivoted. As bail <b>56</b>B is pivoted outward, bail locking apparatus frame back plate <b>90</b>B and side plates <b>92</b>B are likewise pivoted. Upper angular cross-slot <b>102</b>B allows clearance for upper bolt <b>98</b>B as the link is pivoted. Bolt <b>98</b>B is positioned in the upper inner portion of cross-slot <b>102</b>B, and the lower outer portion of cross-slot <b>102</b>B is exposed. The same effect occurs for lower bolt <b>98</b>D, but because it is closer to the lower inner surface of lower eye <b>62</b>B, the pivot point for bail <b>56</b>B, the travel in the lower cross slot is not as great. Like bracket <b>112</b>A, bracket <b>112</b>B is also held stationary as bail <b>56</b>B pivots, allowing use of a MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> (not shown).

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a detailed cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> which shows upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> clamped around nipples <b>7</b>. The jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> hold brackets <b>112</b> stationary while the bails <b>56</b> and frames <b>89</b> of the bail locking assemblies <b>60</b> are pivoted inward and outward.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the inner end <b>124</b> of the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> connected to bracket <b>112</b>. Pins or bolts <b>147</b> are used to mount bracket <b>112</b> to lower jaw <b>74</b>. One or more electric, pneumatic or hydraulic connectors <b>123</b> are designed to quick connect or otherwise mate with quick connectors <b>84</b> in nipple <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Preferably, one or more guide pins <b>125</b> plug into guide receptacles <b>85</b> in nipple <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to ensure proper mating of the MCS connector assembly to nipple <b>70</b>. Ports <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> provide for connection to hydraulic lines to engage or disengage the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a detailed cross-section of the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>. The quick connectors <b>123</b> on inner end face <b>124</b> of inner cylinder <b>116</b> are electrically or fluidly coupled to ports <b>122</b> on the outer face <b>126</b> of inner cylinder <b>116</b>. Inner cylinder <b>116</b> is slideably moved axially within outer cylinder <b>118</b> by piston <b>120</b> which is in mechanical engagement with or integral to inner cylinder <b>116</b>. The piston <b>120</b> and the inner cylinder <b>116</b> are dynamically sealed against the outer cylinder <b>118</b>. The piston <b>120</b> has an inner face <b>150</b> and an outer face <b>152</b>. To engage the bail post connector assembly <b>64</b>, hydraulic fluid within the cavity <b>148</b> formed between outer cylinder <b>118</b> and outer piston face <b>152</b>, is supplied via port <b>128</b> and acts on outer piston face <b>152</b> to axially move piston <b>120</b> and connected inner cylinder <b>116</b> towards elevator ear <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>), while the hydraulic fluid contained within the cavity <b>149</b> bounded by outer cylinder <b>118</b> and piston <b>120</b> is displaced by inner piston face <b>150</b> out of port <b>129</b>. To disengage the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>, hydraulic fluid is supplied via port <b>129</b> to cavity <b>149</b> to act on inner piston face <b>150</b> and move piston <b>120</b> and connected inner cylinder <b>116</b> axially away from elevator ear <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>). The MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> preferably has no splines or other rotation limiting mechanism which prevents rotation of inner cylinder <b>116</b> within outer cylinder <b>118</b>. Thus, bails <b>56</b> and bail locking assemblies <b>60</b> can rotate about elevator ears <b>54</b> without disturbing the MCS power and control quick connections <b>84</b>, <b>125</b>. While a particular hydraulic arrangement is described for the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>, alternate arrangements, including electric or pneumatic, are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> are perspective views in cross section of the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b>. Outer cylinder <b>118</b> is mounted to bracket <b>112</b> and contains ports <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> disposed on either side of movable piston assembly <b>120</b> for directing hydraulic fluid to the operating surfaces <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the piston assembly <b>120</b>. Piston assembly <b>120</b> is mechanically engaged with inner cylinder <b>116</b>. Both the piston assembly <b>120</b> and the inner cylinder <b>116</b> are dynamically sealed against outer cylinder <b>118</b>. The piston <b>120</b> axially moves inner cylinder <b>116</b> to engage or disengage the MCS quick connectors <b>123</b> with nipple <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, inner cylinder <b>116</b> is in the disengaged position, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, inner cylinder <b>116</b> is axially moved into the engaged position. MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> is preferably designed so that inner cylinder <b>116</b> can rotate with outer cylinder <b>118</b>, particularly when in an engaged position. This ability to rotate allows the bails <b>56</b> to rotate around the elevator ear (in the direction of arrows <b>138</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) while allowing the power and control connectors at elevator ear <b>54</b> to remain intact as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. To illustrate the rotation, the inner cylinder <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is rotated about ten degrees compared to the inner cylinder <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Although the bail post connector assembly <b>64</b> is described as having a particular hydraulic arrangement, other arrangements, including pneumatic or electric actuators, may be also used and are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates how the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> allows rotation of bail <b>56</b> about the elevator ear in the directions of arrows <b>138</b>. As bail <b>56</b> is rotated about the elevator ear, the frame <b>89</b>, back plate <b>90</b>, side plates <b>92</b>, upper and lower jaws <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, bracket <b>112</b>, and outer cylinder <b>118</b> of the MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> are all likewise rotated. However, inner cylinder <b>116</b> of the MCS connector assembly, which is coupled to the elevator ear <b>54</b> by quick connector pairs <b>125</b>, <b>84</b>, guide pins <b>123</b>, and guide sockets <b>85</b>, remains stationary. In other words, outer cylinder <b>118</b> rotates about inner cylinder <b>116</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the locking assembly <b>60</b> according to the invention equipped with a protective cover assembly. The cover assembly preferably includes one or more individual covers <b>101</b>, <b>158</b>, and a protective tubular frame <b>154</b> which mount to bail locking assembly frame <b>89</b> (not visible). One or more quick access covers <b>156</b> are attached by hinges and latches to allow easy inspection and maintenance. The cover assembly can be used both for an individual bail locking assembly <b>60</b> or a bail locking assembly <b>60</b>/bail post connector assembly <b>64</b> combination. The cover assembly protects both personnel from injury and the bail locking assembly <b>60</b> and MCS connector assembly <b>64</b> from damage.</p>
