<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a capacitor structure, and more particularly, to a three-dimensional capacitor structure having low resistance and high matching.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Capacitor structures are able to store charges, and can be applied to many sorts of integrated circuits, such as RFIC and MMIC. A capacitor structure consists of two parallel electrical plates with an insulation layer between thereof. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor structure according to the prior art. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, the MIM capacitor structure <b>10</b> comprises a substrate <b>12</b>, a first electrical plate <b>14</b> disposed on the substrate <b>12</b>, a capacitor dielectric layer <b>16</b> located on the first electrical plate <b>14</b>, and a second electrical plate <b>18</b> disposed on the capacitor dielectric layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An inter-digitated capacitor structure has been gradually replacing the conventional MIM capacitor structure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,359 discloses an inter-digitated capacitor structure. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic external diagram of a prior art inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic sectional diagram of the prior art inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>30</b>, taken across sections III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> show, the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>30</b> is composed of a first electrode structure and a second electrode structure. The first electrode structure comprises a plurality of first metal patterns <b>32</b> stacked vertically with respect to each other. The second electrode structure comprises a plurality of second metal patterns <b>34</b> stacked vertically with respect to each other. In addition, each first metal pattern <b>32</b> comprises a first peripheral part <b>321</b> and a plurality of first finger parts <b>322</b> connected to the first peripheral part <b>321</b>. Each second metal pattern <b>34</b> comprises a second peripheral part <b>341</b> and a plurality of second finger parts <b>342</b> connected to the second peripheral part <b>341</b>. Furthermore, a capacitor dielectric layer <b>38</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is disposed between each first metal pattern <b>32</b> and each second metal pattern <b>34</b>. The prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>30</b> further comprises a plurality of first connective plugs <b>40</b> disposed among the capacitor dielectric layers <b>38</b> between the first peripheral parts <b>321</b> of each first metal pattern <b>32</b>, so every first metal pattern <b>32</b> electrically connects with each other. Additionally, there are a plurality of second connective plugs <b>42</b> disposed among the capacitor dielectric layer <b>38</b> between the second peripheral parts <b>341</b> of each second metal pattern <b>34</b>, so every second metal pattern <b>34</b> electrically connects with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, the first metal patterns <b>32</b> connected with each other by the first connective plugs <b>40</b> make up a first electrode structure. The second metal patterns <b>34</b> connected with each other by the second connective plugs <b>42</b> make up a second electrode structure. Furthermore, the first metal patterns <b>32</b>, the second metal patterns <b>34</b>, and the capacitor dielectric layer between the first metal patterns <b>32</b> and the second metal patterns <b>34</b> form the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>30</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, the first finger parts <b>322</b> of the first metal patterns <b>32</b> are connected to a positive voltage, and the second finger parts <b>342</b> of the second metal patterns <b>34</b> are connected to a negative voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior inter-digitated capacitor structure has another embodiment. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic external diagram of a prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic sectional diagram of the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>50</b>, taken across sections V-V of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> show, the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>50</b> consists of a first electrode structure and a second electrode structure. The first electrode structure comprises a plurality of first metal patterns <b>52</b> stacked vertically with respect to each other. The second electrode structure comprises a plurality of second metal patterns <b>54</b> stacked vertically with respect to each other. In addition, each first metal pattern <b>52</b> comprises a first peripheral part <b>521</b> and a plurality of first finger parts <b>522</b> connected with the first peripheral part <b>521</b>. Each second metal pattern <b>54</b> comprises a second peripheral part <b>541</b> and a plurality of second finger parts <b>542</b> connected with the second peripheral part <b>541</b>. Furthermore, between each first metal pattern <b>52</b> and each second metal pattern <b>54</b> a capacitor dielectric layer <b>58</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is disposed. The prior inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>50</b> further comprises a plurality of first connective plugs <b>60</b> disposed among the capacitor dielectric layers <b>58</b> between the first peripheral parts <b>521</b> of each first metal pattern <b>52</b>, so every first metal pattern <b>52</b> electrically connects with each other. Additionally a plurality of second connective plugs <b>62</b> are disposed among the capacitor dielectric layers <b>58</b> between the second peripheral parts <b>541</b> of each second metal pattern <b>54</b>, so every second metal pattern <b>54</b> electrically connects with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> show, the difference between the inter-digitated capacitor structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> and the inter-digitated capacitor structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> is that the first electrode structure of the inter-digitated capacitor structure <b>50</b> is mismatched with the second electrode structure. Therefore, a first finger part <b>522</b> combined with four second finger parts <b>542</b> that are respectively adjacent to the first finger part <b>522</b> will form a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Compared with the MIM capacitor structure, the inter-digitated capacitor structure has better capacitance while it maintains the same size. The capacitance, however, is not the only consideration of the capacitor structure. Because the finger parts of the inter-digitated capacitor structure have longer lengths, and the finger parts are only connected electrically on one side, the resistance is correspondingly high, and the matching of the inter-digitated capacitor structure needs to be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore one objective of the claimed invention to provide a three-dimensional capacitor structure having a low resistance, and high matching.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect of the claimed invention a three-dimensional capacitor structure is provided. The three-dimensional capacitor structure has a first conductive layer, a second conductive layer disposed above the first conductive layer, and a plug layer disposed therebetween. The first conductive layer is divided into a plurality of grid units arranged in a matrix. The first conductive layer comprises a plurality of first conductive grids and a plurality of first square holes. In the grid units of odd rows, the first conductive grids are disposed in the grid units of odd columns, and the first square holes are disposed in the grid units of even columns. In the grid units of even rows, the first conductive grids are disposed in the grid units of even columns, and the first square holes are disposed in the grid units of odd columns. A centre of each first square hole further comprises a first conductive island, and each first conductive island is not connected electrically with the first conductive grids. The second conductive layer is divided into a plurality of grid units corresponding to the grid units of the first conductive layer. The second conductive layer comprises a plurality of second conductive grids and a plurality of second square holes. In the grid units of odd rows, the second conductive grids are disposed in the grid units of even columns, and the second square holes are disposed in the grid units of odd columns. In the grid units of the even rows, the second conductive grids are disposed in the grid units of odd columns, and the second square holes are disposed in the grid units of even columns.

In even rows of the grid unit, the first conductive grid <b>721</b> is disposed in an even column of the grid unit, and the first square hole <b>722</b> is disposed in an odd column of the grid unit. The centre of each first square hole <b>722</b> further comprises a first conductive island <b>723</b>, where each first conductive island <b>723</b> does not connect electrically with a first conductive grid <b>721</b>. Each the grid unit of even column in the odd row and each grid unit of the odd column in the even row further comprise a first conductive ring <b>724</b>. Each first conductive ring <b>724</b> surrounds the corresponding first square hole <b>722</b>, and connects with the first conductive grid <b>721</b> to increase the capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, the three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>70</b> further comprises a first plug layer <b>74</b> stacked above the first conductive layer <b>72</b>. The first plug layer <b>74</b> comprises a plurality of plugs <b>741</b>, where each plug <b>741</b> is individually disposed on each first conductive island <b>723</b> and each first conductive grid <b>721</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows, the three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>70</b> comprises a second conductive layer (a second metal layer) <b>76</b> stacked on the first plug layer <b>74</b>, and the second conductive layer <b>76</b> is divided into a plurality of grid units corresponding to the grid units of the first conductive layer <b>72</b>. The second conductive layer <b>76</b> comprises a plurality of second conductive grids <b>761</b> and a plurality of second square holes <b>762</b>. In addition, in odd rows of the grid units the second conductive grids <b>761</b> are disposed in the even columns of the grid units, and the second square holes <b>762</b> are disposed in the odd columns of the grid units. In even rows of the grid units the second conductive grids <b>761</b> are disposed in the odd columns, and the second square holes <b>762</b> are disposed in the even columns.

Each second conductive ring <b>764</b> surrounds the corresponding second square hole <b>762</b>, and connects with the second conductive grid <b>761</b> to increase the capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, in this embodiment, the horizontal cross-sectional areas of each first conductive island <b>723</b> and each second conductive island <b>763</b> are slightly larger than the horizontal cross-sectional areas of each plug <b>741</b>. The horizontal cross-section areas of the first conductive island <b>723</b>, the second conductive island <b>763</b>, and the plug <b>741</b> can change depending on the required capacitance and the manufacturing limitations. A capacitor dielectric layer (not shown) is disposed between the first conductive layer <b>72</b> and the first plug layer <b>74</b>, and the first plug layer <b>74</b> and the second conductive layer <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To sum up the aforementioned embodiments, the total capacitance of the three-dimensional capacitor structure in the present invention is the sum of the horizontal capacitance in the horizontal direction and the vertical capacitance in the vertical direction. The horizontal capacitance is a result of the capacitances between the first conductive grid <b>721</b> and the first conductive island <b>723</b>, the capacitances between the second conductive grid <b>761</b> and the second conductive island <b>763</b>, and the capacitance between the plugs <b>741</b>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The above-mentioned first conductive layer <b>72</b>, the first plug layer <b>74</b>, and the second conductive layer <b>76</b> form the basic unit of the three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>70</b> in the present invention. The first conductive layer <b>72</b> and the second conductive layer <b>76</b> are supplied with different voltages, for example they individually connect with a positive voltage and a negative voltage. Furthermore, in real application, the three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>70</b> of the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned three stacked structures, and can be altered depending on the capacitance or the layers of the metal interconnection. For example, the three-dimensional capacitor structure in the present invention can change to consist of five conductive layers and four plug layers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram of a three-dimensional capacitor structure of another embodiment according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic sectional diagram of the three-dimensional capacitor structure, taken across section X-X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The embodiment takes as an example a three-dimensional capacitor structure made from five conductive layers and four plug layers. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows, a three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>70</b> comprises (from bottom to top) a first conductive layer <b>72</b>, a first plug layer <b>74</b>, a second conductive layer <b>76</b>, a second plug layer <b>78</b>, a third conductive layer <b>80</b>, a third plug layer <b>82</b>, a fourth conductive layer <b>84</b>, a fourth plug layer <b>86</b>, and a fifth conductive layer <b>88</b>. Additionally, there are capacitor dielectric layers (not shown) among each layer. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows, a three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>70</b> is manufactured by stacking. The conductive grids of an odd conductive layer and the conductive islands of an even conductive layer are connected electrically by plugs. The conductive grids of an even conductive layer and the conductive island of an odd conductive layer are also connected electrically by the plugs. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows, when the odd conductive layer and even conductive layer individually connect with different voltages, the three-dimensional capacitor structure <b>90</b> is utilized as a capacitor. The total capacitance is the sum of the horizontal capacitance in the horizontal direction and the vertical capacitance in the vertical direction. The horizontal capacitance is the capacitance between the same level conductive grid and the conductive island (equal to the capacitance between the first conductive grid <b>721</b> and the first conductive island <b>723</b>, and between the second conductive grid <b>761</b> and the second conductive island <b>763</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>) added to the capacitance between the same level plugs (e.g. the plug <b>741</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The vertical capacitance is a result of the capacitance between a different level conductive grid and an adjacent conductive grid (e.g. the capacitance between the first conductive ring <b>724</b> and the second conductive grid <b>761</b>, and the capacitance between the second conductive ring <b>764</b> and the first conductive grid <b>721</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In conclusion, the three-dimensional capacitor structure in the present invention has low resistance, high matching, and high capacitance, and effectively improves the integration of the integrated circuits. Please note that the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments, and can be modified appropriately. For example, the horizontal cross-sections of the plug, the conductive grid or the conductive island are not limited to being a square shape; they could be circular, square, rectangular, or polygonal, under different demands of the capacitor and manufacturing conditions. The conductive ring could be circular, rectangular, or a polygonal ring. Moreover, the material of the conductive layer can be selected from metal, poly-silicon or semiconductor etc. according to the electrical performance, and the capacitor dielectric layer could be selected from materials under the demand of the capacitance. The corresponding position of the conductive grid and the conductive island of each conductive layer could be modified appropriately, and is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments.</p>
