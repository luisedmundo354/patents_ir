<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is directed to a blank for a stackable shelf and the formed shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some products, such as prepackaged meat or chicken, are shipped as units. It is necessary to have several layers of these units in a container. There usually are a plurality of units in each layer. The layers need to be separated so that the units in the lower layers are not crushed by the weight of the units in the upper layers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One embodiment of the present invention is a blank for a shelf which can separate these layers. Another embodiment is a stack of shelves formed from this blank. Another embodiment is a blank for a shelf which has an integral support post. Another embodiment is a stack of shelves formed from this blank.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In use, the product units are placed on the bottom of a container and the shelf is placed over the units. The shelf has side walls that extend downwardly around the product and rest on the container bottom wall supporting the shelf. If the shelf has an integral post, the post will extend downwardly and rest on the container bottom wall supporting the shelf. If a separate support member is used, it will be placed on the container bottom wall supporting the shelf. Another layer of product units will be placed on the shelf. If there is a separate support member it will also be placed on the shelf. The next shelf will then be placed on the first shelf and be supported by its side walls and either the separate support member or the integral support post.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The downwardly extending side walls have upward extensions which may act to guide the side walls of the next upper shelf into place, or as handles to pull a shelf from the container at the place of use.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the shelf blank <b>10</b> has a central shelf member <b>12</b> and four side walls <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>attached and hinged to the central shelf member <b>12</b> by score lines <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. Each of the side walls <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>has an outer bottom edge <b>18</b> and side edges <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>′. The height of each of the side walls <b>14</b>, the distance between the score line <b>16</b> and the bottom edge <b>18</b>, is substantially equal so that each of the bottom edges <b>18</b> can provide support for the shelf member <b>12</b> in the erected shelf. The side edges <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>′ of each side wall <b>14</b> are separated from the side edges <b>20</b> or <b>20</b>′ of an adjacent side wall <b>14</b>. In one embodiment the side edges <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>′ of a side wall <b>14</b> are substantially aligned with the score lines <b>16</b> of the adjacent side walls. In another embodiment they are beveled inwardly from the line of score lines <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The side walls <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>have integral inward extensions <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>which are detachable from the central shelf member <b>12</b> by lines <b>24</b>. Lines <b>24</b> can be cut lines, cut and score lines or perforations. A transverse score line <b>26</b> extends across extension <b>22</b> and divides it into a lower section <b>28</b> and an upper section <b>30</b>. The score line <b>26</b> of an extension <b>22</b> is substantially parallel to the score lines <b>16</b> which attach the side wall <b>14</b> integral the extension <b>22</b> to the shelf member <b>12</b>. The perpendicular distance between the score line <b>26</b> and the score line <b>16</b> is substantially equal to the perpendicular distance between the score line <b>16</b> and the bottom edge <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shelf member <b>12</b> has a pair of elements <b>32</b> which surround the upper section <b>30</b>. These elements <b>32</b> are formed by lines <b>34</b> and a cut line <b>36</b>. The lines <b>34</b> can be cut lines, score lines, cut and score lines or perforations. These elements <b>32</b> allow the upper sections <b>30</b> to be grasped and rotated upwardly to detach the extension <b>22</b> from the shelf member <b>12</b> when forming the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows the blank for one style of separate support member. An H style support member is shown. Any type of separate support member can be used. The blank <b>40</b> is divided into three sections by transverse score lines <b>42</b>. The blank is also divided into two halves by a central longitudinal score line <b>44</b> extending between the score lines <b>42</b>, and central longitudinal cut lines <b>46</b> which are aligned with and extend from the score lines <b>42</b> to the outer edges <b>48</b> of the blank.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The H support member is formed by folding the blank <b>40</b> around the longitudinal score line <b>44</b> and bending the end sections <b>50</b> outwardly around the score lines <b>42</b> to form the support member <b>52</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The height of the support member is substantially equal to the height of the side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A shelf <b>60</b> is formed by rotating each of the extensions <b>22</b> upwardly around score lines <b>16</b>, detaching the extensions <b>22</b> from the shelf member <b>12</b>. The inward extensions of the blank become upward extensions in the formed shelf. The side walls <b>14</b> then extend downwardly from the shelf member <b>12</b>.

A transverse score line <b>118</b> extends across extension <b>114</b> and divides it into a lower section <b>120</b> and an upper section <b>122</b>. A second transverse score line <b>124</b> extends across extension <b>114</b> and divides upper section <b>122</b> into an intermediate section <b>126</b> and an outer section <b>128</b>. The score lines <b>118</b> and <b>124</b> are substantially parallel to the score lines <b>106</b>. The perpendicular distance between the score line <b>118</b> and the score line <b>16</b> is substantially equal to the perpendicular distance between the score line <b>16</b> and the bottom edge <b>18</b>. The perpendicular distance between the score line <b>118</b> and the score line <b>124</b> is also substantially equal to the perpendicular distance between the score line <b>16</b> and the bottom edge <b>18</b>. The score line <b>118</b> is at the height of one erected shelf above shelf member <b>102</b> and the score line <b>124</b> is at the height of two erected shelves above shelf member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An additional embodiment of the extensions <b>114</b> is also illustrated. In the earlier illustrations the extensions <b>22</b> extending from opposed sides were aligned. In this illustration the extensions <b>114</b> from the opposed sides are not aligned. They also overlap in the shelf member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The shelf member <b>12</b> has a pair of elements <b>130</b> which surrounds the upper section <b>122</b>. These elements <b>130</b> are formed by lines <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. The lines <b>130</b> can be cut lines, score lines, cut and score lines or perforations. The line <b>134</b> would normally be a cut line or a perforation. These elements <b>130</b> allow the extension <b>114</b> to be grasped and rotated upwardly to detach the extension <b>114</b> from the shelf member <b>102</b> when forming the shelf <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In using the stacking shelf, the product units are placed on the bottom of the container <b>138</b>. The shelf <b>136</b> is formed and placed over the product units. The shelf member <b>12</b> is held above the product units by the side walls <b>104</b>. Another layer of product units is placed on the shelf member <b>12</b>. When the top of the container is reached, the upper section <b>122</b> of each extension <b>114</b> of the upper shelf <b>136</b> is bent downwardly around score line <b>118</b>, and the outer section <b>128</b> of each extension <b>114</b> of the shelf <b>136</b> immediately below the upper shelf is bent downwardly around the score lines <b>124</b> to allow the top of the container to be closed.</p>
