<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A deterioration detection apparatus for an oxygen sensor is able to detect an abnormality of the oxygen sensor constantly with high precision, without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance. The apparatus applies a voltage V to the oxygen sensor, and calculates an element impedance real value Rsr=V/1 of a sensor element based on the applied voltage and the current I caused to flow by the voltage. The apparatus calculates an element temperature estimated value Tex of the oxygen sensor from a factor that affects the temperature of the oxygen sensor. The apparatus determines whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality on the basis of whether the relationship between the element impedance real value Rsr and the element temperature estimated value Tex can be regarded as a relationship that agrees with a normal temperature characteristic.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-341327 filed on Nov. 25, 2002, including the specification, drawings and abstract thereof, are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to an oxygen sensor deterioration detection apparatus and method, more particularly, to a deterioration detection apparatus suitable for detecting deterioration of an oxygen sensor whose element impedance exhibits a temperature characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A related-art apparatus that detects an abnormality of an oxygen sensor on the basis of an element impedance of the oxygen sensor is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-198635. In this related-art detection apparatus, the oxygen sensor is disposed in an exhaust passageway of an internal combustion engine. The oxygen sensor has a heater for heating a sensor element. In a normal service environment, the temperature of the sensor element is controlled at about 700Â° C. via the heater and heat from exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above-described detection apparatus, a characteristic of the element impedance of the sensor element is dependent on temperature. Therefore, if the heating of the sensor element is not appropriate, the element impedance exhibits a value that is different from the value exhibited when the heating is appropriate. Utilizing this characteristic, that is, on the basis of whether the element impedance exhibits a normal value in a normal service environment, the detection apparatus detects a broken wire related to the sensor, deterioration of the heater, a broken wire related to the heater, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The detection apparatus assumes that the oxygen sensor has activated, at the elapse of a predetermined time following startup of the internal combustion engine. In that condition, the apparatus determines whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality on the basis of the element impedance, on an assumption that the oxygen sensor has been heated to about 700Â° C.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In reality, however, the temperature of the oxygen sensor may sometimes be apart from the vicinity of 700Â° C. after the elapse of a predetermined time following startup of the internal combustion engine, even if the detection system is normal. In such a case, the value of the element impedance greatly deviates from the value that is normally exhibited when the temperature of the sensor element is at or around 700Â° C., due to the temperature characteristic of the sensor element. As a result, a false determination of an abnormality of the oxygen sensor may be made.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">[Description of System Construction]</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram for illustrating the construction of Embodiment 1 of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system in accordance with this embodiment has an oxygen sensor <b>10</b>. In the embodiment, the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> is disposed in an exhaust passageway of an internal combustion engine, and is used as a sensor for detecting the concentration of oxygen in exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The oxygen sensor <b>10</b> has a sensor element <b>12</b>, and a heater <b>14</b> for heating the sensor element <b>12</b>. The sensor element <b>12</b> has characteristics of generating an electromotive force corresponding to the oxygen concentration in a detection-object gas, and changing an element impedance Rs in accordance with temperature. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sensor element <b>12</b> can be equivalently represented by an electromotive force component <b>16</b> and an impedance component <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The oxygen sensor <b>10</b> is connected to an ECU (electronic control unit) <b>20</b>. The ECU <b>20</b> is an on-vehicle computer formed by a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, electronic circuits, etc. In the embodiment, a heater control portion <b>22</b>, an element impedance detection portion <b>24</b>, a fuel-cut detection portion <b>26</b>, an element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> and an abnormality determination portion <b>30</b> are realized within the ECU <b>20</b> in hardware and software fashions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The heater control portion <b>22</b> accomplishes a function of controlling the heater <b>14</b> of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b>. The sensor element <b>12</b> of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> generates an electromotive force corresponding to the oxygen concentration in a detection-object gas provided that the sensor element <b>12</b> has been heated to a predetermined temperature. Therefore, the heater control portion <b>22</b> controls the electrified and non-electrified states of the heater <b>14</b> so that the activation temperature of the sensor element <b>12</b> is maintained during operation of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The element impedance detection portion <b>24</b> accomplishes a function of detecting the element impedance Rs of the sensor element <b>12</b>. More specifically, the element impedance detection portion <b>24</b> supplies an appropriate electric power to the sensor element <b>12</b>, and detects an element impedance Rs from a value related to the supplied power. Since the sensor element <b>12</b> is an electromotive force type sensor, it is impossible to extract a sensor output from the sensor element. <b>12</b> during supply of power to the sensor element <b>12</b> (during application of voltage). Therefore, the element impedance detection portion <b>24</b> supplies power to the sensor element <b>12</b> only at a predetermined timing at which the element impedance Rs is to be detected. Then, the element impedance detection portion <b>24</b> detects the element impedance Rs in accordance with a relationship (V=RsÂ·I) between the applied voltage V across the sensor element <b>12</b> and the current I through the sensor element <b>12</b>. Hereinafter, the element impedance Rs detected by the element impedance detection portion <b>24</b>, that is, the element impedance Rs calculated from values related to the electric power supplied to the sensor element <b>12</b>, will be referred to as âelement impedance real value Rsrâ.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The element impedance detection portion <b>24</b> is provided with a first judgment value acquirer that calculates the element impedance real value Rsr, and that acquires the calculated value as a judgment value (first judgment value).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the internal combustion engine, fuel-cut for stopping the injection of fuel is executed, for example, if the engine rotation speed is high and an accelerator pedal is released. The fuel-cut detection portion <b>26</b> accomplishes a function of detecting execution of the fuel-cut if the above-described fuel-cut is executed in the internal combustion engine. A result of detection provided by the fuel-cut detection portion <b>26</b> is supplied to the element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> is supplied with information regarding the execution of fuel-cut from the fuel-cut detection portion <b>26</b> as stated above, and is also supplied with information regarding the electrification/non-electrification of the heater <b>14</b> from the heater control portion <b>22</b>. The element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> is connected to an air flow meter <b>32</b>, a vehicle speed sensor <b>34</b>, an intake air temperature sensor <b>36</b>, and an atmospheric pressure sensor <b>38</b>. Therefore, the element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> is supplied with information regarding the amount of intake air Ga, the vehicle speed SPD, the intake air temperature Ta, and the atmospheric pressure Pa from those sensors. All the aforementioned pieces of information supplied to the element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> concern factors that affect the temperature of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> (sensor element <b>12</b>). More specifically, the pieces of information concern major factors that affect the supplied amount of heat Ts for the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> (sensor element <b>12</b>) or the amount of radiant heat Tr from the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> (sensor element <b>12</b>). On the basis of the aforementioned information, the element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> accomplishes the function of estimating the temperature of the sensor element <b>12</b>. Hereinafter, the temperature of the sensor element <b>12</b> estimated by the element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b>, that is, the element temperature calculated on the basis of the information regarding major factors that affect the temperature of the sensor element <b>12</b>, will be referred to as âelement temperature estimated value Texâ.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b> is provided with a second judgment value acquirer that calculates the element temperature estimated value Tex and acquires the calculated value as a judgment value (second judgment value).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The abnormality determination portion <b>30</b> determines whether the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> has an abnormality on the basis of the element impedance real value Rsr detected by the element impedance detection portion <b>24</b>, and the element temperature estimated value Tex estimated by the element temperature estimation portion <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The abnormality determination portion <b>30</b> is provided with an abnormality determiner that determines whether the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> has an abnormality on the basis of the first judgment value acquired by the first judgment value acquirer and the second judgment value acquired by the second judgment value acquirer. The abnormality determiner is equipped with a heater electrification state detector that detects the electrified state of the heater described below, a sensor element abnormality identifier that, if it is determined that the oxygen sensor has an abnormality in a situation where the heater is not electrified, identifies the abnormality as an abnormality of the sensor element, and an electrification stopper that stops electrification of the heater if it is determined that the oxygen sensor has an abnormality in a situation where the heater is electrified. The abnormality determiner is further equipped with a first change amount detector that detects the amount of change in the first judgment value, and a second change amount detector that detects the amount of change in the second judgment value.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Subsequently, it is determined whether the difference TexAâTexB between the point-A element temperature estimated value TexA and the point-B element temperature estimated value TexB is greater than a predetermined criterion temperature T<b>4</b> (e.g., 100Â° C.). That is, it is determined whether a change greater than the criterion temperature T<b>4</b> has occurred on the element temperature estimated value Tex during the period from the detection of the point-A element temperature estimated value TexA to the present execution cycle (step <b>174</b>). A process of detecting the amount of change in the element temperature estimated value Tex in step <b>174</b> is accomplished by the aforementioned second change amount detector.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The processing of step <b>174</b> is repeatedly executed until it is determined that TexAâTexB&gt;T<b>4</b> holds. When it is determined that this condition is met, the element impedance real value Rsr at that time point of determination is stored as a point-B element impedance real value RsrB (step <b>176</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the routine illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is subsequently determined whether the difference between the point-A element impedance real value RsrA stored in step <b>170</b> and the point-B element impedance real value Rsr stored in step <b>176</b> is less than an intermediate short-circuit criterion R<b>4</b> (step <b>178</b>). A process of detecting the amount of change in the element impedance real value Rsr in steps <b>178</b> is accomplished by the aforementioned first change amount detector.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The element temperature and the element impedance of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> should have a relationship corresponding to the normal temperature characteristic. Therefore, as long as the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> is normal, a change in the element temperature estimated value Tex which is greater than the criterion temperature T<b>4</b> should be accompanied by a change in the element impedance real value Rsr which corresponds to the criterion temperature T<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The intermediate short-circuit criterion R<b>4</b> used in step <b>178</b> is set at a predetermined value that is sufficiently small compared with the amount of change corresponding to the criterion temperature T<b>4</b>, specifically, an amount of change that should occur in the element impedance Rs when an element temperature change of T<b>4</b>/2 (50Â° C.) occurs on the oxygen sensor <b>10</b>. Therefore, if it is determined that RsrAâRsfB&lt;R<b>4</b> holds, it can be judged that the amount of change in the element impedance real value Rsr is excessively small with respect to the amount of change that has occurred in the element temperature estimated value Tex.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the routine illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if it is determined in step <b>178</b> that RsrAâRsfB&lt;R<b>4</b> holds, it is judged that the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> has an intermediate short circuit (step <b>180</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Conversely, if it is determined that RsrA-RsfB&lt;R<b>4</b> does not hold, it is judged that the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> does not have an intermediate short circuit. Hence, after it is determined that the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> is normal, the present execution cycle ends (step <b>182</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As is apparent from the foregoing description, it is possible to precisely determine whether there is a broken wire, a short circuit, deterioration, or an intermediate short circuit related to the oxygen sensor <b>10</b>, according to the routines illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>. Thus, the apparatus of the embodiment is able to determine whether the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> has an abnormality constantly with high precision, without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance real value Rsr, on the basis of the element impedance real value Rsr (or the element temperature theoretical value Ti) determined from a value related to the electric power supplied to the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> and the element temperature estimated value Tex calculated from a value that affects the temperature of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the embodiment described above, the determination regarding a broken wire and a short circuit and the determination regarding an intermediate short circuit (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>) are based on comparison between the element impedance real value Rsr and the element temperature estimated value Tex, and the determination regarding deterioration is based on comparison between the element temperature theoretical value Ti and the element temperature estimated value Tex. However, this fashion of determination is merely illustrative.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">That is, in the embodiment, it is a precondition that the element impedance Rs of the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> has a temperature dependency. Therefore, since it is possible to calculate the element impedance Rs (the element impedance real value Rsr) from a value related to electric power, it is also possible to calculate an element temperature (the element temperature theoretical value Ti) from the electric power-related value. Furthermore, since it is possible to calculate the element temperature (the element temperature estimated value Tex) from a value that affects temperature, it is also possible to calculate an element impedance (hereinafter, referred to as âelement impedance estimated valueâ) on the basis of the value that affects temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">What is needed in order to determine whether there is a broken wire, a short circuit, deterioration or an intermediate short circuit related to the oxygen sensor <b>10</b> is that it can be determined whether there is a normal correlation between the element impedance Rs or the element temperature calculated from an electric power-related value and the element impedance Rs or the element temperature calculated from a value that affects temperature. Therefore, the aforementioned determination can be performed on the basis of any one of the following four combinations:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0108">(a) the combination of the element impedance real value Rsr and the element temperature estimated value Tex;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0109">(b) the combination of the element impedance real value Rsr and the element impedance estimated value;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0110">(c) the combination of the element temperature theoretical value Ti and the element impedance estimated value; and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0111">(d) the combination of the element temperature theoretical value Ti and the element temperature estimated value Tex.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">The combination (a) corresponds to first deterioration detection apparatus and method for an oxygen sensor of the invention. The combination (b) corresponds to second deterioration detection apparatus and method for an oxygen sensor of the invention. The combination (c) corresponds to third deterioration detection apparatus and method for an oxygen sensor of the invention. The combination (d) corresponds to fourth deterioration detection apparatus and method for an oxygen sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0113">In the embodiment, the process of calculating an element temperature theoretical value Ti and acquiring the calculated value as a criterion is accomplished by the ECU <b>20</b> executing the process of step <b>150</b>. Furthermore, the process of calculating an element impedance estimated value and acquiring the calculated value as a criterion is accomplished by the ECU <b>20</b> executing the process of step <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114">With the above-described construction, the invention achieves advantages as follows. According to the first oxygen sensor deterioration detection apparatus and method of the invention, whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality can be determined constantly with high precision, without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance, on the basis of whether the element impedance real value calculated from a value related to the electric power supplied to the oxygen sensor and the element temperature estimated value calculated from a factor that affects the temperature of the oxygen sensor have a proper relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0115">According to the second oxygen sensor deterioration detection apparatus and method, whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality can be determined constantly with high precision, without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance, on the basis of whether the element impedance real value calculated from a value related to the electric power supplied to the oxygen sensor and the element impedance estimated value calculated from a factor that affects the temperature of the oxygen sensor have a proper relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0116">According to the third oxygen sensor deterioration detection apparatus and method, whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality can be determined constantly with high precision, without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance, on the basis of whether the element temperature theoretical value calculated from a value related to the electric power supplied to the oxygen sensor and the element impedance estimated value calculated from a factor that affects the temperature of the oxygen sensor have a proper relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0117">According to the fourth oxygen sensor deterioration detection apparatus and method, whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality can be determined constantly with high precision, without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance, on the basis of whether the element temperature theoretical value calculated from a value related to the electric power supplied to the oxygen sensor and the element temperature estimated value calculated from a factor that affects the temperature of the oxygen sensor have a proper relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0118">Furthermore, according to deterioration detection apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, whether an oxygen sensor has an abnormality can be determined with high precision on the basis of whether the relationship between the element impedance real value and the element temperature estimated value accords with a proper temperature characteristic, or on the basis of whether the relationship between the element temperature theoretical value and the element impedance estimated value accords with a proper temperature characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0119">Still further, according to deterioration detection apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, whether an oxygen sensor has an abnormality can be determined with high precision on the basis of whether the element impedance real value and the element impedance estimated value are substantially equal, or on the basis of whether the element temperature theoretical value and the element temperature estimated value are substantially equal.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0120">Further, according to deterioration detection apparatus and method of the invention, if it is determined that the oxygen sensor has an abnormality in a situation where the heater is not electrified, the abnormality can be identified as an abnormality of the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0121">Further, according to deterioration detection apparatus and method of the invention, if it is determined that the oxygen sensor has an abnormality in a situation where the heater is electrified, the state of the heater can be excluded from the cause of the abnormality by stopping the electrification of the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0122">Further, according to deterioration detection apparatus and method of the invention, if the determination of an abnormality of the oxygen sensor is overturned by the exclusion of the state of the heater from the cause of the abnormality, it can be determined that the heater has an abnormality.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0123">Further, according to deterioration detection apparatus and method of the invention, if the first judgment value and the second judgment value that should change in a normal correlation therebetween are not found to have the normal correlation, it can be determined that the oxygen sensor has an abnormality. The above-described techniques of determination make it possible to determine whether the oxygen sensor has an abnormality constantly with high precision without being affected by the temperature characteristic of the element impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0124">While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments or constructions. To the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements. In addition, while the various elements of the exemplary embodiments are shown in various combinations and configurations, which are exemplary, other combinations and configurations, including more, less or only a single element, are also within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
