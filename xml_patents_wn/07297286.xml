<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for manufacturing an article having polymeric residue that is to be removed during the manufacture of the article is disclosed. The article is introduced into a controlled environment of a processing tool having one or more processing chambers. Free radicals are generated from one or more reactant gases and introduced into at least one of the one or more processing chambers where they react with the polymeric residue. A cryogenic cleaning medium is supplied into at least one of the one or more processing chambers where the cryogenic cleaning medium removes the polymeric residue present after the free radicals react with the polymeric residue. The reactant gases are selected to facilitate removal of the polymeric residue with the cryogenic cleaning medium. The cryogenic cleaning medium is supplied with a pulsating flow via a nozzle implement that sweeps across the article. The pulsating flow may be generated via a piezo device or a rotating shaft with a hole the periodically enables or interrupts flow through a flow channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to systems and methods for removing photoresist or other materials from an integrated circuit structure with a dry process, preferably in a vacuum stripping chamber, such as photoresist remaining after etch, implant or other fabrication steps. The invented system and method also can desirably remove etch residues remaining from previous fabrication step(s). The present invention also is suitable for cleaning surfaces on hard disks, semiconductor wafers, delicate optics, etc. The present invention more particularly relates to a preferably oscillating or/and pulsating nozzle cleaning system preferably dispensing cryogenic, solvent or solvent combination cleaning mediums, combined with plasma excited reactive gases. The oscillating nozzle cleaning and plasma processes can be performed sequentially or simultaneously. The present invention also relates to other dry or plasma type processes that are combined with or followed by cryogenic cleaning type process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Articles such as hard disks, semiconductor wafers, delicate optics, MEMS (micro electromechanical systems), flat panel displays, masks, reticles etc., often must be precisely cleaned in order to remove contaminants, either during or after a process for manufacturing the articles. For example, resist strip and residue clean typically are needed between etch, implant and deposition steps in IC fabrication processes. Conventional dry-type strip/clean sequences typically use plasma to ash resist and wet chemicals to clean residues. Resist stripping is typically carried out using dry plasma ashing. Conventional O<sub>2 </sub>plasma ashing at high temperature tends to leave polymeric residues that, require acids and/or organic solvents for removal. Wet chemistries generally are not desirable due to non-uniformities, selectivity to exposed layers and incomplete resist removal because of mass transport and surface tension associated with the solutions. A variety of alternative cleaning methods have been employed with varying degrees of success. Certain of such methods that have been attempted involve imparting carbon dioxide snow onto the article to be cleaned. An example of such a conventional carbon dioxide cleaning system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,061.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional systems generally require multiple tools and multiple processes in which articles to be processed have to be moved from one piece of equipment in order to carry out the desired processing. In addition, the processes used in conventional systems generally combine wet and dry processes, which may be batch or single article systems. For example, in a typical post-etch wafer strip/clean, a semiconductor wafer will go through an asher to remove the bulk of photoresist and once a batch of 25 or so wafers are processed through the asher they are thereafter placed in a cassette and placed in a wet bench. The wafers are processed in the wet bench typically by being moved into multiple chemical sinks to clean the residues, then through a sink of DI water to remove the solvent and finally they are moved to a dryer module to dry the wafers. Such conventional systems have many shortcomings. For example, there tends to be a high capital cost due to the multiple pieces of equipment that are required. There also tends to be a high cost per wafer for the cleaning process due to the price of chemicals and chemical disposal, which often involves the use of hazardous chemicals. There also is lowered throughput due to the wafer transport time from one piece of equipment to the next. Also, wet processes tend to affect material properties such as via corrosion of metal, particularly with copper, and changes in dielectric constant value, particularly with low-k dielectric materials. In addition, in conventional methods semiconductor wafers typically leave the vacuum environment after photoresist stripping and prior to wet cleaning. The exposure to atmospheric air often causes an oxide layer to form, which increases the level of difficulty of cleaning.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to systems and methods preferably using a plasma process and a cryogenic cleaning process. Certain preferred embodiments employ a plasma generation system, as a chemical means, for resist and polymer residue removal and a preferably cryogenic cleaning medium, as a physical means, for enhancing the cleaning of an exposed surface of an article in a single integrated process tool. Without being bound by theory, the cryogenic cleaning medium is believed to help in reducing submicron defects. The plasma source preferably is either a remote source that provides free radicals or an ion assisted chemistry activated by direct exposure of the wafer to a preferably RF plasma. In certain alternative preferred embodiments, the free radicals/ions ratio can be controlled by running simultaneously both sources (remote and RF sources). The cryogenic and plasma processes can be performed sequentially or simultaneously in the same chamber or in two separate chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Integrated, preferably all dry systems and methods in accordance with the present invention can eliminate problems associated with current conventional systems. The present invention also provides technological, environmental as well as economical advantages over such conventional systems. Such advantages include: more effective cleaning by performing all processes in a vacuum environment; using an all dry method which is able to penetrate high aspect ratio vias and trenches due to lower surface tension than liquid; combining chemical and physical mechanisms; lowered capital costs by reducing the number of the pieces of equipment required to accomplish the desired processing; a smaller footprint for the equipment, which tends to take up less space and reduces real estate cost, etc.; less human intervention and training than with multi-equipment conventional systems; lower costs of ownership and per article processing due to the elimination of many costly solvents; increased safety to both humans and the environment due to the elimination of many hazardous chemicals; higher yield due to the elimination of wet processes that negatively affect the materials used; higher throughput due to, for example, the elimination of article transport processes from one piece of equipment to the next and due to the elimination of the article drying process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary preferred system/method can be described as follows. The articles to be cleaned preferably are placed in a special box on shelves. The box preferably has a front door that is locked and airtight. A loader is in communication with the front end of the box through an interface. The front end preferably consists of an enclosure with fan filter units placed on the top to provide a clean particle free environment inside the enclosure, an atmospheric robot to transfer the articles, and a pre-aligner to align the orientation of the articles (commonly provided in the case of semiconductor wafers and the like). The box preferably is placed on the tool loader. The loader opens up a door in the box to allow the atmospheric robot to access the articles/wafers. The atmospheric robot preferably extends its arm to hold one article/wafer from the box and transfer it to the pre-aligner. The pre-aligner rotates the article/wafer and aligns it in to a predetermined rotational position. The atmospheric robot preferably picks up the article/wafer and delivers it to a vacuum robot located in a vacuum chamber adjacent to the front end and is in communication with the Kfront end through an opening slot with a door. The door preferably then closes and allows the robot vacuum chamber to be pumped down. The robot vacuum chamber, which often is referred to as a vacuum transfer chamber, is then pumped down to a low vacuum The vacuum transfer chamber preferably is interfaced with the connected one or multiple vacuum process chambers through opening slots and doors. Each vacuum process chamber could contain all the mechanisms required to perform the strip/clean process as described elsewhere herein, which include mechanisms for introducing the plasma excited reactive gases and the pulsating cryogenic flow spray. Alternatively, the mechanisms for introducing the plasma excited reactive gases may be provided in a separate vacuum chamber from the chamber in which the mechanisms, for pulsating cryogenic spray are provided. In the first case (both plasma and the cryogenic spray are in a single chamber) the vacuum robot places the wafer inside the process vacuum chamber. The interface door closes down and the vacuum chamber is pumped down to a predetermined vacuum level. The plasma excited reactive gages are provided to strip the photoresist (or to carry out another desired process). The cryogenic nozzle system is then turned on to clean the remaining residues that have been conditioned by the plasma steps to be removed by the preferably pulsating cryogenic spray. In one alternative embodiment (e.g., separate chambers are provided, one for the plasma processing and another for the cryogenic processing), the article/wafer has to be moved from one chamber to the next chamber after the plasma process is completed in order for the cryogenic cleaning process to occur, which can desirably remove remaining residues. The article/wafer may then be moved preferably to another box on another load port following a reverse path.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary preferred embodiment for photoresist stripping/cleaning system/method is as follows. An enclosure is provided for maintaining a controlled environment during the photoresist stripping (or post etch implant or other fabrication step) and residue cleaning process. The enclosure preferably provides ingress and egress from and to a surrounding environment. A holding chuck preferably is provided that is configured to secure the article to be cleaned of photoresist and/or other remaining polymeric or other residue. The environment preferably is pressure controlled (vacuum) to optimize the plasma reaction. A stage or stage means is mounted on the support structure and the holding chuck is mounted on the stage means in a manner so that the stage or stage means is fixed and the system allows a nozzle to move relative to it for complete surface coverage of the cryogenic gas. The stage or stage means, in alternative embodiments, is mounted on the support structure and the holding chuck is mounted on the stage means in a manner so that movement of the article relative to the support structure is provided within the enclosure on a predetermined path between the ingress and the egress points. A pre-heater, in certain embodiments, is mounted in a first position adjacent the predetermined path in thermal communication with the surface of the article at the first position. Reactive gases such as oxygen preferably are introduced through a remote plasma chamber. The processing chamber is connected to a vacuum exhaust line. A cryogenic spray nozzle assembly preferably is provided wherein a spray nozzle is mounted in the spray nozzle assembly. A cryogenic spray nozzle assembly preferably is mounted on a slide mechanism in a manner so that the cryogenic spray nozzle assembly is allowed to be in a controlled fashion so that the cryogenic spray impinges on the surface of the article to be cleaned in a predetermined path. The spray nozzle is in communication with the cryogenic cleaning medium, preferably through a cryogenic purification system, for providing a purified cleaning spray. The cryogenic spray nozzle assembly, in preferred embodiments, is further connected outside the environment to an assembly or other means for imparting cyclic pulsating and/or cyclic motion in the spray nozzle so that the cleaning spray impinges dynamically, with a controlled frequency, relative to the predetermined path. This cyclic motion assembly or means alternatively could be internal to the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the present invention, systems and methods are provided for cleaning a surface of an article, wherein a preferred system includes a framework, and a holding means that holds the article with the surface exposed. The plasma source preferably is separated remotely from the article that is being processed, with free radicals generated remotely. Ion assisted chemistries, optionally or in combination with the remotely generated free radicals, are provided preferably by direct exposure of the wafer to RF plasma. The plasma also may be activated by both a remote source and an RF plasma source. In preferred embodiments, each form of plasma is independently controlled to cover a wide spectrum of processing conditions in a manner to satisfy the complexity and diversity of the residues. The present invention preferably involves placing the substrate (wafer or other article, etc.) in the plasma reactor, applying to the substrate surface an activated mixture of gases selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, fluorine, hydro fluorocarbon, water vapor or a mixture of such gases to both remove the photoresist layer and alter the composition of the residues such that the residues are soluble in cryogenic fluid and/or have a weakened bonds that they can be removed with a stream of cryogenic cleaning medium.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With respect to the cryogenic cleaning assembly, a nozzle having a nozzle axis and nozzle tips preferably is spaced from and adjacent to the predetermined path for delivering a cleaning spray onto the article surface. Means preferably is mounted between the framework and the nozzle for supporting and driving the nozzle tips through a cyclic motion and/or causing the cryogenic flow to be provided in a pulsating manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect of the present invention, an oscillating, vibratory or pulsating nozzle assembly for use in cryogenic cleaning of a surface of an article that must be cleaned substantially free of contaminants is provided, particularly after or as part of a dry process as described herein. An oscillating nozzle assembly in accordance with certain exemplary preferred embodiments preferably includes an assembly mounting block, a nozzle mounting block, and means for resiliently connecting the nozzle mounting block to the assembly mounting block. Further, the oscillating nozzle assembly preferably connected to a pulsating valve includes a frequency controller. At least one nozzle preferably is included having nozzle tips, wherein the nozzle is connected to the pulsating valve so that the valve controller operates to produce pulsating flow at a controlled pulsation frequency. The flow pulsation is preferably accomplished through a piezoelectric system attached to the pulsating valve that produces a high frequency controlled pressure perturbation in the cryogenic flow at the outlet of the nozzle tips. Alternatively, the pulsation in the flow can be accomplished through a brushless motor with the shaft-inserted diagonal to the flow. The shaft of the brushless motor has one or multiple radial holes and rotates at a controlled frequency through a driver and controller.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Methods in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to processing an article having a surface to be cleaned substantially free of contaminates. The process includes the steps of performing a plasma etching/ashing process or other dry process, preferably to remove a photoresist-type layer, a plurality of pre-cleaning fabrication steps, conducting a cleaning process using a cleaning spray, and performing a plurality of post-cleaning fabrication steps. The plasma step preferably involves placing the substrate (or other article) in the plasma reactor, applying to the substrate surface an activated mixture of gases selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, fluorine, hydro fluorocarbon, water vapor or a mixture of such gases to both remove the photoresist layer and alter the composition of the residues such that the residues are soluble in water and/or have a weakened bonds that they can be removed with a stream of cryogenic medium.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The step of conducting a cleaning process preferably occurs in the same environment and includes the steps of turning the cryogenic flow on in a predetermined frequency of pulsation and moving the nozzle across the article to be cleaned in a predetermined path and controllable speed to sweep the whole surface of the article. Further, the step of pulsating the cleaning spray at the cleaning position in a predetermined pattern preferably is performed to provide improved cleaning in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain exemplary preferred embodiments, the cryogenic spray assembly is enclosed inside the cryogenic vacuum chamber. The chamber preferably has a partition wall with a slot through which the cryogenic spray nozzle extends. The partition wall preferably divides the cryogenic spray chamber into two sections, one section with a track, drive motor and slide mechanism assembly, while the other section contains the article to be cleaned sitting on an electrostatic chuck and the cryogenic spray nozzle assembly. The slide mechanism and drive motor preferably are located on the bottom of the chamber at a lower level than the article to be cleaned in the neighboring section, while separated by the partition wall to prevent particulates that might be generated from being deposited on the article to be cleaned. The partition wall serves to reduce cross flow between the two sections, and also serves to protect the slide mechanism and drive motor from the plasma gases that are introduced on the article to be cleaned in the neighboring section while at the same time protecting the article to be cleaned from contamination that might be introduced by the slide mechanism and drive motor. In the event that particulates are generated from the slide mechanism and/or drive motor, preferably a vacuum port is provided in proximity (preferably below) to the slide mechanism and drive motor to allow such particulates to be transported outside the chamber. In alternative embodiments, the system is extended to a two-wafer chamber for higher wafer processing throughput. In this case the mechanism that moves the nozzles preferably are located in the center of the chamber and it drives both nozzle assemblies (or two sides of a single nozzle) at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of certain preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention, the cryogenic spray assembly preferably is enclosed inside the cryogenic vacuum chamber while the slide mechanism and drive motor are outside the vacuum chamber. In such embodiments, the cryogenic spray assembly shaft preferably is the only assembly part that is enclosed inside the cryogenic vacuum chamber and it penetrates the vacuum chamber somewhere above the position of the article to be cleaned, to allow the cryogenic spray nozzle to sweep over it. The cryogenic spray medium preferably enters the vacuum chamber to the nozzle thru a shaft that is connected to an all metal flexible tube to allow the movement of the shaft during the sweeping process, where the nozzle will be sliding from the beginning of the article to be cleaned until the end of that article. The opening from where the shaft enters the vacuum chamber preferably is equipped with multiple O-rings and plates to prevent loss of vacuum from the chamber and maintain high vacuum level inside the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, in yet other preferred embodiments of the present invention, the track and drive motor are located outside the vacuum chamber and attached to a magnetic coupling system. In accordance with such embodiments, the cryogenic spray assembly is enclosed inside the cryogenic vacuum chamber and the chamber has a partition wall with a slot through which the cryogenic spray nozzle extends. The magnetic coupling system preferably slides on the track for the length of the article to be cleaned driven by the motor, while magnetically coupling the cryogenic spray nozzle on the inside of the vacuum chamber to allow the cryogenic spraying nozzle to sweep the length of the article to be cleaned from beginning to end.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention, however, preferably utilizes such an oscillatory, vibratory and/or pulsating cryogenic cleaning assembly in combination with a plasma process preferably in a single vacuum chamber; in alternative embodiments, the plasma process and the cryogenic process are in separate vacuum chambers preferably adjacent to each other in the same processing tool. The cryogenic cleaning implement preferably is provided in combination with the plasma process, where the oscillatory, vibratory or pulsating aspect of the cryogenic cleaning assembly is optionally provided (i.e., in such embodiments, the cryogenic cleaning medium may or may not be provided with oscillatory, vibratory or pulsating action, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Very small quantities of contamination generally are detrimental to the fabrication processes involved in producing integrated circuit wafers, hard discs, optical elements, etc. Contamination in the form of particulates, films, or microscopic clusters of molecules can produce fatal defects in any of the aforementioned products before, during or after fabrication processes. Cleanliness with elevated temperature processes is extremely important due to the typical increase in the reaction rate of impurities with an increase in temperature. At high temperature it is possible for the impurities to diffuse into the silicon or mix with dielectric or conductors to cause unexpected and unwanted electrical or other characteristics. This tends to cause device failure, degraded reliability, and/or operational failure. Cleaning of the surfaces of such products is therefore essential at various phases during fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The use of plasma chemistry has become very important in the semiconductor manufacturing sector. In photoresist stripping, the plasma used in a dry process typically is performed using free radicals. This process is usually enhanced by a physical means to improve material removal and cleaning efficiency, often using an ion bombardment process. There are many shortcomings of the aforementioned combination, such as the conflict of the relatively high pressure requirement for the effectiveness of the pure chemical stripping and the ion bombardment processes that require low pressure to increase the ions mean free path. Another problem with the ion bombardment process is that charging damage could occur and cause wafer defects.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, a plasma process is provided in conjunction with cryogenic cleaning for the physical removal of contamination. In accordance with the present invention, such an approach tends to eliminate the pressure conflict described elsewhere herein and tends to drastically reduce the charging damage problem. Without being bound by theory, this is believed to be due to the pressure upstream of the nozzle not being very critical in the cryogenic expansion. In addition, in accordance with the present invention, the process preferably is regulated for maximum efficiency by controlling the upstream pressure, velocity, temperature, and the frequency and the amplitude of the nozzle vibration or oscillation or nozzle flow pulsation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Cryogenic cleaning of surfaces utilizing impingement of solid particles of relatively inert gases such as argon and CO<sub>2 </sub>are known and the manner in which solid particles of such gases are generated for cleaning purposes need not be described herein. Without being bound by theory, in such cases it is thought that the combination of sublimation of the solid particles as they impinge the surface to be cleaned as well as the impact momentum transfer by the particles provide the vehicle for removing contamination from a surface. It is further recognized that sublimation occurs, and therefore a major portion of the cleaning, only while the surface to be cleaned is at a higher temperature than that of the cryogenic spray. The thermophoresis due to the heated surface also helps to remove the particles from the surface and reduce the chance for re-deposition of the detached particles. As a consequence, heating of the surface being cleaned preferably is required within the vicinity of the impinging cleaning spray. In addition to the thermophoresis effect, heating the article to be cleaned generally tends to cause some of the cryogenic fluid to melt and then evaporate instead of sublimate, hence tending to result in the presence of liquid phase cryogenic along with the gas and solid phases on the surface of the article. The presence of the three phases generally occurs in a non-equilibrium fashion. The presence of the liquid phase is important in creating a solvent property that will aid in removing contaminants from the surface of the article.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, heating for the cryogenic cleaning is optional. Another important aspect of single chamber processes with the combination of plasma and cryogenic cleaning is the elimination of contamination that in certain situations tends to be deposited on the wafer with cryogenic cleaning alone. Without being bound by theory, the sources of the contaminants are believed the delivery system and impurities that exist in the cryogenic cleaning medium; those impurities are believed to be composed of fluorinated and other hydrocarbons. The fact that the plasma gases are used to clean fluorinated hydrocarbons could eliminate this problem In certain preferred embodiments, a purification system is provided to remove particles and other contaminants such as hydrocarbons for use in the systems and methods of the present invention. In another embodiment, cleaning by various other solvents and solvent combinations where the levels of residual contaminants following the cleaning process need not be held quite as low, is also envisioned for use in the systems and methods of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As previously explained, certain disclosure from the First and Second Referenced Applications will now be provided so that an exemplary, preferred oscillatory cryogenic cleaning assembly and method might be understood.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, wherein one exemplary embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. A system <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having an enclosure <b>11</b> depicted in phantom line. The environment within the enclosure is maintained at a level of cleanliness depending on the level of cleanliness to be imposed on articles to be cleaned within the enclosure. A scavenging line <b>12</b> is shown exiting the enclosure <b>11</b> at the bottom thereof and proceeding to a filter <b>13</b> for removing particulates from the enclosure environment that may be generated by the cleaning process or by mechanical components within the enclosure. Rudimentary support structure is shown including a base plate <b>14</b> and two uprights <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> attached at their bases to the base plate. The description herein makes reference to an XYZ coordinate system) wherein the Z direction is substantially vertical and the mutually orthogonal Z and Y axes are substantially horizontal. An XY stage is shown having an X stage <b>18</b> for movement on a Y stage <b>19</b>, that is mounted on the base plate <b>14</b> (other X/Y stage configurations are within the scope of the present invention). A holding chuck <b>21</b>, in this instance a vacuum chuck connected through a line <b>22</b> to a vacuum source <b>23</b>, is mounted for movement on the X stage <b>18</b>. An article to be cleaned, in this exemplary illustration an integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> mounted to the vacuum chuck <b>21</b> and held in place by known means (e.g., held in place by the vacuum). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b> in an initial position, and subsequently in a cleaning position at <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a post-heating position at <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b> preferably is transportable along a predetermined path governed by the movement of the X stage <b>18</b> on the Y stage <b>19</b> and the movement of the vacuum chuck <b>21</b> on the X stage <b>18</b>. Chuck <b>21</b> is driven over the upper surface of the X stage by known means, which may include a carriage portion within the X stage driven by a lead screw and a servo motor (not shown), for example. A cable connection <b>26</b> is shown at one end of the X stage for introducing power to energize the aforementioned servo motor. A similar cable connection (not shown) is provided to power the Y stage <b>19</b> so that the X stage, mounted on a moveable carriage of the Y stage, may be moved in the Y direction by a lead screw and servo motor similar to that mentioned hereinbefore in conjunction with the X stage.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">From the foregoing it is seen that the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b> shown in an initial position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be moved to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to pass beneath a pre-heater <b>27</b> at a pre-heat position along the aforementioned predetermined path, which preferably pre-heats the integrated circuit wafer prior to cleaning. Further movement of the chuck <b>21</b> brings the integrated circuit wafer to a cleaning position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at <b>24</b><i>a </i>Continuing movement of the chuck along the predetermined path defined by the X and Y stages <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> delivers the integrated circuit wafer to a post-heat position shown at <b>24</b><i>b</i>, wherein post-heating of the integrated circuit wafer preferably is performed by a post-heater <b>28</b>. The pre and post heaters may be infrared lamps or other heating sources. These heaters preferably impart surface temperatures to the article that enhance cleaning, prevent re-contamination and remove static electricity. In alternative embodiments, the pre and post heaters are supplemented with, or replaced by, a heated vacuum chuck, with the heated vacuum chuck providing heat to the article to be cleaned, etc. The use of such a heated vacuum chuck also may be used in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A nozzle assembly support plate <b>29</b> is shown extending between the two uprights <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>. The support plate preferably is attached at the upright <b>16</b> in a Z position by a friction clamp <b>31</b>. The support plate <b>29</b> preferably is mounted on the opposing end to upright <b>17</b> in the Z position by an additional friction clamp <b>32</b>. It should be noted that the position of the mounting plate <b>29</b> in the Z direction may be governed by a servo motor <b>33</b> and associated mechanism (not shown) similar to that of the X and Y stages, so that the Z position of the support plate <b>29</b> is dictated by a control <b>34</b>, which may controllably raise or lower the support plate <b>29</b> either before, during or after cleaning or other processing.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> is shown mounted to the support plate <b>29</b> at a pivot <b>37</b>. A nozzle <b>38</b> is shown extending from the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> at a lower portion thereof at the cleaning position shown by the position of integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A preferred exemplary angle of the nozzle <b>38</b> to the surface to be cleaned on the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b> is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to be obtuse to the direction of approach of the integrated circuit wafer. Expressed alternatively, the angle of the nozzle <b>38</b>, and the subsequent spray emitted therefrom, is acute to the downstream portion of the predetermined path along which the wafer travels on the XY stage. The point to be made here is that the spray emanating from the spray nozzle <b>38</b> preferably is set to impinge the surface to be cleaned at an angle to facilitate contaminant removal and to add any velocity of the surface to be cleaned to the spray velocity for purposes of enhancing contaminant removal. That angle of impingement as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> preferably is adjustable by moving the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> rotationally about the pivot <b>37</b> and fixing the angle in the adjusted position.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should also be noted that, in preferred embodiments, one or more jets for cleaning an article, with the oscillatory-type movement of the present invention, such jets, although having a non-uniform spray pattern, may result in a more substantially uniform and improved spray distribution due to the oscillatory-type movement, which preferably enables an article to be more uniformly cleaned in a single pass, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning to the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> is shown poised in position above the integrated circuit wafer in the position represented by <b>24</b><i>a </i>wherein the wafer is moving to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> relative to the spray nozzle assembly. Nozzle <b>38</b> is shown directing a cleaning spray <b>39</b> onto the surface of the article to be cleaned (integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at the spray impingement angle referred to hereinbefore in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A second spray nozzle <b>41</b> is shown just visible in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for preferably delivering a heated inert gas spray <b>42</b> for heating, drying and removing static electricity from the surface just cleaned by the spray <b>39</b>. The heated inert gas spray nozzle <b>41</b> may fill the requirements of the post-heater <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Details of construction of the nozzles <b>38</b> and <b>41</b> will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an inert gas source <b>43</b> connected through a flow line to a temperature control module <b>44</b> and subsequently to a gas filter <b>46</b>. Inert gas flow is subsequently directed through an ionizer <b>47</b> and a flexible line <b>48</b> to the nozzle <b>41</b> contained in the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b>. A cleaning medium container <b>49</b> (such as an argon or CO<sub>2 </sub>gas container) preferably is connected through a gas flow line to a temperature control <b>51</b>. The temperature controlled cleaning medium preferably is connected to a pressure booster <b>52</b> and subsequently to a filter <b>53</b> for removing contaminants. The filtered, temperature controlled and pressurized cleaning medium preferably is connected through a flexible line <b>54</b> to the nozzle <b>38</b> in the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b>. The manner in which a gas cleaning medium is conditioned for cryogenic cleaning is known, and teachings from the art submitted contemporaneously herewith are incorporated herein by reference. In certain applications the cleaning medium contained in the container <b>49</b> may be a solvent different from the cryogenic gas, known to those in this art, descriptions of which will not be undertaken here. A flexible vacuum line <b>56</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to remove contaminants generated by functions taking place within the case of the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> so that they are not deposited upon the surface to be cleaned. The flexible vacuum line <b>56</b> is led to the outside of the enclosure <b>11</b> when the system containing the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> is enclosed therein. The location of the pivot <b>37</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown by the hole <b>37</b><i>a </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> with the cover removed. The article to be cleaned represented by the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is seen to be moving to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> relative to the spray nozzle assembly. The spray nozzle assembly is pivoted about the pivot <b>37</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to assume the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so that the cleaning nozzle <b>38</b> dispenses the cleaning spray <b>39</b> at an obtuse angle relative to the approaching portion of the surface to be cleaned. The cleaning nozzle <b>38</b> preferably has a nozzle axis and a nozzle tip with an elongated nozzle opening therein to provide the exemplary preferred fan-shaped spray <b>39</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A friction lock <b>57</b> is shown on the nozzle <b>38</b> which allows the tip of the nozzle to be rotated around the nozzle axis and to be locked in the rotated position. Rotation of the tip of nozzle <b>38</b> preferably allows the fan-shaped spray <b>39</b> to impinge the surface to be cleaned at an angle of rotation about the nozzle axis. This angle of rotation allows the fan-shaped spray <b>39</b> to push contaminates to one side of the surface to be cleaned as to the spray nozzle is oscillated to thereby affect a “snow plow” function. This will be further explained in conjunction with the description of the oscillation of the nozzle <b>38</b>. In like fashion, nozzle <b>41</b> for dispensing inert drying gas, preferably has a friction lock <b>58</b> functioning in the same manner as the friction lock <b>57</b> on nozzle <b>38</b>. Nozzle <b>41</b> also has a tip with an elongated opening therein for preferably producing a fan shaped emission of inert drying gas <b>42</b>. Nozzle <b>38</b> preferably is attached to a nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> through a tube <b>61</b> and a connector <b>62</b> coupling the nozzle <b>38</b> to the flexible line <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Nozzle <b>41</b> also preferably has a tube <b>63</b> connected thereto which is mounted in the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b>. A connector <b>64</b> connects the tube <b>63</b> to the flexible line <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to deliver heated inert gas to the surface to be cleaned immediately after cleaning when that method is used for post-heating of and removal of static charge from the surface being cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is cut away to show installation of the outer diameter of an outer bearing race <b>66</b> mounted within a bore <b>67</b> in the nozzle mounting block. An inner race <b>68</b> on the bearing within the bore <b>67</b> has an eccentric cam-member <b>69</b> mounted therein. A shaft <b>71</b> on a pulley <b>72</b> is passed through an offset hole <b>73</b> in the eccentric cam and fixed therein. The pulley <b>72</b> is driven by a belt <b>74</b> which in turn is driven by a pulley <b>76</b> mounted on the end of a shaft <b>77</b> driven by a motor <b>78</b>. The motor <b>78</b> is mounted in a motor mount block <b>79</b> (partly cut away for clarity) secured to the outer case of the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b>. The motor mount block <b>79</b> also serves to mount the pulley <b>72</b> for rotation thereon. A plurality of arms <b>81</b>, two of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are fastened to the motor mounting block <b>79</b> extending outwardly therefrom to a position beyond the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b>. Yieldable structure such as coil springs <b>82</b>, extend from the ends of the arms <b>81</b> to the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> and from the motor mounting block <b>79</b> to the opposing side of the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b>. The ends of the coil springs <b>82</b> are encompassed by buttons or caps <b>83</b> that are seated in counter bores in the structural members <b>59</b>, <b>79</b> and <b>81</b> that receive respective ends of the coil springs <b>82</b>. The material for the end caps <b>83</b> is preferably Dehrin AF. Very little particulate is sloughed off of the Delrin AF surfaces when the material is subjected to friction. As a result, the springs <b>82</b> are anchored on one end within the bores <b>84</b> at the ends of the arms <b>81</b> and in the motor mounting block <b>79</b> and anchored at an opposing end within bores <b>84</b> in the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b>. Nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> is therefore suspended by the springs <b>82</b> in position spaced from the remainder of the spray nozzle assembly. Consequently, when the spray nozzles <b>38</b> and <b>41</b> are mounted on the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b>, and when the nozzle mounting block is moved, the sprays <b>39</b> and <b>42</b> are moved relative to the surface to be cleaned on the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An optimum offset from the geometric center of the offset cam <b>69</b> has been found to be about 0.075 inches. As a result an optimum peak to peak amplitude for cam excursion is about 0.150 inches. An optimum cam rotation frequency through the pulleys <b>76</b> and <b>72</b> has been found to be approximately 27.5 revolutions per second or about 27½ Hertz. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the optimum amplitude provided by the cam <b>69</b> falls within the range of about 0.120 to 0.180 inches peak to peak. The optimum frequency falls within the range of about 25 to 30 Hertz. Other amplitudes and frequencies for optimum cleaning of specific contaminants from surfaces are envisioned as within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Springs <b>82</b>, in this preferred embodiment, preferably have coils of 0.043 inch diameter stainless steel wire, with one half (½) inch diameter coils and lengths of one and one-half (½) inches. Such springs generally should provide adequately support the mass of the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> and members attached thereto. It should further be noted that motor <b>78</b> could be mounted on motor mounting block <b>79</b> to directly drive shaft <b>71</b> connected to the eccentric cam <b>69</b> in those instances where the-rotational output speed of the motor shaft <b>77</b> imparts an acceptable frequency to the oscillatory motion induced by the rotation of the eccentric cam <b>69</b>. In any event, the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> and the nozzles <b>38</b> and <b>41</b> attached thereto are driven at a predetermined frequency and amplitude, so that the nozzles are driven in a circular pattern having a diameter of the peak to peak oscillation amplitude and a frequency determined by the rotational frequency of the eccentric cam <b>69</b>. The physical dimensions of springs <b>82</b> will depend on the mass of the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b>. Therefore, heavier or lighter springs <b>82</b> may be used as the spray nozzle assembly assumes greater or lesser mass. It is noted that the preferred structure for imparting the cyclic motion to the nozzles <b>38</b> and <b>41</b> relative to the surface to be cleaned are exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> with the motor mounting block <b>79</b> removed from the drawing for clarity. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a single nozzle <b>38</b> is shown having the aforementioned preferred elongated aperture therein for providing emission of the fan-shaped spray <b>39</b> for impingement on the surface to be cleaned. The surface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the surface of the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b><i>a</i>. Friction lock <b>57</b> in the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is loosened and the nozzle <b>38</b> is rotated counter-clockwise (looking at the elongated aperture therein). The orientation of the aperture of nozzle <b>38</b> is locked in the adjusted position by the friction lock <b>57</b>. When the motor <b>78</b> is energized and an oscillation in the nozzle <b>38</b> is imparted by the oscillation of the nozzle mounting block <b>59</b> on the support provided by the springs <b>82</b>, the nozzle tip, and therefore the spray <b>39</b> describes a circular pattern at the predetermined amplitude and frequency. The rotation of the oscillation is indicated by the arrow <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The impingement of the spray pattern <b>39</b> on the surface to be cleaned is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The nozzle <b>38</b> and the spray pattern <b>39</b> moves during half of each rotational cycle toward the integrated circuit wafer. Further, during the subsequent half of each rotational cycle the nozzle and spray move away from the wafer surface. This is seen when it is recognized that the nozzle tip describes a circle during oscillation, wherein the plane of the circle substantially includes an extension of the nozzle axis. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the rotational arrow <b>84</b> and the arrows <b>85</b> representing oscillation circle diameters. The nozzle <b>38</b> sweeps the spray <b>39</b> side to side on the wafer surface because the edge of the circle represented by diameters <b>85</b> appears as a straight line when viewed from the wafer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Now considering the rotation of the flat fan shaped spray <b>39</b> about the nozzle axis by the adjustment of the friction lock <b>57</b>, the fan <b>39</b> impinges the surface at a compound angle (displaced from the side to side sweep) preferably resulting in the “snow plow” effect of the fan-shaped spray <b>39</b> during half of each cycle as it rotates in the direction of the arrow <b>84</b>. Further, the disclosed oscillation of the fan-shaped spray <b>39</b> provides the benefits of pulsing which enhances cleaning. Pulsing in the past has been provided in a spray by interrupting the spray periodically. However, such interruption causes the spray jet to lose optimum characteristics as the spray is cut off and restarted when the spray is a cryogenic cleaning medium comprised of solid gas particles. The pulsing occurs in the embodiments disclosed herein due to increasing velocity (or acceleration) as the spray <b>39</b> converges on the surface to be cleaned during one half (½) of the oscillatory cycle and the decrease in velocity (negative acceleration) as the spray <b>39</b> diverges from the surface to be cleaned during the other half of the oscillatory cycle. Spray nozzle <b>38</b> describing a circular pattern during oscillation as described hereinbefore, preferably lays down a laterally oscillating spray pattern on the surface to be cleaned. The angle of the spray pattern impingement on the surface is therefore formed by adjustment of the spray nozzle assembly <b>36</b> rotationally about the pivot <b>37</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and adjustment to the spray fan orientation about the nozzle axis through adjustment of the friction lock <b>57</b>. Pulsing and compound angle “snow plow” effects in cleaning are believed to provide advantages in obtaining thorough contaminant removal. It should be mentioned that the shaft <b>71</b> for driving the eccentric cam <b>69</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) could be driven directly by the motor <b>78</b>, allowing elimination of the pulleys <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> and the belt <b>74</b> as discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. On the other hand, selection of relative diameters of pulleys <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> may be used to adjust the frequency of oscillation if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a robot <b>86</b> having an extendable and retractable arm <b>87</b>, providing movement in a vertical direction, and a laterally extending arm segment <b>88</b> disposed for rotation about an axis <b>89</b> at the upper end of the arm <b>87</b>. An additional robot arm <b>91</b> is provided that moves translationally in a horizontal direction. Translationally moving arm <b>91</b> extends through an egress/ingress port <b>92</b> in the enclosure <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to insert an article having a surface to be cleaned, such as the integrated circuit wafer <b>24</b>, into a controlled environment within the enclosure <b>11</b> as discussed in conjunction with the enclosure <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The wafer <b>24</b> is shown at the limit of its insertion within the enclosure <b>11</b>, having passed the pre-heater and post-heater combination <b>93</b> immediately inside the ingress/egress port. Wafer <b>24</b> is therefore pre-heated at the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and then withdrawn toward the ingress/egress port <b>92</b> to pass beneath a bank (plurality) of cleaning nozzles <b>94</b>. The bank of nozzles extend across the entire dimension of the wafer, providing impingement by a plurality of fan shaped sprays on the surface to be cleaned, thereby cleaning the surface in a single pass beneath the bank of cleaning nozzles <b>94</b>. Immediately following passage of the surface to be cleaned beneath the cleaning nozzles <b>94</b>, an inert drying gas and anti-static electricity array <b>96</b> is positioned that also extends across the entire dimension of the wafer <b>24</b>. As the wafer is withdrawn toward the ingress/egress port <b>92</b>, the surface is dried by the inert drying gas nozzle array arid further heated by the pre/post heater <b>93</b> to a temperature that will prohibit condensation on the clean surface as it is withdrawn from the enclosure <b>11</b> by the robot arm <b>91</b>. Positioned adjacent the cleaning nozzle array <b>94</b> is a scavenging intake <b>97</b> that operates to remove particulates cleaned from the surface of the wafer <b>94</b> as well as particulates generated within the enclosure <b>11</b>. Scavenging intake is connected to an exhaust <b>98</b>, which carries the contaminants from within the enclosure to the ambient environment. Pressure within the enclosure <b>11</b> preferably is maintained slightly higher than ambient pressure to prevent contaminants from entering the enclosure through the ingress/egress port <b>92</b>. Further, as in the description of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the scavenging line <b>12</b> is provided to withdraw the enclosed atmosphere and deliver it to the cleaning filter <b>13</b> to further reduce contaminants within the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With regard to an exemplary preferred method in accordance with the present invention, there preferably exist certain pre-cleaning fabrication steps for the article having a surface to be cleaned followed by the step of cleaning the surface, and culminating in post-cleaning fabrication steps for the article having a surface to be cleaned. The block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts these steps. Details of a preferred surface cleaning process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are found in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the pre-cleaning fabrication steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> followed by mounting the article having a surface to be cleaned on an article transport. In one embodiment of the cleaning process the article is transported to a cleaning position and the shape of the spray is configured to assume a fan shape. The spray nozzle in then oriented to cause the spray to impinge the surface to be cleaned at an angle to the lateral dimension of the surface as it passes the spray. This angle is called a compound angle. The nozzle is then aimed at the surface to be cleaned to form an obtuse angle with the surface relative to the approaching portion of the surface to be cleaned. Subsequently, the nozzle is oscillated so that the spray functions as a pulsing spray as the forward motion of the nozzle is added to the velocity of the cleaning spray during one portion of the oscillation cycle and is subtracted from the velocity of the cleaning spray during the subsequent portion of the oscillation cycle. Moreover, the orientation of the nozzle aperture and the fan-shaped spray about the nozzle axis preferably provides a “snow plow” effect facilitating cleaning as previously described. Subsequent to the cleaning by the oscillating fan-shaped spray the article preferably is moved onto the post-cleaning fabrication steps as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another aspect of the cleaning process of the present invention a cryogenic cleaning medium is used. As mentioned hereinbefore an inert gas such as argon or CO<sub>2 </sub>is in substantially solid or “snow” form as it is emitted from the nozzle so that sublimation of the gas occurs at the surface to be cleaned. In this process the surface to be cleaned preferably is preheated to a temperature such that the surface to be cleaned will remain at a temperature above ambient during the impingement of the cryogenic spray on the surface. The spray preferably is shaped into a fan shape and the spray nozzle aperture preferably is oriented about the nozzle access to provide impingement of the fan spray on the surface to be cleaned at an angle to the lateral dimension of the surface (the compound angle). The spray nozzle preferably is then aimed at the surface at an obtuse angle relative to the surface portion approaching the cleaning spray and the nozzle preferably is oscillated in a cyclic pattern having a pre-determined amplitude and frequency. The nozzle preferably oscillates in a substantially circular pattern in a plane including the nozzle axis so that the spray pattern is lateral and linear on the surface. Moreover, due to the orientation of the nozzle rotationally about the nozzle axis, the spray impinges the surface at the compound angle and performs a “snow plow” function. This function is believed to tend to push contaminants to one side of the surface to be cleaned. Following exposure to the oscillation cleaning spray, the surface preferably is post-heated to a temperature above ambient temperature to prevent condensation and recontamination of the surface and also to remove static charge. It should be noted that the step of shaping the spray preferably reside in both embodiments of the process described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and includes expanding the width of the cleaning spray to cover the lateral dimension of the surface to be cleaned. As a result, the cleaning of the surface may be obtained in a single pass of the surface to be cleaned past the spray. Subsequently the post-heated article surface is passed to the post-cleaning fabrication steps as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As previously explained, preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed to the combination of plasma processing (such as removal or ashing of a photoresist-type layer) that provides a chemical mechanism, followed by a cryogenic cleaning processing that preferably provides a physical removal-type mechanism While oscillatory or vibratory-type cryogenic cleaning is believed to provide more optimum results in certain embodiments, the present invention as set forth herein is expressly not limited to the use of oscillatory or vibratory type cryogenic cleaning, and certain embodiments of the present invention utilize cryogenic cleaning that is not oscillatory or vibratory. Accordingly, the foregoing description from the First Referenced Applications is provided as background and for providing a description of an exemplary oscillatory assembly used only in certain embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, exemplary preferred embodiments of the present invention described in the Second Referenced Applications will now be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, gas source <b>104</b> provides a source of reactant gas, which in preferred embodiments may consist of, for example, gases selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, fluorine, hydro fluorocarbon or a mixture of such gases, representative examples being O2, N2, H2, CF4 and NF3, etc. The reactant gas(es) preferably is/are provided through compressed cylinder(s) such as is illustrated by gas source <b>104</b> (hereinafter, the reactant gas or gases or referred to simply as the “reactant gas”). In preferred embodiments, the reactant gas is supplied via mass flow controller(s) <b>105</b> (which serve to control the flow of the reactant gas) and pipe <b>102</b> to plasma applicator <b>103</b>, which in preferred embodiments consists of a microwave discharge apparatus, which includes or is coupled to microwave source <b>103</b>A Microwave source <b>103</b>A and plasma applicator/microwave discharge <b>103</b> create free radicals from the reactant gas, which may then be supplied to vacuum processing chamber <b>101</b>. The reactant-gas free radicals preferably are introduced into processing chamber <b>101</b> via a gas distribution system or implement, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is illustrated as showerhead <b>108</b>, such that the activated reactant gas/free radicals are presented to, and may react with, material of the article being processed (indicated as wafer <b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, which has been introduced into processing chamber <b>101</b> as illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In preferred embodiments, heated wafer holder <b>110</b> is provided over heating implement <b>111</b>, which optionally provides heat preferably via an electric heating element from the back side of wafer <b>109</b>, in a manner as is known in the art. As will be appreciated, heating implement <b>111</b> may be controlled to provide the proper and optimum temperature for the particular process. Pressure within processing chamber <b>101</b> is controlled in part via exhaust pump <b>106</b>, which is in flow communication with processing chamber <b>101</b> via exhaust pipe <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It also should be noted that RF source <b>101</b>A is optionally provided as illustrated. In such embodiments, wafer holder <b>110</b> preferably serves as a first electrode, and a second electrode is provided, which may consist of the housing of processing chamber <b>101</b> or showerhead <b>108</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, RF source <b>101</b>A provides RF energy that creates an RF plasma that produces radicals and ions from the reactant gas that are provided to wafer <b>109</b>, such as for ashing or removing a photoresist-type layer on wafer <b>109</b>. In certain embodiments, only an RF plasma is utilized (and thus the remote plasma discharge <b>103</b> is not provided or operative), while in other embodiments only the radicals produced by remote plasma discharge <b>103</b> are utilized (and thus RF source and/or the first and second electrodes are not provided or are not operative), while in yet other embodiments both the RF plasma and the radicals produced by remote plasma discharge <b>103</b> are utilized. It should be understood that the RF plasma and electrodes may be biased and controlled such that what is known as an RIE process may be carried out, although the present invention is not limited thereto. What is important is that one or more plasma/free radical sources are provided to deliver the reactant gas species to the surface of wafer <b>109</b> such that the photoresist or similar layer thereon may be attacked chemically (which may have a physical component as well, in the case of an RIE process) so as to ash or remove the photoresist layer. An exemplary disclosure of such an apparatus having a microwave discharge implement and an RF/RIE plasma is U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,831, which is hereby incorporated by reference for background purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In conventional approaches, a de-ionized water or solvent process is provided after plasma treatment in order to remove residue resulting from the plasma process. The necessity of such a DI water and/or solvent cleaning has been determined to be detrimental to optimum processing, and in accordance with embodiments of the present invention a cryogenic cleaning process is performed as part of, or subsequent to, the plasma process. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, nozzle/nozzle assembly <b>112</b> is provided with a transport mechanism that moves nozzle/nozzle assembly <b>112</b> relative to wafer <b>109</b> in a manner such that the cryogenic cleaning medium (preferably consisting of or including carbon dioxide) impinges on and over the surface of wafer <b>109</b>. The use of the cryogenic cleaning process, in combination with the remotely-generated and/or RF generated plasma, has been determined to provide more optimum removal of photoresist-type layers.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In accordance with certain preferred embodiments, an oscillatory or vibratory discharge of the cryogenic cleaning medium is provided in order to provide more optimum cleaning. While the Referenced Applications described exemplary ways of implementing such an oscillatory or vibratory mechanism, the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates another exemplary mechanism As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, an oscillatory/vibratory nozzle cleaning system, preferably dispensing cryogenic, solvent or solvent combination cleaning medium(s) to assist the plasma cleaning and photoresist stripping/removal process. The oscillatory/vibratory nozzle cleaning and plasma processes can be performed sequentially or simultaneously, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter. In the illustrated embodiment, the oscillatory/vibratory nozzle cleaning system includes vibration actuators <b>115</b>, which are attached to nozzle manifold <b>113</b> to induce the oscillation or vibration. The oscillatory/vibrator nozzle cleaning system preferably is mounted on vibration isolators <b>116</b> to prevent vibration of posts <b>114</b>. Posts <b>114</b> (preferably two) are mounted on linear slide assembly <b>117</b> to allow nozzle/nozzle assembly to “sweep” wafer <b>109</b> with the cryogenic cleaning medium. Nozzle manifold <b>113</b> preferably utilizes a pressurized plenum to ensure uniform flow through nozzle/nozzle assembly <b>112</b>. It should be noted that the oscillatory/vibratory nozzle system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is exemplary; what is important is that the process chamber include plasma treatment capability such as has been described, and also a preferably integral type of cryogenic cleaning medium assembly that can movably or otherwise provide the cryogenic cleaning medium on and over the surface of wafer <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In operation, wafer <b>109</b> is introduced into processing chamber <b>101</b>; in an illustrated embodiment, wafer <b>109</b> includes a photoresist or similar-type layer that needs to be removed. Plasma/free radicals are generated via the reactant gas (either via plasma applicator/microwave discharge <b>103</b> and/or an RF plasma, etc.), which preferably chemically attack and remove the material of the photoresist layer. In the case of reactant gas that is free radicalized via plasma applicator/microwave discharge <b>103</b>, free radicals and ions are generated from the reactant gas, although it is believed (without being bound by theory) that the concentration of ions that are introduced into processing chamber <b>101</b> is low due to the relatively high operating pressure that may be utilized. Either subsequent to or interspersed with plasma processing steps, one or more cryogenic cleaning steps are performed, which serve to remove (preferably with a mechanical type action) residues and contaminants that are present after the plasma/free radical treatment. Without being bound by theory, it also is believed that plasma treatment subsequent to a cryogenic cleaning step helps remove residue that exists after the cryogenic cleaning step, and that the cryogenic cleaning subsequent to a plasma/free radical treatment helps remove residue that exists after the plasma treatment. In combination, it has been determined that such combined processing produces a more optimum photoresist-type layer removal process, which may eliminate or substantially reduce the need for a DI water or solvent rinse process.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates another view of the embodiment described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> (although for simplicity, for example, RF source <b>101</b>A has not been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates an embodiment of nozzle/nozzle assembly in flow communication with nozzle manifold <b>113</b>, and preferably positioned on vibration actuators <b>115</b> and vibration isolators <b>116</b>, which in turn are positioned on posts <b>114</b>, the assemblage of which is movable via, for example, linear slide assembly <b>117</b>. Other aspects of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> will not be further discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> illustrate a nozzle assembly, another exemplary preferred embodiment of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, cryogenic medium inlet <b>117</b> is provided, which is in flow communication with pressure plenum <b>116</b>. A perforated plate or surface <b>118</b> is provided in flow communication with pressure plenum <b>116</b>, such as is illustrated. As part of, or coupled to, perforated plate or surface <b>118</b>, but in any event in flow communication therewith, are preferably axi-symmetric nozzles <b>119</b>. Nozzles <b>119</b> may be holes of a tapered or conical shape (or other shape to provide the desired nozzle characteristics) formed in a relatively thick plate (thick enough to accommodate the desired nozzle shape and provide the necessary mechanical strength, etc.). Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, perforated or slotted plate <b>118</b>A may be provided, with planar nozzle system <b>118</b>B provided. As illustrated, planar nozzle system <b>118</b>B may consist of two inclined planes coupled to form a slotted or planar nozzle. Again, as will be appreciated, such a planar nozzle assembly will have internal shapes and an exit orifice or orifices in order to distribute the cryogenic cleaning medium in a desired manner, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which nozzle/nozzle assembly <b>112</b> is stationary, and wafer <b>109</b> moves relative to nozzle/nozzle assembly <b>112</b>. In such an embodiment, wafer holder <b>110</b> consists of, or is on, a movement mechanism such as a linear slide assembly such that after plasma processing, wafer <b>109</b> is moved relative to nozzle/nozzle assembly <b>112</b> such that the cryogenic cleaning medium is presented to the surface of wafer <b>109</b> such as has been previously described. Also as previously described, the cryogenic cleaning medium may be delivered in an oscillatory or vibratory manner (although this is not required in all embodiments), which may be via a mechanism such described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, or which may be via the oscillatory mechanisms as described in the Referenced Applications (and described above). Other aspects of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that are in common with the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, including the use of an RF source to generate an RF/RIE type plasma treatment, which will not be further described for purposes of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a further alternative embodiment, wherein showerhead <b>108</b> includes inlet <b>115</b> for purposes of introducing the cryogenic cleaning medium (e.g., carbon dioxide). In such embodiments, showerhead <b>108</b> provides for delivery of free radicals generated from the reactant gas to the surface of wafer <b>109</b>, while also providing for delivery of the cryogenic cleaning medium to the surface of wafer <b>109</b>. In an illustrative operation of such an embodiment, a plasma/free radical treatment may be provided (which may be accompanied or substituted by an RF/RIE plasma treatment, such as previously described), which may involve showerhead <b>108</b> distributing free radicals generated from the reactant gas at a first point in time (plasma treatment phase), and distributing the cryogenic cleaning medium at a second point in time (cryogenic cleaning phase) (the distribution of free radicals and/or cryogenic cleaning medium is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by spray pattern <b>113</b>). In certain embodiments, a single set of distribution holes are provided in showerhead <b>108</b>, with the reactant gas flow and the cryogenic cleaning medium flow alternatively turned on and off. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, however, showerhead <b>120</b> may be provided, which includes separate distribution holes for the plasma/free radicals (holes <b>122</b>) and cryogenic cleaning nozzles.(holes <b>121</b>). In such embodiments, holes <b>122</b> have a size and shape for the more optimum delivery of plasma/free radicals, while holes <b>121</b> have a size and shape for the more optimum delivery of the cryogenic cleaning medium In one exemplary embodiment, the size of holes <b>122</b> is greater than the size of holes <b>121</b>, and preferably hole <b>121</b> are formed to provide a nozzle effect for the dispersal and distribution of the cryogenic cleaning medium, etc. As the characteristics of the medium passing through the holes, and the more optimum delivery conditions from the holes, are quite distinct, having first and second holes of differing sizes and shapes and flow characteristics has been determined to provide more optimum results in such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a general process flow in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention. As previously described, an article, wafer, substrate, etc. having a layer to be removed (e.g., a photoresist-type layer) is introduced into the processing chamber. This generally is illustrated by start step <b>125</b>. At step <b>126</b>, a plasma treatment step is provided, such as previously described. This may consist of plasma/free radicals remotely generated such as previously described, and/or an RF or RIE type plasma treatment, also such as previously described. At step <b>127</b>, a cryogenic cleaning (e.g., carbon dioxide) process is performed, such as previously described. This may be a two step, two phase process, where a single plasma phase/step <b>126</b> is performed, and then a single cryogenic cleaning phase/step <b>127</b> is performed, with the flow then stopping as illustrated by end step <b>131</b>. In alternate embodiments, however, as indicated by flow path <b>130</b>, a plasma treatment phase/step is provided followed by a cryogenic cleaning phase/step, with the plasma treatment-cryogenic cleaning steps repeated a plurality of times. In such embodiments, and without being bound by theory, it is believed that the plasma treatment phase provides a primarily chemical means for removal of the target material, while the cryogenic cleaning phase removes residues and materials present after the plasma treatment phase, and with a subsequent plasma treatment phase helping remove residue and materials present after the cryogenic cleaning phase. While not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in certain such embodiments, the process begins and ends with a plasma treatment phase.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the addition to the foregoing discussion relating to the First and Second Referenced Applications, additional refinements and inventions based thereon will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, wherein one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.

In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, track <b>234</b> and drive motor <b>214</b> are outside vacuum chamber <b>228</b>, and a magnetically coupled drive system is provided as will be hereinafter described. In this embodiment, the cryogenic spray assembly is enclosed inside cryogenic vacuum chamber <b>228</b>. Chamber <b>228</b> preferably has partition wall <b>224</b> with a slot through which cryogenic spray nozzle <b>207</b> extends.

The two magnets <b>236</b> are provided to create a magnetic coupling system that starts when drive motor <b>214</b> starts and then will cause cryogenic spray nozzle <b>207</b> to start sweeping over article <b>208</b>. Section <b>226</b> contains article <b>208</b> and cryogenic spray nozzle <b>207</b>. Slide mechanism <b>220</b> preferably is located on the bottom of the chamber of section <b>222</b> at a point below article <b>208</b> in neighboring section <b>226</b> while separated by partition wall <b>224</b> to help prevent particulates that might be generated by slide mechanism <b>220</b> or the like and then be undesirably deposited on article <b>208</b>. Partition wall <b>224</b> also helps to reduce cross flow between the two sections <b>222</b> and <b>226</b>, and also helps to protect slide mechanism <b>220</b> and magnet <b>236</b> from the plasma gases that are introduced to article <b>208</b> in neighboring section <b>226</b> (for clarity, the implements to provide the plasma processing are not shown in these figures) while at the same time helping to protect article <b>208</b> in section <b>226</b> from the contamination introduced by slide mechanism <b>220</b>, etc. In the event that particulates are generated in section <b>222</b> such as from slide mechanism <b>220</b>, preferably a vacuum port is provided in a lower portion of section <b>222</b> to allow such particulates to be transported outside the chamber. Cryogenic spray nozzle <b>207</b> preferably is attached to block <b>2125</b> on cryogenic slide mechanism <b>220</b> in such a way that, when the slider moves from position A to position B (where the length from position A to position B is the maximum diameter length of the article to be cleaned), cryogenic spray nozzle <b>207</b> will sweep that length. In such embodiments of cryogenic vacuum chamber <b>228</b>, article <b>208</b> preferably is placed on electrostatic chuck <b>230</b> with enough applied voltage to the chuck to insure that the momentum of the spray does not cause any movement of article <b>208</b> while spray nozzle <b>207</b> sweeps over article <b>208</b> with cryogenic fluids coming from valve <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> are diagrams illustrating a cryogenic vacuum chamber for another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention the cryogenic spraying nozzle has a curved shape that preferably matches, or corresponds in desired mariner to, the contour of the wafer or other article. The curve nozzle allows the spraying to occur on at the wafer in the beginning of the spray process. This will reduce the amount of the cryogenic fluid used that misses the wafer surface and reduce the probability of wafer contamination transfer onto the wafer by the impinging spray on surface adjacent to the wafer. This embodiment operates similar to the embodiment discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> (with the exception of curved nozzle assembly <b>207</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> are diagrams illustrating a cryogenic vacuum chamber for another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the cryogenic spray assembly is enclosed inside cryogenic vacuum chamber <b>228</b>. Chamber <b>228</b> has partition walls <b>224</b> with a slot through which cryogenic spray nozzles <b>207</b> extend. Partition walls <b>224</b> divide cryogenic spray chamber <b>228</b> into three sections, one section <b>22</b> with the track, drive motor <b>214</b> and slide mechanism assembly <b>220</b>, while two other sections <b>226</b> contains two articles to be cleaned <b>208</b> and cryogenic spray nozzles <b>207</b>. Slide mechanism <b>220</b> and drive motor <b>214</b> preferably are located on the bottom of the chamber of section <b>222</b> at a point below articles <b>208</b> in neighboring sections <b>226</b> while separated by partition walls <b>224</b> to help prevent particulates that might be generated by slide mechanism <b>220</b> or drive mote <b>214</b>, etc., and undesirably deposited on articles <b>208</b>. Preferably flexible all metal tube <b>216</b> is connected to the inlet of the nozzles from one end and from the other end to a fitting at the top wall of the chamber through which the cryogenic fluid in introduced via valve <b>218</b>. Flexible tube <b>216</b> allows nozzles <b>207</b> to sweep articles <b>208</b> while connected to the source of the cryogenic fluid. The nozzle system preferably contains control valves <b>240</b> that permit turning the flow on or off on either side of the apparatus in order to control whether to clean either one article at a time or both articles simultaneously. Partition walls <b>224</b> server to help reduce cross flow between the two sections <b>226</b> and section <b>222</b> and help to protect slide mechanism <b>220</b> and drive motor <b>214</b> from plasma gases that are introduced to articles <b>208</b> in neighboring sections <b>226</b> while at the same time helping to protect articles <b>208</b> in sections <b>226</b> from contamination that may be generated by slide mechanism <b>220</b> and/or drive motor <b>214</b> in section <b>222</b> (for clarity, implements for the plasma process are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> but are described elsewhere herein). In the event that particulates are generated in section <b>222</b> such as from slide mechanism <b>220</b> and/or motor drive <b>214</b>, a vacuum port preferably is provided at a lower portion of section <b>222</b> in order to transport the particulates outside the chamber. Cryogenic spray nozzles <b>207</b> preferably are attached to block <b>212</b> on slide mechanism <b>220</b> in such a way that, when the slider moves from position A to position B (where the length from position A to position B is the maximum diameter length of the article to be cleaned), cryogenic spray nozzles <b>207</b> will sweep that length.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In accordance with preferred embodiments, an vibrating, oscillating and/or pulsating cryogenic spray is provided to more desirably clean the articles/wafer. Exemplary preferred embodiments of pulsating flows will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a diagram illustrating a cryogenic pulsation system in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the present invention. The pulsating mechanism in accordance with this embodiment preferably consists of two attached parts: motor <b>250</b> and block <b>264</b>. Motor <b>250</b> preferably has a variable and controllable frequency of rotation. Motor shaft <b>256</b> has a radial through hole (or multiple radial through holes). Motor <b>250</b> preferably includes flange <b>252</b> with four (or other suitable number) screw holes <b>254</b> near the corners of flange <b>252</b>. Block <b>264</b> preferably has through hole <b>258</b> with fittings <b>266</b> at both ends of the through hole. Block <b>264</b> also preferably has another hole <b>260</b> perpendicular to through hole <b>258</b> and intersects through hole <b>258</b>. Hole <b>260</b> preferably is not a through hole and does not penetrate the other side of the block. Block <b>264</b> preferably has four threaded screw holes <b>268</b> near the corners to attach to flange <b>252</b> of motor <b>250</b>. Motor <b>250</b> preferably attaches to block <b>264</b> by a set of four screws through the screw holes <b>254</b> and <b>268</b>. When motor <b>250</b> is attached to block <b>264</b>, motor shaft <b>256</b> would be inserted into block hole <b>260</b> in such a way that shaft hole <b>262</b> is at the same axial distance from flange <b>252</b> as block through hole <b>258</b>. The source of the cryogenic fluid is connected to inlet fitting <b>266</b> to allow the fluid to flow in through hole <b>258</b>. The cryogenic fluid flows only when shaft hole <b>262</b> is aligned with block through hole <b>258</b>. Hence, rotating motor shaft <b>256</b> at a certain frequency causes the flow to turn on and off, or pulsate, based on the same frequency. This results in a desirable pulsating cryogenic flow. In certain cases, for example when the pulsating frequency required is higher than the maximum motor frequency, additional radial holes in shaft <b>256</b> can be implemented. Note that in general the addition of one hole in the shaft doubles the frequency of pulsation of the flow.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a diagram illustrating a cryogenic pulsation system in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The pulsating mechanism in accordance with this embodiment preferably consists of two attached parts: pulsation valve <b>272</b> and piezo assembly <b>292</b>. Piezo assembly <b>292</b> preferably consists of piezo element <b>290</b>, piezo housing <b>284</b> and load nut <b>282</b>. Piezo assembly <b>292</b> preferably is screwed to pulsation valve <b>272</b> using threads <b>288</b> of piezo housing <b>284</b>. Load nut <b>282</b> serves to fix piezo assembly <b>292</b> to pulsation valve <b>272</b> by tightening load nut <b>282</b> against the body of pulsation valve <b>272</b> and compressing gasket <b>280</b> to prevent leakage from the interface between pulsation valve <b>272</b> and piezo assembly <b>292</b>. A controlled voltage supplied by lead <b>286</b> excites piezo element <b>290</b>. Piezo element <b>290</b> expands and contracts longitudinally due to the exciting voltage provided by lead <b>286</b>. When piezo element <b>290</b> is in a position in which it contacts plunger <b>278</b> and load nut <b>282</b> is tightened, piezo element <b>290</b> becomes loaded. When piezo element <b>290</b> is loaded and is excited by a control voltage, its longitudinal motion (extraction and contraction) is transferred to plunger <b>278</b>. The motion transferred to plunger <b>278</b> represents controllable longitudinal frequency of motion. The longitudinal motion frequency transferred from plunger <b>278</b> to flow valve <b>276</b> drives flow valve <b>276</b> to open and close at the frequency generated originally by the longitudinal motion of piezo element <b>290</b>. A cryogenic fluid flowing from inlet flow port <b>270</b> will flow through port <b>274</b> of flow valve <b>276</b> and exit pulsation valve <b>272</b>, if flow valve <b>276</b> is open. The cryogenic fluid flowing from inlet flow port <b>270</b> will not flow through port <b>274</b> of flow valve <b>276</b> if flow valve <b>276</b> is closed. The cryogenic fluid flow coming in through port <b>270</b> into port <b>274</b> of flow valve <b>276</b> is then regulated by the frequency of opening and closing of flow valve <b>276</b>, which is regulated by the controlled longitudinal motion (frequency) of plunger <b>278</b> and before that by the controlled longitudinal motion (frequency) of piezo element <b>290</b>. The motion frequency of piezo element <b>290</b> preferably has a wide range, which can be regulated by an electronic frequency generator.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">What is important is that a piezo or similar controllable mechanical implement controllably opens and controls (or at least perturbs the flow) a flow valve that controls the cryogenic fluid flow in order to create a pulsation effect as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a preferably multi-stage filtering process, which desirably may be utilized with the foregoing cleaning apparatus/method, will now be described (this discussion follows from the First Referenced Applications discussed above). Certain preferred embodiments of the present invention implement a CO<sub>2 </sub>purification technique, which preferably utilizes a multi-stage, multi-filtering type/mode (multiple, distinct types of filtering processes).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Carbon dioxide typically is a by product of a process, and has been determined typically to be contaminated with contaminants such as hydrocarbons and other chemicals. Hydrocarbons typically are soluble in CO<sub>2</sub>, especially at more elevated temperatures. When using CO<sub>2 </sub>for example as a cleaning medium in a supersonic nozzle system, the temperature at the exit of the nozzle tends to be very low (e.g., about −110° F.). It has been discovered that, in such processes, hydrocarbons in the CO<sub>2 </sub>can be released and deposited on the surface being cleaned (e.g., silicon wafer), which can severely limit the utility of the (preferably) cleaning process.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is important to purify the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas before it can be used for cleaning the wafer or other article. According to investigations by the inventors herewith, the best grade CO<sub>2 </sub>available in the market tends to contain as much as about 5 PPB of hydrocarbons. In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, however, the level of contaminant such as hydrocarbons is reduced by orders of magnitude to about 0.01 PPT before it is utilized in a subsequent process, which may be, for example, a wafer cleaning process. Removing the hydrocarbon contaminant from CO<sub>2 </sub>has been determined to be a very challenging problem. In fact, it has been very difficult to accomplish this task because of the minute amounts of hydrocarbon needed to be removed, given that hydrocarbons tend to have excellent solubility in CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Preferred embodiments of the present invention preferably utilize a series of filtering/purification processes to remove hydrocarbon contaminants from the CO<sub>2</sub>. In accordance with such preferred embodiments, a filtering/purification process is provided that desirably utilizes one or more of: condensation of the hydrocarbon; particulate filtration; chemical filtration using activated filters; and catalytic oxidation. The schematic provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates outlines a desirable combination of distinct filtering/purification steps or implements in an exemplary preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">CO<sub>2 </sub>gas is provided by source <b>300</b>, which preferably provides the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas at about 300 to 900 psia pressure range, which preferably flows through condensing device <b>301</b>. Condensing device <b>301</b> preferably removes a majority of the contaminant, preferably hydrocarbon. Condensing device <b>301</b> preferably removes hydrocarbons by condensation and through surface tension phenomenon and gravity force.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The gas preferably will then be heated in heater <b>302</b> to prepare it for a subsequent, preferably catalytic, oxidation process. The preferably catalytic reduction/oxidation process is implemented in catalytic reactor <b>303</b>, which preferably is heated via heater <b>303</b>A to a temperature to provide more optimum conditions for catalytic reduction/oxidization of the hydrocarbons, assisted by catalyst <b>303</b>B. Catalyst <b>303</b>B may be of a type known in the art, that serves to facilitate and accelerate the reduction/oxidization of hydrocarbons. For example, catalyst <b>303</b>B may be Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) or other suitable catalytic material, which could be enhanced by the use of UV light (the use of UV light on such a catalyst is known in the art). Catalyst <b>303</b>B preferably is imbedded into, or integrated with, heater <b>303</b>A in order to maintain the preferably high temperature required for effective burning of residual hydrocarbon.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It should be noted that CO<sub>2 </sub>normally contains oxygen that is required for the catalytic oxidation process. If, however, the amount of oxygen in the CO<sub>2 </sub>is not sufficient to enable conditions for a stoichiometric reaction, oxygen optionally can be injected into the gas line via inlet <b>311</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. It should be further noted that, in certain embodiments, heater <b>302</b> is optional or integrated into heated catalytic reactor <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In accordance with preferred embodiments, and as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas preferably is then passed through chemical filter <b>304</b>, which preferably consists of a series of chemical filters <b>304</b>, which preferably contain what is known in the art as activated carbon for hydrocarbon adsorption. In accordance with preferred embodiments, it should be noted that carbon filter(s) <b>304</b> is/are utilized towards the final stage of the filtering/purification process because it adsorbs the hydrocarbon and needs to be replaced (e.g., when nearing or at saturation). As a result, in accordance with the present invention, employing it at or near the last stage will increase the lifetime and decrease the replacement frequency of filter(s) <b>304</b>, and thus desirably reduce the down time of the processing tool.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In accordance with preferred embodiments, and as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas preferably is then passed through particle filter <b>305</b> (or a series of particle filters <b>305</b>) to remove any particles that may be present in the CO<sub>2 </sub>or that were shed into the CO<sub>2 </sub>in the preceding carbon filtering process. As further illustrated, in certain preferred embodiments liquid CO<sub>2 </sub>is required for, for example, nozzle flow. In such embodiments, the gas is condensed through chiller <b>306</b>. In embodiments where gas is required in the nozzle or subsequent process, chiller <b>306</b> is omitted, and the gas preferably passes via outlet <b>310</b> through the particle filters to the nozzle system (or other system implement).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As will be appreciated from the exemplary preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, in accordance with preferred embodiments, the cryogenic cleaning medium consists of carbon dioxide that is filtered, preferably with a multi-stage, multi-mode/type filtering process. As commercial sources of carbon dioxide tend to include undesirable amounts of hydrocarbons (due, at least in part, to the solubility of many hydrocarbons in carbon dioxide), a preferably multi-stage filtering process that removes contaminants such as hydrocarbons is implemented. Additional details/options in accordance with such embodiments will now be described. In preferred embodiments, the filtering process utilizes one or more of the following. A coalescent-type, preferably condensing-type, filter <b>301</b> is provided that preferably removes the bulk of the contaminant (typically hydrocarbon). Filter <b>301</b> preferably consists of multiple stages, such two to four stages, with three stages used in certain preferred embodiments (three separate filters). A heated/catalytic reactor <b>303</b> preferably removes contaminants such as hydrocarbons. High temperature pre-heater <b>302</b> preferably is utilized in certain embodiments to heat the CO<sub>2 </sub>to accelerate the catalytic reaction. The temperature range preferably is about 250° C.-1000° C., with the preferred set point temperature about 500° C. Heated catalyst <b>303</b>B (preferably multi-stage) is provided, with heater <b>303</b>A used to maintain a constant temperature for the catalytic process (preferred temperature ranges may be as stated previously). A multistage catalytic process preferably is utilized that removes contaminants such as hydrocarbons based on multi-heater/catalyst stages. A multi-stage catalytic process preferably is utilized in order to, for example, ensure a near complete reduction/oxidation of hydrocarbons, with the multistage process helping ensure that the majority of CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules will come in contact with one or more catalytic surface. Activated (which may also include non-activated) carbon filters <b>304</b> (preferably replaceable) preferably are utilized to extract residual contaminants such as hydrocarbons in the CO<sub>2 </sub>after the catalytic oxidation. In preferred embodiments, filter(s) is/are implemented downstream of the catalytic process, where the amount of hydrocarbon in the CO<sub>2 </sub>is greatly reduced; as a result, filter replacement will be less frequent. Particle filter <b>305</b>, preferably a multistage filtration system, consists of one or more preferably ceramic core particulate filters to remove larger particles (e.g., 0.1 micron and larger), which preferably is followed by a preferably all metal electronic grade filter to remove finer particles (e.g., 0.005-0.1 microns). Chiller <b>306</b> preferably is provided to control the quality and the conditions of the CO<sub>2 </sub>entering the nozzle (for a nozzle-based cleaning process, etc.). The core of chiller <b>306</b> preferably is electro-polished stainless steel to prevent contamination of the CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
