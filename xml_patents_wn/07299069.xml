<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides a method and an apparatus for adapting a communications network of a plurality of wireless access nodes, such as base stations to a changing environment. The method comprises determining a current location of at least a first user in the communications network, identifying a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of a first base station of the plurality of base stations based on the current location of the first user, and implementing a first response in the communications network in response to the need for change for the first base station. In this way, a self-deploying wireless access network may autonomously reposition base stations in a changing environment of user distributions across a coverage area and/or user demand by users of wireless communication devices, such as mobile units. Using indirect communication between the base stations capable of operating with different standards or protocols, a distributed algorithm may adapt the network to the changing environment. Such adaptation of the network in a distributed manner may control overall network costs of providing wireless services to mobile users.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to telecommunications, and more particularly, to wireless communications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless access networks are generally deployed by network operators or service providers to provide a variety of media services including data and voice wireless services to users of wireless communication devices. Examples of wireless communication devices include mobile units or terminals that use a wireless access network. Examples of wireless access networks include a global system for mobile communications system (GSM), a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular communications system, a wide local area network (WLAN), and the like, which provide transport for data, voice, video or other services.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To provide media services to wireless or mobile users, a communications system typically comprises one or more wireless access nodes, such as base stations (sometimes referred to as node-Bs). A user of a mobile unit may exchange voice and/or data information with a wireless access node, e.g., a base station over an air interface. To transmit the voice and/or data information, the base station or mobile unit encodes the information according to one or more wireless telecommunication protocols such as a UMTS, GSM, CDMA protocol, and the like. The encoded information is then modulated as an electromagnetic wave to generate a radio frequency (RF) signal that is transmitted across the air interface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As desire for new feature-rich wireless services and traffic demands goes up, complexity in the management, deployment, and configuration of wireless access networks often increases. With changes in services and traffic, adaptation of a network becomes inevitable to a constantly changing environment. However, due to centralization of control, hierarchical nature of architecture and isolation from other systems, most wireless access networks may be too inflexible as far as adapting to new wireless services and traffic demands goes. As the communication systems become richer in features and capability, the isolation between systems will have to decrease since the need for rapidly deployable communications systems in areas of high-traffic density will increase.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, one issue that service providers or network operators of many communications systems may inevitably face is the increase in cost for deployment and operation of wireless access networks. For example, to increase the capacity of wireless access networks, a trend to smaller cell sizes (with a commensurate increase in the total number of cells) is clearly emerging. In combination with the additional requirement of interoperability of heterogeneous systems, the deployment and configuration of wireless access networks represents an increasing cost factor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To control these costs, a deployment process based on self-configuration of wireless access nodes is used to adapt a network to its changing environment involving changes in number, position and configuration of its wireless access nodes, user demand and location of users. Such a self-deploying network may optimize the use of the wireless access nodes. In contrast to traditional ad-hoc networks, where the configuration is optimised for the current locations of the nodes, a self-deploying network has the freedom to choose the locations of its nodes autonomously. Therefore, a self-deploying network with mobile base stations is able to adapt to changes in user distributions across the coverage area and user demand, resulting in an improved performance compared to conventional networks</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For cellular networks, a planning process is usually performed in a quasi-manual manner, using a mixture of centralised planning tools, expensive drive testing and economic rules-of-thumb. For other wireless networks, such as wireless local area networks (WLAN), no planning is performed at all, resulting in low performance and efficiency. Likewise, statically deployed networks with centralised control are unable to recover reliably from failing nodes. In this way, some significant drawbacks of network adaptation solutions are expense, time consumption and complicated cellular planning process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Use of a host of techniques, such as simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, integer linear programming, and greedy algorithms has been proposed to position wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations for network planning. Other approaches have explored the trade-offs between coverage, cell count and capacity. It has been shown that, the identification of the globally optimum base station locations in a network of multiple base stations is a NP-hard problem, far too complex to solve computationally. Further difficulties are that most of the system parameters required to find an optimal solution are unknown, and the optimal positions change constantly due to the changes in user demand, user positions, and base station positions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More specifically, the manual adaptation of the base station positions based on the optimal positions identified by the network relies on manual decision making and optimization. Such manual decision making and optimization may become exorbitantly expensive, essentially dominating the total network costs, particularly as the capital expenses continue to reduce over time through improvements in hardware and software. Even worse, a large-scale increase in the sheer complexity of a wireless access network deployment and configuration process may exceed the capabilities of manual planning and configuration entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing, the effects of, one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an exhaustive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for adapting a communications network of a plurality of base stations to a changing environment. The method comprises determining the current locations of a plurality of users in the communications network connected to a first base station, identifying a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the first base station of the plurality of base stations based on the current locations of the connected users, and implementing a first response in the communications network in response to the need for change for the first base station.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, a wireless access node associated with a communications network comprises a controller capable of adapting the communications network to a changing environment and a storage coupled to the controller. The storage stores instructions to determine a current location of a plurality of users in the communications network, identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the wireless access node based on the current location of the users, and implement a first response in the communications network in response to the need for change for the wireless access node.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions may be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but may nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, a communications system and a method is provided for adapting a network of a plurality of wireless access nodes to a changing environment. For example, a wireless access network, i.e., self-deploying network uses self-configuration of one or more wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations to control overall network costs of providing a service to a user of a wireless communication device, such as a mobile unit. Specifically, one or more wireless access nodes may modify positions thereof without a human interaction to enable a wireless access network to adapt autonomously to changes in user locations and/or user demand. For wireless access node or base-station positioning in a wireless access network, an algorithm provides autonomous self-deployment and self-configuration, based on a changing environment of user locations and user demand (current values or statistics), in a distributed manner. A distributed algorithm provides distributed processing resulting in a self-organising manner to achieve a desired level of robustness and scalability. Indirect communication between the wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations performing self-deployment, enables a technology independent adaptation of the wireless access network. Accordingly, the wireless access network may comprise base stations capable of operating with different standards or protocols, such as UMTS or 802.11, complementing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a communications system <b>100</b> is illustrated to include a plurality of wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations (BS) <b>105</b> (<b>1</b>-N) according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. For example, a first wireless access node or a first base station <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) may have at least one neighboring, e.g., a second wireless access node or a second base station <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>). The first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) may store a distributed algorithm <b>110</b> to adapt a wireless access communication network <b>115</b> to a changing environment for at least a first user associated with a first wireless communication device, e.g., a first mobile unit <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>). The first wireless communication device or first mobile unit <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>) may be capable of communicating with the plurality of wireless access nodes or the BSs <b>105</b> (<b>1</b>-N).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One example of the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> is a self-deploying radio access network. Such a self-deploying radio access network may learn from a current performance, i.e., in terms of coverage and capacity and in terms of the network profitability. Accordingly, the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may determine desired changes in positions, additions, and removals of one or more wireless access nodes or the BSs <b>105</b> (<b>1</b>-N) based on user demands, user locations and/or distribution of users in an environment that may change over time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Consistent with one embodiment, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may adapt the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> to the changing environment based on position data <b>122</b>(<b>1</b>) and location data <b>122</b>(<b>2</b>) and/or statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>) associated with the changing environment. By optimizing the first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) based on position data <b>122</b>(<b>1</b>) and location data <b>122</b>(<b>2</b>) and/or statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>) associated with the changing environment, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may adapt the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> to the changing environment. That is, in one embodiment, each wireless access node or the BS <b>105</b> may use a corresponding distributed algorithm <b>110</b> to adapt the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> by all the wireless access nodes or the BSs <b>105</b> (<b>1</b>-N) in a distributed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, a changing environment behavior of the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may be collected as the position data <b>122</b>(<b>1</b>) associated with positioning and re-positioning of the wireless access nodes or the BSs <b>105</b> (<b>1</b>-N) and the location data <b>122</b>(<b>2</b>) associated with current locations of users of the plurality wireless communication device, e.g., mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>). Additionally, the statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>) may be collected as one or more user statistics at each wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> during operation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the position data <b>122</b>(<b>1</b>) may comprise coordinates data for a particular position of at least a first wireless access node or the BS <b>105</b> (<b>1</b>) within a coverage area of the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>. Likewise, the location data <b>122</b>(<b>2</b>) may comprise current location data of the first user associated with the first wireless communication device or the first mobile unit <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>). The statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>) may comprise, for example, demand for use from users for the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> over a period of time, such as requests for particular data rates.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may comprise a conventional radio access network <b>126</b>, e.g., a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) and a conventional core network (CN) <b>128</b>. The wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may further comprise a first and a second radio network controller (RNC) <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>130</b>(<i>k</i>) to manage communications with the plurality of wireless communication devices or the mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the first and second RNCs <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>130</b>(<i>k</i>) may be associated with one or more wireless access nodes or the BSs <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N), such as Node-Bs within the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>. Specifically, the first RNC <b>130</b> (<b>1</b>) may be coupled to a first plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations, i.e., Node-Bs including the first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) and a second wireless access node or a second BS <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>). Likewise, the second RNC <b>130</b>(<i>k</i>) may be coupled to a second plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations, i.e., Node-Bs <b>105</b>(<b>3</b>-N).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) may comprise a controller <b>135</b> capable of adapting the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> to the changing environment, in one embodiment. The first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) may further comprise a storage <b>140</b> coupled to the controller <b>135</b>. The storage <b>140</b> may store instructions, i.e., the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> to determine a current location of a plurality of users in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>. The distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) based on the current location of the users. In response to the need for change for first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>), the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may implement a first response in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Using the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> at each wireless access node or the BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N), the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may autonomously identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with at least one of a number, position and configuration of a wireless access node or base station <b>105</b>, based on user demand and user locations, adapting the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> to the changing environment. By using the distributed algorithm <b>110</b>, the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may obtain a near-optimum solution for self-deployment and self-configuration, based only on limited locally available system knowledge. While the self-deployment may refer to adapting to changes in a wireless or mobile communication environment involving the users of the plurality wireless communication device or mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) and the wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) within the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> over a relatively long term, such as weeks to years, the self-configuration may refer to the adaptation for a relatively short-term activity over tens of minutes to days, as examples.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, a short term self-deployment is possible, for example, in a military environment, where the wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) may be mobile (e.g., flying drones, or autonomous vehicles). For this case, the current mobile unit <b>120</b> locations may be taken into account instead of collected statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>) by the distributed algorithms <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Instead of optimizing the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions according to cell coverage or cell capacity, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may optimize the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions based on the changing environment, such as the current, and constantly changing, wireless communication device or mobile unit connections <b>145</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>), user demand, and user locations and/or wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions. In the communications system <b>100</b>, the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions may be visible and/or dependent on wireless communication device or mobile unit <b>120</b> locations. When the current mobile unit <b>120</b> locations and/or requests of data rates from users change, one or more of the wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) may move to a new position. In this manner, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may optimize the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions without utilizing knowledge of noise and interference.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">One example of the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> includes a digital cellular network, such as defined at least in part by the UMTS, GSM, WCDMA or CDMA standards. More specifically, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications may define interactions between the plurality of wireless communication devices, e.g., mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) and the first and second plurality of the wireless access nodes or base stations, i.e., Node-Bs <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) within the communications system <b>100</b>, such as a based on a CDMA technique. The wireless communication device or the mobile unit <b>120</b> may refer to a host of wireless communication devices including, but not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and global positioning systems (GPS) that employ the communications system <b>100</b> to operate in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>, such as a third or fourth generation digital cellular CDMA or WCDMA network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may be used with the changing environment based on user distribution and demand maps. For example, a network operator may obtain the user distribution and demand maps from a service broker agent. In another embodiment, such optimization may be used to determine an optimum radiation pattern for each wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> instead of, or complementary with the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positioning. Since a radiation pattern of a wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> influences a desired transmit power in a manner similar to the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> position, the radiation pattern may be optimized. In this case, for each wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> a globally or locally optimal or near optimal radiation pattern may be identified in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, self-deployment of the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is schematically depicted based on self-organization using indirect communication between the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) and local optimization of each wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the instant invention. An example of a self-organisation process, resulting from such indirect communication between wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b> and local optimization of each wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> location is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The first and second wireless access nodes or base stations BS<b>1</b>, BS<b>2</b> are shown as solid squares <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>) and the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b> are shown as ellipses with a line to the connected wireless access node or base station <b>105</b>. The optimal base station positions are shown as dotted squares <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>1</b>) and <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">By using the indirect communication, each wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b> may modify its surrounding environment as a first response to the need for change determined by the distributed algorithm <b>110</b>, and these changes then influence the behaviour of neighbouring wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b> as a second response. In the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>, for example, interactions known as stigmergy may be used to coordinate activities of the wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) by means of self-organization.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a wireless communication, the environment in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may relate to the link connections <b>145</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) to the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>). When one or more of the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) connect to a particular wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> with a strongest received pilot power, the link connections <b>145</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) may provide information on the coverage of neighbouring cells associated with neighbouring wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To adapt to a change in the network environment, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may perform local optimization of the wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions. Other optimization possibilities include, for example, modifications of the pilot powers to achieve load balancing (e.g., either equal transmit power, or equal capacity) in each cell. The indirect communication through modification of the network environment may allow interoperability of heterogeneous systems (i.e., systems with different access technologies) since the first wireless access node or base station <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) may not directly exchange data with the second wireless access node or base station <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>) in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a start condition, as step <b>1</b>, the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b> are connected to either the first wireless access node or base station <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) or the second wireless access node or base station <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>) based on a connection rule (e.g., strongest received pilot power). This scenario defines the current network environment in one embodiment. In each step, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> calculates the optimal positions for wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b> based on the current network environment. At step <b>2</b>, the first and second wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>) may move to the predicted optimum positions, as shown by the dotted squares <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>1</b>) and <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>2</b>). The new base station positions <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>1</b>) and <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>2</b>) may trigger a change in the link connection <b>145</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>) to the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>). This modification of the network environment provides an indirect way of communication between the wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>, e.g., providing information on coverage, positions, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, re-positioning of the first and second wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is schematically depicted consistent with one embodiment of the present invention. That is, a further example showing the self-deployment process triggered by load balancing via modification of the pilot powers is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A set of contour plots <b>310</b>(<b>1</b>) illustrate the received pilot power.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Besides the optimization of the resource efficiency, the optimal positions <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>1</b>) and <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>2</b>) of the first and second wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>), respectfully, may depend on a variety of factors or constrains, such as suitable locations, costs, or legislations may play a role for the positioning. For example, the optimal positions <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>1</b>) and <b>105</b><i>a</i>(<b>2</b>) may depend upon use of resources (i.e. transmit power and available frequency spectrum), within constrains such as maximum transmit power levels of single base stations or possible locations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Accordingly, consistent with one embodiment, rules for optimal positioning of individual wireless access nodes or base stations, and wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b> in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may be stated as follows: (1). a local optimization of individual wireless access nodes or base stations may provide an optimal position for an individual wireless access node or base station that enables sustaining all requested connections with a given minimum possible transmit power criteria and (2). a global optimization of wireless access nodes or base stations <b>115</b> in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may provide the optimal positions of all the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> in a network, enabling the network to sustain all requested connections with a given minimum possible transmit power criteria. In addition, both rules may be subject to desired constraints. Of course, a locally optimum position of a single base station of Rule 1 may not necessarily be equivalent to a position of the same base station in a globally optimized network based on Rule 2.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a stylized representation of a flow chart implementing a method for adapting the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, of the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to a changing environment consistent with one embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) based on the current location of the users, as indicated in block <b>405</b>. A decision block <b>410</b> may ascertain whether a need for change in the current position of the first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) exists. If so, at block <b>415</b>, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may implement a first response in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> by moving or re-positioning the first wireless access node or the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) to a new position, such as an optimal position. In this way, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may adapt the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> to a changing environment, as shown in block <b>420</b>, according to some embodiments of the instant invention.</p>

In this manner, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b>, at block <b>525</b>, may cause a move in direction of a calculated optimal position and/or updated base station radiation pattern for the first and second BSs <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">To satisfy a given minimum possible transmit power criterion for an arbitrary small bit-error rate, a capacity limit may be targeted as optimisation for the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>, in some embodiments. For simplicity of capacity equations, the interference from other base stations <b>105</b> or mobile units <b>120</b> may be modelled as a white Gaussian random variable with zero mean. In addition, only the slow fading components of the channel may be taken into account for the base station <b>105</b> positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A minimum power requirement for a link with given capacity may be obtained in a manner set forth below, for example. The channel capacity C for a channel perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise is a function of the average received signal power S=E{s(t)s(t)*}, the average noise power N=E{n(t)n(t)*} and the bandwidth B, where s(t) and n(t) denote the signal and noise values at the time instant t. The well known capacity relationship (Shannon-Hartley theorem) may be expressed as</p>

Therefore, an exhaustive search for jointly optimal positions for more than a few base stations in a limited area is impractical due to prohibitive computational complexity (i.e. NP-hard problem). In addition, centralised processing is necessary and complete system knowledge is required. However, in reality most of the desired parameters (e.g. channels and interference at new positions) are unknown. Therefore, even if the computational complexity were manageable, it would still be difficult to compute the globally optimum positions due to incomplete of system knowledge.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Again, the optimisation may be obtained for a given user and demand distribution instead of for specific connections by using the expected value of the transmit power, required at each potential user location. In contrast to the global optimisation, the local optimisation may be obtained in a de-centralised manner, based only on local system knowledge. However, as before, not all of the required system knowledge is available.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For positioning with limited system knowledge, the globally and/or locally optimal positioning of networks is a challenging task due to limited knowledge of the constantly changing system parameters and the prohibitive computational complexity. The locally optimum solution is of manageable computational complexity, but suffers from incomplete system knowledge. As a consequence, a solution based on partial system knowledge may provide results close to an optimum solution.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this way, by taking any knowledge available into account and ignoring (or replacing by an expected value) all unknown contributions, a near-optimal solution may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>-N) are self-deploying, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may improve the deployment convergence speed by using the knowledge that for certain changes in a position of a wireless access node or base station, other wireless access nodes or base stations will react to those changes and take over users connected at an old position. Such self-deploying may result in a further movement of a desired wireless access node or base station in a next deployment step. This further movement may be taken into account in the current deployment step by moving further in the same direction, than the current optimum position indicates. Given that p={x, y} is a vector comprising the coordinates of the current position, and p<sub>opt</sub>, the vector of the calculated optimum position, the new position p<sub>new </sub>for improved convergence may be calculated as

However, for α=1 if the network environment does not change due to the re-positioning, at least some oscillating new positions P<sub>new </sub>may result. For α&gt;1, at least some of the BS positions may become unstable.

The first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) may be self-deployed at the calculated optimal position. By self-deploying the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>), in response to a change in an old position of the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>), the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may cause the second BS <b>105</b>(<b>2</b>) to take over one or more users connected to the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) at the old position, significantly increasing a rate of the deployment convergence.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An efficient deployment in channels dominated by shadow fading may be provided, in one embodiment. In a scenario where a path loss dominates the total channel loss, optimising a base station <b>105</b> position for the currently connected mobile units <b>120</b> may result in efficient self-deployment characteristics, since connection changes happen only at the edges of a cell. For scenarios where shadow fading dominates the channel loss for a single base station, the connections to the mobile units <b>120</b> may change dramatically when the base station <b>105</b> position changes. Therefore, optimizing the position for the currently connected mobiles may not be efficient in channels dominated by shadow fading.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, by taking into account only one or more most probable connections to a base station of interest, at the current position, for unknown new shadow fading values, an optimization with respect to the mobile units <b>120</b>, which are most likely to have a good connection to the base station <b>105</b> at its current position may be provided for different channel realisations. These mobile units <b>120</b> may form a new network environment for each base station <b>105</b>, on which the self-deploying distributed algorithms <b>110</b> base associated positioning calculation. The mobile units <b>120</b> with the highest connection probability may be determined by a cell selection method (e.g., a mobile unit <b>120</b> connects to a base station with the strongest calculated received pilot power), while ignoring the shadow fading contribution in the calculation. In addition, any a priori information on the likelihood of channel changes may be taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">However, each base station <b>105</b> of interest may not necessarily be aware of all the mobile units <b>120</b> with the highest connection probability, due to current poor channel conditions to some of these mobile units <b>120</b>. Therefore, additional communication between the base stations <b>105</b> may result in exchange of position data of neighbouring mobile units <b>120</b> and base stations <b>105</b>.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, the connection data may be exchanged between the base stations <b>105</b> for the exchange of information of the mobile unit <b>120</b> locations in vicinity of each base station <b>105</b> of interest and their possible base station connections. Example of different methods of communication that may be used for such purposes include (a) a direct communication of neighbouring base stations <b>105</b> via a backhaul connection; (b) base stations <b>105</b> may update a centralised database containing all base station <b>105</b> positions and mobile unit <b>120</b> locations, which is accessible to all base stations <b>105</b> via the backhaul connection; (c) a direct communication of neighbouring base stations <b>105</b> via a radio link; and a relayed transmission of connection data via the mobile units <b>120</b>, which may be seen by multiple base stations <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one embodiment of an exemplary selection of wireless communication devices or mobile units is schematically depicted for optimization of a wireless access node or a base station position, such as the first BS <b>105</b>(<b>1</b>) position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. An example of one step of the self-deployment process based on a new network environment (e.g., highest connection probability of the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>-<i>m</i>)) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Again the current positions of the first and second BSs, BS<b>1</b> and BS<b>2</b> are shown as solid squares and the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b> are shown as ellipses with a line to a connected base station for a link connection <b>700</b> based on received pilot power. The wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b> with the highest connection probability for different channel conditions are indicated via dashed lines to the corresponding base station, as probable link connection <b>705</b> based on optimization of BS position. For instance, the new or optimal base station positions of the first and second BSs, BS<b>1</b> and BS<b>2</b> are shown as dotted squares. The new or optimal base station positions may trigger a change in both, the link connection to the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b>, and the network environment (e.g., most probable link connections <b>705</b> for different shadow fading values). In one embodiment, the BS positioning is independent of the current link connections <b>145</b> to the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a chart schematically depicts one embodiment the link connections <b>700</b> for the wireless communication devices or mobile units <b>120</b> to the wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b> for the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Likewise, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a chart schematically depicts one embodiment of channel attenuations for constant wireless access node or base station <b>105</b> positions in the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a chart schematically depicts performance comparison for convergence based on the self-deployment using the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Without load balancing, use of the distribution algorithm <b>110</b> is compared with both, a reference network with fixed base station positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, and a self-deploying network set forth above. The chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that the distribution algorithm <b>110</b> (with α=0.95) may result in a significant reduction in deployment time, and relatively better overall network performance.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> schematically depicts a chart showing performance comparison for self-deployment in channels with dominating shadow fading using the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in accordance with one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows that the reference network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> with constant base station positions performs well for uniform user distributions. The optimization based on the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> performs well for uniform user distributions after the deployment stage and significantly outperforms both, a simpler optimization method and the reference network with fixed base station positions, for non-uniform user distributions and for a case of failing base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows that self-deployment based on the current connections may outperform the reference network only for non-uniform user distributions. The optimization based on the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> performs well for uniform user distributions after the deployment stage and significantly outperforms the other methods, for non-uniform user distributions and for the case of failing base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For autonomous self-deployment, and self-configuration of base station <b>105</b> position and/or radiation patterns, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> based on the channel capacity may take the current values of the environment (channels), user locations and the user demand (current values or statistics) into account. Using incomplete local system knowledge of the communications system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may derive a near-optimal global solution to provide the base station <b>105</b> positioning and configuration. Moreover, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may improve upon a convergence time of self-deploying networks. To significantly improve the self-deployment performance in environments where shadow fading is dominating the channel loss, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may select local system information for the optimization of base station <b>105</b> positions.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In other embodiments, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may reduces costs of deployment since the wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may provide information on optimized positions and/or radiation patterns for each base station <b>105</b> based on associated measurements, obviating drive testing. With mobile base stations <b>105</b>, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may enable network optimization based on current values of user demand and user locations. The wireless access communication network <b>115</b> may adapt efficiently to changes in user demand and user locations, resulting in an improved performance of the self-deploying and self-configuring network for changing user demand and user distributions.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may enable a long-term optimization of deployed networks based on measured statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>). The resulting information may be used to identify the need for a new base station <b>105</b> and modification of the current positions or radiation patterns. Due to the distributed processing, the distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may provide a scalable and robust wireless access communication network <b>115</b> against failing wireless access nodes or base stations <b>105</b>. The distributed algorithm <b>110</b> may operate efficiently with limited local system knowledge using a long-term and short-term optimization of deployed networks based on measured statistics <b>122</b>(<b>3</b>). In this manner, use of indirect communication (stigmergy) may provide a universal language and enable communication and interoperability of heterogeneous systems, obviating a need to know different standards to communicate within the wireless access communication network <b>115</b>.</p>
