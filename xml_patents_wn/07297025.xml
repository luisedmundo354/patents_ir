<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrical connector, and particularly to a thin electrical connector adapted to LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signal) displaying interface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A thin receptacle connector has been widely used in the filed of panel products in recent years; such thin receptacle connector generally is referred to LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signal) connector as well and is made in miniaturized structure. The LVDS connector is soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) and mates with a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) for electrically communication. Because of the miniaturized structure and concerning about a linking strength between each part of the connector, a configuration of the LVDS connector would have been restricted, especially the configuration of a metal shell, terminals, and grounding parts. Generally, the metal shell covers an insulative body of the connector for increasing the strength of the insulative body, and the grounding parts can further connect to the metal shell for ridding influences of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and static interference. Such connector with improved structure for preventing EMI and static interference is disclosed, for instance, in TW utility model application No. 092123863 as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The connector includes a grounding part <b>11</b>, an insulative housing <b>12</b> and a casing <b>13</b>, wherein the insulative part <b>11</b> has a contact portion <b>111</b> extending from a side thereof. In assembly, the contact portion <b>111</b> is inserted into a gape <b>121</b> of the insulative body <b>12</b> in an opposite direction of the casing <b>13</b>, and therefore the contact portion <b>111</b> upwardly contact against an inner side of a sidewall <b>131</b> of the casing <b>13</b>, whereby an electrical communication is formed between the casing <b>13</b> and the grounding part <b>11</b>. The connector is grounded by connecting a grounding terminal <b>112</b> attached to the grounding part <b>11</b> and the PCB (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, considerable problems often are encountered because the contact portion <b>111</b> is a cantilever structure, which often causes the contact portion <b>111</b> improperly contacting the sidewall <b>131</b> of the casing <b>13</b> because of a resilient angle. That is, if the resilient angle of the contact portion <b>111</b> is too small, the contact portion <b>111</b> may fails to contact the sidewall <b>131</b>, whereas if the resilient angle is too big, the contact portion <b>111</b> may be against lateral sides of the casing <b>13</b> and may cause damage to the grounding part <b>11</b>. Moreover, the grounding part <b>11</b> further has a clipping board <b>123</b> for engaging with the insulative body <b>12</b>. Obviously, the conventional electrical connector has too many components, which is not advantageous to assembly and fabrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector which can be assembled easily and firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector which has structure to remove EMI and static interference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector which has simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above-mentioned objects, an electrical connector in accordance with the present invention include an insulative housing, a plurality of terminals, a holding member and a shielding covering having a latch element, wherein the holding member including a plurality of resilient plates, a coupling portion for coupling the resilient plates, and a pair of extending portions. In assembly, the holding member is inserted into the insulative housing in a direction of the rear face of the insulative housing and therefore the extending portion adheres to the rear face, then the shielding covers the insulative housing in a direction of the front face of the insulatiave housing and therefore the latch element is inserted through the slot and interferentially contacting the extending portion of the holding member.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the first embodiment of an electrical connector <b>200</b> of the present invention includes an insulative housing <b>20</b>, a plurality of terminals <b>30</b>, a holding member <b>40</b> and a shielding <b>50</b>. The insulative housing of rectangle-shaped has a front face <b>21</b> for connecting with a mating connector (not shown), and a rear face <b>22</b> having a plurality of terminal passageways <b>23</b> for receiving the plurality of terminals <b>30</b>. The rear face <b>22</b> further has a pair of slots <b>24</b> disposed at opposite ends thereof, the slots <b>24</b> extending inwardly from the rear face <b>22</b> and through the front face <b>21</b>. Each terminal <b>30</b> has a contact part <b>31</b> and a soldering part <b>32</b>, wherein the contact part <b>31</b> extends forward toward the front face <b>21</b>, and the soldering part <b>32</b> extends out of the insulative housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The holding member <b>40</b> includes a plurality of resilient plates <b>41</b>, a coupling portion <b>42</b> for coupling the resilient plates <b>41</b>, and a pair of extending portions <b>411</b> extending outwardly from opposite ends of the coupling portion <b>42</b>, each extending portion <b>411</b> having a hole <b>412</b>. The resilient plates <b>41</b> are respectively inserted into the terminal passageways <b>23</b> of the insulative housing <b>20</b>, and therefore the coupling portion <b>42</b> and the extending portions <b>411</b> completely adhere to the rear face <b>22</b> of the insulative housing <b>20</b>, and the holes <b>412</b> are in alignment with the slots <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shielding <b>50</b> of rectangle-shaped covers the insulative housing <b>20</b> in a direction of the front face <b>21</b> of the insulatiave housing <b>20</b>. The shielding <b>50</b> has a plurality of latch portions <b>51</b> located at opposite ends thereof, wherein a latch element <b>52</b> is formed on each latch portion <b>51</b> and extends toward the latch portions <b>51</b> for being inserted through the slots <b>24</b> and the holes <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an enlarged cross-sectional view showing an assembled connection between the latch element <b>52</b> and the holding member <b>40</b>, the latch element <b>52</b> is inserted through the slots <b>24</b> and the holes <b>412</b> and interferentially engaging with the holding member <b>40</b>. Moreover, a protrusion <b>413</b> is disposed on a lateral side of each hole <b>412</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and protrudes inside the hole <b>412</b> to form arcuated shape at opposite ends of the hole <b>412</b> for facilitating insertion of the latch element <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In comparison with conventional connector, the electrical connector <b>20</b> as described above has more simple structure and fewer components because the electrical connector <b>20</b> of the present invention does not have the grounding terminal <b>112</b> and the gape <b>121</b>, and the electrical connector <b>20</b> with improved structure can be assembled easily and firmly through an engagement between the latch element <b>52</b> and the extending portion <b>411</b>. Furthermore, the engagement can be enhanced, for example, by adding a hump <b>521</b> to the latch element <b>52</b> on one side thereof opposite to the protrusion <b>413</b> of the hole <b>412</b>. When the latch element <b>52</b> is inserted in the hole <b>412</b>, the hump <b>521</b> engages with the protrusion <b>413</b>. Another example is to form the latch element <b>52</b> to be of fork-shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>; when the fork-shaped latch element <b>52</b> is inserted in the hole <b>412</b>, bend the fork-shaped part of the latch element <b>52</b> to engage with the hole <b>412</b>; or still another example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the latch element <b>52</b> is inserted in the hole <b>412</b>, simply bend inwardly exposed parts of the latch element <b>52</b> to engage with the hole <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, an electrical connector <b>600</b> in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention includes an insulative housing <b>60</b>, a plurality of terminals <b>70</b>, a holding member <b>80</b> and a shielding <b>90</b>.
