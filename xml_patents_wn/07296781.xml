<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electromagnetic fuel injection valve, and particularly to an electromagnetic fuel injection valve in which a magnetic cylindrical body which constitutes a part of a valve housing having a valve seat at a front end portion is connected to a front portion of a cylindrical fixed core via a coaxial non-magnetic cylindrical body; a solenoid housing comprises a cylindrical magnetic metal coil case integrally having, at one end side, a ring-shaped end wall portion and a press-fit cylindrical portion integrally connected to an inner periphery of the end wall portion so that the magnetic cylindrical body is press-fitted to the press-fit cylindrical portion and the press-fit cylindrical portion is welded to the magnetic cylindrical body, and a flange portion which protrudes radially outward from a rear end of the fixed core and is magnetically connected to the other end of the coil case; a coil assembly which surrounds a rear portion of the magnetic cylindrical body, the non-magnetic cylindrical body and the fixed core is housed in the solenoid housing; and at least the solenoid housing is covered with a resin molded part made of a synthetic resin and integrally having a power receiving coupler which faces a power-receiving-side connecting terminal connected to a coil of the coil assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such an electromagnetic fuel injection valve is already known from, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2004-76700 in which a coil case <b>31</b> made of magnetic metal is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Specifically, in forming a coil case <b>31</b>′ integrally having, at one end side, a ring-shaped end wall portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ connected to an inner periphery of the end wall portion <b>31</b><i>a</i>, a magnetic-metal bottomed cylindrical material <b>65</b> having a dish-shaped projecting portion <b>65</b><i>a </i>at a central portion of a closed end and is formed of is prepared, and punching is performed by a punch <b>66</b> and a die <b>67</b> to punch out the central portion of the closed end in the material <b>65</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), thereby obtaining the coil case <b>31</b>′ as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ has a function of exchanging magnetic flux with the magnetic cylindrical body by press-fitting therein the magnetic cylindrical body and being welded to an outer periphery of the magnetic cylindrical body, and needs to secure a predetermined length or more for close contact with the outer periphery of the magnetic cylindrical body. When the coil case <b>31</b>′ is formed by the above described punching, a portion incapable of coming into close contact with the outer surface of the magnetic cylindrical body is generated in a tip end side of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ over a comparatively long distance L<b>1</b> due to formation of a shear drop and a fracture surface. In order to secure a contact portion with the outer periphery of the magnetic cylinder over a predetermined length or more, a total length (L<b>1</b>+L<b>2</b>) of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ becomes large. When the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ becomes long in this way, the resin molded part covering the solenoid housing also becomes long, so that the projecting amount of the valve housing from the resin molded part becomes short. As a result, when the fuel injection valve is mounted to a passage forming member which forms an intake passage, the exposed length of the valve housing to the intake passage side becomes short, unless the electromagnetic fuel injection valve is increased in size, and therefore injected fuel may easily attach to an inner surface of the intake passage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been achieved in view of the above circumstances, and has an object to provide an electromagnetic fuel injection valve capable of lengthening a projecting amount of a valve housing from a resin molded part while avoiding increase in size.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided an electromagnetic fuel injection valve in which a magnetic cylindrical body which constitutes a part of a valve housing having a valve seat at a front end portion is connected to a front portion of a cylindrical fixed core via a coaxial non-magnetic cylindrical body; a solenoid housing comprises a cylindrical magnetic metal coil case integrally having, at one end side, a ring-shaped end wall portion and a press-fit cylindrical portion integrally connected to an inner periphery of the end wall portion so that the magnetic cylindrical body is press-fitted to the press-fit cylindrical portion and the press-fit cylindrical portion is welded to the magnetic cylindrical body, and a flange portion which protrudes radially outward from a rear end of the fixed core and is magnetically connected to the other end of the coil case; a coil assembly which surrounds a rear portion of the magnetic cylindrical body, the non-magnetic cylindrical body and the fixed core is housed in the solenoid housing; and at least the solenoid housing is covered with a resin molded part made of a synthetic resin and integrally having a power receiving coupler which faces a power-receiving-side connecting terminal connected to a coil of the coil assembly, characterized in that the coil case is formed by a burring process to a central portion of a closed end of a bottomed cylindrical material having a circular opening with a smaller diameter than an outer diameter of the press-fit cylindrical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the first feature of the invention, since the coil case is formed by a burring process to a central portion of a closed end of a bottomed cylindrical material having a circular opening with a smaller diameter than an outer diameter of the press-fit cylindrical portion, the press-fit cylindrical portion of the coil case is formed to have a length larger in close contact with the outer surface of the magnetic cylindrical body than that obtained by punching, and the length of the press-fit cylindrical portion can be made shorter than that obtained by punching. Accordingly, the projecting amount of the valve housing from the resin molded part can be made long, and the exposed length of the valve housing to the intake passage side can be made large without increasing the electromagnetic fuel injection valve in size, and attachment of the injection fuel to the inner surface of the intake passage can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, the resin molded part is provided with a forward extending portion which extends forward from the solenoid housing while covering the magnetic cylindrical body, and that a tapered projecting portion, which is integrally provided at the resin molded part to cover the magnetic cylindrical body while projecting forward from the inner peripheral portion of the forward extending portion, is inserted between the magnetic cylindrical body and a taper surface which is formed on at least an end portion at the resin molded part side of an inner periphery of a ring-shaped seal ring that is sandwiched between an annular receiving portion provided at a passage forming member forming an intake passage and a front end of the forward extending portion and which surrounds the magnetic cylindrical body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the second feature, it is possible to dispose the portion of the resin molded part, which abuts on the seal ring, at a position farther from the front end of the valve housing while securing the necessary length of the portion of the resin molded part covering the magnetic cylindrical body, whereby the projecting amount of the valve housing from the receiving portion of the passage forming member can be made long, the exposed length of the valve housing to the intake passage side is made larger without increasing the electromagnetic fuel injection valve in size, and attachment of the injection fuel to the inner surface of the intake passage can be more effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above-mentioned object, other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a preferred embodiment, which will be described in detail below by reference to the attached drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The solenoid part <b>6</b> includes: the movable core <b>20</b>; a cylindrical fixed core <b>23</b> opposed to the movable core <b>20</b>; a return spring <b>24</b> which exhibits a spring force biasing the movable core <b>20</b> to a side away from the fixed core <b>23</b>; the coil assembly <b>11</b> which is disposed to surround the rear portion of the valve housing <b>9</b> and the fixed core <b>23</b> while being capable of exhibiting the electromagnetic force which attracts the movable core <b>20</b> toward the fixed core <b>23</b> against the spring force of the return spring <b>24</b>; and the solenoid housing <b>12</b> which encloses the coil assembly <b>11</b> so that its front end portion is connected to the valve housing <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A rear end of the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> in the valve housing <b>9</b> is coaxially connected to a front end of the fixed core <b>23</b> via a non-magnetic cylindrical body <b>25</b> made of non-magnetic metal. The rear end of the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> is butt-welded to a front end of the non-magnetic cylindrical body <b>25</b>. A rear end of the non-magnetic cylindrical body <b>25</b> is welded to the fixed core <b>23</b> with the front end portion of the fixed core <b>23</b> fitted to the non-magnetic cylindrical body <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A cylindrical retainer <b>26</b> is fitted to the fixed core <b>23</b> and fixed by crimping. The return spring <b>24</b> is interposed between the retainer <b>26</b> and the movable core <b>20</b>. In order to avoid the movable core <b>20</b> from directly contacting the fixed core <b>23</b>, a ring-shaped stopper <b>27</b> made of a non-magnetic material is fitted and fixed to an inner periphery of the rear end portion of the movable core <b>20</b> so as to slightly project toward the fixed core <b>23</b> from the rear end surface of the movable core <b>20</b>. Further, the coil assembly <b>11</b> is formed by winding a coil <b>29</b> around a bobbin <b>28</b> which surrounds the rear portion of the valve housing <b>9</b>, the non-magnetic cylindrical body <b>25</b> and the fixed core <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The solenoid housing <b>12</b> comprises a cylindrical coil case <b>31</b> made of magnetic metal and a flange portion <b>23</b><i>a</i>. The cylindrical coil case <b>31</b> has, at its one end, a ring-shaped end wall <b>31</b><i>a </i>and surrounds the coil assembly <b>11</b>, and the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>protruding radially outward from the rear end portion of the fixed core <b>23</b> to oppose the end portion of the coil assembly <b>11</b> at a side opposite from the valve operating part <b>5</b>. The flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>is magnetically connected to the other end portion of the coil case <b>31</b>. In addition, a fitting cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>to which the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> in the valve housing <b>9</b> is press-fitted is coaxially and integrally provided at an inner periphery of the end wall <b>31</b><i>a </i>in the coil case <b>31</b>. The coil case <b>31</b>, that is, the solenoid housing <b>12</b> is connected to the valve housing <b>9</b> by welding the fitting cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>to the outer periphery of the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In forming the coil case <b>31</b>, a magnetic metal cylindrical bottomed material <b>45</b> which has a circular open portion <b>44</b> having a diameter smaller than an outer diameter of a press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>in a central part of a closed end is prepared as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), and a burring process by a punch <b>46</b> and a die <b>47</b> is applied to the central portion of the closed end of the material <b>45</b>, whereby the coil case <b>31</b> is obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to such a burring process, the proportion of a length L of a portion having a constant inner diameter of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>in the entire length of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>can be made larger as compared with the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ formed by the conventional punching described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When a length of a predetermined amount or more in close contact with the outer periphery of the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> is set as the length L, the entire length of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>can be made smaller as compared with the entire length of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>′ formed by the conventional punching.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Again in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cylindrical inlet cylinder <b>32</b> made of metal such as stainless steel is integrally and coaxially connected to the rear end of the fixed core <b>23</b>. A fuel filter <b>33</b> is mounted to a rear portion of the inlet cylinder <b>32</b>. In addition, a fuel passage <b>34</b> leading to a through-hole <b>21</b> of the movable core <b>20</b> is coaxially provided in the inlet cylinder <b>32</b>, the retainer <b>26</b> and the fixed core <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The resin molded part <b>7</b> is formed so as to sealingly imbed therein not only the solenoid housing <b>12</b> and the coil assembly <b>11</b> but also a part of the valve housing <b>9</b> and most part of the inlet cylinder <b>32</b>, while filling a gap between the solenoid housing <b>12</b> and the coil assembly <b>11</b>. The coil case <b>31</b> of the solenoid housing <b>12</b> is provided with a notched portion <b>35</b> for disposing a terminal boss portion <b>36</b>, which is integrally formed at the bobbin <b>28</b> of the coil assembly <b>11</b>, at an outside of the solenoid housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The resin molded part <b>7</b> is integrally provided with the power receiving coupler <b>40</b> forming a recessed portion <b>39</b> which faces the power-receiving-side connecting terminals <b>38</b> connecting to opposite ends of the coil <b>29</b> in the coil assembly <b>11</b>. Base ends of the power-receiving-side connecting terminals <b>38</b> are imbedded in the terminal boss portion <b>36</b>. Coil ends <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the coil <b>29</b> are electrodeposited to the power-receiving-side connecting terminals <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The resin molded part <b>7</b> is formed by molding two layers, that is, a first resin molded layer <b>41</b> which covers at least a part of the solenoid housing <b>12</b> and forms a coupler main portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>forming a basic structure of the power receiving coupler <b>40</b>, and a second resin molded layer <b>42</b> which covers the first resin molded layer <b>41</b> so that an outer periphery of the power receiving coupler <b>40</b> is exposed from an intermediate portion to a tip end side of the power receiving coupler <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the entire part of the solenoid housing <b>12</b>, the rear part of the valve housing <b>9</b> and a part of the inlet cylinder <b>32</b> are covered with the first resin molded layer <b>41</b>, and the coupler main portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the power receiving coupler <b>40</b> is formed by the first resin molded layer <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the first and the second resin molded layers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are made of different synthetic resins. While the first resin molded layer <b>41</b> is made of a synthetic resin having a relatively large bending strength, the second resin molded layer <b>42</b> is made of a synthetic resin with a bending strength smaller than that of the first resin molded layer <b>41</b>. The first resin molded layer <b>41</b> is made of, for example, a liquid crystal polymer containing glass fiber. The second resin molded layer <b>42</b> is made of a thermoplastic polyester elastomer excluding glass fiber, for example, an elastomer under the trade name of Hytrel (produced by Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company Inc.).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The liquid crystal polymer containing glass fiber which forms the first resin molded layer <b>41</b> has a high rigidity and a function of relatively suppressing transmission of operation sound. On the other hand, the second resin molded layer <b>41</b> is made of the thermoplastic polyester elastomer excluding glass fiber can suppress the operation sound pressure peak to be low.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The resin molded part <b>7</b> is provided with a forward extending portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>which extends forward from the solenoid housing <b>12</b> while covering the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b>. The rind-shaped seal ring <b>56</b> surrounding the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> is sandwiched between a front end of the forward extending portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the receiving portion <b>55</b> of the throttle body <b>52</b>. Taper surfaces <b>56</b><i>a </i>are formed at least on an end portion of an inner periphery of the seal ring <b>56</b>, which is at the resin molded part <b>7</b> side, that is, at opposite end portions of the inner periphery in this embodiment. A tapered projecting portion <b>43</b>, which is inserted between the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> and the taper surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>at the resin molded part <b>7</b> side among both the taper surfaces <b>56</b><i>a</i>, is integrally provided at the first resin molded portion <b>41</b> in the resin molded part <b>7</b> so as to cover the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> while projecting forward from the inner peripheral portion of the forward extending portion <b>7</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, the operation of the embodiment will be described. The burring process to the central portion of the closed end of the bottomed cylindrical material <b>45</b> having the circular opening <b>44</b> with a smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>, provides the cylindrical magnetic metal coil case <b>31</b> which integrally has, at one end side, the ring-shaped end wall portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>integrally connected to the inner periphery of the end wall portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>so that the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> is press-fitted to the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>and the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>is welded to the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b>. Therefore, the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the coil case <b>31</b> is formed to have the close contact length of the outer surface of the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> longer than that obtained by punching, and the length of the press-fit cylindrical portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>can be made shorter than that obtained by punching. Thus, the projecting amount of the valve housing <b>9</b> from the resin molded part <b>7</b> can be made long, the exposed length of the valve housing <b>9</b> to the intake passage <b>51</b> side is made long without increasing the electromagnetic fuel injection valve V in size, and attaching of injection fuel to the inner surface of the intake passage <b>51</b> can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The resin molded part <b>7</b> is provided with the forward extending portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>which extends forward from the solenoid housing <b>12</b> while covering the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b>. The tapered projecting portion <b>43</b> is integrally provided at the resin molded part <b>7</b> to cover the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> while projecting forward from the inner peripheral portion of the forward extending portion <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The tapered projecting portion <b>43</b> is inserted between the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b> and the taper surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>which is formed on at least an end portion at the resin molded part <b>7</b> side of the inner periphery of the ring-shaped seal ring <b>56</b> that is sandwiched between an annular receiving portion <b>55</b> provided at the passage forming member <b>52</b> forming the intake passage <b>51</b> and the front end of the forward extending portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>and that surrounds the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, it is possible to dispose the portion of the resin molded part <b>7</b> which abuts on the seal ring <b>56</b> at a position farther from the front end of the valve housing <b>9</b> while securing necessary length of the portion of the resin molded part <b>7</b> for covering the magnetic cylindrical body <b>13</b>. Therefore, the projecting amount of the valve housing <b>9</b> from the receiving portion <b>55</b> of the throttle body <b>52</b> can be made long, the exposed length of the valve housing <b>9</b> to the intake passage <b>51</b> side is made longer without increasing the electromagnetic fuel injection valve V in size, and attachment of the injection fuel to the inner surface of the intake passage <b>51</b> can be more effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The embodiment of the present invention is described thus far, but the present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment, and various design changes can be made without departing from the present invention described in claims.</p>
