<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for patterning self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals and a method for fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides having an inverted-opal structure using the patterning method. The patterning method includes depositing first and second conductive films separate from each other, on an area corresponding to a pattern of the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals that are to be formed on a substrate and on another area except for the area corresponding to the pattern, respectively, and growing the photonic crystals on the substrate on which the first and second conductive films are deposited by dip-coating in a fluid containing colloidal particles while applying a DC voltage to the respective first and second conductive films. Various types of colloidal photonic crystals can be fabricated depending on the electrode pattern defined on the substrate. Additionally, three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure having a photonic band gap in all light-traveling directions can be fabricated.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method for forming self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals on a selected area of a substrate or forming self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals having different diameters on the same substrate using an electric field, and a method for fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure using the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals patterned by the patterning method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photonic band gap structures in photonic crystals composed of dielectrics having a three-dimensional periodicity have become a matter of increasing interest. The photonic band gap structures are highly applicable to diverse optoelectronic devices such as microlasers, filters, high-efficiency LEDs, optical switches, low-loss waveguides, etc. In an initial stage of investigation, a three-dimensional photonic band gap in a microwave range was realized by providing periodicity to the dielectric constant of a dielectric-air structure by making small holes in a parallel direction on a silicon wafer or by stacking bar-shaped dielectrics in piles. However, in the wavelength ranges of infrared rays and visible light, it was only possible to form a two-dimensional photonic band gap. This is because it was very difficult to form a three-dimensional photonic band gap due to the need for scaling-down the etching space. In the case of a three-dimensional photonic band gap, the holographic lithography of laser light was used. Recently, research for methods of self-assembling small spheres (colloids) having a diameter of several hundred nanometers (nm) has been conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, diverse methods for fabricating self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals have been studied. One of the methods most frequently used is a dip-coating method for fabricating photonic crystals which utilizes capillary force exerted among a colloidal fluid, a substrate and colloidal particles. This dip-coating method is easy to carry out, and can form photonic crystals having a high crystallization in a wide area. However, it is difficult to selectively control the colloidal particles, and many semiconductor processes such as the lithography are required for patterning the photonic crystals. Additionally, in the case of forming photonic crystal of different kinds of colloidal particles or colloidal particles having different sizes, a template is required. Also, in the case of forming colloidal photonic crystals using three or more kinds of colloidal particles or colloidal particles having three or more sizes, the fabricating processes become complicated with limitations in design.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The most frequently used method for fabricating waveguides using photonic crystals comprises forming a transmission line from two-dimensional photonic crystals formed by periodically etching fine holes onto a silicon substrate. The two-dimensional photonic crystal has a photonic band gap and therefore results in no photonic loss in a two-dimensional light-traveling direction, but does suffer photonic loss in other light-traveling directions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, because the three-dimensional photonic crystal of an inverted-opal structure has a photonic band gap in all three-dimensional light-traveling directions, a waveguide using these three-dimensional photonic crystals can greatly reduce photonic loss in comparison to a two-dimensional photonic crystal. The fabrication of a waveguide having the three-dimensional photonic band gap requires a high-grade etching technique such as e-beam lithography, a high fabricating cost and considerable manufacturing time, and it is difficult to implement the waveguide in a wide area. Accordingly, there has been an increasing demand for and interest in a method for fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure through self-assembly of colloidal particles that can easily allow for fabricating photonic crystals in a wide area.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventional methods for fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure have been proposed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">First, the method described in “Multi-Photon Polymerization of Waveguide Structures within Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals”, Advanced Materials, vol. 14, 2003, pp 271-294 by W. Lee et al. has problems due to material and area limitations. Second, the method described in “Micromolding of Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals on Silicon Substrates”, Nanotechnology, vol. 14, 2003, pp 323-326 by P. Ferrand et al. also has problems in that its process is complicated and the photonic crystals are broken with the occurrence of cracks during an artificial piling up of the photonic crystals.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Certain embodiments of the present invention will next be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention should not be construed as being limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the following description, the same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements even in different drawings. The detailed description below is provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the present invention. Thus, it is apparent that the present invention can be carried out without being limited to such structure. Also, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal selectively formed on a specified area patterned on a substrate according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first conductive film <b>21</b> separate from a second conductive film <b>22</b> of a specified pattern are formed on a substrate <b>10</b>, and a self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal <b>30</b> is formed only on the first conductive film <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the method for patterning the self-assembled colloidal structure, a position, in which the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal is formed, is selectively determined by controlling the attractive force or repulsive force exerted between colloidal particles having a polarity and electrodes, i.e., the conductive films, by applying a voltage to the conductive films formed in the specified pattern. Using this method, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal <b>30</b> can be formed only on the specified part, i.e., the first conductive film <b>21</b>, of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view explaining a method of forming the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal <b>30</b> of the specified pattern by an electric field formed by the electrodes <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> patterned on the substrate <b>10</b> and a dip-coating method.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Basically, in order to grow the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal <b>30</b>, a dip-coating method that uses a capillary force exerted among a colloidal fluid <b>40</b>, the substrate <b>10</b> and the colloidal particles is employed. The first and second conductive films <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> having a pattern as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are deposited on the substrate <b>10</b> with a specified thickness. The substrate <b>10</b> on which the first and second conductive films <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are formed is vertically dipped into the colloidal fluid <b>40</b> in which the colloidal particles <b>42</b> are dispersed, and then slowly raised in a vertical direction. This action results in forming the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal on the substrate <b>10</b> on which the first and second conductive films <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are formed by capillary force exerted among the colloidal fluid <b>40</b>, the substrate <b>10</b> and the colloidal particles.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this case, by applying a DC voltage <b>50</b> across the first and second conductive films, i.e., metal plates <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, the first metal plate <b>21</b>, which corresponds to the area in which the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal is formed, forms a positive electrode and the second metal plate <b>22</b> forms a negative electrode. By drawing the substrate slowly in the vertical direction, the positive electrode <b>21</b> attracts colloidal particles <b>42</b> having negative charges, and thus the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal <b>30</b> is formed on the positive electrode <b>21</b>. By contrast, the negative electrode <b>22</b> repulses the colloidal particles <b>42</b> having negative charges, and thus no self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal is formed on the negative electrode <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The colloidal fluid <b>40</b> may be a solution obtained by dispersing colloidal particles <b>42</b> such as silica or polystyrene having diameters of several hundred nanometers (nm) in a solvent <b>41</b> such as water or alcohol. In the embodiment of the present invention, the self-assembled colloidal crystal <b>30</b> is formed only on the positive electrode <b>21</b> patterned to a width of 300 μm using water <b>41</b> containing 0.3 wt % polystyrene colloidal particles <b>42</b> having a negative polarity and a diameter of about 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, by repeating the above-described dip-coating while applying a voltage to the electrodes of diverse patterns to match the part in which the self-assembled colloidal photonic crystal is to be formed, various kinds of self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals having various sizes can be formed on the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, a method for fabricating a three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide of an inverted-opal structure according to the second to fourth embodiments of the present invention will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3G</figref> are views illustrating, in order, the process of fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure according to a second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4G</figref> are views illustrating, in order, the process of fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The fabricating methods according to the second and third embodiments of the present invention provide a three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide having an optical transmission line constituting a void (empty) space inside the photonic crystals using different kinds of colloidal particles C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>and different kinds of nanoparticles N<sub>1 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">First, the method for fabricating three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides of an inverted-opal structure according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a first conductive film <b>120</b> having a pattern corresponding to a part on which an optical transmission line will be formed, and second conductive films <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>arranged at both ends of and separate from the first conductive film <b>120</b>, are deposited on a substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the substrate <b>100</b> is vertically dipped into a colloidal fluid A (in which colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> and nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b>, which have the same charges but have different thermal or chemical characteristics, are mixed into a solvent in a proper ratio) and then drawn at a constant speed to perform dip-coating, a voltage for exerting a repulsive force against the charges of the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b> is applied to the first conductive film <b>120</b>, and a voltage for exerting an attractive force against the charges of the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b> is applied to the second conductive film <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, photonic crystals of an opal structure are formed by colloidal self-assembly only on the second conductive film <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b> infiltrate into voids between the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> to form the photonic crystals <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>of an opal structure in which the empty space filled with the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, if dip-coating is performed again with respect to the sample of in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> using the same colloidal fluid A, the photonic crystals <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>formed on the second conductive film <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>serve as a channel, and a photonic crystal <b>140</b> is formed only between the photonic crystals <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>formed on the second conductive film <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. At that time, the thickness of the photonic crystal formed as above is adjusted to be smaller than that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> by reducing the concentration of the colloidal fluid A as compared to that used in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, or by increasing the drawing speed of the substrate as compared to that used in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Here, the thickness difference corresponds to the thickness of the optical transmission line that is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, dip-coating is carried out with respect to the sample of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, using a colloidal fluid B in which the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b> and colloidal particles (C<sub>2</sub>) <b>152</b> and nanoparticles (N<sub>2</sub>) <b>154</b> having thermal or chemical characteristics different from the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b> are mixed into a solvent in a proper ratio. As a result, photonic crystals <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>150</b> are formed of a structure in which two kinds of colloidal particles <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> and two kinds of nanoparticles <b>134</b> and <b>154</b> are mixed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Then, by removing the colloidal particles (C<sub>2</sub>) <b>152</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>2</sub>) <b>154</b> using a thermal or chemical method that can remove the colloidal particles (C<sub>2</sub>) <b>152</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>2</sub>) <b>154</b> but which does not affect the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> and the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b>, an optical transmission line <b>170</b> of empty space is formed inside the photonic crystal as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Finally, by removing the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> using a thermal or chemical method that can remove the colloidal particles (C<sub>1</sub>) <b>132</b> from the sample of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> but which does not affect the nanoparticles (N<sub>1</sub>) <b>134</b>, a three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide <b>180</b> of an inverted-opal structure that includes the optical transmission line <b>170</b> constituting a void space is formed.</p>
