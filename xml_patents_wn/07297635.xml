<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a processing method; and, more particularly, to a method for removing an organic film layer formed on a surface of an object to be processed by generating a plasma of a process gas in a vacuum processing vessel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In forming a wiring of a semiconductor integrated circuit, there is included a process of forming, e.g., a contact hole or a groove for wiring. In such a process, a resist film layer and an anti-reflection coating film layer are formed on an insulating film layer made of, e.g., silicon oxide, and, further, a pattern for the contact hole or the groove is formed thereon by using a photolithography technique, after which an etching is performed by using a plasma processing apparatus according to the pattern, to thereby form the contact hole or the groove. Next, an ashing is carried out by using the same or a different plasma processing apparatus to remove the resist film layer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> describe a conventional ashing process. There is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> a structure having, starting from top to bottom, a photoresist film layer (PR film layer) <b>102</b>, an anti-reflection film layer [BARC (bottom anti-reflection coating) layer] <b>103</b>, a silicon oxide film layer (SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer) <b>104</b> and a silicon oxy nitride film layer (SiON film layer) <b>105</b> formed on a silicon layer <b>101</b> of a wafer. The SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>104</b> and the SiON film layer <b>105</b> incorporate a contact hole <b>106</b> formed by etching. In ashing the PR film layer <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the PR film layer <b>102</b> along with the BARC layer <b>103</b> formed on the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>104</b>, is removed thereby. For such conventional processing, a chamber made of, e.g., alumite-treated aluminum or alumina, is used as a vacuum processing vessel of the plasma processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In executing such processing, there is a problem of contaminant generation due to damages on chamber material by the plasma incurring with age. In particular, in a case of the chamber being made of aluminum or a material containing aluminum such as alumina, the etching performed by using a fluorine-based gas results in a generation of particles such as aluminum fluoride. To solve such problem, recently a chamber having an inner surface thereof thermally sprayed with ceramic such as yttria (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) has been employed to improve plasma resistance, which in turn stretches a periodic cleaning cycle of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a case of such chamber being treated with the ceramic thermal spray, e.g., a yttria thermal spray, the etching is performed by using a predetermined etching gas to form the contact hole <b>106</b> at the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, and, subsequently, the ashing is executed by using, e.g., an O<sub>2 </sub>gas, at a predetermined pressure of, e.g., 200 mTorr, to thereby remove the PR film layer <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In this case, however, crater-shaped holes <b>107</b> (hereinafter, referred to as craters for simplicity) formed by an abnormal etching are found at a surface of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>104</b>, particularly, around the contact hole <b>106</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a processing method capable of preventing the generation of craters at a lower film layer formed beneath an organic film layer due to an abnormal etching during an ashing of the organic film layer to remove same from the film layer within a vacuum processing chamber, wherein the vacuum processing chamber is treated with a ceramic thermal spray including a metallic component, such as yttria thermal spray, in order to enhance plasma-resistance.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4B</figref>, the preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> offers a schematic cross sectional view of a magnetron RIE type etching apparatus (hereinafter, referred to as a processing apparatus for simplicity) for carrying out a processing method in accordance with the present invention. The processing apparatus includes a chamber <b>1</b> made of aluminum and having an inner surface thereof treated with a thermal spray coating of yttria; a vertically movable support <b>3</b> made of aluminum, for supporting a lower electrode <b>2</b> via an insulating member <b>2</b>A; and a shower head <b>4</b> disposed above the support <b>3</b>, for supplying a process gas and also serving as an upper electrode <b>4</b> (hereinafter, referred to as an upper electrode, when necessary).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The chamber <b>1</b> in an upper part thereof has an upper room <b>1</b>A with a smaller diameter relative to a lower room <b>1</b>B with a larger diameter in a lower part thereof. The upper room <b>1</b>A is surrounded with a dipole ring magnet <b>5</b>. The dipole ring magnet <b>5</b> has a plurality of anisotropic cylindrical segment magnets arranged in a ring-shaped casing made of a magnetic material, which creates as a whole a substantially uniform horizontal magnetic field directed in a single direction in the upper room <b>1</b>A. Formed at an upper part of the lower room <b>1</b>B is an opening for transferring the wafer W therethrough, and at which a gate valve <b>6</b> is installed. The lower electrode <b>2</b> is connected to a high frequency power supply <b>7</b> of 13.56 MHz via a matching unit <b>7</b>A, and a predetermined voltage is applied to the lower electrode <b>2</b> from the high frequency power supply <b>7</b>, to thereby form a vertical electric field between the lower electrode <b>2</b> and the upper electrode <b>4</b> in the upper room <b>1</b>A. Accordingly, a magnetron discharge is generated by the vertical electric field formed by the high frequency power supply <b>7</b> and the horizontal magnetic field formed by the dipole ring magnet <b>5</b>, via a process gas, and, as a result, a plasma of the process gas supplied into the upper room <b>1</b>A is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Disposed on an upper surface of the lower electrode <b>2</b> is an electrostatic chuck <b>8</b> having an electrode plate <b>8</b>A embedded therein and the electrode plate <b>8</b>A is connected to a high voltage DC power supply <b>9</b>. By applying a high voltage from the high voltage DC power supply <b>9</b> to the electrode plate <b>8</b>A under a high vacuum state, the wafer W is electrostatically adsorbed by the electrostatic chuck <b>8</b>. On an upper peripheral portion of the lower electrode <b>2</b>, there is provided a focus ring <b>10</b>, made of a single crystalline silicon, for confining the plasma generated in the upper room <b>1</b>A above the wafer W. Further, there is provided beneath the focus ring <b>10</b> an exhaust ring <b>11</b> installed on top of the support <b>3</b>. The exhaust ring <b>11</b> has a plurality of holes being nearly equi-distanced along an entire periphery thereof, through which the gas in the upper room <b>1</b>A is discharged to the lower room <b>1</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The support <b>3</b> can be raised and lowered between the upper room <b>1</b>A and the lower room <b>1</b>B via a ball screw mechanism <b>12</b> and a bellows <b>13</b>. When loading the wafer W onto the lower electrode <b>2</b>, the lower electrode <b>2</b> is lowered with the support <b>3</b> via a ball screw mechanism <b>12</b> into the lower room <b>1</b>B. Then the gate valve <b>6</b> is opened and a transferring mechanism (not shown) loads the wafer W onto the lower electrode <b>2</b>. In executing a processing of the wafer W, first the lower electrode <b>2</b> is raised with the support <b>3</b> via the ball screw mechanism <b>12</b>, to satisfy a predetermined spacing between the lower electrode <b>2</b> and the shower head <b>4</b> for performing the processing of the wafer W. There is formed a coolant passageway <b>2</b>B connected to a coolant line <b>14</b> in the lower electrode <b>2</b>, through which a coolant introduced from the coolant line <b>14</b> is circulated to thereby adjust the wafer W to a predetermined temperature. Furthermore, respective gas channel <b>2</b>C is formed in a susceptor <b>3</b>, the insulating member <b>2</b>A, the lower electrode <b>2</b> and the electrostatic chuck <b>8</b>. The gas channel <b>2</b>C supplies therethrough, e.g., a He gas supplied from a gas introduction mechanism <b>15</b> through a gas pipe <b>15</b>A to a slit between the electrostatic chuck <b>8</b> and the wafer W as a backside gas at a predetermined pressure, by which heat transfer between the electrostatic chuck <b>8</b> and the wafer W is enhanced. Meanwhile, the reference numeral <b>16</b> denotes a bellows cover.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Prepared at a top portion of the shower head <b>4</b> is a gas inlet opening <b>4</b>A connected to a gas supplying system <b>18</b> via a line <b>17</b>. The gas supplying system <b>18</b> has a CF<sub>4 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>A, a C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>B, a CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>C, an O<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>D, an Ar gas source <b>18</b>E and a CO gas source <b>18</b>F. These gas sources <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>18</b>D, <b>18</b>E and <b>18</b>F supply respective gases thereof to the shower head <b>4</b> through valves <b>18</b>G, <b>18</b>H, <b>18</b>I, <b>18</b>J, <b>18</b>K and <b>18</b>L and mass flow controllers <b>18</b>M, <b>18</b>N, <b>18</b>O, <b>18</b>P, <b>18</b>Q and <b>18</b>R, respectively. A gas supplied to the shower head <b>4</b> may be a single gas or plural kinds of gases having predetermined flow rates depending on the process phase, wherein the plural kinds of gases are mixed in the shower head <b>4</b> to form a gaseous mixture having a specified flow rate ratio. A plurality of holes <b>4</b>B are formed at an entire bottom surface of the shower head <b>4</b> to be uniformly distributed thereat, through which the gaseous mixture from the shower head <b>4</b> is supplied into the upper room <b>1</b>A as a process gas. Meanwhile, a reference numeral <b>1</b>C represents a gas exhaust line <b>1</b>C and a reference numeral <b>19</b> represents a gas exhaust unit including therein, e.g., a vacuum pump connected to the gas exhaust line <b>1</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereinafter, a processing method by using the above-described processing apparatus in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 4B</figref>. There are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> a contact hole forming process, a photoresist layer (PR film layer) ashing process and a shoulder portion of the contact hole, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First, the contact hole forming process by using the above-described processing apparatus will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, there are shown on a silicon layer <b>201</b> of the wafer W starting from top to bottom a PR film layer <b>202</b>, an anti-reflection film layer [BARC (bottom anti-reflection coating) layer] <b>203</b>, a silicon oxide film layer (SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer) <b>204</b> and a silicon oxy nitride film layer (SiON film layer) <b>205</b> formed in a previous process. The PR film layer <b>202</b> contains a lithographed pattern <b>206</b> of a contact hole.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the contact hole forming process, the wafer W is etched to form the contact hole by using the aforementioned processing apparatus under the conventional etching conditions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. First, The BARC layer <b>203</b> is etched away. Specifically, the valves <b>18</b>G, <b>18</b>J and <b>18</b>K corresponding to the CF<sub>4 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>A, the O<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>D and the Ar gas source <b>18</b>E of the gas supplying system <b>18</b> respectively are opened to be connected to the upper electrode <b>4</b>, while respective flow rates thereof are set to be predetermined rates (e.g., CF<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/Ar=80/20/160 sccm) by the corresponding mass flow controllers <b>18</b>M, <b>18</b>P and <b>18</b>Q, respectively. Then the process gases are supplied to the upper electrode <b>4</b>. An ambient pressure of the chamber <b>1</b> is set to be, e.g., 40 mTorr by using the gas exhaust unit <b>19</b>. Under the existing state, by applying a high frequency power of, e.g., 1500 W, to the lower electrode <b>2</b>, a plasma of a gaseous mixture of the CF<sub>4</sub>, the O<sub>2 </sub>and the Ar gases is generated between the lower electrode <b>2</b> and the upper electrode <b>4</b>, and the BARC layer <b>203</b> is etched away by the plasma generated thereby (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Upon completion of the etching of the BARC layer <b>203</b>, the residual gas is purged and the process gas is replaced to form the contact hole in the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b>. First, the C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>B, the O<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>D and the Ar gas source <b>18</b>E of the gas supplying system <b>18</b> are connected to the upper electrode <b>4</b> in a similar manner as the above, wherein the flow rates of these process gases are set to be, e.g., C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/Ar=6/3/500 sccm, while setting an ambient pressure of the chamber <b>1</b> at, e.g., 60 mTorr. Under such arrangement, a high frequency power of, e.g., 1500 W, is applied to the lower electrode <b>2</b>, to thereby generate a plasma of a gaseous mixture of the C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, the O<sub>2 </sub>and the Ar gases, by which the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b> is etched to form a contact hole <b>207</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Following the etching of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b>, an overetching thereof is performed. The residual gas is purged, and the process gas is introduced by connecting the C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>B, the CO gas source <b>18</b>F and the Ar gas source <b>18</b>E to the upper electrode <b>4</b>, in a manner shown above, wherein the flow rates of these process gases are set to be, e.g., C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/CO/Ar=12/360/280 sccm, while an ambient pressure of the chamber <b>1</b> is set to be, e.g., 45 mTorr. Under the existing state, application of a high frequency power of, e.g., 1500 W, to the lower electrode <b>2</b> generates a plasma of a gaseous mixture of the C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, the CO, the Ar gases, by which the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b> is overetched. At this stage, etching residues are attached to the SiON film layer <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thereafter, an etching is performed to remove the etching residues on the SiON film layer <b>205</b>. The process gas is replaced with an O<sub>2 </sub>and an Ar gas by connecting the O<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>D and the Ar gas source <b>18</b>E to the upper electrode <b>4</b> in a similar manner as in the method described above, wherein the flow rates of these process gases are set to be, e.g., O<sub>2</sub>/Ar=20/100 sccm, while an inner pressure of the chamber <b>1</b> is set to be, e.g., 40 mTorr. Under this state, a high frequency power of, e.g., 500 W, applied to the lower electrode <b>2</b> causes the generation of a plasma of a gaseous mixture including the O<sub>2 </sub>and the Ar gases. By briefly etching using the plasma, the depositions on the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>205</b> are removed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, an etching of the SiON film layer <b>205</b> is performed. The residual gas is purged and the process gas is replaced, after which an etching of the SiON film layer <b>205</b> begins. The CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>C, the O<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>D and the Ar gas source <b>18</b>E are connected to the upper electrode <b>4</b>, wherein the flow rates of these process gases are set to be, e.g., CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/Ar=20/10/100 sccm and, while an ambient pressure of the chamber <b>1</b> is set to be, e.g., 80 mTorr. At such stage, by applying a high frequency power of, e.g., 500 W, to the lower electrode <b>2</b>, a plasma of a gaseous mixture of the CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, the O<sub>2 </sub>and the Ar gases is generated, by which the SiON film layer <b>205</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is etched away, thereby forming the contact hole <b>207</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the formation of the contact hole, the PR film layer <b>202</b> is ashed in the same chamber <b>1</b> in accordance with the processing method of the present invention. First, the residual gas is purged and the process gas is replaced by connecting the O<sub>2 </sub>gas source <b>18</b>D to the upper electrode <b>4</b> in a similar manner as the above. The pressure and flow rate of O<sub>2 </sub>gas are set to be predetermined levels appropriate to execute the processing method in accordance with the present invention. Under the existing state, a high frequency power of, e.g., 300 W, is applied to the lower electrode <b>2</b> and the PR film layer <b>202</b> is ashed by a plasma of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, to be completely removed, and thus transforming from a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In the present embodiment, the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is solely used as the process gas, but a gaseous mixture of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas and another gas, e.g., a gas mixed with an N<sub>2 </sub>gas, or a gas including at least one of N and H, e.g., an NH<sub>3 </sub>gas or a gaseous mixture of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas and a H<sub>2 </sub>gas may be used therefor, i.e., any gas, which enables the ashing of the PR film layer <b>202</b>, can be used as the process gas.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the processing method of the present invention, it is preferable to complete the ashing process of the PR film layer <b>202</b> in two steps. Specifically, the processing method of the present invention includes a first process of ashing the PR film layer <b>202</b> at a first pressure by using the O<sub>2 </sub>gas and a second process of ashing the PR film layer <b>202</b> at a second pressure higher than the first pressure by using the O<sub>2 </sub>gas. The first pressure is preferably not greater than 100 mTorr, which is much lower than that of the conventional method (e.g., 200 mTorr), and most preferably within the range from 20 to 50 mTorr. Since the first pressure is set to be equal to or lower than 100 mTorr, an abnormal etching due to yttrium can be prevented, to thereby remove the PR film layer <b>202</b> creating craters around the contact hole <b>207</b> even though <b>202</b> is contaminated by yttria cause by the yttria thermal sprayed portion of the chamber <b>1</b> to generate therein a metal contamination. If the first pressure is higher than 100 mTorr, there may be a problem of the crater generation around the contact hole <b>206</b> due to yttrium contamination. While an excessively low first pressure may suppress the generation of the craters, such low pressure may increase shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The shoulder loss <b>207</b>A is quantitatively defined as follows. A line extended from a sidewall of the contact hole <b>207</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, is represented as L<sub>1</sub>, and a line extended from an opening portion of the contact hole <b>207</b> is represented as L<sub>2</sub>. A line bisecting an angle (of about 90°) formed by the lines L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>is represented as L<sub>3</sub>. A point where the line L<sub>3 </sub>meets the shoulder portion is designated as an intersection point C. The shoulder loss is defined as a length δ of the line L<sub>3 </sub>between the intersection point C and an intersecting point of the lines L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, it is preferable that the contact hole <b>207</b> has small shoulder loss, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, in order to minimize the shoulder loss, the second pressure is preferably set high, e.g., higher than 100 mTorr, i.e., within the range from 200 to 300 mTorr. Moreover, it is preferable that the first pressure is switched to the second pressure at a point when the PR film layer <b>202</b> is completely ashed under the first pressure (hereinafter, referred to as “just ashing”). A starting point of an overetching process can be determined by detecting a variation of a certain wavelength of an active species included in the plasma, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, by using a conventional endpoint detector (not shown). However, it is not preferable to switch from the first pressure to the second pressure prior to the just ashing under the first pressure (lower than 100 mTorr), due to crater generation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, an overprocessing rate of the PR film layer <b>202</b> under the first pressure is preferably equal to or less than 15%, and more preferably, within the range from 0 to 10%. The overprocessing rate of the PR film layer <b>202</b> denotes a ratio of an overashed amount of the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the thickness thereof in percentage. If the overprocessing rate exceeds 15%, the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A becomes large. Further, sum of the overprocessing rates of the PR film layer <b>202</b> under the first pressure and under the second pressure is preferably equal to or less than 100% and, more preferably, within the range from 50 to 100%. If the sum exceeds 100%, the shoulder loss becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to the pressure of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas in the chamber <b>1</b>, the residence time thereof influences the generation of the craters. In case that the pressure of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is adjusted to first pressure (the pressure not greater than 100 mTorr), the generation of the craters is prevented with an increase in the residence time. On the other hand, in case that the pressure of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is adjusted to the second pressure (the pressure greater than 100 mTorr), the generation of the craters is prevented more effectively when the residence time is small. However, when the O<sub>2 </sub>gas has the first pressure, the shoulder loss becomes large with an increase in the residence time. The residence time (τ) can be obtained by the following Equation 1.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>τ=<i>V/S=pV/Q</i>(<i>m sec</i>) . . .   Eq. 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this formula, V is a volume (L) obtained by multiplying the area of the wafer by the distance between the upper and the lower electrodes; S, an exhaust rate (L/sec) of the gas exhaust unit <b>19</b>; p, an ambient pressure (Torr) of the chamber; and Q, a total flow rate of the gas, wherein 1 Torr·L/sec=79.05 sccm.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is possible to conduct the ashing process and the overashing process of the PR film layer <b>202</b> only at the first pressure, i.e., the pressure not greater than 100 mTorr. In such case, the generation of the craters around the contact hole <b>207</b> can be prevented. However, as the residence time of O<sub>2 </sub>gas increases, a problem of an increase shoulder loss may rise.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As explained above, in accordance with the present embodiment, when removing the PR film layer <b>202</b> formed on the wafer W by generating the plasma of the process gas in the chamber <b>1</b> having the inner surface thereof thermally sprayed with ceramic, such as yttria, the PR film layer <b>202</b> is removed first by using the O<sub>2 </sub>gas as the process gas under the first pressure, e.g., the pressure not greater than 100 mTorr, and then, by using the same O<sub>2 </sub>gas under the second pressure higher than the first pressure, e.g., the pressure greater than 100 mTorr. As a result, the generation of the craters by the abnormal etching at the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b>, particularly, around the contact hole <b>207</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) can be suppressed, while removing the resist film layer <b>202</b> from the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b> by performing the ashing process after forming the contact hole <b>207</b> at the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b> in the chamber <b>1</b> having an improved plasma resistance by a ceramic thermal spray treatment including a metallic component, such as yttria thermal spray treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, in accordance with the present invention, since the overprocessing rate of the PR film layer <b>202</b> under the first pressure, e.g., not greater than 100 mTorr, is set to be equal to or less than 15%, the shoulder loss can definitely be prevented. Further, since the sum of the overprocessing rates of the PR film layer <b>202</b> under the first pressure, e.g., not higher than 100 mTorr, and under the second pressure higher than, e.g., 100 mTorr, is set to be equal to or less than 100%, the generation of the craters can be prevented while minimizing the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b>. Moreover, even when the second process under the second pressure is omitted, the PR film layer <b>202</b> is removed under the pressure of O<sub>2 </sub>gas lower than 100 mTorr and such will prevent the generation of the craters as well. A contact surface of the chamber <b>1</b> having contact with the plasma of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas includes the metallic component, e.g., yttrium or yttria, to thereby prevent the generation of the craters around the contact hole <b>207</b>. Moreover, if the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b> has thereon the BARC layer <b>203</b> and the PR film layer <b>202</b> serving as organic film layers; the contact hole <b>207</b> can be completely formed with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present embodiment, the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the BARC layer <b>203</b> on the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>204</b> incorporating the contact hole <b>207</b> therein were ashed by applying the following process conditions to the processing apparatus. In these experiments, the respective process times under the first pressure and the second pressure were varied, while setting the final overashed amount under the first and the second pressures at 340%. Further, the total thickness of the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the BARC layer <b>203</b> was 780 nm. The ashing rate under the first pressure was 936 nm/min and that under the second pressure was 1140 nm/min.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present example, the first pressure of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas was set to be 20 mTorr, and ‘just ashing’ of the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the BARC layer <b>203</b> was performed under the first pressure for duration of 50 seconds after which the second pressure was set to be 200 mTorr, and the ashing of the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the BARC layer <b>203</b> was performed under the second pressure for duration of 2 minutes and 19 seconds. As a result, no crater was generated around the contact hole <b>207</b> and the shoulder loss of the contact hole <b>207</b> was 30.4 nm.</p>

As a result, there was no crater generated around the contact hole <b>207</b> and the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b> was 34.1 nm, which was greater than that of the example 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the present example, the first and the second pressures of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas and the flow rate at each pressure were set to be identical to those of the example 1. The ashing of the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the BARC film layer <b>203</b> was performed first under the first pressure for duration of 40 seconds and then under the second pressure for duration of 2 minutes and 27 seconds. Though indistinguishable craters were found around the contact hole <b>207</b>, in comparison with conventional ashing the generation of the craters is significantly suppressed in the present example. Further, the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b> was 29.5 nm, which was smaller than that of the example 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the present example, the pressure of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas was adjusted to 20 mTorr, i.e., the first pressure, and the flow rate thereof was set to be 50 sccm, as in the examples 1 to 3. The overashing of 340% was conducted under a pressure of 20 mTorr. As a result, no crater was generated around the contact hole <b>207</b> and the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b> was 62 nm, which was greater than that of the example 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 5</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present example, the ashing was performed under the same conditions as in the example 4 with the exception of the flow rate of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas being increased up to 150 sccm. The residence time was 8.9 m/sec. Under such conditions, no craters around the contact hole <b>207</b> were observed and the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b> was 45 nm, which was smaller than that of the example 4.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLE 6</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the present reference example, the ashing was conducted under the same conditions as in the example 3, with the exception of the flow rate of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas being changed to 250 sccm. The residence time was 5.4 m/sec. When the ashing was finished, few craters around the contact hole <b>207</b> and the shoulder loss <b>207</b>A of the contact hole <b>207</b> of 35.3 nm were observed. In this experiment, the generation of the craters was prevented much more effectively than in the conventional ashing process and the shoulder loss of the contact hole was smaller than those of the examples 4 and 5.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In preventing the generation of the craters, the residence time is preferably equal to or greater than 5 m/sec and, more preferably, equal to or greater than 10 m/sec. In the above examples, the first pressure was set to be 20 mTorr. However, it has been found that, even at the pressure of 60 mTorr, the shoulder loss was suppressed as in the above examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the present comparative example, the PR film layer <b>202</b> and the BARC layer <b>203</b> were ashed by the conventional processing method. Specifically, the pressure and the flow rate of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas were set to be 200 mTorr and 900 sccm, respectively, while performing the ashing for duration of 3 minutes with 340% overash. As a result, a number of deep and clear craters were formed around the contact hole <b>207</b> while producing the shoulder loss of the contact hole <b>207</b> of 18.8 nm, which was smaller than those of the above examples. In other experiments conducted while varying the overashed amount to 30%, 50%, 100%, and 200%, the demonstrable generation of the craters was observed with an increase in the amount of overash.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present comparative example, the ashing was performed under the above conditions with the exception of the flow rate of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas being adjusted to 300 mTorr. The residence time of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas was 44.7 m/sec. As a result, a number of craters deeper and clearer than those of the comparative example 1 were found.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Apart from the above examples and comparative examples an experiment was conducted in which a processing right until the ashing, was executed on a dummy wafer for use in evaluating metal contamination attached to a silicon oxide film thereof. When the dummy wafer was processed in the yttria-sprayed chamber used in the above examples, yttria contaminants were 10<sup>11 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. In case of the yttria contaminants mounting to 10<sup>10 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>, generation of craters were observed. However, when the same dummy wafer was processed in the chamber which was not yttria-sprayed, the yttria contaminants were less than 4.3×10<sup>8 </sup>atom/cm<sup>2 </sup>(the lowest limit of measurement). In case of using such chamber, craters were not generated regardless of the pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The inventors of the present invention examined causes of the craters generated after removing the PR film layer by performing ashing in the chamber having improved plasma resistance through the ceramic thermal spray treatment including the metallic component such as yttria. Based on the findings of the above examples and comparative examples, the inventors have arrived at following conclusions. While etching the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>104</b>, a deposition film (deposition) (hereinafter, referred to as “DEPO”) of etching by-product is formed in the chamber of which the inner surface is thermally sprayed with yttria, a kind of thermal spray of ceramic including the metallic component. Then the ashing of the PR film <b>102</b> is performed, at which time the DEPO along with yttrium and is accumulated on the wafer. After removing the PR film layer <b>102</b>, the metallic component such as yttrium remains on the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer <b>104</b> and such spots are selectively etched, so that the craters are formed thereat. Therefore, as a result of a series of processes while varying the process conditions of the process gas, e.g., the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, as in the above examples, it has been found that, if the pressure of the process gas is set to be lower than that of the conventional one (those of the comparative examples), the generation of the craters can be suppressed, regardless of the DEPO dropping down to the PR film layer <b>102</b> including yttrium.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the above examples, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film layer is formed beneath the PR film layer, but a SiOC (carbon-containing silicon oxide film) layer, a SiOF (fluorine-containing silicon oxide film) layer, a SiOH (hydrogen-containing silicon oxide film) layer, a SiN (silicon nitride film) layer, a ploysilicon film layer, a metal film layer or the like may be formed in place thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, the present invention is not limited to the above examples and can be applied to, e.g., when performing the yttria thermal spraying on another component in the chamber such as the upper electrode. The present invention further comprehends processing methods disclosing the following descriptions: when removing the organic film layer such as the PR film layer formed on a surface of an object to be processed in the vacuum processing vessel where the surface in contact with the plasma includes the metallic component, the pressure of the process gas including at least the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is set to be much lower than the conventional pressure (e.g., 200 mTorr).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided the processing method capable of noticeably preventing the craters from being generated at the lower film layer due to the abnormal etching, while removing the organic film layer from the lower film layer by performing the ashing in the vacuum processing vessel treated with the ceramic thermal spray including the metallic component, such as the yttria thermal spray, in order to enhance the plasma resistance.</p>
