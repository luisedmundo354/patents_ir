<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In an active matrix display device using an SRAM, the number of transistors configuring the SRAM circuit is large. Therefore, the transistors cannot be embedded in a pixel when a pixel area is small, otherwise an aperture ratio is reduced. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a display device without a refreshing operation and thus with small power consumption. According to the invention, a display device including a pixel which comprises a switching element and a nonvolatile memory element is provided. When a still image is displayed by utilizing a ferroelectric element as a nonvolatile memory element and storing a signal, writing is not required per frame. Further, as the ferroelectric element occupies a small area, a memory circuit can be incorporated without decreasing an aperture ratio.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a display device, and more particularly to a display device using a thin film transistor (TFT) formed on a transparent substrate such as glass or plastics, and a driving method of the same. In addition, the invention relates to electronic apparatuses using the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, with the advance of the communication technology, mobile phones have been widely used. In future, transmission of moving images and a larger volume of information are expected. On the other hand, through reduction in weight of personal computers, those adapted for mobile communication have been produced. Information terminals called PDA originated in electronic notebooks have also been produced in large quantities and widely used. In addition, with the development of display devices, the majority of portable information devices are equipped with a flat panel display.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, according to recent techniques, an active matrix display device tends to be used as a display device for the above portable information device and the like. In the active matrix display device, a TFT is arranged in each pixel and a display screen is controlled by the TFT. Compared to a passive matrix display device, such an active matrix display device has advantages in that it achieves high performance and high image quality, and can handle moving images. Therefore, it is expected that the mainstream of liquid crystal display devices will also shift from passive matrix types to active matrix types.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An active matrix display device has been manufactured using a polycrystalline semiconductor such as polysilicon formed at a temperature of 500° C. or less at highest, which is rather low as compared to the conventional condition of 1000° C. or more. Such an active matrix display device has advantages in that, in addition to a pixel, a driver circuit can be integrally formed around a pixel portion, which makes it possible to realize downsizing and high definition of a display device. Thus, such a display device is expected to be more widely used in future.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A description is given below on the operation of a pixel portion in an active matrix liquid crystal display device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a configuration example of an active matrix liquid crystal display device. One pixel <b>220</b> comprises a source signal line <b>203</b>, a gate signal line <b>205</b>, a capacitor line <b>219</b>, a pixel TFT <b>207</b>, a storage capacitor <b>211</b>, and a liquid crystal <b>215</b>. However, the capacitor line may not necessarily be provided if other wiring and the like can concurrently serve as the capacitor line. A gate electrode of the pixel TFT <b>207</b> is connected to the gate signal line <b>205</b>. Further, either of a drain region or a source region of the pixel TFT <b>207</b> is connected to the source signal line <b>203</b> whereas the other is connected to the storage capacitor <b>211</b> and the liquid crystal <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The gate signal line <b>205</b> and a gate signal line <b>206</b> are selected sequentially in accordance with a line cycle. Provided that the pixel TFT <b>207</b> and a pixel TFT <b>209</b> are N-channel types, the gate signal line <b>205</b> becomes active when it is Hi, thus the pixel TFTs <b>207</b> and <b>209</b> are turned ON. As the pixel TFTs <b>207</b> and <b>209</b> are turned ON, potentials of the source signal line <b>203</b> and a source signal line <b>204</b> are respectively written into the storage capacitor <b>211</b> and a storage capacitor <b>213</b> and into the liquid crystal <b>215</b> and a liquid crystal <b>217</b>. In the next line period, the adjacent gate signal line <b>206</b> becomes active and potentials of pixel TFTs <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> become Hi. Then, the potentials of the source signal lines <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> are respectively written into storage capacitors <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> and into liquid crystals <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> in a similar fashion. The liquid crystals <b>215</b> to <b>218</b> are aligned in accordance with the written potentials and change light transmissivity. In this manner, the active matrix liquid crystal display performs a display operation using a liquid crystal as a light shutter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an active matrix display device which performs a display operation with a static RAM (SRAM) inside its pixel portion and is also developed. (See Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei8-286170</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, one pixel <b>1407</b> comprises an SRAM <b>1403</b>, switches <b>1405</b> and <b>1406</b>, and a liquid crystal <b>1404</b>. A source signal line driver circuit <b>1401</b> outputs an video signal to source signal lines <b>1408</b> and <b>1409</b>. When a gate signal line <b>1410</b> is selected by a gate signal line driver circuit <b>1402</b>, the video signal is written into the SRAM <b>1403</b> via the source signal lines <b>1408</b> and <b>1409</b>. Either of the switches <b>1405</b> and <b>1406</b> operates based on the stored signal in the SRAM <b>1403</b> and either a potential Va or Vb is applied to the liquid crystal <b>1404</b>. This signal is maintained until the next video signal is written into the SRAM <b>1403</b>. In this manner, a display operation is performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Conventional active matrix display devices suffer from problems in that its display portion has a dynamic RAM (DRAM) structure with a storage capacitor and a switching circuit as described above, thus a periodical refreshing operation is required. Operation waveforms thereof are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A pixel signal line waveform approaches a source signal line waveform at the point when the source signal line waveform changes at t<b>1</b> and t<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a display operation can be performed favorably since the rewriting is performed at t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b> and t<b>5</b> to t<b>6</b>. However, when a refreshing operation is not performed or a refreshing period is long, a charge accumulated in the storage capacitor is discharged due to a leakage current of a switching TFT and thus a voltage required for driving the liquid crystal can not be stored. Therefore, even in the case of displaying an image such as a still image where an image data does not essentially change, periodical writing is required. As a result, power consumption is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Meanwhile, as for an active matrix display device using an SRAM as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the number of transistors configuring the SRAM circuit is large. Therefore, the transistors cannot be embedded in pixels when a pixel area is small, or otherwise an aperture ratio is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To solve the foregoing problems, the following method is applied to the display device of the invention. That is, a nonvolatile memory element such as one utilizing a ferroelectric material is provided in a pixel portion so that stored data is saved in the nonvolatile memory element without refreshing. By utilizing the ferroelectric material, an SRAM can be omitted, thus an element area occupying each pixel area can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A display device according to the invention comprises a source signal line, a gate signal line, and a pixel, all of which are arranged in matrix. One pixel comprises a switching element, a nonvolatile memory element, and a pixel electrode. An input terminal of the switching element is electrically connected to the source signal line, an output terminal thereof is electrically connected to the nonvolatile memory element and the pixel electrode, and a control terminal thereof is electrically connected to the gate signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A display device according to the invention comprises a plurality of source signal lines, a plurality of gate signal lines, and a plurality of pixels, all of which are arranged in matrix. One pixel comprises a plurality of sub-pixels each comprising a switching element, a nonvolatile memory element, and a pixel electrode. An input terminal of the switching element is electrically connected to the source signal line, an output terminal thereof is electrically connected to the nonvolatile memory element and the pixel electrode, and a control terminal thereof is electrically connected to the gate signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A display device according to the invention comprises a plurality of source signal lines, a plurality of gate signal lines, and a plurality of pixels, all of which are arranged in matrix.

An input terminal of the switching element is electrically connected to the source signal line, an output terminal thereof is electrically connected to the nonvolatile memory element and the pixel electrode, and a control terminal thereof is electrically connected to the gate signal line.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferred embodiments of the invention will be hereinafter described referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment Mode</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a configuration of the invention. Note that, a 3-bit gradation is taken as an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, the invention is not exclusively limited to 3-bit. One pixel <b>152</b> comprises three switching elements and three nonvolatile memory elements. ON/OFF operations of the switching elements are controlled by gate signal lines. One terminal of each nonvolatile memory element is connected to each switching element and the other terminal thereof is connected to a common electrode <b>151</b>. Each switching element has an input terminal, an output terminal, and a control terminal, wherein the input terminal is electrically connected to a source signal line, the output terminal is electrically connected to the nonvolatile memory element and to a liquid crystal element via and a pixel electrode (not shown in the figure), and the control terminal is electrically connected to the gate signal line. Operation thereof is explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Digital video signals are outputted from a source signal line driver circuit <b>101</b> to source signal lines <b>103</b> to <b>108</b>. When gate signal lines <b>109</b> to <b>111</b> are selected by a gate signal line driver circuit <b>102</b>, switching elements <b>115</b> to <b>117</b> and <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>103</b> to <b>108</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>127</b> to <b>129</b> and <b>133</b> to <b>135</b>. When the selection of the gate signal lines <b>109</b> to <b>111</b> are released by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>102</b>, the switching elements <b>115</b> to <b>117</b> and <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> are turned OFF. However, as the signals are stored in the nonvolatile memory elements <b>127</b> to <b>129</b> and <b>133</b> to <b>135</b>, liquid crystals <b>139</b> to <b>141</b> and <b>145</b> to <b>147</b> can perform a display operation based on the stored signals.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, when gate signal lines <b>112</b> to <b>114</b> are selected by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>102</b>, switching elements <b>118</b> to <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> to <b>126</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>103</b> to <b>108</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>130</b> to <b>132</b> and <b>136</b> to <b>138</b>. When the selection of the gate signal lines <b>112</b> to <b>114</b> are released by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>102</b>, the switching elements <b>118</b> to <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> to <b>126</b> are turned OFF. However, as the signals are stored in the nonvolatile memory elements <b>130</b> to <b>132</b> and <b>136</b> to <b>138</b>, liquid crystals <b>142</b> to <b>144</b> and <b>148</b> to <b>150</b> can perform a display operation based on the stored signals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the invention, a display operation is performed with an area gradation system since signals are stored digitally. That is, when a 3-bit display operation is to be performed, a gradation can be expressed by setting an area ratio of the pixel electrodes at 4:2:1, and storing a necessary signal according to a required gradation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When a ferroelectric material such as PZT (lead zirconate titanate: Pb[Zr<sub>x</sub>, Ti<sub>1-x</sub>]O<sub>3</sub>) is utilized for the nonvolatile memory element, the signal can be stored even when the power source is turned OFF. Therefore, when a still image is displayed, the power source of the display device can be turned OFF and the electricity can thus be reduced. In this manner, a refreshing operation which has been the conventional problem can be omitted and the power consumption can be reduced. The ferroelectric material is not exclusively limited to PZT and other materials can be utilized as well.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, according to the invention, unlike a display device using an SRAM, a large number of transistors are not required inside a pixel. Therefore, it can be driven without causing such problems as a case where the transistors cannot be embedded in the pixel when a pixel area is small or where an aperture ratio is notably reduced. Incidentally, a material such as an electrophoresis element can be utilized instead of a liquid crystal although the liquid crystal has been taken as an example above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the source signal line driver circuit, the gate signal line driver circuit, or other circuits used in the invention can be integrally formed on the same substrate as the pixels, while they can be formed on the separate substrates using the techniques of COG (Chip On Glass) or TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) and the like.</p>

One pixel <b>452</b> comprises three TFTs and three nonvolatile memory elements. ON/OFF operations of the TFTs are controlled by gate signal lines. One terminal of each nonvolatile memory element is connected to each TFT and to each liquid crystal element via a pixel electrode (not shown in the figure), and the other terminal thereof is connected to a common electrode <b>451</b>. Operation thereof is explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Digital video signals are outputted from a source signal line driver circuit <b>401</b> to source signal lines <b>403</b> to <b>408</b>. When gate signal lines <b>409</b> to <b>411</b> are selected by a gate signal line driver circuit <b>402</b>, TFTs <b>415</b> to <b>417</b> and <b>421</b> to <b>423</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>403</b> to <b>408</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>427</b> to <b>429</b> and <b>433</b> to <b>435</b>.

However, as the signals are stored in the nonvolatile memory elements <b>427</b> to <b>429</b> and <b>433</b> to <b>435</b>, liquid crystals <b>439</b> to <b>441</b> and <b>445</b> to <b>447</b> can perform a display operation based on the stored signals.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, when gate signal lines <b>412</b> to <b>414</b> are selected by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>402</b>, TFTs <b>418</b> to <b>420</b> and <b>424</b> to <b>426</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>403</b> to <b>408</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>430</b> to <b>432</b> and <b>436</b> to <b>438</b>. When the selection of the gate signal lines <b>412</b> to <b>414</b> are released by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>402</b>, the TFTs <b>418</b> to <b>420</b> and <b>424</b> to <b>426</b> are turned OFF. However, as the signals are stored in the nonvolatile memory elements <b>430</b> to <b>432</b> and <b>436</b> to <b>438</b>, liquid crystals <b>442</b> to <b>444</b> and <b>448</b> to <b>450</b> can perform a display operation based on the stored signals.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the invention, a display operation is performed with an area gradation system since signals are stored out digitally. That is, when a 3-bit display operation is to be performed, a gradation can be expressed by setting an area ratio of the pixel electrodes at 4:2:1, and storing a necessary signal according to a required gradation.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a configuration of an embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is different from Embodiment 1 in that one source signal line is provided corresponding to one pixel column. Note that, a 3-bit gradation is taken as an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, however, the invention is not exclusively limited to 3-bit. One pixel <b>548</b> comprises three TFTs and three nonvolatile memory elements. ON/OFF operations of the TFTs are controlled by gate signal lines. One terminal of each nonvolatile memory element is connected to each TFT and to each liquid crystal element via a pixel electrode (not shown in the figure), and the other terminal thereof is connected to a common electrode <b>547</b>. Operation thereof is explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Digital video signals are outputted from a source signal line driver circuit <b>501</b> to source signal lines <b>503</b> and <b>504</b>. When a gate signal line <b>505</b> is selected by a gate signal line driver circuit <b>502</b>, TFTs <b>515</b> and <b>517</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>523</b> and <b>529</b>. When the selection of the gate signal line <b>505</b> is released by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>502</b>, the TFTs <b>511</b> and <b>517</b> are turned OFF. However, as the signals are stored in the nonvolatile memory elements <b>523</b> and <b>529</b>, liquid crystals <b>535</b> and <b>541</b> can perform a display operation based on the stored signals.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, when a gate signal line <b>506</b> is selected by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>502</b>, TFTs <b>512</b> and <b>518</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>524</b> and <b>530</b>. When the selection of the gate signal line <b>506</b> is released by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>502</b>, the TFTs <b>512</b> and <b>518</b> are turned OFF. However, as the signals are stored in the nonvolatile memory elements <b>524</b> and <b>530</b>, liquid crystals <b>536</b> and <b>542</b> can perform a display operation based on the stored signals.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, when a gate signal line <b>507</b> is selected by the gate signal line driver circuit <b>502</b>, TFTs <b>513</b> and <b>519</b> are turned ON and the digital video signals from the source signal lines <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> are written into nonvolatile memory elements <b>525</b> and <b>531</b>.

In this manner, data writing of one pixel <b>548</b> is completed. The data writing is carried out during one horizontal line period.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the similar fashion, the above writing operation is carried out in the subsequent pixel row.

In this manner, a display operation is performed. In this embodiment, as the number of source signal lines can be reduced, it contributes to an improvement of the aperture ratio.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an embodiment of a source signal line driver circuit which corresponds to the pixel configuration shown in Embodiment 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the source signal line driver circuit comprises a shift register <b>601</b>, a 1st latch circuit <b>614</b>, and a 2nd latch circuit <b>615</b>. Operation of the source signal line driver circuit is explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When output pulses from the shift register <b>601</b> are inputted to latch circuits <b>602</b> to <b>604</b>, digital video signals from a video signal line <b>616</b> are stored in the latch circuits <b>602</b> to <b>604</b>. Subsequently, when output pulses from the shift register <b>601</b> are inputted to latch circuits <b>608</b> to <b>610</b>, digital video signals from the video signal line <b>616</b> are stored in the latch circuits <b>608</b> to <b>610</b>. In this manner, output pulses from the shift register <b>601</b> are sequentially scanned and video signals corresponding to one line are stored in the 1st latch circuit <b>614</b>. Then, before an image of a succeeding line is displayed, latch pulses are inputted to latch circuits <b>605</b> to <b>607</b> and <b>611</b> to <b>613</b>, and the video signals from the 1st latch circuit <b>614</b> are stored in the 2nd latch circuit <b>615</b>. As a result, the video signals are outputted to source signal lines. In this manner, the source signal line driver circuit is operated.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an embodiment of a source signal line driver circuit which has a different configuration from that of Embodiment 1. This source signal line driver circuit corresponds to the pixel configuration shown in Embodiment 2. Digital video signals from a video signal line <b>714</b> are sequentially stored in latch circuits <b>702</b> to <b>704</b> and <b>708</b> to <b>710</b> with output pulses from a shift register <b>701</b>. After the video signals corresponding to one line is stored, the video signals are transferred to latch circuits <b>705</b> to <b>707</b> and <b>711</b> to <b>713</b> with a latch pulse of a latch signal line <b>715</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The operations set forth so far are the same as those of Embodiment 3. Thereafter, output signals from the latch circuits <b>705</b> to <b>707</b> are switched with a switch <b>716</b> and each output signal is outputted to a source signal line during one-third of one line period. By the above operation, the number of source signal lines can be reduced. That is, a signal of the source signal line can be utilized in a time division manner. Here, the output signal is tripartitioned, however, the invention is not exclusively limited to tripartition. Similarly, output signals from the latch circuits <b>711</b> to <b>713</b> can be switched with a switch <b>717</b> and thus can be outputted to the source signal line.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 5 </heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a configuration example of a shift register using unipolar TFTs. Such a signal line driver circuit or other circuits of one polarity serves for the reduction in cost of a display device. Note that, N-channel unipolar TFTs are used in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, however, either P-channel unipolar TFTs only or N-channel unipolar TFTs only may be used. The use of unipolar process serves for the reduction in the number of masks.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, start pulses are inputted to a scanning direction changing switch <b>802</b>, and through a switching TFT <b>811</b>, they are inputted to a shift register <b>801</b>. The shift register <b>801</b> is a set reset type shift register which uses a boot strap. Operation of the shift register <b>801</b> is explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Start pulses are inputted to gates of TFTs <b>803</b> and <b>806</b>. When the TFT <b>806</b> is turned ON, a gate potential of a TFT <b>804</b> becomes Lo, thereby turning OFF the TFT <b>804</b>. Meanwhile, as a gate potential of a TFT <b>810</b> becomes Lo, the TFT <b>810</b> is also turned OFF. A gate potential of the TFT <b>803</b> is raised to the level of the power source potential. Therefore, a gate potential of a TFT <b>809</b> is firstly raised to (the power source potential−|Vgs|). Since an initial potential of an output <b>1</b> is Lo, the TFT <b>809</b> is to raise its source potential while charging the output <b>1</b> and a capacitor <b>808</b>. When the gate potential of the TFT <b>809</b> reaches (the power source potential−|Vgs|), the TFT <b>809</b> is still ON, thus the potential of the output <b>1</b> further keeps on increasing. As the gate of the TFT <b>809</b> has no electric discharge path, the gate potential of the TFT <b>809</b> keeps on increasing along with its source potential even past the power source potential.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the drain and source potentials of the TFT <b>809</b> become equal to each other, current flow to the output stops, thus the rise in potential of the TFT <b>809</b> is terminated. In this manner, a Hi potential which is equal to the power source potential can be outputted from the output <b>1</b>. At this time, a potential of CLb is Hi. When the potential of CLb is changed to Lo, a charge accumulated in the capacitor <b>808</b> is discharged through the TFT <b>809</b> to CLb, thus the potential of the output <b>1</b> becomes Lo. A pulse of the output <b>1</b> is transferred to the shift register of the subsequent stage. Described above is the operation of the circuit of Embodiment 5. This embodiment can be freely combined with other embodiments of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view of a pixel shown in Embodiment 1. The pixel comprises source signal lines <b>901</b> to <b>903</b>, gate signal lines <b>904</b> to <b>906</b>, TFTs <b>907</b> to <b>909</b>, nonvolatile memory elements <b>910</b> to <b>912</b>, common electrodes <b>913</b> to <b>915</b>, and pixel electrodes <b>916</b> to <b>918</b>. Note that, a 3-bit gradation is taken as an example in this embodiment, however, the invention is not exclusively limited to 3-bit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the nonvolatile memory elements <b>910</b> to <b>912</b> occupies small areas. Therefore, a memory circuit can be incorporated without decreasing an aperture ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Meanwhile, by setting an area ratio of the pixel electrodes <b>916</b>, <b>917</b>, and <b>918</b> at 1:2:4, a 3-bit area gradation can be realized. Similarly, in the case of an n-bit area gradation, by providing n pieces of sub-pixels and setting an area ratio of each sub-pixel at one to two raised to the (n−1)th power, the gradations can be also realized.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Steps for manufacturing a display device of the invention will be explained. Specifically explained herein are the steps for manufacturing a switching TFT to configure a pixel portion, a TFT to configure a driver circuit or other logic circuits, and a capacitor utilizing a ferroelectric material to configure a nonvolatile latch circuit concurrently on the same substrate with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref> are sectional views showing the manufacturing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a glass substrate such as barium borosilicate glass and aluminum borosilicate glass, a quartz substrate, a stainless (SUS) substrate, and the like can be used as a substrate <b>1000</b>. Also, although a substrate made from a synthetic resin having flexibility, such as plastic, generally tends to have a lower heat resistance temperature as compared to the substrates described above, it is possible to utilize the synthetic resin substrate as the substrate <b>1000</b> as long as they are capable of withstanding the process temperatures in the manufacturing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Base films <b>1001</b> and <b>1002</b> formed of insulating films such as silicon oxide films, silicon nitride films, or silicon oxynitride films are formed over the substrate <b>1000</b>. For example, the silicon oxynitride film <b>1001</b> formed of SiH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O is formed to have a thickness of 10 to 200 nm (desirably, 50 to 100 nm) by a plasma CVD method, and the hydrogenated silicon oxynitride film <b>1002</b> formed of SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O is similarly laminated thereon to have a thickness of 50 to 200 nm (desirably, 100 to 150 nm). In this embodiment, bilayer base films are shown, however, the base films are not limited to the bilayer structure, and may be a single layer or a multilayer structure of more than two layers formed of the above-mentioned insulating film. In addition, the base films may not necessarily be provided when using a quartz substrate and the like since its impurity diffusion does not become a big problem.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Island-shaped semiconductor layers <b>1003</b> to <b>1005</b> are each formed of crystalline semiconductor films manufactured by processing a semiconductor film having an amorphous structure with a laser crystallization method or a known thermal crystallization method (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>). The film thickness of the island-shaped semiconductor layers <b>1003</b> to <b>1005</b> is to be 25 to 100 nm (desirably, 30 to 60 nm). Note that, the island-shaped semiconductor layers <b>1003</b> to <b>1005</b> may be amorphous semiconductors or polycrystalline semiconductors. Also, not only silicon but also silicon germanium may be utilized for the semiconductor films. In the case of utilizing the silicon germanium, a concentration of the germanium is desirably within a range from 0.01 to 4.5 atomic %.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">For manufacturing the crystalline semiconductor film by using a laser crystallization method, laser such as a pulse oscillation type or continuous emission type excimer laser, a YAG laser, or a YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser is adopted. A method of condensing laser light emitted from a laser oscillator into a linear shape by an optical system and then irradiating the light to the semiconductor film may be employed when these types of lasers are used. The crystallization conditions may be selected by an operator appropriately. However, the pulse oscillation frequency is set at 30 Hz, and the laser energy density is set at 100 to 400 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(typically between 200 and 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) when using the excimer laser. Further, in the case of using the YAG laser, its second harmonic may be utilized to set the pulse oscillation frequency at 1 to 10 kHz, and the laser energy density may be set at 300 to 600 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(typically between 350 and 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>). A laser light, which has been condensed into a linear shape with a width of 100 to 1000 μm, for example 400 μm here, is irradiated over the whole surface of the substrate. This is performed with an overlap ratio of 80 to 98%.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, a gate insulating film <b>1006</b> is formed so as to cover the island-shaped semiconductor layers <b>1003</b> to <b>1005</b>. The gate insulating film <b>1006</b> is formed of an insulating film containing silicon in thickness of 40 to 150 nm by a plasma CVD method or a sputtering method. In this embodiment, the gate insulating film <b>1006</b> is formed of a silicon oxynitride film with a thickness of 120 nm. It is needless to mention that the gate insulating film <b>1006</b> is not limited to such a silicon oxynitride film and other insulating film containing silicon may be employed in a single layer or a multilayer structure. For example, in the case of using a silicon oxide film, the silicon oxide film is formed by mixing TEOS (Tetraethyl Ortho silicate) and O<sub>2 </sub>with the plasma CVD method, setting a reactive pressure and a substrate temperature at 40 Pa and 300 to 400° C. respectively, and discharging the mixture of TEOS with O<sub>2 </sub>at a high frequency (13.56 MHz) and a power flux density of 0.5 to 0.8 W/cm2. The silicon oxide film manufactured in this manner is thereafter subjected to thermal annealing at 400 to 500° C., thus favorable characteristics as a gate insulating film can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Gate electrodes <b>1100</b> to <b>1102</b> are formed on the gate insulating film <b>1006</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. The gate electrodes <b>1100</b> to <b>1102</b> may be formed of Tantalum (Ta), Titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), an alloy containing the above metal element as its main component, polycrystalline silicon, and the like. The gate electrodes <b>1100</b> to <b>1102</b> are formed by forming a conductive layer on the surface of the gate insulating film <b>1006</b>, and then etching the conductive layer with a resist mask (not shown in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then, an impurity element which imparts N-type conductivity is doped, thus N-type low concentration impurity regions <b>1103</b> to <b>1108</b> are formed in a semiconductor active layer.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, a resist mask (not shown) is formed so as to cover the gate electrode <b>1102</b>, an N-type impurity element is added in a self-aligned manner using the gate electrode <b>1101</b> and the resist mask as masks, and a P-type impurity element is added in a self-aligned manner using the gate electrode <b>1101</b> as a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this manner, high concentration N-type impurity regions <b>1111</b> to <b>1114</b> which function as a source region or a drain region of an N-channel TFT, and high concentration P-type impurity regions <b>1109</b> and <b>1110</b> which function as a drain region of a P-channel TFT are formed. As the impurity element for imparting N-type conductivity, phosphorous (P) or arsenic (As) is used, and as the impurity element for imparting P-type conductivity, Boron (B) is used.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Subsequently, activation of the N type and P type impurity elements is carried out by any following method of furnace annealing, laser annealing, lamp annealing or a combination of these. As for the thermal annealing method, it is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere where an oxygen concentration is 1 ppm or less or, desirably, 0.1 ppm or less at 400 to 700° C.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, a first interlayer insulating film <b>1115</b> formed of a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxynitride film is formed over the gate electrodes <b>1100</b> to <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thus, a switching TFT for configuring a pixel portion and a TFT for configuring a driver circuit and other logic circuits are formed on the same substrate. Next, a capacitor is formed on the first interlayer insulating film <b>1115</b> by utilizing a ferroelectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">First, a lower electrode layer <b>1201</b> is formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>). For the formation of the lower electrode layer <b>1201</b>, a CVD method, a sputtering method, an ion beam sputtering method, a laser ablation method, and the like may be adopted. As for a material used for the lower electrode layer <b>1201</b>, Pt/IrO<sub>2</sub>, Pt/Ta/SiO<sub>2 </sub>and the like may be utilized. As electrical characteristics of a ferroelectric thin film largely depends on an alignment of a crystal, it is particularly desirable that Pt which can easily control the alignment is utilized for the surface of the lower electrode. After forming the metalic film, unnecessary portions are processed by plasma etching in order to form the lower electrode layer <b>1201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, a ferroelectric layer <b>1202</b> is formed over the lower electric layer <b>1201</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). As the ferroelectric, lead-containing perovskite such as PZT and PbTiO<sub>3</sub>, a bismuth layer compound such as Bi<sub>4</sub>Ti3O<sub>12</sub>, an ilmenite-based compound such as LiNbO<sub>3 </sub>and LiTaO<sub>3 </sub>may be utilized. Above all, the ferroelectriric using the lead-containing perovskite, PZT is favorably utilized since it shows ferroelectric characteristics over a wide range of composition.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For the formation of the ferroelectric layer <b>1202</b>, a CVD method, a sputtering method, an ion beam sputtering method, a laser ablation method, and the like may be adopted. Above all, the CVD method is favorably used since it has high controllability of film composition and crystallinity, and thus achieves a large-sized screen and mass production. In the case of using the CVD method, the following conditions are required for the material: having a high vapor pressure relatively at a low temperature; a long-term stability; a precipitating rate which is decided by the amount of raw material supply within a range of a deposition temperature, wherein a nucleating reaction in the vapor phase is not caused. In light of the above points, PZT is still appropriate for the material.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The formation of the ferroelectric layer by the CVD method may be followed by known steps. For example, a ferroelectric layer using PZT can be formed at a pressure of 660 Pa and a substrate temperature of 500 to 650° C.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Next, an upper electrode layer <b>1203</b> is formed on the ferroelectric layer <b>1202</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>). For the formation thereof, a CVD method, a sputtering method, an ion beam sputtering method, a laser ablation method, and the like may be adopted as the lower electrode layer <b>1201</b>. As a material used for the layer, Ir/IrO<sub>2 </sub>and the like may be utilized in addition to the material used for the lower electrode layer <b>1201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, a second interlayer insulating film <b>1307</b> using a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxynitride film is formed. Then, contact holes are formed and wirings <b>1300</b> to <b>1306</b> are formed through the contact holes. A mode of electrical connections between the wirings <b>1300</b> to <b>1306</b> and TFTs are not exclusively limited to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">At the end, a protective layer <b>1308</b> is formed over the second interlayer insulating film <b>1307</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. As a material for the protective layer <b>1308</b>, a photo-curing or thermo-curing organic resin material such as a polyimide resin or an acrylic resin can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Through the above-mentioned steps, a TFT for configuring a pixel portion, a TFT for configuring a driver circuit and other logic circuits, and a capacitor using a ferroelectric material for configuring a nonvolatile latch circuit can be concurrently formed on the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is to be noted that, in this embodiment, a structure having an LDD region which does not overlap with a gate electrode is adopted to the switching TFT for configuring the pixel portion, and a single drain structure is adopted to the TFT for configuring the driver circuit and the logic circuits.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to the invention, a display operation is performed with an area gradation system since signals are stored digitally.

As described above, the invention is not exclusively limited to 3-bit. Further, the driver TFTs may be driven in a saturation region and the EL elements may be driven with a constant current, or the driver TFTs may be driven in a linear region and the EL elements may be driven with a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When a ferroelectric material such as PZT is utilized for the nonvolatile memory element, the signal can be stored even when the power source is turned OFF. Therefore, when a still image is displayed, the power source of the display device can be turned OFF and the electricity can thus be reduced. In this manner, a refreshing operation which has been the conventional problem can be omitted and the power consumption can be reduced. The ferroelectric material is not exclusively limited to PZT and other materials can be utilized as well.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Also, according to the invention, unlike a display device using an SRAM, a large number of transistors are not required inside a pixel.

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Further, the source signal line driver circuit, the gate signal line driver circuit, or other circuits used in the invention can be integrally formed on the same substrate as the pixels, while they can be formed on the separate substrates using the techniques of COG or TAB and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In a conventional active matrix display device, a refreshing operation of a pixel has to be performed at a fixed cycle. Therefore, even when a still image is outputted, writing is required, which results in the high power consumption. Further, in a display device to which an SRAM is applied, a large number of TFTs are needed in each pixel. Therefore, the transistors cannot be embedded in the pixel when a pixel area is small, or otherwise, an aperture ratio is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">According to the invention, a refreshing operation at the time when a still image is displayed can be omitted by incorporating a nonvolatile memory element into a pixel. Furthermore, as a signal is stored with a small number of elements, a display operation can be performed without notably decreasing an aperture ratio.</p>
