<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application cross-references two co-pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications filed on herewith on Sep. 12, 2003; namely, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/661,920 entitled, “Lithium-Limited Anode Subassembly with Solid Anode Current Collector and Spacer” and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/661,666 entitled, “Spacer Separator Subassembly” the contents of both are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of electrochemical cells, and, more particularly, the present invention relates to an anode subassembly for use in implantable electrochemical cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Implantable cardiac stimulation devices, such as defibrillators and pacemakers, are used to treat patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac dysfunction. In operation, such devices may continuously monitor the electrical activity of the heart and deliver appropriate stimulation therapies to normalize electrical or mechanical dysfunction. Cardiac stimulation devices must possess low self-discharge in order to have a useful life of many months, and must be highly reliable to provide a needed therapy whenever necessary. In implantable defibrillators, the power source must have a high rate capability to provide the necessary charge to the capacitors for delivering high-energy shocks. In addition, since cardiac stimulation devices are implanted, the battery must be able to supply energy from a minimum packaged volume.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Batteries or electrochemical cells are volumetrically constrained systems. The size or volume of components that go into a battery (cathode, anode, separator, current collectors, electrolyte, etc.) cannot exceed the available volume of the battery case. In addition, the appropriate amount of some components depends on the amount of other components that are used. These components must be “balanced” to provide discharge to the extent desired.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional cathode-limited battery such as a lithium-silver vanadium oxide (LiSVO) battery commonly used in cardiac stimulation devices, the capacity (Q<sub>+</sub>) of the cathode must not exceed the capacity (Q<sub>−</sub>) of the anode. Cathode limited cells have been used in battery powered implantable medical devices such as heart pacemakers because of the proven reliability of their discharge over the long periods during which they are implanted. The volume occupied by the other battery components also depends on the cathode capacity (Q<sub>+</sub>) as reflected by the amount of cathode material in the battery. The amount of electrolyte depends on the amount of cathode material and the amount of it to be discharged since the cathode material can swell as the battery is discharged and requires more electrolyte to fill the additional cathode volume. The volume of the separator and current collector depends on the area of the electrodes. The area of the electrodes depends on the area required for consistent pulse output as the battery is discharged. All of these components must be adjusted for a given battery volume.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One method for constructing a lithium anode cell is to wind cathode and anode elements together to form a cylindrical or oblong coil. In a coiled design, anode material is available on either side of the cathode windings and will deplete into the cathode as the battery is discharged. Reliable performance is assured by having an excess of anode capacity beyond the usable capacity desired of the cathode. This excess lithium is distributed through the length of the anode. The lithium winding forming the outermost winding of the coil has cathode material adjacent to its inner circumference but not on the outer circumference. Therefore the outermost winding of the anode need only be half the thickness of the inner windings. If an anode is constructed from a single piece of foil that is of uniform thickness, there is an additional excess of lithium on the outermost winding of the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One disadvantage of a cathode-limited cell is that the excess lithium in the cell may reduce other materials after the cathode is fully discharged, which can lead to cell swelling. In order to prevent damage to circuitry within the implantable device surrounding the cell due to cell swelling, a reinforcing stainless steel plate may be provided against the cell. This stainless steel plate occupies valuable space in an implantable device and adds weight to the overall device. In regard to implantable medical devices, a reduced size and weight is desirable to ease the implant procedure and avoid patient discomfort at the implant site. Eliminating the excess lithium or the need for the stainless steel plate would allow the cell size, and therefore the overall size of the medical device, to be reduced. Alternatively, the volume occupied by excess lithium and the steel plate could otherwise be taken up by cathode material to increase the battery capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another disadvantage of a cathode-limited cell is that its resistance increases as a function of time after the cell is discharged to the second voltage plateau on its discharge curve. By limiting the amount of lithium and electrolyte material in the cell, the cell may be designed to utilize only the first voltage plateau. Superior long-term cell performance can be achieved since the same useful capacity can be provided as in a conventionally balanced cell but at a higher voltage toward the end of the discharge cycle. A lithium-limited balanced cell having these advantages is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,997 to Crespi et al, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a coiled, anode-limited cell it is desirable to reduce the excess anode material present in the outermost winding that does not interface cathode material on both sides. One method for manufacturing an anode-limited cell that eliminates the excess anode material involves layering two lithium foil pieces. One lithium foil is provided long enough to form all of the windings in a coil, and the other lithium foil is provided long enough to form only the inner windings. When the two foils are overlaid and coiled with a cathode, the inner coil windings are formed by a double layer of lithium foil and the outermost winding by a single layer of lithium foil.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another method for reducing excess lithium in an anode-limited cell is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/123,495 filed 15 Apr. 2002 and entitled, “Balanced Anode Electrode” (Atty. Dkt. P-10327.00) invented by Aamodt et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosed method utilizes a short, thin lithium foil joined to a long, thick lithium foil such that the shorter, thinner foil will form the outermost coil winding and the longer thicker foil will form all of the inner windings. This method advantageously provides a narrow tolerance of the anode material for fully gaining the benefits of an anode-limited cell.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The anode current collector is commonly provided as a perforated conductive material such as a perforated nickel or titanium (e.g., a grid or screen). During assembly, the anode current collector is pressed against the anode material such that the anode material becomes enmeshed with the openings in the anode current collector. In this way, the openings in the anode current collector grid act to strengthen the mechanical joint between the current collector and the anode material and prevent separation of these components. The anode current collector further acts to provide reinforcement to the thin lithium layer in the outermost winding of a lithium-limited cell.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A limitation exists, however, in coiled anode-limited cells of this type relating to the potential for a short to occur between the cathode material and the anode current collector. When the thin layer of lithium has substantially depleted into the cathode in the outermost winding, the cathode may press into the anode current collector potentially causing a short. The anode current collector may extend the length of the coil windings but is typically positioned only on the outermost coil winding. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that, when the anode material becomes depleted toward the end of cell discharge, the cathode material may exert a force sufficient to press against the anode current collector. Cracks that naturally and commonly occur in coiled cathode material create exposed edges of the cathode material that when forced against the edges of the perforations or holes in the anode current collector grid, particularly in the final turn of the outermost winding of a coiled electrode assembly, can also contribute to the problem. Even if a robust separator material layer is present between the cathode and anode subassemblies, the separator material may tear when pressed between a cathode crack edge and an anode current collector edge. The possibility exists, therefore, for an electrical short to occur between the cathode material and anode current collector.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Though this mechanism is likely highly infrequent, it could result in potentially serious consequences for an implanted or difficult to retrieve electronic device. Thus, an improved anode subassembly design is warranted which overcomes the potential failure mechanism described above, particularly in anode-limited cells but potentially in any cell in which cathode cracking may precipitate a short between the cathode and anode.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention addresses the limitations described above by providing an anode subassembly that includes an anode current collector designed to eliminate perforation or grid edges in the last turn of the outermost coil winding. The anode subassembly includes the anode current collector mechanically pressed against an alkali metal anode to thereby promote secure attachment between the anode current collector and anode material. The anode subassembly has a leading edge and a trailing edge. The anode subassembly may be enveloped within a separator and wound with a cathode subassembly to form a coiled electrode assembly, beginning with the leading edge of the anode subassembly at the center of the coil and ending with the trailing edge on the outermost coil winding. The outermost coil winding includes: a first turn; a first generally straight segment; a second turn, which is the last or final turn of the coil; and a second generally straight segment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One aspect of the present invention is the elimination of anode current collector perforation edges from the second turn of the outermost winding, where a short is most likely to occur as described above. In one embodiment, an anode current collector grid of reduced size is provided such that the anode current collector grid is positioned only on the second straight segment of the outermost coil.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, the anode current collector is provided as a discontinuous grid formed in two sections. The first current collector section is positioned along the first turn and first generally straight segment of the outermost winding and the second current collector section is positioned along the second generally straight segment of the outermost winding.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another embodiment, the anode current collector is formed from alternating perforated or grid areas and solid areas. A first solid area may be provided at the leading edge of the anode current collector, which will reinforce an area of overlap between relatively thick and thin pieces of alkali metal foil used for forming the alkali metal anode. Next, a first perforated area will correspond to the area of the first generally straight segment of the outermost winding. Next, a second solid area is provided for positioning along the second turn of the outermost winding, and lastly a second perforated area is provided for positioning along the second generally straight segment of the outermost winding.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide reinforcement of the thin anode material forming the outermost coil winding to improve the handling properties of the anode subassembly and/or reinforcing a seam, also referred to herein as the “area of overlap”, between two pieces of alkali metal used to fabricate the alkali metal anode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, reinforcement is achieved by providing a reduced-size anode current collector with one or more extension members for extending across an area of overlap between thin and thick pieces of alkali metal anode material. The anode current collector extension member(s) provide reinforcement of the area of overlap. The extension member(s) additionally provide support to the thin alkali metal piece forming the outermost coil winding.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally or alternatively, reinforcement is achieved by including a spacer in the anode subassembly for reinforcing the thin alkali metal anode in areas not supported by a reduced-size or discontinuous anode current collector. The spacer may be pressed onto the alkali metal anode on the side opposite the anode current collector. In one embodiment, the spacer is formed from a film of microporous, non-conductive material such as polyethylene or polypropylene. In another embodiment, the spacer is formed from a perforated sheet of a fluoropolymer, such as a perforated sheet of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A reinforcing spacer may be positioned along the area of overlap between a thin and thick piece of alkali metal material used to form the alkali metal anode. The spacer may extend along the inner surface of the anode on the first turn of the outermost winding, the first generally straight segment of the outermost winding and/or the second turn of the outermost winding when a reduced-size anode current collector is positioned along the second generally straight segment of the outermost winding. The spacer may be positioned between the first and second sections of a discontinuous anode current collector, on the opposite side of the alkali metal anode from the anode current collector, to reinforce the thin alkali metal anode between the anode current collector sections.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet other embodiments, reinforcement is achieved by pressing strips of alkali metal onto the anode to add reinforcement along the top and bottom edges of at least a portion of the outermost winding and/or along the seam between thin and thick pieces of alkali metal used to form the alkali metal anode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still another embodiment, an anode current collector subassembly is provided including two anode current collector sections and an intervening spacer. The anode current collector subassembly is pressed onto an alkali metal anode to form the anode subassembly. The anode current collector subassembly is positioned on the anode such that a first current collector section will be positioned along the first turn and the first straight segment of the outermost winding, the spacer will be positioned along the second turn of the outermost winding and provide reinforcement of the anode thereto, and a second current collector section will be positioned along the second straight segment of the outermost winding.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention is aimed at providing an improved anode subassembly for use in an implantable electrochemical cell that is designed to prevent cell failure due to shorting between the cathode material and the anode current collector, particularly when the anode material becomes depleted. The benefits of the present invention may be realized in anode-limited cells wherein the anode becomes depleted before the cathode. However, it is expected that the benefits of the present invention may also be realized in cathode-limited cells wherein cracks in the cathode material, in particular in cells having relatively thick cathode material, may lead to shorting between the cathode and anode.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While a variety of battery configurations and constructions are possible for anode-or cathode-limited cells, the methods included in the present invention are particularly suited for batteries having folded, coiled or wrapped electrode configurations, such as the batteries disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,215 issued to Kelm et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,038 issued to Howard et al, both patents incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The inventors of the present invention have recognized that a shorting failure can potentially occur in a coiled, lithium-limited cell between the cathode material and the anode current collector on the outermost winding as the thin lithium layer depletes into the cathode during cell discharge. The inventors have further recognized that this potential failure mechanism, though expectedly rare, is most likely to occur in the last turn of the coil, in the outermost winding, if it occurs at all.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a top plan view of an anode subassembly <b>1</b> to be included in an electrochemical cell according to one embodiment of the present invention. The anode subassembly <b>1</b> includes an anode current collector grid <b>5</b> attached to an alkali metal anode <b>3</b> formed from two pieces of anode material, <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. The anode current collector <b>5</b> is a flat, thin conductive metal grid or perforated conductive metal that is corrosion-resistant when associated with the alkali metal pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. The anode current collector <b>5</b> is preferably fabricated from titanium, nickel, copper or an alloy of nickel or copper. One or more connector tabs <b>20</b> may project from anode current collector <b>5</b> to allow anode connection to a desired battery terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Anode current collector grid <b>5</b> is of a reduced size relative to prior art anode current collector grids which typically extend for most or all of the length of the outermost coil winding or even further into the inner coil windings. As will be described in greater detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, anode current collector grid <b>5</b> is sized and positioned on anode <b>3</b> such that it will be present on the outer surface of the last straight segment of the outermost coil winding. When anode subassembly <b>1</b> is wound with a cathode subassembly to form an oblong, coiled electrode assembly, starting with a leading edge <b>14</b> at the center of the coil and ending with a trailing edge <b>12</b> of anode subassembly <b>1</b>, anode current collector <b>5</b> edges will not be present in the turns of the outermost coil.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the alkali metal anode <b>3</b> is formed from an elongated piece of alkali metal <b>10</b> conjoined to a shorter and thinner piece of alkali metal <b>15</b>. The alkali metal pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> are preferably foils formed of lithium metal or an alloy of lithium. The two foil pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> are partially overlapped to provide an interfacing area for forming a cohesive bond between the two pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. The area of overlap <b>8</b> is preferably kept as narrow as possible to avoid excess lithium but still provide a stable cohesive bond. The cohesive bond is formed at the area of overlap <b>8</b> using high pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The anode subassembly <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is intended for use in an anode-limited cell wherein the shorter thinner piece of alkali metal <b>15</b> forms the outer winding of a coiled electrode assembly formed when anode subassembly <b>1</b> is wound around an appropriately-sized mandrel with a cathode subassembly. An anode subassembly including a short, thin piece of alkali metal for forming the outer electrode winding and a long, thicker piece of alkali metal for forming the inner electrode windings is generally disclosed in the above-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/123,495. Such an arrangement has the advantage of achieving a narrow anode material tolerance in an anode-limited cell.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In prior art designs, an anode current collector grid may extend over the area of overlap <b>8</b> to thereby stabilize and reinforce the cohesive bond between foils <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, wherein anode current collector grid <b>5</b> is of a reduced size, a spacer <b>30</b> is provided for reinforcing the overlap area <b>8</b> between lithium foils <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> and for improving the handling characteristics of the anode subassembly <b>1</b> during cell assembly procedures. The thin lithium foil <b>15</b>, supported by anode current collector grid <b>5</b> in a limited area, may be vulnerable to creasing or tearing during assembly procedures. By reinforcing the thin lithium foil <b>15</b> and area of overlap <b>8</b> with spacer <b>30</b>, anode subassembly <b>1</b> handling properties are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Spacer <b>30</b> is preferably pressed onto alkali metal anode <b>3</b> on the opposite side of anode <b>3</b> from current collector grid <b>5</b>. Spacer <b>30</b> is preferably formed from a microporous, non-conductive film, such as a commercially available polyethylene or polypropylene film known for use as a battery separator material, which is chemically inert in the environment of the electrochemical cell. A preferred material for spacer <b>30</b> is a bilayer film including a microporous and non-woven layer of polypropylene.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternative anode material arrangements may be used within the scope of the present invention for forming the alkali metal anode <b>3</b>. For example, the anode <b>3</b> may be formed from a single elongated piece of alkali foil <b>10</b> attached to the reduced-size, anode current collector grid <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, wherein the elongated alkali metal piece <b>10</b> extends the entire length of anode subassembly <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of an alkali metal anode arrangement. A long foil <b>10</b> is cohesively bonded to a shorter alkali metal foil <b>15</b> having a length corresponding to the linear distance of the inner coils of a wound electrode assembly. Anode current collector grid <b>5</b> is attached near the trailing edge <b>12</b> of long alkali metal piece <b>10</b>. The area of overlap <b>8</b> of the long and short pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> forms the inner coil windings of an electrode assembly, and long piece <b>10</b> forms the outer winding with anode current collector grid <b>5</b> positioned only on the outer face of the final straight segment of an oblong coil. In this embodiment, the long and short foils <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> may be provided with the same or different thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C, the assembly process for producing anode subassembly <b>1</b> includes the step of pressing the alkali metal anode <b>3</b> onto anode current collector grid <b>5</b> to securely attach the anode current collector <b>5</b> to the anode material. Pressure of about 800 psi may be used to attach the anode current collector grid <b>5</b> to the anode <b>3</b>. Anode current collector grid <b>5</b> is preferably pressed onto and thereby securely attached to the anode alkali metal near the trailing edge <b>12</b> of anode <b>3</b> at a location corresponding to the area that will become the outer surface of the final straight segment of an oblong, coiled electrode assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The anode subassembly materials, namely anode current collector grid <b>5</b>, alkali metal anode <b>3</b> which may include two foil pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>, and spacer <b>30</b>, may be positioned as desired in a die. The die is then placed between platens of a hydraulic press which presses the anode <b>3</b> onto the anode current collector grid <b>5</b> and spacer <b>30</b> onto anode <b>3</b>. Preferably the pressed joint between the anode current collector <b>5</b> and the alkali metal anode <b>3</b> withstands a pulling force of about 0.25 lbs or greater, depending on the materials used, without delaminating to ensure that delamination does not occur during the expected useful life of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Spacer <b>30</b> is pressed onto the alkali metal anode <b>3</b>, preferably on the opposite side of the anode <b>3</b> from anode current collector grid <b>5</b>. Spacer <b>30</b> is positioned over an area of anode <b>3</b> which will become the outermost winding of a coiled electrode. Spacer <b>30</b> may be positioned and sized such that it provides reinforcement in the area of overlap <b>8</b> and/or at least a portion of anode <b>3</b> along the outermost winding where anode <b>3</b> is not supported by anode current collector <b>5</b>. Spacer <b>30</b> may optionally extend over at least a portion of the area supported by anode current collector <b>5</b> such that the anode material is “sandwiched” between the current collector grid <b>5</b> and spacer <b>30</b>. Though shown to extend only slightly over current collector grid <b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref> through <b>1</b>C, spacer <b>30</b> may optionally extend to trailing edge <b>12</b> such that it also covers the anode supported by current collector grid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Spacer <b>30</b> and anode current collector grid <b>5</b> may be pressed onto the anode material in a single pressing step or in two separate pressing steps. The pressure applied preferably deforms the anode metal into intimate contact with the spacer. When the bilayer film including microporous and non-woven layers indicated above is used for fabricating spacer <b>30</b>, the non-woven side is preferably placed against the anode alkali metal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Anode subassembly <b>1</b> may be enveloped in a separator before cell assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of an anode subassembly <b>1</b> being packaged in a separator <b>110</b>. Anode subassembly <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> corresponds to the anode subassembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, however, any of the various anode subassembly embodiments described herein may be packaged in a separator <b>110</b> prior to electrode assembly. Separator <b>110</b> may be formed from a microporous, single layer or multi-layer film formed from a non-conductive material that is chemically inert in the environment of the electrochemical cell, such as polypropylene and/or polyethylene. Numerous commercially available separator materials are known in the art. In one embodiment, separator <b>110</b> is formed as a single layer of polypropylene film about 0.001 inches in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Separator <b>110</b> is elongated and sized appropriately for enveloping anode subassembly <b>1</b>. Separator <b>110</b> is folded longitudinally along its midline <b>130</b> such that anode subassembly <b>1</b> may be inserted into separator <b>110</b> as indicated by arrow <b>135</b>. After positioning anode subassembly <b>1</b> in separator <b>110</b>, separator <b>110</b> may optionally be sealed along the three open edges <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b> by applying heat to a desired seam area along each edge <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Separator <b>110</b> may be sealed closed around anode subassembly <b>1</b> using conventional heat sealing equipment. A slit <b>123</b> is provided in separator subassembly <b>110</b> to accommodate anode connector tab <b>20</b> that allows anode connection to a desired battery terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Separator <b>110</b> may alternatively take the form of a separator subassembly that further includes a spacer joined to separator <b>110</b> to provide an additional layer of protection between the anode current collector and cathode in a wound electrode assembly, as generally disclosed in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/661,666 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. With regard to the anode subassembly embodiments described herein, a spacer included in a separator subassembly may provide additional reinforcement of the alkali metal anode <b>3</b> in areas unsupported by the anode current collector <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an end view of an electrode assembly including the anode subassembly <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Electrode assembly <b>120</b> is formed by winding anode subassembly <b>1</b> with a cathode subassembly around an appropriately sized mandrel <b>100</b>. The cathode subassembly includes cathode material <b>50</b> and a cathode current collector <b>52</b>. The cathode current collector <b>52</b> is formed from a conductive metal that is corrosion resistant at the cathode potential, such as titanium or aluminum. The cathode current collector may be provided with one or more projecting connector tabs <b>70</b> to allow connection to a cathode terminal. The cathode material <b>50</b> includes a solid reactive cathode ingredient, such as silver vanadium oxide (SVO), and may include other materials such as binding materials or conductivity enhancers as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A method for winding the electrode assembly <b>120</b> may be performed as described in previously-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,215 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,038. The length of the anode subassembly <b>1</b> relative to the cathode subassembly is such that the outermost winding <b>125</b> of the electrode assembly <b>120</b> is formed by the anode subassembly <b>1</b>. Moreover, the length of the elongated alkali metal piece <b>10</b> and the length of the shorter, thinner alkali metal piece <b>15</b> are such that the thicker piece <b>10</b> forms the inner windings of the electrode assembly <b>120</b> and the thinner piece <b>15</b> forms the outermost winding <b>125</b> of the assembly <b>120</b>. Prior to coiling anode and cathode subassemblies together, one or both of anode subassembly <b>1</b> and the cathode subassembly may be enveloped in a separator material in the manner generally described above.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the anode and cathode subassemblies have been properly wound, the mandrel <b>100</b> may be removed. The inner windings of the anode subassembly <b>1</b> formed by the thicker alkali metal piece <b>10</b> face cathode <b>50</b> on both sides. The outermost winding <b>125</b> includes a first (also herein, a penultimate) turn <b>126</b>, followed by a first (also herein, a penultimate) generally straight segment <b>127</b>, a second (also herein, a final) turn <b>128</b> which is the last or final turn of the coil, and a second (also herein, a final) generally straight segment <b>129</b> ending at trailing edge <b>12</b>. The outermost winding <b>125</b> is formed by the thin alkali metal piece <b>15</b> which faces cathode <b>50</b> only on one side. Spacer <b>30</b> is positioned on the inner surface of the outermost winding <b>125</b>, starting from just before first turn <b>126</b> extending along straight segment <b>127</b> and through second turn <b>128</b>, such that spacer <b>30</b> provides a reinforcing layer to the thin alkali metal piece <b>15</b> and to the area of overlap <b>8</b> between the thin and thick pieces <b>15</b> and <b>10</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Spacer <b>30</b> is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to only partially overlap anode current collector grid <b>5</b> on second straight segment <b>129</b> of outermost winding <b>125</b>. Spacer <b>30</b>, however, may optionally extend further along second generally straight segment <b>129</b> or even all the way to trailing edge <b>12</b>. Spacer <b>30</b> may optionally extend into the inner windings of electrode assembly <b>120</b>, however, in a preferred embodiment, spacer <b>30</b> extends along the inside of the outermost winding only where reinforcement of the thin anode material is desired so as to minimize the volume occupied by spacer <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The anode subassembly <b>1</b> provided by the present invention reduces the risk of a short between the cathode material and anode current collector by eliminating the anode current collector grid from the region of the second turn <b>129</b> of the outermost coil, where a short is most likely to occur. As such, anode subassembly <b>1</b> is expected to improve the long-term reliability of electrode assembly <b>120</b>. In addition, a reduced-size anode current collector occupies less of the available cell volume thereby allowing for an increase in the volume occupied by other cell components, e.g., an increase in anode or cathode material to increase cell capacity, or otherwise reducing the overall cell size. Furthermore, the anode subassembly <b>1</b> provided by the present invention may enable the use of thicker cathode material, which can crack more severely than relatively thinner cathodes, to increase the cell capacity with improved reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top plan view of an alternative embodiment of an anode subassembly including an anode current collector of a reduced sized. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reduced-size anode current collector grid <b>5</b> is positioned over the area of overlap <b>8</b> rather than along the trailing edge <b>12</b> of alkali metal anode <b>3</b>. Anode current collector grid <b>5</b> thereby reinforces the area of overlap <b>8</b> between anode alkali metal pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> yet does not extend into the second turn <b>128</b> of the outermost winding <b>125</b> where a short between the cathode <b>50</b> and anode current collector <b>5</b> would otherwise most likely occur.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As noted above, when the anode current collector <b>5</b> is reduced in size such that it does not reinforce the thin alkali metal piece <b>15</b> along its entire length on the outermost coil, the thin alkali metal piece <b>15</b> may be vulnerable to tearing or kinking during handling and electrode assembly procedures. It is desirable therefore to provide reinforcing elements to support the thin alkali metal piece <b>15</b> and/or the area of overlap <b>8</b> between the thin and thick alkali metal pieces <b>15</b> and <b>10</b>, respectively, to thereby improve the handling properties of anode subassembly <b>1</b>.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a first solid area <b>43</b> is provided to support the area of overlap <b>8</b> between thick and thin alkali metal pieces <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>.
