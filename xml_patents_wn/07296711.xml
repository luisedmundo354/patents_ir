<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELDS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a safety cap, in particular, a safety cap with a cover unopenable unless a specific opening operation is taken place.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, as a cap for a container for a drink or other contents, there is proposed a cap having a cylindrical body for fitting on an opened neck portion of the container, and a cover for closing the top end surface of the cylindrical body. Although such a cap is easy to open for everybody, but it may be opened by a mischief small child such that the contents of the container may be scattered therearound. Moreover, the cap is susceptible to an unauthorized opening which may result in pilfering of the contents by unauthorized persons.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For preventing these disadvantages, there are following proposals on safety caps which are not able to open without taking a specific open operation that requires the finger dexterity of the grownups.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 56-28939 (hereinafter referred as document 1), discloses a safety cap with a ball type torque transmission. This safety cap is formed by an inner cap member screw-fitted on the opened neck portion of the container, and an outer cap member for covering the outside of the inner cap member, which is attached rotationally to the inner cap member but irremovable therefrom against pulling. The ball type torque transmission is formed between the inner and outer cap members so as to transmit the torque from one to the other when the outer cap member is rotated to a closing direction, or when the container is inclined to a certain orientation and then the outer cap member is rotated to an opening direction in the inclined state. Accordingly, when the container is not inclined to that orientation, it is impossible to detach the inner cap member from the opened neck portion of the container by the rotation of the outer cap member, since the outer cap member rotates idly around the inner cap member, transmitting no torque thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-335610 (hereinafter referred as document 2) discloses a safety cap similar to the one according to the document 1, except that the ball type torque transmission is replaced by an engagement pin for penetrating through the top walls of the inner and outer cap members.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-335611 (hereinafter referred as document 3) discloses a safety cap comprising a rotation cylinder for fitting on the opened neck portion of a container irremovably, an outer cylinder with a top wall which is screw-fitted on the main part of the rotation cylinder except its lower end part, and an engagement means which is provided between the rotation cylinder and the outer cylinder for providing an engagement therebetween when the outer cylinder is turned to a closing direction, and releasing the engagement when the outer cylinder is turned to an opening direction, such that the outer cylinder turns around the rotation cylinder under the engagement releasing condition. By pushing a portion of the lower end part of rotation cylinder, on the other hand, the engagement is released such that the outer cylinder is screwed out from the rotation cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9(1997)-86550 (hereinafter referred to as document 4) discloses a safety cap comprising a cap body having a top wall with a discharge port and a cover hinged to a rear portion of the cap body. An U-shaped locking piece as seen from the above, is provided to a front surface of the cap body, and an operation plate is extending downwardly from a front portion of the cap body through the locking piece and having an upper plate portion for detachable engagement with the locking piece, such that the engagement is released by pushing the lower plate portion of the operation plate to the backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10(1998)-264953 (hereinafter referred to as document 5) and Japanese Patent No. 3273359 (hereinafter referred to as document 6) disclose a safety cap comprising a cap body and a cover hinged to the rear side of the cap body, wherein a generally inverted U-shaped slit is cut in the left and right sides of the circumferential wall of the cap body except its lower end portion to form a stopping piece therein, having an upper end portion which is adapted to be engaged to the remainder of the circumferential wall of the cap body and detachable therefrom by depressing the stopping piece inwardly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The proposals according to the documents 1 to 3 may only apply to the type of the safety cap for screw-fitting on the opened neck portion of the container. On the other hand, in the squeezable container for storing detergent for example, the cap having a cover hinged to its cap body is widely used for facilitating the opening and closing operation, such as disclosed in the document 4. However, since the lower plate portion of operation plate is exposed to the outside as a push button, the appearance of the cap is deteriorated and the dust is apt to be attached to the lower plate portion of the operation plate, which may be disadvantage in accordance with the usage of the cap. To improve this point, the documents 5 and 6 teach to form the stopping piece for maintaining a closing state as a part (the left and right side portions) of the circumferential wall. For opening this cap, it is necessary to press the stopping pieces inwardly of the cap and to push the front portion of the cover to rotate it into an opening direction at the same time. This operation is more complicated to some extent than that of the cap according to the document 4, i.e., pressing the lower plate portion of the operation plate inwardly and then pushing the same upwardly. Although the complexity in its operation contributes to prevent unintentional opening of the cap by the small children (including infants) for example, thereby increasing the cap' childproofness, it is natural that the grown-up user feels it troublesome especially when he or she has to repeat the opening operation for the repeated use of the container under the circumstances there is no chance of unintentional use of the children.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first purpose of the present invention is to provide a safety cap which is useful for the adult, and also resistant to the unintentional or unauthorized use by the children for example.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve this purpose, the present invention proposes</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">a safety cap comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a cap body having a top wall with a discharge spout, and a skirt depending from the top wall;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a cover having an outer tube which is connected to the cap body via a hinge and adapted to fit on an upper part of the skirt;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">at least one stopping piece which is disposed at one side of the skirt, having a proximal end portion fixed to a lower portion of the skirt and a distal end portion, an outer surface of which is able to confront to an inner surface of the outer cylinder, the stopping piece is capable of being pushed inwardly to swing around the proximal end portion;</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">first and second engagement means formed on the outer surface of the distal end portion and the inner surface of the outer tube for providing mutual engagement and cooperating with each other to maintain a closed state of the cover, and for releasing the engagement by pushing the stopping piece inwardly;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">wherein the stopping piece is forcibly movable from an initial position where the first and second engagement means are cooperating with each other to maintain the closed state of the cap, such that the first and second engagement means are separated each other, after being removed from the initial position, allowing an opening of the cover without pushing the stopping piece inwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is desirable that the stopping piece is formed as a portion of the skirt within an inverted U-shaped slit which is cut at one side of the cap body, so as to enable the stopping piece to swing about the proximal end portion to laterally outwardly. This feature contribute to a favorable streamlined appearance of the safety cap as mentioned previously.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is also desirable that the skirt has a pair of stopping pieces which are diametrically opposed to each other and spaced generally equidistantly from the hinge, and that a pair of first engagement means are formed in the stopping pieces respectively, while a pair of second engagement means are formed in the outer tube of the cover corresponding to the first engagement means. In this structure, the cap is able to open only when the both sides of the cap is pressed inwardly at the same time, such that the child resistivity is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Second purpose of the present invention is to provide a safety cap with a stopping piece which is movable between an initial state and a second state.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to achieve this purpose, the present invention proposes</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">a safety cap according to the first purpose, wherein the stopping piece is provided at its outside with a generally U-shaped sliding member having a pair of sliding arms protruding parallel from both ends of an intermediate connecting portion for insertion into a pair of vertical portions of the inverted U-shaped slit,</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">and a pair clicks, each of which is formed on a leading end of the sliding arm and adapted to engage with a margin within the slit on the skirt's side irremovably therefrom, such that the sliding member is adapted to move up and down with respect to the stopping piece, with the intermediate connecting portion being in contact with an outside of the stopping piece,</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">wherein an outer surface of the stopping piece is formed into a slant surface protruding gradually outwardly from the margin within the slit, in approaching from the proximal end of the stopping piece to the distal end thereof, such that the slant surface is pressed inwardly by the intermediate connecting portion when the sliding member is pushed upwards;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">the stopping piece is movable by the up-and-down movement of the sliding member between the initial position where the first and second engagement means are cooperating to maintain the closed state of the cap, and a second position where the first and second engagement means are separate from each other, and does not recover to a mutual engagement state.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The third purpose of the present invention is to provide a safety cap which is not able to recover to its initial state after opening, showing an obvious sign of the unauthorized opening particularly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to achieve this purpose, the present invention proposes a safety cap according to the first or second purpose, wherein a fragile line is formed at a lower part of the stopping piece such that the stopping piece is able to cut off from the cap body so as to leave initial position by breaking the fragile line.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">By the way, as a safety cap adapted to show an obvious sign of illegal opening, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 7-41028 teaches one having cap body, a cover, and a connecting piece formed therebetween, said connecting piece having such a break portion such that it is broken when the cap is opened. However, the cap according to the present invention is distinguished from the prior art in that the cap is opened by pressing the stopping piece inwardly, and the stopping piece is adapted to be removed from the cap only when it is necessary.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> show a first embodiment of the safety cap according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring briefly on the elements of the safety cap which are common with the prior art. Numeral <b>1</b> designates a cap body having a top wall <b>2</b> and a skirt (or an outer circumferential wall) <b>3</b> depending from the perimeter of the top wall. The top wall <b>2</b> is provided at its under side with inner circumferential wall(s) <b>4</b> depending therefrom for fitting to an opened neck portion of a container as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The inner circumferential walls may be a sealing cylinder <b>4</b><i>a </i>for fitting within the opened neck portion, and a holding cylinder <b>4</b><i>b </i>for fitting on the opened neck portion. The upper end portion of the cap body <b>1</b> is preferably formed into a small diameter portion <b>6</b> with a step portion <b>5</b> with its surface directed upwardly being intermediate the upper end portion and the remainder of the cap body <b>1</b>. The top wall <b>2</b> is provided at its front portion with a discharge spout <b>7</b> from which a nozzle is standing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A stopping piece <b>9</b> is formed as a part of the cap body <b>1</b> and adapted to function as a push bottom. It is preferable that a pair of stopping pieces are provided equidistantly from a later-described hinge. In a favorable shown embodiment, each stopping piece is formed by cutting a slit (or a split groove) <b>8</b> on the left and right side portions of the skirt <b>3</b> except the lower end portion of the skirt itself, such that the surface of the stopping pieces and the remainder of the cap body except the stopping pieces are generally flush with (i.e. formed continuously with) each other. The stopping piece <b>9</b> is provided at the outside of its upper end portion with a first engagement means <b>10</b> which is a laterally formed engagement claw in this embodiment. Moreover, in a shown embodiment, the stopping piece <b>9</b> has a skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>which forms a portion of the skirt, and a step corresponding portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>located above the skirt corresponding portion, and a portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>corresponding to a small outer diameter portion, formed above the step corresponding portion <b>5</b><i>a</i>. On the other hand, the slit <b>8</b> may be made wider than it is in the shown embodiment. This construction may be embodied by forming a belt-like window hole <b>11</b> from the perimeter of the top wall <b>2</b> of the cap body <b>11</b> to the lower portion of the skirt <b>3</b>, and by extending the stopping piece <b>9</b> from the lower periphery of the window hole into the same. In this case, the stopping piece <b>9</b> is desirably shaped into a longitudinal plate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An auxiliary cap <b>13</b> is attached to a rear portion of the cap body <b>1</b> through a thin hinge <b>12</b>. The cap <b>13</b> has a top plate <b>15</b>, an outer tube (or circumferential wall) <b>14</b> depending from the perimeter of the top plate <b>15</b> for fitting on the small outer diameter portion <b>6</b>, and a sealing cylinder <b>16</b> depending from the underside of the top plate <b>15</b> for fitting with the nozzle. Upon the rotation of the auxiliary cap <b>13</b> about the hinge <b>12</b>, the outer tube <b>14</b> is fitted to and removed from the small outer diameter portion <b>6</b>, and the sealing cylinder <b>16</b> is fitted to and removed from the outside of the nozzle respectively. Meanwhile, the outer tube <b>14</b> is provided at its left and right sides with a pair of second engagement means <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> which are engagement holes, such that the first engagement means <b>10</b>,<b>10</b> are engaged to the second engagement means <b>18</b>,<b>18</b> to prevent the opening of the cap. On the other hand, the first engagement means <b>10</b>,<b>10</b> may be released from the second engagement means <b>18</b>,<b>18</b> by pressing the upper end portions of the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> inwardly of the cap body <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to elastically deform these pieces, such that the cap can be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cap <b>13</b> may be a so called snap type cover which is automatically turned to a fully opened state or a closed on the both sides of an equilibrium. This type of cap is adapted to be urged toward an opening direction when it is opened to a certain angle (equilibrium), and is urged toward an closing direction when it is closed from the fully opened state to the certain angle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present invention, the skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the stopping piece <b>9</b> has a slant surface <b>19</b> defined by its outer surface. The slant surface <b>19</b> is protruding gradually outward of the inner margin of the skirt <b>3</b> at the slit <b>8</b> in proceeding from the lower end (proximal end) of the stopping piece to the outer upper end (distal end) of the same. In other words, the slant surface <b>19</b> is protruding outwardly from an outline (a circumscribed circle if the skirt is cylinder) C of the skirt <b>3</b> depicted by an imaginary line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the stopping piece <b>9</b> is preferably formed gradually thicker in proceeding from the lower end to the upper end of the skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>such that the outer surface thereof is formed into the slat surface. In this structure, the inside of the upper part of the skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>does not protrude from the circumscribed circle of the skirt <b>3</b>, such that the appearance of the safety cap is not deteriorated when it is used wile a sliding member <b>21</b> being its lowermost position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sliding member <b>21</b> is mounted on the cap body <b>1</b>. It is preferable that the sliding member <b>21</b> is U-shaped as seen from the above as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, comprising a pair of sliding arms (sliding plates) <b>23</b>, <b>23</b> protruding on both ends of an intermediate connecting means (transverse plate) <b>22</b>. A pair of engagement projection <b>24</b>,<b>24</b> preferably formed longitudinally are formed at the outsides of their leading end portions of the sliding arms <b>23</b>,<b>23</b> respectively. The intermediate connecting means <b>22</b> is adapted to fit on the outside of the lower portion of the stopping piece <b>9</b>, while the sliding arms <b>23</b>, <b>23</b> extending through the slit <b>8</b> at the sides of the stopping piece <b>9</b>, and the engagement projections <b>24</b>, <b>24</b> resting on the edges <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the window hole, the inside of the skirt <b>3</b> along the slit <b>8</b> irremovably.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sliding member <b>21</b> is adapted to move between a lower position and an upper position guided by the vertical portions of the slit <b>8</b>. In a shown embodiment, the lower position is defined by the lower end of the skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the stopping piece <b>9</b>, and so is the upper portion defined by the upper end of the skirt corresponding portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>. When the sliding member <b>21</b> is located in the lower position, the stopping piece <b>9</b> is in the initial position where the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> are cooperating each other to maintain the closed state of the safety cap unless the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> are pressed inwardly by the hand of the user or any instrument held by the user. By pushing up the sliding member <b>21</b> from the initial position, the slant surface <b>19</b> is pressed inwardly by the intermediate connecting means <b>22</b>, such that the first engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>10</b> are removed by the second engagement means <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>, and that the stopping piece <b>9</b> shifts from the initial position to the second position, where the cooperation of the first and second engagement <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> is dissolved. Namely, the first and second engagement <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> are separated each other without pressing the stopping piece <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above-mentioned construction, when the user wishes to use the cap according to this invention as a safety cap, the sliding member <b>21</b> is to be depressed to the lower position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this state, the cap <b>13</b> is unable to open unless pressing the upper portions of the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> inwardly of the cap body, since the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>,<b>18</b> are engaged together. Accordingly, the children are not able to open the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For releasing the safety function of the cap, the sliding member <b>21</b> is to be lift up to the upper position. As a result, the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> are pressed inwardly, with the stopping pieces to achieve the second position of the cap, such that the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>,<b>18</b> are normally separated and the cap is opened and closed without operation of the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 12</figref> shows a second embodiment of the safety cap according to the present invention. Hereinafter, the explanation on the construction equivalent to that of the first embodiment, designating by the same numeral.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the second embodiment, the stopping piece <b>9</b> is capable of being torn off (or cut off) from the cap body <b>1</b>, such that the tearing operation releases the stopping piece <b>9</b> from the initial position where the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> are cooperating to maintain the closed state. Namely, corresponding to the second position in the first embodiment, the stopping piece <b>9</b> is separated completely from the cap body <b>1</b>, being transferred to an arbitrary position where the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> are released from cooperative relationship and does not recover its mutual engagement elastically as they do in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The stopping piece <b>9</b> tearable from the cap body <b>1</b> may be embodied in many ways, for example by forming a thin weaken line or partly-cut line as a breaking line L in the cap body <b>1</b>. These weaken line or partly-cut line are formed at the lower end of the stopping piece <b>9</b> in the shown embodiment, but they may be formed at any other suitable place.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stopping piece <b>9</b> is provided at its upper portion with an engagement projection(s) <b>20</b> which protrudes laterally from one side thereof and is adapted to engage with the inside of the skirt <b>3</b> after riding it over. The engagement projection <b>20</b> prevents the stopping piece <b>9</b> from inclining outwardly, but allows inward thrusting of the stopping piece <b>9</b> for releasing the engagement of the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When forming the cap body <b>1</b> as mentioned above, it is molded in a state that the stopping piece <b>9</b> is laid laterally outward of the skirt <b>3</b>, and after the molding the stopping piece <b>9</b> is turned to an upright posture against its elasticity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and the engagement projections <b>20</b>, <b>20</b> ride over the skirt <b>3</b> to engage therewith. In this structure, each stopping piece <b>9</b> is usually urged to turn outwardly, the engagement projections <b>20</b>, <b>20</b> are engageably stopped, so as to prevent the rattling of the stopping pieces <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, numerals <b>17</b>, <b>17</b> designate a pair of elastic plates positioned at both sides of the hinge <b>12</b> for connecting the lower end of the outer tube <b>14</b> and the upper end of the cap body <b>1</b> at their respective rear portions.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The cap according to this embodiment can be used by pressing both of the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> inwardly for releasing the first engagement means <b>10</b> from the second engagement means <b>18</b>, and then opening the cap <b>13</b> for distributing the liquid, as it does in the first embodiment. The cap is sufficiently resistant to the children's use or the unauthorized use, because the opening of the cap requires to release the engagement of the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b>, and to take the opening operation of the cover <b>3</b> while keeping the unengaged state of the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b>. After the use of the cap, the cap <b>13</b> can be closed by fitting the first and second engagement means <b>10</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, when there is no room for the unauthorized use of the cap, the engagement projections <b>20</b>, <b>20</b> are to be rode over the inner edge <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the window hole to pull the stopping piece <b>9</b> out of the cap body <b>1</b>, such that the stopping pieces <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> may be torn off from the cap body. After that the cap can be opened immediately.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Meanwhile, the sliding member <b>21</b> in the first embodiment and the breaking line L for tearing off the stopping piece are functionally different, but it is possible to form both of the sliding member <b>21</b> and breaking line in the stopping pieces in one safety cap.</p>
