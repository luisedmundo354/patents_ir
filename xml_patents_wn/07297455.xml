<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a toner used in image forming processes such as electrophotography, electrostatic printing, toner jet recording and magnetic recording, and an image forming method making use of the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the spread of electrophotographic full-color image forming apparatus, a great variety of their uses have been developed, and a demand for image quality have now come severer. In the copying or printing of images such as catalogues and maps, the details thereof are required to be reproduced finely and faithfully. With such demands, a demand for the sharpness of colors also has been heightened, and it is desired to extend the range of color reproduction. In particular, in these days the advance of electrophotographic apparatus into the field of printing is marked, and also in electrophotographic systems, it has been required that colofulness, minuteness and graininess of image characteristics are improved to be at a level not lower than those in printing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, in full-color image forming apparatus such as full-color copying machines having been proposed, commonly used are, e.g., a method in which, using a plurality of photosensitive members, electrostatic latent images formed respectively on the photosensitive members are developed with a cyan toner, a magenta toner, a yellow toner and a black toner to form corresponding toner images and then a transfer material is transported between the photosensitive members and a belt-like transfer member to transfer the toner images thereto in a straight pass, followed by fixing to form a full-color image, and a method in which the transfer material is wound around the surface of a cylindrical transfer member set opposite to a photosensitive member, by the aid of electrostatic force or by mechanical action of a gripper or the like, and the steps of development and transfer are carried out four times to obtain a full-color image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Toners used in these full-color image forming apparatus such as full-color copying machines are required to be sufficiently color-mixed and be heat-fixed to a transfer material in the step of heat-and-pressure fixing, without damaging color reproducibility and transparency of overhead projector (OHP) images.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To meet such requirements, as binder resins used in toner particles, it is preferable to use resins having higher sharp-melt properties. In recent years, polyester resins are used as the resins having sharp-melt properties. As polymerization catalysts used for the production of polyester resins used in the binder resins of toner particles, tin type catalysts such as dibutyltin oxide and antimony type catalysts such as antimony trioxide have been in common use. These techniques are still not fully satisfactory because fixing performance such as low-temperature fixing performance or high-temperature anti-offset properties and color reproducibility such as color mixing performance or transparency are important as performances of toners in order to satisfy functions such as high speed, high image quality and high minuteness which are demanded in the full-color image forming apparatus such as copying machines for full-color images.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 2002-148867 and No. 2001-64378, techniques are disclosed in which titanates of aromatic diols are used as polymerization catalysts or solid titanium compounds are used as polymerization catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These proposals still have problems on fixing performance, color reproducibility and developing performance in some cases, and further improvement is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The use of the resins having sharp-melt properties usually tends to bring about a problem on high-temperature anti-offset properties because binder resins have a low self cohesive force when toners melt in the step of heat-and-pressure fixing. Accordingly, in order to improve the high-temperature anti-offset properties at the time of fixing, relatively highly crystalline waxes as typified by polyethylene wax and polypropylene wax are used as release agents.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, especially in toners used in full-color images, because of such a high crystallizability of the release agents themselves and a difference in refractive index between toners and OHP sheet materials, the transparency may be damaged when projected through OHPs, resulting in a low chroma or brightness of projected images.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, in order to solve such problems, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H4-149559 and No. H4-107467, a method is proposed in which a nucleating agent and a wax are used in combination to lower the crystallizability of the wax. As also disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H4-301858 and No. H5-61238, a method is further proposed in which a wax having low crystallinity is used. As other waxes, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H1-185660 and No. H1-238672, it is proposed to use montan type waxes as waxes having relatively good transparency and low melting points. These waxes, however, are not those which can satisfy all the transparency on OHPs, the low-temperature fixing performance at the time of heat-and-pressure fixing and the high-temperature anti-offset properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to solve the above problems and to provide a toner having superior fixing performance and high-temperature anti-offset properties, and an image forming method making use of the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide a toner improved in the dispersibility of colorant in toner particles and having superior color reproducibility such as color mixing performance or transparency, and an image forming method making use of the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a toner which is superior in the running (extensive operation) stability of chargeability and can form images having high quality, and an image forming method making use of the toner.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, in the present invention, as the catalyst used in synthesizing the polyester unit, two types or more of compounds may be used which are selected from the group consisting of the titanium chelate compound having a structure represented by any of the above Formulas (I) to (VI), and a hydrate of the titanium chelate compound.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The use of the resin having a polyester unit according to the present invention improves the dispersibility of colorant in toner particles, so that a toner can be obtained having superior color reproducibility such as toner color mixing performance or transparency in fixed images and also has a high covering power on transfer materials. This is effective especially when pigment contents are large as in a colorant master batch. The above effect can be brought about because the resin according to the present invention has been synthesized using the titanium chelate compound as a catalyst. The reason therefor is presumed to be that the presence of the titanium chelate compound in the toner increases affinity for the colorant to bring about the effect of improving the dispersibility of colorant in the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the titanium chelate compound used in the present invention, it is preferable that the ligand is a dicarboxylic acid or an oxycarboxylic acid. Of these, it is particularly preferable that the ligand is an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or an aliphatic oxycarboxylic acid. Aliphatic-type ligands have a stronger catalytic activity than aromatic-type ligands, and are preferred in view of the shortening of reaction time and the control of temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The ligand may specifically include, as the dicarboxylic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid and maleic acid; and, as the oxycarboxylic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, hydroxyacrylic acid, α-oxybutyric acid, glyceric acid, tartronic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In particular, in the titanium chelate compound, the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>′, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>′, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>′, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>4</sub>′ in the above Formulas (I), (III), (IV) and (VI) may each be an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an alkenylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. This is preferable in view of development stability. It is also preferable that the titanium chelate compound is a compound represented by the above Formula (I), (II), (IV) or (VI) or a hydrate thereof. This is preferable because the toner can have superior running stability of chargeability to form images having maintained high image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As the counter cation M in Formulas (I) to (VI), an alkali metal is preferred, and the alkali metal may include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium. Of these, preferred are lithium, sodium and potassium, and particularly preferred are sodium and potassium.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The titanium chelate compound and the hydrate of the titanium chelate compound may each be added in an amount of from 0.01% by weight or more to 2% by weight or less, and more preferably from 0.05% by weight or more to 1% by weight or less, as the total sum based on the weight of the polyester unit. If added in an amount of less than 0.01% by weight, the reaction time may be lengthened when the polyester is produced by polymerization and also the effect of improving the dispersibility of colorant may not be obtained. If on the other hand added in an amount of more than 2% by weight, the charging performance of the toner may be affected, tending to increase variation of charge quantity depending on environment.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the toner of the present invention, besides the titanium chelate compounds and the hydrate of the titanium chelate compounds, a promoter also may optionally be used.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As the promoter, titanium chelate compounds of different types may be added, and preferably used are compounds of elements such as beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium barium, titanium, zirconium, manganese, cobalt, zinc, boron, aluminum, gallium, phosphor and tin. As examples of the compounds of these elements, preferably used are fatty acid salts (such as acetates), carbonates, sulfates and nitrates, or alkoxide salts, or halides (such as chlorides), or acetylacetonato salts or oxides.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Of these, preferred are acetates, carbonates, alkoxide salts, halides or acetylacetonato salts, particularly titanium alkoxide, titanium tetrachloride, zirconium alkoxide, magnesium carbonate or magnesium acetate.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The use of such a promoter is preferable because coexistence with the titanium chelate compound and/or the hydrate of the titanium chelate compound allows polycondensation reaction to proceed quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Any of these promoters may be used in an amount ranging from 0.01% by weight to 200% by weight based on the total weight of the titanium chelate compound and/or the hydrate of the titanium chelate compound.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The resin having a polyester unit according to the present invention may preferably have, in a molecular weight distribution as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), a main peak in the region of molecular weight of from 3,500 to 15,000, and more preferably in the region of molecular weight of from 4,000 to 13,000. The resin having a polyester unit according to the present invention may likewise preferably have, in a molecular weight distribution as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), a ratio of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average molecular weight (Mn), Mw/Mn, of 3.0 or more, and more preferably 5.0 or more. If the resin has a main peak in the region of molecular weight of less than 3,500, the toner may have insufficient high-temperature anti-offset properties. If on the other hand it has a main peak in the region of molecular weight of more than 15,000, the toner may have insufficient low-temperature fixing performance and also may have low OHP transparency. If the resin has an Mw/Mn of less than 3.0, anti-offset properties is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The resin having a polyester unit according to the present invention may also preferably have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of from 40° C. to 90° C., and the resin having a polyester unit according to the present invention may have a softening temperature (Tm) of from 80° C. to 150° C., which is preferable in order to achieve all of the storage stability, the low-temperature fixing performance, the high-temperature anti-offset properties and the dispersibility of colorant.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The resin having a polyester unit may also have an acid value of less than 50 mg·KOH/g. This is preferable in order to improve the development running performance and the dispersibility of colorant.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The toner of the present invention is characterized by containing a wax.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the present invention, the resin having a polyester unit, synthesized using as a catalyst the titanium chelate compound having the specific structure, is used in combination with the wax. This leads color reproducibility on the transfer material to be improved. In particular, images having high brightness and chroma can be obtained without degrading the transparency in OHP images. Also, the toner can achieve both the low-temperature fixing performance and the anti-offset properties. The reason therefor is presumed to be that in toner particles, the titanium chelate compound uniformly dispersed in the resin acts as a nucleating agent of the wax when the wax is dispersed by melt kneading in the presence of the titanium chelate compound, and hence the dispersibility of the wax can be improved. As the result, in the toner particles, the state of fine dispersion of the wax can be achieved, so that the images having high brightness and chroma can be obtained without making poor the transparency in OHP images.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Examples of the wax used in the present invention may include the following: aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes such as low-molecular weight polyethylene, low-molecular weight polypropylene, alkylene copolymers, microcrystalline wax, paraffin wax and Fischer-Tropsch wax; oxides of aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes, such as polyethylene oxide wax, or block copolymers of these; waxes composed chiefly of a fatty ester, such as carnauba wax, behenyl behenate wax and montanate wax, or those obtained by subjecting part or the whole of fatty esters to deoxidizing treatment, such as dioxidized carnauba wax. It may further include saturated straight-chain fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid and montanic acid; unsaturated fatty acids such as brassidic acid, eleostearic acid and parinaric acid; saturated alcohols such as stearyl alcohol, aralkyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, carnaubyl alcohol, ceryl alcohol and melissyl alcohol; polyhydric alcohols such as sorbitol; esters of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid and montanic acid with alcohols such as stearyl alcohol, aralkyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, carnaubyl alcohol, seryl alcohol and melissyl alcohol; fatty acid amides such as linolic acid amide, oleic acid amide and lauric acid amide; saturated fatty acid bisamides such as methylene bis(stearic acid amide), ethylene bis(capric acid amide), ethylene bis(lauric acid amide) and hexamethylene bis(stearic acid amide); unsaturated fatty acid amides such as ethylene bis(oleic acid amide), hexamethylene bis(oleic acid amide), N,N′-dioleyladipic acid amide and N,N′-dioleylsebasic acid amide; aromatic bisamides such as m-xylene bisstearic acid amide and N,N′-distearylisophthalic acid amide; fatty acid metal salts (those commonly called metal soap) such as calcium stearate, calcium laurate, zinc stearate and magnesium stearate; waxes grafted using vinyl monomers such as styrene and acrylic acid, to fatty acid hydrocarbon waxes; partially esterified products of polyhydric alcohols with fatty acids, such as monoglyceride behenate; and methyl esterified products having a hydroxyl group, obtained by hydrogenation of vegetable fats and oils.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Waxes particularly preferably usable in the present invention may include aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes, and esterified products which are esters of fatty acids with alcohols. For example, preferred are low-molecular weight alkylene polymers obtained by polymerizing alkylenes by radical polymerization under high pressure, or by polymerization under low pressure in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst or a metallocene catalyst; alkylene polymers obtained by thermal decomposition of high-molecular weight alkylene polymers; and synthetic hydrocarbon waxes obtained from, or by hydrogenation of, distillation residues of hydrocarbons obtained by the Arge process from synthetic gases containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Hydrocarbon waxes fractionated by using press sweating, solvent fractionation or vacuum distillation, or by a fractionation recrystallization method may more preferably be used.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The hydrocarbons, serving as a matrix, may include those synthesized by reacting carbon monoxide with hydrogen in the presence of a metal oxide type catalyst (preferably, two or more kinds of multinary metal oxide type catalysts), as exemplified by hydrocarbon compounds obtained by the Synthol process or the Hydrocol process (making use of a fluidized catalyst bed); hydrocarbons having about several hundred carbon atoms, obtained by the Arge process (making use of a fixed catalyst bed) which can obtain waxy hydrocarbons in a large quantity; and hydrocarbons obtained by polymerization of alkylenes such as ethylene in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst; all of which are preferable as having less and small branches and being saturated long straight chain hydrocarbons. In particular, waxes synthesized by the method not relying on the polymerization of alkylenes are preferred in view of their molecular weight distribution. Paraffin wax may also preferably be used.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The wax used in the present invention may preferably have, in an endothermic curve in measurement by differential thermal analysis (or differential scanning calorimetry DSC), a maximum endothermic peak in the range of temperature of from 30° C. to 200° C. and a peak temperature thereof in the range of from 60° C. to 130° C., more preferably in the range of from 65° C. to 125° C., and still more preferably in the range of from 65° C. to 110° C.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Where the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is in the range of from 60° C. to 130° C., the state of appropriate fine dispersion of the wax in toner particles can be achieved, and this is preferable in order to bring out the effect of the present invention. Meanwhile, if the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is less than 60° C., the toner may have poor anti-offset properties. If on the other hand the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is more than 130° C., the toner tends to have poor fixing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The toner of the present invention has a light transmittance (%) of 600 nm wavelength light from 10% to 70%, more preferably from 10% to 60%, and still more preferably from 15% to 50%, in an aqueous solution containing methanol 45 vol. %.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The toner of the present invention has the wax incorporated in the toner particles, and hence the wax is present at least on the toner particle surfaces. If the wax is present at the toner particle surfaces in a small quantity, the release effect at the time of fixing may be difficult to bring about, lowering low-temperature fixing performance desired from the viewpoint of energy saving. If on the other hand the wax is present on the toner particle surfaces in a large quantity, the wax may contaminate charge-providing members. For example, it may melt-adhere onto the developing sleeve to increase the electric resistance of the sleeve high-resistance and reduce the effect of actual development bias for the development, lowering image density, and as a result, development running performance (or development durability) deteriorates in some cases. Thus, when the toner particles are incorporated with the wax, it is important to control the quantity of the wax at the toner particle surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Accordingly, in the present invention, the resin having a polyester unit, synthesized using as a catalyst the titanium chelate compound, is used in combination with the wax, whereby the state of fine dispersion of the wax in toner particles can be achieved to make it possible to control the quantity of the wax at the toner particle surfaces even when the wax is added in a large quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The quantity of the wax at the toner particle surfaces can be measured simply and in a high precision, by measuring transmittance (%) of light in a liquid dispersion prepared by dispersing the toner in an aqueous solution of 45% by volume of methanol.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">This measuring method can accurately find the quantity of the wax at the toner particle surfaces, by compelling toner particles to disperse into a methanol-water mixed solvent to make it easy to specify particle by particle the quantity of the wax at the toner surfaces, and measuring the transmittance after a certain time has passed.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">That is, when the wax, which is hydrophobic, is present at the toner particle surfaces in a large quantity, the toner standing dispersed cannot be easily wetted by the solvent and does not settle, and hence the transmittance comes to be as large as 70%. On the other hand, when the wax is present at the toner particle surfaces in a small quantity, such a resin as containing the polyester unit is present in a large quantity has so strong a polarity as to exhibit hydrophilicity, where the toner is uniformly dispersed in the 45 vol % methanol aqueous solution, so that the transmittance comes to be as small as 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The toner of the present invention may also preferably have, in an endothermic curve as measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), a maximum endothermic peak in the range of temperature of from 30° C. to 200° C. and a peak temperature thereof in the range of from 60° C. to 130° C., more preferably in the range of from 65° C. to 125° C., and still more preferably in the range of from 65° C. to 110° C.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">By the use of the resin having a polyester unit, synthesized using the titanium chelate compound according to the present as a catalyst, the state of appropriate fine dispersion of the wax in toner particles can be realized when the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is in the range of from 60° C. to 130° C., which is preferable in order to bring out the effect of the present invention. Meanwhile, if the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is less than 60° C., the toner may have poor anti-offset properties. If on the other hand the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is more than 130° C., the toner tends to be inferior in fixing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The wax may be used in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, and preferably from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the binder resin.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The toner of the present invention may further preferably have, in molecular weight distribution of its resin component as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), a main peak in the molecular weight region of from 3,500 to 15,000, and more preferably in the molecular weight region of from 4,000 to 13,000. The ratio of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average molecular weight (Mn), Mw/Mn, is preferably 3.0 or more, and more preferably 5.0 or more. If the toner has a main peak in the molecular weight region of less than 3,500, the toner may have insufficient high-temperature anti-offset properties. If on the other hand it has a main peak in the molecular weight region of more than 15,000, the toner may have no sufficient low-temperature fixing performance and also may have low OHP transparency. If the Mw/Mn is less than 3.0, good anti-offset properties cannot be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As the colorant used in the toner of the present invention, any known dyes and/or pigments may be used. A pigment may be used alone, but in view of image quality of full-color images, it is more preferable to use a dye and a pigment in combination so that the color sharpness can be improved. Examples of dyes and pigments used as the colorant are given below.</p>

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Where the resin according to the present invention is used and the colorant is made into the master batch, the dispersibility of colorant does not deteriorate even when the colorant is used in a large quantity, and also the dispersibility of colorant in toner particles is improved to bring about superior color reproducibility such as color mixing performance or transparency. Also, a toner having a large covering power on the transfer material can be obtained. Still also, since the dispersibility of colorant is improved, the toner can have superior running stability of chargeability to form images having maintained high image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the toner, the colorant may be used in an amount of from 0.1 to 15 parts by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 12 parts by weight, and still more preferably from 2 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the binder resin. The use of the colorant in such a quantity is preferable in view of color reproducibility and developing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A known charge control agent may be used in the toner of the present invention in order to make the chargeability stable. Usually, the charge control agent may preferably be contained in toner particles in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, which may differ depending on the type of the charge control agent or the physical properties of toner particle constituent materials. Such a charge control agent is known to include one capable of controlling the toner to be negatively chargeable and one capable of controlling the toner to be positively chargeable. One or more types of various charge control agents may be used according to types and uses of toner.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As negative charge control agents, usable are salicylic acid metal compounds, naphthoic acid metal compounds, dicarboxylic acid metal compounds, polymer type compounds having sulfonic acid or carboxylic acid in the side chain, boron compounds, urea compounds, silicon compounds, and carixarene. As positive charge control agents, usable are quaternary ammonium salts, polymer type compounds having such a quaternary ammonium salt in the side chain, guanidine compounds, and imidazole compounds. The charge control agent may internally be added, or may externally be added, to the toner particles.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Where the toner of the present invention is used, it is preferable for the toner to contain an aromatic carboxylic acid metal compound. The aromatic carboxylic acid metal compound is preferable because it is colorless, can quickly charge the toner and can stably maintain a constant charge quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The toner of the present invention is characterized by having at least inorganic fine particles. Also, it is preferable for the inorganic fine particles to be at least one of fine titanium oxide particles and fine silica particles.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The fine titanium oxide particles used in the present invention may include sulfuric acid process titanium compounds, chlorine process titanium compounds and volatile titanium compounds, as exemplified by fine titanium oxide particles produced by low-temperature oxidation (such as thermal decomposition or hydrolysis) of titanium alkoxides, titanium halides or acetylacetonatotitanium.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Crystal forms of the fine titanium oxide particles may be anatase type, rutile type, mixed-crystal form of these, or amorphous, any of which may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The present inventors have discovered that, in the toner of the present invention which makes use of the resin having a polyester unit, synthesized using the titanium chelate compound, the incorporation of the fine titanium oxide particles is very effective in achieving charge stability during running (extensive operation), in particular, charge stability in a low-humidity environment. The reason therefor is that, when the toner of the present invention which makes use of the resin having a polyester unit, synthesized using the titanium chelate compound, is incorporated with the fine titanium oxide particles, the fine titanium oxide particles show substantially neutral chargeability, and hence they bring about the effect of restraining charge-up especially in a low-humidity environment.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The toner of the present invention may also preferably be incorporated with fine silica particles in view of charge quantity control.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Fine silica particles used preferably in the present invention include the so-called dry-process silica or fumed silica produced by vapor phase oxidation of silicon halides and the so-called wet-process silica produced from water glass. The dry-process silica is preferred, as having less silanol groups on the surfaces and insides of the fine silica particles and leaving less production residues such as Na<sub>2</sub>O and SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>. In the dry-process silica, it is also possible to use, in its production step, other metal halide compounds such as aluminum chloride or titanium chloride together with the silicon halide to give composite fine powder of silica with other metal oxides. The fine silica particles include these as well.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The so-called dry-process silica or fumed silica is produced by a conventionally known technique. For example, it is a process that utilizes heat decomposition oxidation reaction in oxyhydrogen frame of silicon tetrachloride gas. The reaction basically proceeds as follows.

</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the alkylalkoxysilane compound, if n is larger than 12, though hydrophobicity can be sufficient, inorganic fine particles may greatly coalesce one another to tend to have low fluidity-providing ability.

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The hydrophobic treatment may be carried out using one kind of hydrophobic-treating agent alone, or using two or more kinds of hydrophobic-treating agents. For example, the hydrophobic treatment may be made using one kind of hydrophobic-treating agent alone or using two kinds of hydrophobic-treating agents together, or may made by using one hydrophobic-treating agent and thereafter using another hydrophobic-treating agent.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The fine titanium oxide particles and/or the fine silica particles may preferably be added in an amount of from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, and preferably from 0.05 to 3 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the toner particles.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Further, the toner according to the present invention may be constituted as either a non-magnetic toner or a magnetic toner.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The toner of the present invention may be used in either of one-component developers and two-component developers. When used in the two-component developers, the toner is used in the form of a blend with a carrier. As the carrier, usable are known carriers such as magnetic-material particles per se, a coated carrier comprising magnetic-material particles coated with a resin, and a magnetic-material-dispersed resin carrier comprising magnetic-material particles dispersed in resin particles. As the magnetic-material particles, usable are, e.g., particles of metals such as iron, lithium, calcium, magnesium, nickel, copper, zinc, cobalt, manganese, chromium and rare earth elements, which may be surface-oxidized or non-oxidized, and alloys or oxide particles of any of these, and ferrite particles.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The coated carrier comprising carrier particles surface-coated with a resin is particularly preferred in developing methods in which an AC bias is applied to a developing sleeve. Methods for coating the carrier particle surfaces may include a method in which a coating fluid prepared by dissolving or suspending a coating material such as a resin in a solvent is applied to the surfaces of magnetic carrier core particles, and a method in which the magnetic carrier core particles and the coating material are mixed in the form of powder.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The coating material applied on the surfaces of magnetic carrier core particles may include silicone resins, polyester resins, styrene resins, acrylic resins, polyamide, polyvinyl butyral, aminoacrylate resins and fluorine resins. Any of these may be used alone or in combination. In the treatment with the coating material, the coating material may preferably be used in an amount of from 0.1% by weight to 30% by weight, and more preferably from 0.5 to 20% by weight, based on the weight of the carrier core particles. Such magnetic carrier core particles may have a number-average particle diameter of from 10 μm to 100 μm, and more preferably from 20 μm to 70 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The number-average particle diameter of the magnetic carrier core particles can be determined as follows: at least 300 carrier particles of 0.1 μm or more in diameter are picked out at random with a scanning electron microscope (100 to 5,000 magnifications), and their horizontal-direction Fere's diameters are measured as carrier particle diameters by means of a digitizer to calculate therefrom the number-average particle diameter of the carrier core particles.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">When the two-component developer is prepared by blending the toner of the present invention and the magnetic carrier, they may preferably be blended in a proportion of from 2% by weight to 15% by weight, and more preferably from 4% by weight to 13% by weight, as toner concentration in the developer in order to obtain good images. If the toner concentration is less than 2% by weight, image density tends to lower. If it is more than 15% by weight, fog or in-machine toner scatter tends to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The procedure of producing the toner is described below. The toner of the present invention may be produced by mixing the binder resin, the colorant, the wax and any desired materials, melt-kneading the mixture obtained, and cooling and pulverizing the kneaded product, optionally followed by spherical treatment or classification of the pulverized product, and further optionally followed by mixing a fluidity-providing agent with the resultant product.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the step of mixing the raw materials, at least the resin and the colorant are weighed and compounded as toner internal additives in stated quantities, and mixed. As examples of a mixer therefor, it includes Doublecon Mixer, a V-type mixer, a drum type mixer, Super mixer, Henschel mixer and Nauta mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Further, the toner raw materials compounded and mixed in the above step are melt-kneaded to melt resins and the colorant is dispersed therein. Batch type kneaders such as a pressure kneader and Banbury mixer, or continuous-type kneaders may be used in that melt-kneading step. In recent years, single-screw or twin-screw extruders are prevailing because of an advantage of continuous production. For example, the following are commonly used: a KTK-type extruder manufactured by Kobe Steel, Ltd., a TEM-type mixer manufactured by Toshiba Machine Co., Ltd.), a twin-screw extruder manufactured by KCK Co., and a co-kneader manufactured by Coperion Buss Ag. A colored resin composition obtained by melt-kneading the toner raw materials is further melt-kneaded, and thereafter rolled out by means of a twin-roll mill or the like, followed by cooling through a cooling step where the kneaded colored resin composition is cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Then, in general, the cooled product of the colored resin composition thus obtained is subsequently pulverized in a pulverization step into a product having the desired particle diameter. In the pulverization step, the cooled colored resin composition is first crushed by means of a grinding machine such as a crusher, a hammer mill or a feather mill, and is further pulverized by means of a pulverizer such as a Criptron system manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. or a super rotor manufactured by Nisshin Engineering Inc. Thereafter, the pulverized product obtained is optionally classified using a sifting machine, e.g., a classifier such as Elbow Jet (manufactured by Nittetsu Mining Co., Ltd.), which is of an inertial classification system, or Turboplex (manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Corporation), which is of a centrifugal classification system, obtaining a classified product with a weight-average particle diameter of from 3 μm to 11 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The classified product may optionally be subjected to surface modification and spherical treatment by means of a hybridization system manufactured by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd. or a mechanofusion system manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Corporation. In such a case, a sifting machine such as an air sifter High Bolter (manufactured by Shin Tokyo Kikai K. K.). As a method for external addition treatment with an external additive such as inorganic fine particles, a method is available in which the classified toner and known various external additives are compounded in stated quantities and then agitated and mixed using as an external addition machine a high-speed agitator which provide powder with shear force, such as the Henschel mixer or Super mixer.</p>

<p id="p-0194" num="0198">In addition, the measuring instrument FPIA-2100 used in the present invention calculates the circularity of each particle and thereafter calculates the average circularity, where, according to circularities obtained, particles are divided into classes in which circularities of from 0.4 to 1.0 are equally divided at intervals of 0.01, and the average circularity is calculated using the divided-point center values and the number of particles measured.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0199">Referring to a specific way of measurement, 10 ml of ion-exchanged water from which impurity solid matter or the like has been removed is made ready in a container, and a surface active agent, preferably alkylbenzenesulfonate, is added thereto as a dispersant. Thereafter, a sample for measurement is further added in an amount of 0.02 g, and is uniformly dispersed. As a means for dispersing it, an ultrasonic dispersion mixer “TETORAL 50 Model” (manufactured by Nikkaki Bios Co.) is used, and dispersion treatment is carried out for 2 minutes to prepare a liquid dispersion for measurement, where the liquid dispersion is appropriately cooled so that its temperature does not come to 40° C. or more. Also, in order to keep the circularity from scattering, the flow type particle analyzer FPIA-2100 is installed in an environment controlled to 23° C.±0.5° C. so that its in-machine temperature can be kept at 26 to 27° C., and autofocus adjustment is performed using 2 μm latex particles at intervals of constant time, and preferably at intervals of 2 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0200">In measuring the circularity of the toner, the above flow type particle analyzer is used and the concentration of the liquid dispersion is again so controlled that the toner concentration at the time of measurement is 3,000 to 10,000 particles/μl, where 1,000 or more toner particles are measured. After the measurement, using the data obtained, the data of particles with a circle-corresponding diameter of less than 2 μm are cut, and the average circularity of the toner is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0201">As compared with “FPIA-1000” used conventionally to calculate the shape of toner particles, the measuring instrument “FPIA-2100” used in the present invention has been improved in precision of measurement of toner particle shapes because of an improvement in magnification of processed particle images and also an improvement in processing resolution of images captured (from 256×256 to 512×512), and therefore having achieved surer capture of finer particles. Accordingly, where the particle shapes must be more accurately measured as in the present invention, FPIA-2100 is more useful.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0202">Where the toner has an average circularity of from 0.930 to 0.990, deterioration in the external additives such as inorganic fine particles may be reduced, and good images can also be obtained in running (extensive operation).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0203">If the toner has an average circularity of less than 0.930, the external additives such as inorganic fine particles may greatly deteriorate, and good images may be difficult to obtain in running (extensive operation). If on the other hand the toner has an average circularity of more than 0.990, the spherical treatment must be carried out in excess to obtain such a toner, and the heat generated in such treatment may exude onto toner particle surfaces in excess to tend to contaminate members coming into contact with the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0204">An example of the image forming method of the present invention is more specifically described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0205"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates the constitution of an example of an image forming apparatus which can practice the image forming method of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0206">This image forming apparatus is set up as a full-color copying machine. The full-color copying machine has, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a digital color-image reader section <b>35</b> at the top and a digital color-image printer section <b>36</b> at the lower part.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0207">In the image reader section, an original <b>30</b> is placed on an original-setting glass <b>31</b>, and an exposure lamp <b>32</b> is put into exposure scanning, whereby an optical image reflected from the original <b>30</b> is focused on a full-color sensor <b>34</b> through a lens <b>33</b> to obtain color separation image signals. The color separation image signals are processed by a video processing unit (not shown) through an amplifying circuit (not shown), and then forwarded to the digital color-image printer section.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0208">In the image printer section <b>36</b>, a photosensitive drum <b>1</b> as an image bearing member is a photosensitive member formed of, e.g., an organic photoconductor, and is supported rotatably in the direction of an arrow. Around the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, a pre-exposure lamp <b>11</b>, a corona charging assembly <b>2</b> as a primary charging assembly, a laser exposure optical system <b>3</b> as a latent image forming means, a potential sensor <b>12</b>, four different-color developing assemblies <b>4</b>Y, <b>4</b>C, <b>4</b>M and <b>4</b>K, a detecting means <b>13</b> for detecting the amount of light on the drum, a transfer assembly <b>5</b>A as a transfer means and a cleaner <b>6</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0209">In the laser exposure optical system <b>3</b>, the image signals sent from the reader section <b>35</b> are converted into optical signals for image scanning exposure in a laser output section (not shown). The laser light thus converted is reflected on a polygonal mirror <b>3</b><i>a </i>and projected on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> through a lens <b>3</b><i>b </i>and a mirror <b>3</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0210">In the printer section <b>36</b>, the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is rotated in the direction of an arrow at the time of image formation. The photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is, after destaticized by the pre-exposure lamp <b>11</b>, uniformly negatively charged by means of the charging assembly <b>2</b>, and then irradiated with an optical image E for each separated color to form a latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0211">Next, a stated developing assembly is operated to develop the latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> to form on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> a visible image formed of a negatively chargeable toner composed basically of resin, i.e., a toner image. The developing assemblies <b>4</b>Y, <b>4</b>C, <b>4</b>M and <b>4</b>K are alternately come close to the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> in accordance with the respective separated colors by the operation of eccentric cams <b>24</b>Y, <b>24</b>C, <b>24</b>M and <b>24</b>K, respectively, to perform development.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0212">The transfer assembly <b>5</b>A has a transfer drum <b>5</b>, a transfer charging assembly <b>5</b><i>b</i>, an attraction charging assembly <b>5</b><i>c </i>for attracting a recording material electrostatically, and an attraction roller <b>5</b><i>g </i>provided opposite to the assembly <b>5</b><i>c</i>, an inside charging assembly <b>5</b><i>d</i>, an outside charging assembly <b>5</b><i>e </i>and a separation charging assembly <b>5</b><i>h</i>. The transfer drum <b>5</b> is supported on a shaft so that it can be rotatably driven, and has a transfer sheet <b>5</b><i>f </i>serving as a recording material holding member that holds the recording material (transfer material) at an open zone on the periphery thereof; the transfer sheet <b>5</b><i>f </i>being provided on a cylinder under integral adjustment. As the transfer sheet <b>5</b><i>f</i>, polycarbonate film or the like is used.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0213">The recording material is transported from a cassette <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>or <b>7</b><i>c </i>to the transfer drum <b>5</b> through a transfer sheet transport system, and is held on the transfer sheet <b>5</b><i>f</i>. Following the rotation of the transfer drum <b>5</b>, the recording material held on the transfer drum <b>5</b> is repeatedly transported to the transfer position facing the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. While it passes the transfer position, the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is transferred to the recording material by the action of the transfer charging assembly <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0214">The above steps of image formation are repeatedly carried out for yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K), thus a color toner image formed by transferring and superimposing four-color toner images is obtained on the recording material held on the transfer drum <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0215">In the case of one-side image formation, the recording material to which the four-color toner images have been thus transferred is separated from the transfer drum <b>5</b> by the action of a separation claw <b>8</b><i>a</i>, a separation push-up roller <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the separation charging assembly <b>5</b><i>h</i>, and conveyed to a heat fixing assembly <b>9</b> serving as a fixing means. This heat fixing assembly <b>9</b> is constituted of a heat fixing roller <b>9</b><i>a </i>having a heating means internally and a pressure roller <b>9</b><i>b</i>. The recording material passes through the pressure contact zone between the heat fixing roller <b>9</b><i>a </i>as a heating member and the pressure roller <b>9</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the full-color toner image supported on the recording material is fixed to the recording material. That is, by this fixing step the color mixing of the toners, color formation, and fixing to the recording material are performed until a full-color permanent image is formed. Thereafter, the recording material having the image thus formed is discharged to a tray <b>10</b>. Thus, the full-color copying on one sheet is completed. Meanwhile, the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is cleaned by the cleaner <b>6</b> so that toners remaining on its surface are removed, and thereafter again put to the steps of image formation.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0249">The above raw materials were first introduced into a kneader type mixer, and were heated with mixing under application of no pressure. At the time the resultant mixture reached a maximum temperature (which depends necessarily on the boiling point of a solvent in the paste; in this case, about 90 to 100° C.), the pigment in the aqueous phase was distributed or moved to the molten resin phase. Having made sure of this, the mixture was further melt-kneaded for 30 minutes with heating to cause the pigment in the paste to move sufficiently to the resin phase. Thereafter, the mixer was stopped, and hot water was discharged. Then the mixture was further heated to 130° C. and melt-kneaded for about 30 minutes with heating to disperse the resin, and at the same time the water was evaporated off, finishing the kneading step, followed by cooling to take out the kneaded product and obtaining a first kneaded product. This first kneaded product had a water content of about 0.5% by weight.</p>

<p id="p-0247" num="0252">Materials formulated as shown above were premixed by means of Henschel mixer, and the mixture obtained was melt-kneaded using a twin-screw extrusion kneader, setting its temperature at 150° C. The kneaded product obtained was cooled and thereafter crushed by means of a hammer mill into a crushed product of about 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Then, the crushed product was finely pulverized by means of a fine grinding mill of an air jet system into particles of about 20 μm or less in diameter. The finely pulverized product thus obtained was further classified, and the classified particles were made spherical (circularity: 0.941, as measured with FPIA-2100) using a mechanofusion system having a cooling mechanism such as a chiller unit, to produce yellow resin particles (classified product) with a weight-average particle diameter of 7.2 μm in particle size distribution. Thereafter, as inorganic fine particles, 1.0 part by weight of fine titanium oxide particles of 50 nm in primary average particle diameter surface-treated with isobutyltrimethoxysilane and 0.8 part by weight of hydrophobic silica produced by treating dry-process fine silica particles of 50 nm in primary average particle diameter (BET specific surface area: 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g) with dimethyldichlorosilane, thereafter with hexamethyldisilazane and further with silicone oil were added to effect external addition and mixing to produce Yellow Toner 1. Physical properties of Yellow Toner 1 are shown in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0253">Yellow Toner 1 was further blended with magnetic ferrite carrier particles (number-based average particle diameter: 50 μm) surface-coated with silicone resin, which were so blended as to be in a toner concentration of 6% by weight. Thus, Two-component Yellow Developer 1 was obtained. The polyester unit components contained in the whole binder resin of the Yellow Toner 1 are in a proportion of 100% by weight with respect to the whole binder resin of the Yellow Toner 1.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0254">—Evaluation of Running Charge Stability—</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0255">Using this Two-component Yellow Developer 1 in a modified machine of a full-color copying machine CLC-1000 (manufactured by CANON INC.), from a fixing unit of which an oil application mechanism was detached and in which the process speed was set to 150 mm/sec, 50,000-sheet running tests were conducted by copying an original with an image area percentage of 5% in a monochrome mode and in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment (H/H, 30° C./80% RH), a normal-temperature and low-humidity environment (N/L, 23° C./5% RH) and a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment (N/N, 23° C./50% RH). In each test, the triboelectric charge quantity (mC/kg) on the sleeve was examined at the initial stage (INI) and after the 50,000-sheet running (50 K) to evaluate charge stability according to the following evaluation criteria. The results of evaluation are shown in Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0256">A method for measuring the triboelectric charge quantity on the sleeve is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0257"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a device for measuring the triboelectric charge quantity of two-component developers. First, 0.5 to 1.5 g of two-component developer collected from the sleeve surface is put in a measuring container <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> made of a metal at the bottom of which a screen <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> of 30 μm in mesh opening is provided, and the container is covered with a plate <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> made of a metal. The total weight of the measuring container <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> at this point is weighed and is expressed as W1 (g). Next, in a suction device <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> (made of an insulating material at least at the part coming into contact with the measuring container <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>), air is sucked from a suction opening <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and an air-flow control valve <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> is operated to control the pressure indicated by a vacuum indicator <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> to be 4 kPa. In this state, suction is sufficiently carried out, preferably for about 2 minutes, to suction-remove the toner. The potential indicated by a potentiometer <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> at this point is expressed as V (volt). Here, reference numeral <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> denotes a capacitor, whose capacitance is expressed as C (μF). The total weight of the measuring container after the suction is also weighed and is expressed as W2 (g). The triboelectric charge quantity (mC/kg) of the toner is calculated as in the following expression.

<p id="p-0262" num="0274">To examine fixing temperature ranges, a fixing test was conducted using a color copying machine CLC-1000 (manufactured by CANON INC.) which was so modified that an oil application mechanism was detached from its fixing unit and the process speed was able to be set at will. The development contrast was so adjusted that the toner laid-on level on paper was 1.2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The unfixed images were formed on A4 paper (CLC recommended paper, SK80) in an image area percentage of 25% in a monochrome mode and in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment (N/N, 23° C./50% RH). Thereafter, the unfixed images were fixed raising temperature from 120° C. at intervals of 10° C. in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment (N/N, 23° C./50% RH). The temperature width in which neither offset nor paper winding occurred was regarded as a fixable temperature range. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0294">The following running charge stability in one-component development was evaluated using Yellow Toner 1 produced in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0295">—Evaluation of One-component Development Running—Charge Stability This Yellow Toner 1 was evaluated using a commercially available color laser printer LBP2300 (manufactured by CANON INC.) whose process speed was set to be 150 mm/sec. A yellow cartridge of the above machine was filled with 300 g of Yellow Toner 1, and continuous printing on 5,000 sheets in a print percentage of 5% was evaluated. The triboelectric charge quantities on the sleeve at the initial stage and after 50,000-sheet running in a monochrome mode and in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment (H/H, 30° C./80% RH), a normal-temperature and low-humidity environment (N/L, 23° C./5% RH) and a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment (N/N, 23° C./50% RH) were examined to evaluate charge stability according to the following evaluation criteria. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0296">A method for measuring the triboelectric charge quantities on the sleeve is described below in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a device for measuring the triboelectric charge quantity of one-component developer. The triboelectric charge quantity of the one-component developer can be measured with, e.g., such a Faraday cage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The Faraday cage refers to a coaxial double cylinder, where an inner cylinder and an outer cylinder are insulated from each other. If a charged body having a charge quantity Q is put in this inner cylinder, in virtue of electrostatic induction, it results in a state as if a metallic cylinder having the charge quantity Q exists. The induced charge quantity Q is measured with a KEITHLEY 616 DIGITAL ELECTROMETER, and divided by the toner weight (mass) M in the inner cylinder to find a value (Q/M) which is herein referred to as the charge quantity. The developer is directly taken into a filter by air suction from a developer carrying member. Triboelectric charge quantity (mC/kg) of one-component developer=Q/M.</p>
