<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method to reduce and thereby improve the initial program load time of a computing apparatus operating system and thus provides for near instantaneous user interaction. When practicing the instant invention, a computing apparatus operating system or application processing component is loaded neither sequentially nor completely, but rather on an as required basis. The invention's “required only” loading of processing components persist through subsequent operation and shut down of the computing apparatus with each loaded task creating a checkpoint record of processing modifications to non-volatile memory. Such checkpointing allows shut down processing of the apparatus to consist of merely flushing memory buffers in the apparatus checkpointed non-volatile memory of the apparatus to permanent storage and powering off of the apparatus, with subsequent initial program load (IPL) sequencing referencing the checkpointed records to minimize future system initialization elapsed time.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part patent application based upon U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/183,709 entitled “A Method and Apparatus to Minimize Computer Apparatus Initial Program Load and Exit/Shut Down Processing” filed Jun. 27, 2002 now abandoned.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is not referenced in any microfiche appendix.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to operating systems for computer apparatuses, and more particularly, to a method to reduce and improve the initial program load time of a computing apparatus operating system and shut down processing associated therewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a computing apparatus is power on, numerous and varied software components are loaded into its RAM (Random Access Memory). As used herein, the term computing apparatus is used synonymously with the terms personal computers, portable personal electronic devices, personal digital assistants (PDA's), and other similarly intended apparatus. As more and more auxiliary devices and functions are integrated into computing apparatuses additional RAM is required to accommodate operating and application system functionality requirements. Further, users continue to demand enhanced functionality of hardware devices, additional software must also be loaded into RAM during device initialization to drive such functionality. As RAM must be validity checked during and after every power on sequence to verify its continuing integrity and associative increase in the time required for RAM validation is often perceived by the user of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would seem as processors increase in speed, computing apparatuses operating under control of their respective control programs should be able to boot (a.k.a. “load”) faster. However, given the requirements for additional functionality associated with these computing apparatuses and the necessity of ensuring the integrity of RAM processing, such devices require more time than ever to boot (as used herein the term “boot” is used synonymously with the initial program (IPL) of one or more operating system or application program sequence necessary to execute a desired function).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an associative manner shut down processing or termination processing, given the advances of the art, should require the simple act of minimal cleanup by the operating system resulting in almost immediate shut down of the computing apparatus. However, the status of the present art requires the operating system, or more precisely an operating system or application program processing component associated therewith to attempt to shut down each and every task, and each and every device attached to the computing apparatus to cease operation (even if that task/device is not responding or otherwise presently active in the terminating computer device).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a number of prior art references, improvements in initial program load time(s) have been asserted. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,173 entitled “Method and System for Maximizing the Apparent Initial Processing Capability of a Computer” purports to disclose and claim a method and system reduce the apparent time between turning on a computer and making available the computer processing capability. The method and system of the '173 patent includes and states in part “ . . . displaying within a shortened predetermined time period an interface screen that includes a plurality of interface checkpoints and address data relating to application programs associated with the user interface checkpoints. The shortened predetermined time period has a duration substantially shorter than the period associated with booting the associated application programs. In turning off computer, the method and system include generating a shut down command to computer and storing interface screen and any data files that are open at the time of turning off the computer. The interface screen and data files are stored so that upon subsequently turning off the computer, computer displays interface screen in the shortened predetermined time.”</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another example of a prior art reference purporting to accelerate processes associated with initial program load and/or termination processing are disclosed in association with U.S. Pat. No. 6,073,232, entitled “Method for Minimizing a Computer's Initial Program Load Time after a System Reset or a Power-on Using Non-volatile Storage” discloses in part a method for increasing boot speed of a host computer with associated hard disk drive generates a preftech table that contains pointers to disk locations and lengths of the records of an application program requested by the host computer during an initial power-on/reset. During the next power on/reset, before the host computer is ready for data but after the disk drive has completed its reset routine, using the preftech table the disk drive accesses the previously requested data and copies it onto the cache of the disk drive, from where it is transferred to the host computer when the host computer requests it. The preftech table is updated to reflect disk location changes for the various records, or to reflect new records that were requested by the host computer but not found in cache during the previous power-on/reset).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another reference allegedly shortening the time required to “boot” a computer system is found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,098,158, entitled “Software-enabled to Fast Boot” wherein the abstract of said reference discloses a method of generating a boot image and using the boot image to restore a computer system having a processor, an operating system, physical memory, virtual memory and disk storage. The method may be initiated from any particular software application, or at multiple execution points within a particular application. By providing full virtual memory support in the boot image, the computer system may be restored to any predetermined operating state.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,122,677, entitled “Method of Shortening Boot Uptime In a Computer System” purports to disclose a method of configuring peer devices without the unnecessary delay in boot up time using a compatibility bridge and discloses in part, “Upon initiating a configuration cycle, a BIOS initialization scans all peer devices located on the host bus.

A backup flag representing whether or not the backup data can be restored is set and the system is rebooted.

The method includes the step of detecting if the computer system is to be powered off. If the computer system is detected to be powered off, the state of the computer system is then preserved by storing data representing the state of the computer system in a designated area of nonvolatile memory of the computer system. A system initialization code of the operating system is then replaced with new system initialization code that branches to restart code that accesses to the designated area of the nonvolatile memory such that when the computer system is again powered on, the restart code accesses the designated area of the nonvolatile memory for the data to restore the computer system to the state before the computer system was powered off.</p>

Prior to the time when the application was placed in the non-running state, information defining an image of an interactive screen associated with the application is stored in the memory of the computer and locked to prevent corruption by other running applications. Then, in response to a request from the user to begin using the application, and before the application has been fully loaded into memory and is again running, the image defined by the stored information is displayed to the user. In this way the user is given the impression that the application has become immediately available.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As distinguished from the disclosure and claims of the instant invention, the common deficiency in all of the above-noted prior art references is that each reference expressly or implicitly attempts to restore the computing apparatus to a state reflecting its most recent status prior to shut down or termination processing. Consequently, the common deficiency in all of these references each is that each attempts to restore the computing apparatus to reflect its most recent fully loaded and executing status prior to termination.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Again using the “standard” approach for a boot all memory must first be verified error free and the state of the machine must be loaded from non-volatile random access memory NVRAM (hard drive, flash, etc.). While this approach does reduce time in loading each component from the NVRAM apparatus and integrating it into the operating system, it fails to address or remedy errors in the previously saved image. Had saved information been save incorrectly, if there were errors in software executing at the time it was saved as an image, such errors are routinely loaded back into memory when the apparatus is again activated. Consequently, this flawed methodology requires the computer to be shut down and rebooted yet again after loading the flawed image.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another flawed approach to enhance boot improvement and termination processing found in the contemporary art is the loading of a memory image to disk once the apparatus has been booted (attempting to minimize the above errors). However, if new software has been loaded, subsequent to this image copy, the computer then must be completely rebooted to recreate a current accurate image of the operating system (as used herein, the term operating system is used synonymously with the term “control program” and relates both to processes associated with initial program load and termination processing as well as dispatching control exercised over application end user oriented programs.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Responsive to the foregoing challenges, Applicant has developed an innovative method of optimizing the booting of a computing apparatus to allow that apparatus to function as quickly as possible for its main (intended purpose) by loading portions of the operating system as needed. Processes of the instant invention are equally applicable to any number of computing apparatuses. For purposes of full and enabling disclosure, illustrative examples of the instant invention's practice with respect to a PC and personal digital device (herein synonymously referred to as “PDA”) as well as user module interfaces are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventions methodology assumes and expects all software to maintain logs of changes to its data files (user input) to expedite the shut down of the apparatus. User shut down or loss of power input causes NVRAM buffers to be flushed (hard drives, etc.) (as indicated in block <b>20</b>) to the static memory of the NVRAM apparatus and the apparatus to be shut down (as indicated in block <b>21</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When practicing the instant invention, the computing apparatus is booted from software which is stored on nonvolatile random access memory device and not from an “executing” image of RAM when it was last shut down. Consequently, an object of the invention is a prioritization of loadable tasks wherein only operationally essential tasks are loaded into RAM and executed as quickly as possible with ancillary functions loaded subsequent thereto, if at all.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be described throughout the disclosure of the instant invention, the methodology of the instant invention is equally applicable to a variety of computing apparatuses, such as but not limited to personal computers, routers, and hand-held personal devices (digital assistants, MP3 players, etc.). For purposes of full and enabling disclosure as well as ease in comprehending the adaptability and versatility of the instant invention to a variety of computing devices, the immediately following discussion illustrates “commonality” of the instant invention's practice with respect to personal computers, routers, hand held personal devices during boot execution and shut down/termination processing of each device type.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INVENTION BOOT PROCESSING SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the apparatus is powered on (as indicated in block <b>1</b>), only the amount of RAM required to load (as indicated in block <b>3</b>) core operating system processing components is checked for errors (this initial RAM check may be avoided in computing machinery executed exclusively from NVRAM on the apparatus). As practiced by the instant invention, any RAM not specifically required for initial startup is verified/validated on a as needed basis (i.e., when to load a “primary” function) or as free CPU cycles allow). In the instant invention, errors in RAM will not preclude the apparatus from booting (as indicated in block <b>7</b>). Such errors are maintained in a table as memory address(es) to be avoided. The user is notified of errors within the apparatus, RAM and the apparatus error address(es) “patcharound.”</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">“Highest priority” tasks (and all sub-tasks required to support these tasks) are loaded next (as indicated in block <b>9</b>). The following are examples of such task loading by device type:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0024">A. On a personal computer, the monitor driver, the mouse driver and the keyboard driver (in that order).
        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0025">1. The monitor driver maintains a small database on the hard drive consisting of the background and all icons displayed on the desktop. This database is displayed almost instantaneously by the instant invention.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0026">2. The mouse driver is loaded next as this is generally typically what the user will require next.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0027">B. On a router (such as, but not limited to a Cisco® router).
        <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0028">1. The basic input/output system (BIOS) loads only enough of itself to determine if a valid image in flash memory exists and if the configuration boots to that image. If found, then the image in flash memory starts booting.</li>
            <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0029">2. The router next concentrates interface(s) execution with respect to the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) seven layer model. Concentration emphasis is on layer one (“line up”), then layer two (“protocol up”) and last layer <b>3</b>.</li>
            <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0030">3. The image booting next determines the type routing (layer three) required (IP (Internet Protocol), IPX (Internet Packet Exchange), Appletalk, X.25, Frame Relay, etc.) and loads only those portions of the IOS (Cisco's Internet Operating System) that are required. If BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is not in the configuration, the BGP is not loaded.</li>
            <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0031">4. An additional feature of the instant invention is to accommodate a router's maintaining of statistics (stored in NVRAM and regularly updated to allow for changes in traffic flows) which interfaces are busiest and thus allowing prioritization for making those interfaces operational.</li>
            <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0032">5. When the router has completed all tasks related to “routing”, the invention allows user interaction via the console should be run (on exception to this is, of course, allowing operator input to stop the initial boot sequence to correct router problems).</li>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">INVENTION EXECUTION SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0044">After the absolute highest priority tasks are loaded (as indicated in block <b>3</b>) attention is turned to performing highest priority tasks interspersed with cycles for lower priority tasks. Some of the lower priority tasks would include, but not limited to: completion of checking RAM for errors and/or keeping track of user initial actions and pro-actively loading those tasks into main memory in anticipation of what the user may do (and updating a database that record user actions).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0045">Application software executing on this computing apparatus should “play well” with the operating system. That is, application software (when started) should be compatible with and adhere to the above “fast boot” checkpointing methodology of the instant invention. Plugins should be loaded only when needed. As an example, an initial “splash” screen should be minimal followed by a “untitled” word processing document ready for editing, or another document requested by the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">INVENTION SHUTDOWN PROCESSING SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0046">Apparatus power off can be either user initiated or can be loss of power to the apparatus (plug pulled, battery runs out) (as indicated in blocks <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>). In its practice, the instant invention assumes the apparatus is designed to allow the core task has enough time and power to flush all NVRAM buffers. An interrupt from the power supply to the core task would be best approach towards ensuring this capability.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0047">If all software running on the apparatus “plays well” as in the preceding paragraph, then a simple flush of the NVRAM buffers would save all logged information just before shut down. After the flush of buffers, the apparatus then powers off.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0053">It is understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only, and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein by reference, and which constitute a part of this specification, illustrate certain embodiments of the invention and, together with the detailed description, serve to explain the principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0054">In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment to the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in this application to the details of construction and to the arrangement so the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0055">The invention is capable of other embodiments an of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0056">Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and especially the design engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application. The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to scope of the invention in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0057">The apparatus and the method of the instant invention rely upon processing steps which first requires the loading and initiation of a BIOS (Built In Operation System) initialization routine.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0058">The instant invention next limitedly validates that portion of RAM (as indicated in block <b>3</b>) to be used accommodate the selective BIOS “load” initialization routine to ensure it is free of addressing or error exceptions. To the extent that portion necessary to accommodate the initialization routine, and only that portion necessary in order to accommodate the initialization routine, is checked for validated addressability thus saving the necessity of validating all RAM accessible to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0059">Should an error be found in the RAM thus verified, the instant invention practice is to patch around such invalid addresses and allow the loading of the device to proceed (as indicated in block <b>7</b>). Consequently, the portion of the operating system to be loaded into RAM would be comprised of a core task manager (CTM) and memory task manager (MTM) with the function of the CTM to manage and prioritize tasks (operating systems tasks and program system calls, etc.) and the function of the MTM to manage memory, ram, virtual memory, vm paging, etc. The MTM tracks RAM usage and, if required, facilitates paging in and out of virtual memory (as indicated in block <b>9</b>). The MTM also tracks which tasks (driver system) are no longer active and determines if additional RAM is required, such RAM can be reused (as indicated in block <b>9</b>). Should a system routine be resident in memory (but not active) it can be immediately reactivated and used without requiring the instructions to be reloaded into memory from non-volatile RAM.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0060">For purposes of full and enabling disclosure, processing steps which facilitate the loading and initiation of a bios initialization routine for the instant invention are immediately provided in commentary and pseudocode format.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0061">Following initiation of the initialization routine for a personal computer, the operating system of the instant invention, first interrogates an audit reference to identify those minimally essential operating system and application program (as indicated in block <b>8</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) startup processing components necessary to effectuate user communication with the apparatus. These device dependent audit references are contained within a data reference accessible to the device and most easily comprehended as checkpoint records wherein the operating system and application program prosecution status is recorded for later reference. Having once interrogated the audit reference, the instant invention next selectively retrieves the identified startup program components and thereby bypasses at least a portion of BIOS instruction set normally required for establishing interactive communication between a user and the apparatus. That is, the instant invention identifies those portions of the BIOS initialization to be loaded to RAM to effectuate such communication and then bypasses other “standard” portions of BIOS processing which are necessary to effectuate almost instantaneous user communication.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0062">The instant invention next determines an apparatus specific highest priority task and initiates execution of the task (as indicated in block <b>12</b>). Such tasks are obviously determined by the function of the device with the tasks and the respective priorities stored a non-volatile memory as a task list (TL) or as a table in the CTM and ROM. The CTM then passes the name and size of the application to the MTM and loads the task into memory and passes the task back to the CTM for execution. As an example, the first task on a personal computer is the loading of the driver for hard drive for the additional driver application can be loaded. While the first task of any personal device (MP3 player, PDA, etc.) is to display and the first task of a router would be to determine whether there was a valid boot entry on its non-volatile RAM, a flash card or hard drive (as indicated in block <b>18</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The instant invention next highest determines what is the next execution priority task in the task list, and executes that task and continues to execute each subsequent “next priority task” until the task load is completed (as indicated in block <b>30</b>). Once all such tasks are loaded dispatching control of the operating system is turned to all system and application components necessary to effectuate normal operation. During this normal or standard operation, the MTM initiates all tasks and tracks the task memory requirements (as indicated in blocks <b>36</b> and <b>39</b>). Each task is individually responsible for managing its own temporary files and logging all modifications to those files as such modifications were made. When the files are saved, the original file plus the logged or audit changes are kept in a file. The original file is kept until creation is completed. Then and only then is the old file deleted from the non-volatile RAM device.</p>

Memory protection would be via memory protection hardware or strong memory protection AKAUNIXOS. The MTM tracks which tasks (drivers, system calls, applications) are active and which are no longer active so that if RAM is required then that RAM can be reused. Memory is not changed until something is loaded into that address space. If a system routine is already in memory (albeit not active at the moment) then it can be immediately reactivated and used without requiring the instructions/data be reloaded into memory from NVRAM (a waste of load time and presumably NVRAM is a slower access device than RAM). */
