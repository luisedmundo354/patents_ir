<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a frequency divider, and more particularly, to a programmable frequency divider.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A frequency divider is a very important component of a frequency synthesizer and is used for dividing a source signal to form a result signal. The frequency of the result signal is the frequency of the source signal being divided with a divisor. As is known in the art, a conventional frequency divider is composed of a plurality of cascaded dual mode dividing cells. Each cell of the frequency divider performs a dividing operation according a corresponding divisor signal. The division range depends on the number of cells of the frequency divider. The more cells that are used, the wider the division range. A ⅔ cell having two dividing modes, which are divide-by-two and divide-by-three modes, is a commonly used dividing cell. If the frequency divider is composed of N ⅔ cells, the division range of the frequency divider is all integers from 2<sup>N </sup>to 2<sup>N+1</sup>−1.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Employing more cells in the frequency divider can extend the division range; however, it deteriorates space efficiency for IC design. U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,622 discloses a programmable frequency divider with a prescaler and a programmable counter. Adjusting the counter value of the programmable counter extends the division range of the frequency divider. The complexity of circuit design and cost, however, are increased due to the utilization of the programmable counter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other applications, such as a fractional frequency divider in a frequency synthesizer, the programmed divisor repeatedly changes from a value of M to a value of M+1, then back to M in order to obtain a result signal at a fractional frequency. However, if the divisor changes, i.e. a set of divisor signals are loaded while one or more of the dividing cells is sensitive to the divisor signal, the cells sensitive to the divisor signals are enabled to perform divide-by-two or divide-by-three operations according to the corresponding divisor signals. Therefore, some cells of the programmable frequency divider operate depending upon the divisor signals and the other cells operate depending upon the original divisor signals. The effective division may thereby result an incorrect value, i.e. the effective division may be a value that is neither M nor M+1.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an objective of the claimed invention to provide a programmable frequency divider to guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the output signal of the programmable frequency divider by resetting dividing cells of the programmable frequency divider.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for changing divisors in a programmable frequency divider is disclosed. Wherein the frequency divider has a plurality of cascaded cells, and the method involves: providing a plurality of divisor signals; selectively switching each of the plurality of cells to a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three mode according to the plurality of divisor signals; and synchronously resetting at least a part of the plurality of cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The programmable frequency divider of the present invention synchronously resets the plurality of cells after the divisor is changed so that each cell renews its dividing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment of the present invention, the programmable frequency divider further utilizes a reload signal to trigger each cell to synchronously reload a corresponding divisor signal in order to guarantee that each cell performs dividing operations according to the corresponding signal after the divisor is changed. The output signal of the programmable frequency divider can be employed to be the reload signal to simplify circuit design.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention is capable of extending the division range by simply utilizing flip-flops and simple logic gates to add a bypass mode to the two-mode dividing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention needs to only synchronously reload each of the cells having bypass mode with a corresponding divisor signal in order to simultaneously extend the division range and guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the frequency-divided signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One advantage of the present invention is that the division range is extended by utilizing simple flip-flops and logic gates and without any programmable counter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another advantage of the present invention is that the programmable frequency divider is capable of ensuring correctness of the frequency of the output signal by resetting cells.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet another advantage is that the cells are modularized according to the present invention, so that the circuit design complexity and cost are thereby reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p>

The programmable frequency divider <b>100</b> comprises N cascaded dividing cells <b>10</b>, each cell <b>10</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rs), a first output node (Fo), and a second output node (Mo). According to the cascading sequence, those cells <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are respectively defined from left to right as a first stage cell <b>10</b>, a second stage cell <b>10</b>, . . . , and an N<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the first embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, from the first stage to the (N−1)<sup>th </sup>stage, the first output node (Fo) of each cell <b>10</b> is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of next stage cell <b>10</b> and the second input node (Mi) of each cell <b>10</b> is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of next stage cell <b>10</b>. The second input node (Mi) of the N<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>10</b> is coupled to a last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;N+1&gt;</sub> that is typically a fixed logic value in this embodiment. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second input node (Mi) of the N<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>10</b> is coupled to logic 1, (e.g. coupled to Vcc), which means the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;N+1&gt;</sub> is at logic 1. The third input node (Di) of each cell <b>10</b> is used for receiving a corresponding divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;P&gt;</sub>, (where 1≦P≦N). And the fourth input node (Rs) is used for receiving a reset signal to synchronously reset the P<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>10</b>. The reset signal is usually generated from a control circuit (not shown). Each cell <b>10</b> operates in a divide-by-two mode or a divide-by-three mode respectively according to the logic level at its third input node (Di). A more detailed operation will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the first embodiment of the present invention, a source signal Fin is input into the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell <b>10</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>100</b>. Each cell <b>10</b> processes the source signal Fin according to its dividing mode. After the source signal Fin is sequentially processed by all cells <b>10</b>, a result signal Fout at a divided frequency is thereby output from the second output node (Mo) or the first output node (Fo) of the N<sup>th </sup>stage (the last stage) cell <b>10</b>. A programmable divisor value, which is obtained based on the divisor signals, determines the ratio of the frequency of the result signal Fout to the frequency of the source signal Fin. The programmable divisor value is presented as a set of binary divisor signals, Di<sub>&lt;P&gt;</sub>, 1≦P≦N+1, and each binary divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;P&gt;</sub>, is loaded to the third input node (Di) of the corresponding P<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>10</b> for 1≦P≦N. Once the divisor value changes, the reset signal is employed to reset all cells <b>10</b> after each cell <b>10</b> receives the new value of the corresponding divisor signal, so that each cell <b>10</b> refreshes its dividing operation after being reset. Thus, the frequency of the result signal Fout output from the programmable frequency divider <b>100</b> is thereby guaranteed to be the result of the frequency of the source signal Fin divided with the new divisor value.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a circuit diagram according to one embodiment of the cell <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0 and the third input node (Di) is also at logic 0, this makes the cell <b>10</b> operate in the divide-by-two mode. In the divided-by-two mode, the positive edge of a clock signal at the first input node (Fi) triggers flip-flops <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> such that the first output node (Fo) outputs a half frequency signal. In other words, the signal at the first output node (Fo) has a frequency half of that of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the second input node (Mi) and the third input node (Di) are both at logic 1 and the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, this makes the cell <b>10</b> operate in the divide-by-three mode. In the divided-by-three mode, the positive edge of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi) triggers flip-flops <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> such that the first output node (Fo) outputs a one-third-frequency signal. In other words, the signal at the first output node (Fo) has a frequency one-third of that of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, the second output node (Mo) outputs a signal at the same logic level as the second input node (Mi). In addition, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 1, the second output node (Mo) outputs a logic 0 signal. Furthermore, if the reset signal received on the fourth input node (Rs) is at an active state (i.e. is enabled), such as the logic 1 of the example embodiment, the flip-flops <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> are both at reset state such that the cell <b>10</b> does not perform a dividing operation and the first output node (Fo) outputs a logic 0 signal. Additionally, when the reset signal is enabled, if the second input node (Mi) is at logic 1, the second output node (Mo) outputs a logic 1 signal. After reset is disabled, e.g., the reset signal returns to logic 0 level, the cell <b>10</b> renews its dividing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other words, according to the circuit diagram <b>12</b>, regardless of the logic level of the second output node (Mo), if the third input node (Di) is at logic 0, this means the cell <b>10</b> will operate in the divide-by-two mode. The positive edge of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output the half frequency signal. If the second output node (Mo) and the third input node (Di) are both at logic 1, this means the cell <b>10</b> will operate in the divide-by-three mode. The positive edge of the clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output the one-third-frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">From the above illustration of the circuit diagram <b>12</b>, it is known that the operating clock of the cell <b>10</b> is the signal received at the first input node (Fi). Regarding to the first stage cell <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the operating clock is the source signal Fin received at the first input node (Fi) thereof. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the operating clock of the cells <b>10</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>100</b> is sequentially delivered from the first stage to the last stage (the N<sup>th </sup>stage) and a division cycle is thereby completed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, the signal received at the second input node (Mi) of a cell <b>10</b> acts as an enabling signal which is involved in cell <b>100</b> is switching its dividing mode. When the enabling signal loaded on the second input node (Mi) is at an inactive state, for example, logic 0 of the embodiment, the cell <b>10</b> operates in the divide-by-two mode. If the enabling signal loaded on the second input node (Mi) is at an active state (such as logic 1), the cell <b>10</b> will operate in either the divide-by-two or divide-by-three mode depending upon the division signal loaded on the third input node (Di). For example, when the second input node (Mi) is at the active state and the division signal loaded on the third input node (Di) is logic 1, the cell <b>10</b> will operate in the divide-by-three mode. Please refer back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the programmable frequency divider <b>100</b>, the enabling signal is propagated from the N<sup>th </sup>stage back to the first stage. Since the cell <b>10</b> in the previous stage receives the enabling signal with a higher frequency. This design is feasible for the previous stages to operate in high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that an important feature of the programmable frequency divider <b>100</b> of the present invention is to synchronously reset all cells <b>10</b> thereof. As mentioned above, in the related art, when the divisor of the frequency divider changes, this may result in incorrect division. In the first embodiment of the present invention, when the divisor changes, the programmable frequency divider <b>100</b> synchronously resets all cells <b>10</b> so that each cell <b>10</b> renews its operation according to the new divisor value without sufferring from the problem of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as well as to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The circuit diagram <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is another embodiment of the cell <b>10</b>. In contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, obviously, the difference between the circuit diagram <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the circuit diagram <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that one more AND gate is employed in the circuit diagram <b>14</b> to improve the output speed of the second output node (Mo). The logical operation of the circuit diagram <b>14</b> is substantially the same as the circuit diagram <b>12</b> and further details are thereby omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a schematic diagram of a programmable frequency divider <b>200</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The programmable frequency divider <b>200</b> comprises N cascaded dividing cells <b>20</b>, wherein each cell <b>20</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rl), a first output node (Fo), and a second output node (Mo). According to the cascading sequence, the cells <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are respectively defined from left to right as a first stage cell <b>20</b>, a second stage cell <b>20</b>, . . . , and an N<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the second embodiment of the present invention, from the first stage to the (N−1)<sup>th </sup>stage of the programmable frequency divider <b>200</b>, the first output node (Fo) of each cell <b>20</b> is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of a next stage and the second input node (Mi) of each cell <b>20</b> is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of a next stage. The second input node (Mi) of the N<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>20</b> is coupled to a last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;N+1&gt;</sub> that is typically a fixed logic level, such as Vcc shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The third input node (Di) of each cells <b>20</b> is used for receiving a corresponding divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;P&gt;</sub>, (where 1≦P≦N). And the fourth input node (Rl) is used for receiving a reload signal to synchronously reload the P<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>20</b>. The reload signal is usually generated from a control circuit (not shown). When the reload signal triggers the cells <b>20</b>, a corresponding divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;P&gt;</sub>, on the third input node (Di) is synchronously reloaded into the P<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the second embodiment of the present invention, a source signal Fin is input into the first input node (Fi) of the first cell <b>20</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>200</b>.

Afterward, a result signal Fout at a divided frequency is then output from the second output node (Mo) or the first output node (Fo) of the cell <b>20</b> in the N<sup>th </sup>stage (i.e., the last stage). The ratio of the frequency of the result signal Fout to the frequency of the source signal Fin is configured by a set of programmable divisor signals that are synchronously loaded on the third input node (Di) of each cell <b>20</b> respectively. When changing the divisor, a divisor is presented as a set of binary divisor signals that are received on the third input node (Di) of each cell <b>20</b> respectively. At this moment, each cell <b>20</b> has not yet loaded the divisor signal. After a reload signal is loaded on the fourth input node (Rl) of each cell <b>20</b>, each cell <b>20</b> synchronously loads the corresponding divisor signal on its third input node (Di). Thus, the frequency of the result signal Fout is thereby guaranteed to be the result of the frequency of the source signal Fin divided by the divisor.</p>

In this embodiment, since the second input node (Mi) of the last stage (i.e. the sixth stage) cell <b>30</b> is coupled to Vcc and is thereby always at logic 1 level, i.e., the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> is a logic 1. Accordingly, the smallest divisor value of the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> is 64 (2<sup>6</sup>=64) in this embodiment. As shown in the timing diagram <b>450</b>, regardless of the original operation mode of each cell <b>30</b>, all cells <b>30</b> are synchronously reset and stop dividing operations while the reset signal is enabled during time <b>452</b> through time <b>454</b>. During this period, the signal output from the first output node (Fo) of each cell <b>30</b>, respectively denoted by <b>1</b>-Fo, <b>2</b>-Fo, <b>3</b>-Fo, <b>4</b>-Fo, <b>5</b>-Fo, and <b>6</b>-Fo, becomes logic 0.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As mentioned above, during the period from time <b>452</b> through time <b>454</b>, because of the second input node (Mi) of the last stage cell <b>30</b> is at logic 1, its second output node (Mo) outputs logic 1 signal during the period accordingly. In addition, since the second output node (Mo) of each stage is connected to the second input node (Mi) of its previous stage, the signal output from the second output node (Mo) of each stage, respectively denoted by <b>1</b>-Mo, <b>2</b>-Mo, <b>3</b>-Mo, <b>4</b>-Mo, <b>5</b>-Mo, and <b>6</b>-Mo, becomes logic 1.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At time <b>454</b>, the reset signal becomes disabled (i.e., falls to logic 0), which means all cells <b>30</b> have been synchronously reset, so each cell <b>30</b> renews its operation according to the divisor signal loaded when reset. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, all divisor signals loaded to all cells <b>30</b> are assumed logic 0 and all cells thereby will perform the divide-by-two operation. Accordingly, the divisor of the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> is 64. At time <b>454</b>, since a rising edge of the source signal Fin (i.e., the signal <b>1</b>-Fi input into the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell <b>30</b>) occurs, the first stage cell <b>30</b> operates in the divide-by-two mode and outputs a frequency-divided signal <b>1</b>-Fo from its first output node (Fo). The signal <b>1</b>-Fo is also the operating clock of the second stage cell <b>30</b>, <b>2</b>-Fi. A rising edge of the operating clock <b>2</b>-Fi triggers the second stage cell <b>30</b> to perform dividing operation. The second stage cell <b>30</b> then outputs a frequency-divided signal <b>2</b>-Fo from its first output node (Fo) to be the operating clock of the third stage cell <b>30</b>, <b>3</b>-Fi. By this way, the P<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>30</b> outputs a frequency-divided signal P-Fo from its first output node (Fo) to be the operating clock of the (P+1)<sup>th </sup>stage cell <b>30</b>, (P+1)-Fi. Finally, at time <b>458</b>, the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> completes the first division cycle after reset. The signal output from the second output node (Mo) of the final stage, <b>6</b>-Mo, is employed to be the result signal Fout. The frequency of the result signal Fout is 1/64 of the frequency of the source signal Fin. If using the signal output from the first output node (Fo) of the last stage cell to be the result signal Fout, the frequency of the result signal Fout is also 1/64 of the frequency of the source signal Fin.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As mentioned above, the signal output from the second output node (Mo) of the last stage cell <b>30</b>, <b>6</b>-Mo, is also employed to be the reload signal of the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b>. In the timing diagram <b>450</b>, the divisor signals received on the third input node (Di) of each cell <b>30</b> are logic 0 at time <b>456</b>. After a rising edge of the signal <b>6</b>-Mo triggers each cell <b>30</b> to reload a corresponding divisor signal, the divisor of the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> remains at 64. Accordingly, each cell <b>30</b> repeats the divide-by-two operation in a next division cycle. Therefore, the frequency of the result signal Fout (<b>6</b>-Mo) is still 1/64 of the frequency of the source signal Fin.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the signals output from the second output node (Mo) of each stage, <b>1</b>-Mo, <b>2</b>-Mo, <b>3</b>-Mo, <b>4</b>-Mo, <b>5</b>-Mo, and <b>6</b>-Mo, are periodic signals with identical period and only differ in pulse width. So it is also feasible to use any of these signals as the result signal Fout of the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b>. In practical implementations, an advantage of using the signal <b>6</b>-Mo output from the last stage cell <b>30</b> as the reload signal is that the signal <b>6</b>-Mo has a wider pulse width than the others (i.e., <b>1</b>-Mo, <b>2</b>-Mo, <b>3</b>-Mo, <b>4</b>-Mo, and <b>5</b>-Mo). This feature is helpful to reduce the requirement of detecting high frequency signal for the cell <b>30</b> and the cost of the programmable frequency divider is thereby reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to above illustration of the timing diagram <b>450</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b>, it is known that the fourth embodiment of the present invention has at least two features:</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">(a) All cells <b>30</b> are synchronously reset. After being reset, each cell <b>30</b> renews its dividing operation according to the current divisor signal. In other words, the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> renews its operation according to the current divisor.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">(b) The result signal Fout is used as the reload signal to trigger each cell <b>30</b> to synchronously reload a corresponding divisor signal.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the above embodiments, the manner used in the programmable frequency divider of the present invention to solve the problem concerning incorrect output frequency while changing the divisor has been disclosed. In order to further solve the problem of the division range limited by the number of employed dividing cells, the present invention combines the original cell with simple logic gates to add a bypass mode to the cell. The architecture of the programmable frequency divider with wider division range of the present invention is illustrated in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicts a schematic diagram of a programmable frequency divider according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. A programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> comprises three cells <b>30</b>, a cell <b>40</b>, and two cells <b>50</b>. Each cell <b>30</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rs), a fifth input node (Rl), a first output node (Fo), and a second output node (Mo). The three cells <b>30</b> are respectively defined from left to right as a first stage cell <b>30</b>, a second stage cell <b>30</b>, and a third stage cell <b>30</b>. Each cell <b>50</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rs), a fifth input node (Rl), a sixth input node (Ci), a first output node (Fo), a second output node (Mo), and a third output node (Co). Similarly, the two cells <b>50</b> are respectively defined from left to right as a fourth stage cell <b>50</b> and a fifth stage cell <b>50</b>. The cell <b>40</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rs), a fifth input node (Rl), a sixth input node (Ci), a first output node (Fo), a second output node (Mo), and a third output node (Co), and is defined as a sixth stage cell <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown, the cascading manner of the three cells <b>30</b> is substantially the same as the above embodiments and further details are therefore omitted here. Regarding the fourth stage cell <b>50</b>, its first input node (Fi) is coupled to the first output node (Fo) of the third stage cell <b>30</b>; its second output node (Mo) is coupled to the second input node (Mi) of the third stage cell <b>30</b>; its first output node (Fo) is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of the fifth stage cell <b>50</b>; its second input node (Mi) is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the fifth stage cell <b>50</b>; and its sixth input node (Ci) is coupled to the third output node (Co) of the fifth stage cell <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Regarding the fifth stage cell <b>50</b>, its first output node (Fo) is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of the cell <b>40</b>; its second input node (Mi) is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the cell <b>40</b>; and its sixth input node (Ci) is coupled to the third output node (Co) of the cell <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Regarding the cell <b>40</b>, its second input node (Mi) is coupled to logic 1, (e.g. coupled to Vcc) and its sixth input node (Ci) is coupled to the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>. In addition, each cell of the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> receives a corresponding divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;P&gt;</sub> (1≦P≦6) from the third input node (Di) and receives a reset signal from the fourth input node (Rs). Wherein the reset signal is employed to synchronously reset each cell and is generated by a control circuit (not shown). Additionally, the fifth input node (Rl) of each cell is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell <b>30</b>. The signal output from the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell <b>30</b>, <b>3</b>-Mo, is employed as a reload signal. In this embodiment, the signal, <b>3</b>-Mo, is also employed as a result signal Fout.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The operation of the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> is similar with above embodiments. The programmable divisor value is also presented as a set of binary divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;2&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;3&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>. The programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> divides the frequency of a source signal Fin received on the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell <b>30</b> according to the divisor value. In the previous embodiments, if N cells are employed, since the last divisor signal (D<sub>&lt;N+1&gt;</sub>) is at logic 1 level, the allowable divisors are integers from 2<sup>N </sup>to 2<sup>N+1</sup>−1. In the fifth embodiment, however, each of the last three stages (i.e., the fourth stage cell <b>50</b>, the fifth stage cell <b>50</b>, and the sixth stage cell <b>40</b>) has a bypass mode.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The signal received on the sixth input node (Ci) of the cell <b>40</b> or <b>50</b> is a bypass-mode enabling signal. When the bypass-mode enabling signal is active, for example at logic 0 level, the cell is at a bypass state and does not perform any dividing operation. Accordingly, the division range of the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> is no longer the integers from 2<sup>6 </sup>to 2<sup>7</sup>−1 and is extended to the integers from 2<sup>3 </sup>to 2<sup>7</sup>−1 (i.e., from 8 to 127). In addition, only simple flip-flops and logic combinations are required for the programmable frequency divider of the present invention to extend the division range, the complexity and cost of implementation is thereby decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Note that, D flip-flops are preferably employed in the programmable frequency divider as an example. In practical implementation, any type of flip-flops should also be included in the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as well as to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a circuit diagram <b>42</b> according to one embodiment of the cell <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the cell <b>40</b> is configured in the last stage. The second input node (Mi) is coupled to Vcc (i.e., logic 1 level); the third input node (Di) and the sixth input node (Ci) is coupled to the last two divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, respectively. In the circuit diagram <b>42</b>, when the reload signal on the fifth input node (Rl) triggers the cell <b>40</b>, the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> on the third input node (Di) and the Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> on the sixth input node (Ci) are synchronously loaded into the cell <b>40</b>. At that moment, if the last divisor Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> is at logic 0, a flip-flop <b>132</b> outputs a logic 0 signal. A NOT gate <b>142</b> then converts the logic 0 signal into a logic 1 signal. Next, the logic 1 signal is transmitted into an OR gate <b>152</b>, so that the output of the OR gate <b>152</b> is thereby maintained in logic 1 level to reset flip-flops <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>. Obviously, regardless of the value of the divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> on the third input node (Di) of the cell <b>40</b>, the cell <b>40</b> does not perform any dividing operation, i.e., it is at the so-called bypass state. Thus, when the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> is at logic 0, the cell <b>40</b> is bypassed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Please refer back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the circuit diagram <b>12</b>, as mentioned above, when the reset signal received on the fourth input node (Rs) is at logic 1, the cell <b>10</b> does not perform any dividing operation. The cell then renews its operation when the reset action is completed. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the sixth input node (Ci) of the circuit diagram <b>42</b> receives a logic 0 signal, i.e., the bypass-mode enabling signal is at an active state, the flip-flops <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are both at the reset state so that the cell <b>40</b> does not perform any dividing operation. Thus, when the sixth input node (Ci) of the cell <b>40</b> loaded with a logic 0 signal, the cell <b>40</b> is bypassed and can be regarded as in the reset state.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, when the reload signal on the fifth input node (Rl) triggers the cell <b>40</b>, if the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> loaded into the cell <b>40</b> are both at logic 0, an OR gate <b>154</b> outputs a logic 0 signal. The logic 0 signal is then output from the third output node (Co) of the cell <b>40</b> to the sixth input node (Ci) of the previous stage (the fifth stage) to bypass the previous stage.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which depicts a circuit diagram <b>52</b> according to one embodiment of the cell <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In the circuit diagram <b>52</b>, when the signal received on the sixth input node (Ci) is at logic 0, similar with the circuit diagram <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a NOT gate <b>242</b> converts the logic 0 signal into a logic 1 signal. The logic 1 signal is then transmitted to an OR gate <b>252</b>. Next, the OR gate <b>252</b> outputs a logic 1 signal to reset flip-flops <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>. At that moment, the cell <b>50</b> is bypassed and does not perform any dividing operation. Similarly, in the circuit diagram <b>52</b>, if the signals on the sixth input node (Ci) and the loaded signal from the third input node (Di) are both at logic 0, an OR gate <b>254</b> outputs a logic 0 signal. The logic 0 signal is then transmitted from the third output node (Co) of the cell <b>50</b> to the sixth input node (Ci) of a previous stage to bypass the previous stage.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Regarding the above illustration of the circuit diagrams <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, a conclusion is obtained as follows: in the fifth embodiment of the present invention, when the loaded signals respectively from the last two divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, are both at logic 0, the cell <b>40</b> and the fifth stage cell <b>50</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> are both bypassed. Furthermore, when the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>that have been loaded are all at logic 0, the cell <b>40</b>, the fourth stage cell <b>50</b> and the fifth stage cell <b>50</b> are all bypassed. Thus, the division range of the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> can be extended by properly setting the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;2&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;3&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, if the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub>is 0001000, which is the binary value of <b>8</b>, this means the divisor value is 8. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 0001001, which is the binary value of 9, this means the divisor value is 9. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 0111111, this means the divisor value is 63. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 1000000, this means the divisor value is <b>64</b>. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 1111111, this means the divisor value is 127.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the fifth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, since the last three stages of the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> is possibly bypassed, the signal, <b>3</b>-Mo, output from the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell <b>30</b> is employed as the result signal Fout.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In contrast to the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> is also capable of synchronously resetting all cells, so that each cell renews its operation after reset. The programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> also utilizes the result signal Fout as the reload signal to trigger each cell to synchronously reload a corresponding divisor signal. The difference between the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> and the programmable frequency divider <b>400</b> is that the cell <b>40</b> and cell <b>50</b>, which have a bypass mode, are employed in the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b>, so that the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> is capable of extending the division range by programming the divisor signals.</p>

The difference is that the circuit diagram <b>52</b> utilizes four more logic gates (three OR gates <b>252</b>, <b>254</b>, <b>256</b>, and one NOT gate <b>242</b>) than the circuit diagram <b>32</b>, and the circuit diagram <b>42</b> further utilizes four more elements (one flip-flop <b>132</b>, one NOT gate <b>144</b>, and two AND gates <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>) than the circuit diagram <b>52</b>. Accordingly, one advantage of the fifth embodiment of the present invention is that only some flip-flops and simple logic gates are required for adding a bypass mode to the original cell in order to extend the division range of the programmable frequency divider.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Note that, six cells employed in the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> is just an example for convenience of illustration.

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which depicts a schematic diagram of a programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention. As an example, the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> comprises three cells <b>60</b>, one cell <b>70</b>, and two cells <b>80</b>. Each of the three cells <b>60</b> are cascaded with each other and are respectively defined from left to right as a first stage cell <b>60</b>, a second stage cell <b>60</b>, and a third stage cell <b>60</b>. The two cells <b>80</b> are respectively defined from left to right as a fourth stage cell <b>80</b> and a fifth stage cell <b>80</b>, wherein the fourth stage cell <b>80</b> is cascaded with the third stage cell <b>60</b> and the fifth stage cell <b>80</b> is cascaded with the fourth stage cell <b>80</b>. In addition, the cell <b>70</b> is cascaded with the fifth stage cell <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, each cell <b>60</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a first output node (Fo), and a second output node (Mo). Each of the cells <b>80</b> and <b>70</b> has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rl), a fifth input node (Ci), a first output node (Fo), a second output node (Mo), and a third output node (Co). For each of the first five stages, the first output node (Fo) is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of the next stage, and the second input node (Mi) is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the next stage. For each cell <b>80</b>, the fifth input node (Ci) is coupled to the third output node (Co) of the next stage. The first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell <b>60</b> is coupled to the source signal Fin. The second input node (Mi) of the cell <b>70</b> is coupled to logic 1, e.g. Vcc. The third input node (Di) of each cell is coupled to a corresponding divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;N&gt;</sub> (1≦N≦6). The fifth input node (Ci) of the cell <b>70</b> is coupled to the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>. In addition, for each cell from the fourth stage to the sixth stage, the fourth input node (Rl) is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell <b>60</b>. The signal, denoted by <b>3</b>′-Mo, output from the third stage cell <b>60</b> is employed as a reload signal.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this embodiment, a source signal Fin is input into the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell <b>60</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b>.

Each stage performs a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three operation depending upon the corresponding loaded divisor signal from the third input node (Di).

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Therefore, the division range of the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> is also the integers from 8 to 127 similar to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. However, the difference is that the sixth embodiment of the present invention only needs to trigger the cells having the bypass mode (such as cells <b>70</b> and <b>80</b>) to synchronously reload the corresponding divisor signal instead of to trigger all cells. Additionally, in the sixth embodiment, when the cell having the bypass mode is bypassed (i.e., when the signal received on its fifth input node (Ci) is at logic 0 state), the cell is simultaneously reset. Thus, the sixth embodiment does not require utilizing an additional reset signal to synchronously reset the cells and the complexity and cost is thereby reduced. The architecture of each cell of the sixth embodiment is discussed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> depicting two embodiments of the cell <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which are shown as circuit diagram <b>62</b> and circuit diagram <b>64</b>. The logical operation of the two circuit diagrams <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> is discussed as follows. In the circuit diagram <b>62</b>, for example, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0 level and the third input node (Di) is at logic 0 level, this means the cell <b>60</b> will operate in a divide-by-two mode. Accordingly, the positive edge of a clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a half frequency signal. If the second input node (Mi) is at logic 1, the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, and the third input node (Di) is at logic 1, this means the cell <b>60</b> will perform a divide-by-three operation. Thus, the positive edge of a clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a one-third-frequency signal. In other words, regardless of the logic level of the second output node (Mo), if the third input node (Di) is at logic 0, this means the cell <b>60</b> will perform a divide-by-two operation. Similarly, the positive edge of a clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a half frequency signal. If the second output node (Mo) and the third input node (Di) are both at logic 1, this means the cell <b>60</b> will operate in a divide-by-three mode. Therefore, the positive edge of the clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a one-third-frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">If the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, the second output node (Mo) outputs a signal at the same logic level as the second input node (Mi). In addition, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 1, the second output node (Mo) outputs a logic 0 signal.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The difference between the circuit diagram <b>64</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and the circuit diagram <b>62</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is that one more OR gate is employed in the circuit diagram <b>64</b> in order to improve the output speed of the second output node (Mo) thereof. The logical operation of the circuit diagram <b>64</b> is substantially the same as the circuit diagram <b>62</b> and therefore further details are omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, which illustrate a circuit diagram <b>72</b> and a circuit diagram <b>74</b>, respectively, as two embodiments of the cell <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The circuit diagram <b>72</b> is very similar with the circuit diagram <b>74</b>. The only difference is one more AND gate <b>762</b> is employed in the circuit diagram <b>74</b> to improve the output speed of the second output node (Mo) thereof. Since the logical operation of the circuit diagram <b>72</b> is substantially the same as the circuit diagram <b>74</b>, the circuit diagram <b>72</b> is used as an example in following illustrations.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The logical operation of the circuit diagram <b>72</b> is similar with the circuit diagram <b>62</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In contrast to the circuit diagram <b>62</b>, the circuit diagram <b>72</b> has the fourth input node (Rl), the fifth input node (Ci) and the third output node (Co) but the circuit diagram <b>62</b> does not. In this embodiment, the signal <b>3</b>′-Mo is employed as both the reload signal and the result signal. When the edge (e.g., the raising edge in this embodiment) of the reload signal triggers the fourth input node (Rl), the divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> on the third input node (Di) and the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> on the fifth input node (Ci) are loaded into the cell <b>70</b>. If the loaded last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> is at logic 0 level, a flip-flop <b>732</b> outputs a logic 0 signal. The logic 0 signal is then transferred into a logic 1 signal by a NOT gate <b>742</b> to reset flip-flops <b>734</b> and <b>736</b>. Thus, when the last divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> is at logic 0 level, the cell <b>70</b> is bypassed. At that moment, the cell <b>70</b> does not perform any dividing operation and can be regarded as being in the reset state.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If the loaded divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> are both at logic 0 level, an OR gate <b>752</b> of the circuit diagram <b>72</b> outputs a logic 0 signal from the third output node (Co). The logic 0 signal is transmitted to the fifth input node (Ci) of the previous stage. In other words, when the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> loaded to the cell <b>70</b> are both at logic 0 level, the cell <b>70</b> is bypassed and outputs a logic 0 signal to the fifth input node (Ci) of the fifth stage cell <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, which illustrate a circuit diagram <b>82</b> and a circuit diagram <b>84</b>, respectively, as two embodiments of the cell <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The circuit diagram <b>82</b> is very similar with the circuit diagram <b>84</b>. The only difference is one more AND gate <b>862</b> is employed in the circuit diagram <b>84</b> to improve the output speed of the second output node (Mo) thereof. Since the logical operation of the circuit diagram <b>82</b> is substantially the same as the circuit diagram <b>84</b>, the circuit diagram <b>82</b> is used as an example in the following illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The logical operation of the circuit diagram <b>82</b> is similar with the circuit diagram <b>72</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, but the circuit diagram <b>82</b> has one less flip-flop. Similarly, when the edge (e.g., the raising edge in this embodiment) of the reload signal triggers the fourth input node (Rl), the divisor signal Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub> on the third input node (Di) is loaded into the cell <b>80</b>. If the signal received on the fifth input node (Ci) is a logic 0 signal, the logic 0 signal is then transferred into a logic 1 signal by a NOT gate <b>842</b> to reset flip-flops <b>832</b> and <b>834</b>. Thus, if the received signal of the fifth input node (Ci) is at logic 0 level, the cell <b>80</b> is bypassed. At that moment, the cell <b>80</b> does not perform any dividing operation and is equivalent to being in the reset state.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">At that moment, if the loaded divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub> is also at logic 0 level, an OR gate <b>852</b> of the circuit diagram <b>82</b> outputs a logic 0 signal from the third output node (Co). The logic 0 signal is transmitted to the fifth input node (Ci) of the previous stage. In other words, when the signal received on the fifth input node (Ci) of the cell <b>80</b> and the loaded divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, from the third input node (Di) are both at logic 0 level, the fifth stage cell <b>80</b> is bypassed and simultaneously outputs a logic 0 signal to the fifth input node (Ci) of the fourth stage cell <b>80</b> to bypass the fourth stage cell <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Regarding the foregoing circuit diagrams <b>72</b> and <b>82</b>, a conclusion is obtained: in the sixth embodiment of the present invention, when the last two loaded divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> are both at logic 0, the cell <b>70</b> and the fifth stage cell <b>80</b> of the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> are both bypassed. Furthermore, when the loaded divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub> are all at logic 0, the cell <b>70</b>, the fourth stage cell <b>80</b> and the fifth stage cell <b>80</b> are bypassed. Thus, the division range of the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> can be extended by programming the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;2&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;3&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, if the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;i&gt;</sub> is 0001000, which is the binary value of 8, the divisor value is 8. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 0001001, which is the binary value of 9, the divisor value is 9. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 0111111, the divisor value is <b>63</b>. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 1000000, the divisor value is 64. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, . . . , and Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub> is 1111111, the divisor value is 127.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the sixth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, since the last three stages of the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> may be bypassed, the signal, <b>3</b>-Mo, output from the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell <b>60</b> is employed as the result signal Fout.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">An obvious feature of the sixth embodiment of the present invention is that only the cells having the bypass mode, such as cells <b>70</b> and <b>80</b>, have to be synchronously reloaded with the corresponding divisor signal in order to extend the division range and to guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the result signal Fout. Accordingly, the complexity and implementation cost are further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Note that, six cells employed in the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> is just an example for convenience of illustration. In practical implementation, the number of cells employed in the programmable frequency divider is not necessarily limited to six, and any number of employed cells should also be included in the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, which depicts a flowchart of the method for changing divisors in a programmable frequency divider comprising a plurality of cascaded cells. The flowchart comprises the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Step <b>900</b>: Start.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Step <b>902</b>: Providing a plurality of divisor signals.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Step <b>904</b>: Selectively switching each of the plurality of cells to a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three mode according to the plurality of divisor signals.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Step <b>906</b>: Synchronously resetting at least a part of the plurality of cells.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Step <b>908</b>: End.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> are used as examples in the following illustration. In Step <b>902</b>, a divisor is represented in a binary form. Each bit of the binary divisor is represented as a divisor signal and ready on the third input node (Di) of a corresponding cell. Each cell is then reloaded with the corresponding divisor signal. In the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, each cell <b>60</b> is loaded with the corresponding divisor signal (such as Di<sub>&lt;1&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;2&gt;</sub>, or Di<sub>&lt;3&gt;</sub>) when triggered by the rising edge of the working clock, i.e. the signal received on the first input node (Fi). Additionally, each of the cells <b>80</b> and cell <b>70</b> is loaded with the corresponding divisor signal (Di<sub>&lt;4&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;5&gt;</sub>, Di<sub>&lt;6&gt;</sub> or Di<sub>&lt;7&gt;</sub>) when the fourth input node (Rl) triggered by the raising edge of the reload signal. However, in the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, each cell is synchronously loaded with a corresponding divisor signal when the fourth input node (Rl) triggered by the rising edge of the reload signal.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In Step <b>904</b>, each cell switches to a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three mode according to the loaded divisor signal. In the two embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the plurality of divisor signals further determines whether each of the cells having the bypass mode, such as the cell <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>70</b>, or <b>80</b> is bypassed or not. Regarding a cell with the bypass mode, if the divisor signals input to the cell and each of its subsequent cells having the bypass mode are logic 0, the cell is bypassed and does not perform any dividing operation. In addition, the last divisor signal determines whether the last stage, such as the cell <b>40</b> or the cell <b>70</b>, is bypassed or not.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the programmable frequency divider <b>600</b>, the fifth stage cell <b>80</b> and the cell <b>70</b> are assumed bypassed after all the cells are loaded with a corresponding divisor signal. The bypassed cells <b>80</b> and <b>70</b> are then synchronously reset in Step <b>906</b>. At that moment, the bypassed cells stop performing the dividing operation. In the programmable frequency divider <b>500</b>, after all the cells are loaded with a corresponding divisor signal, the fifth stage cell <b>50</b> and the cell <b>40</b> are assumed bypassed. In Step <b>906</b>, similarly, the bypassed cells are then synchronously reset. After reset, each of the bypassed cells renews its dividing operation according to the loaded divisor signal.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As mentioned above, after the divisor is changed, each of the bypassed cells of the programmable frequency divider of the present invention stops its dividing operation and each of the cells which is not bypassed renews its dividing operation based on a loaded divisor signal after reset. Accordingly, after the divisor is changed, the frequency of the result signal Fout output from the programmable frequency divider is thereby guaranteed to be the result of the frequency of the source signal Fin divided with the divisor.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In other words, the method for changing divisors of the present invention has the following features: First, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention only needs to utilize simple flip-flops and logic gates to extend the division range instead of employing additional programmable prescaler. Second, in order to guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the output signal, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention resets the dividing cells when changing the divisor value, so that each cell renews operation according to the divisor signal loaded when reset. Third, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention is capable of generating the result signal with continuous pulses by both synchronously resetting each cell and synchronously reloading each cell with a corresponding divisor signal. Fourth, each of the dividing cells of the programmable frequency divider is modularized, so that the cost and complexity of the circuit implementation is thereby effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.</p>
