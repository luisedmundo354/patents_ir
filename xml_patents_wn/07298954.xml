<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An improved waveguide shuttle optical switch design which provides the function of a variable optical attenuator (VOA). A small degree of intentional misalignment of the waveguide will create different levels of optical attenuation. By finely controlling the misalignment of a selected switched position, a single device may be realized that will provide the functions of both switching and attenuating or just attenuation alone. The optical MEMS device utilizes a latching mechanism in association with a thermal drive actuator for aligning a waveguide shuttle platform. The integration of the switching function and the VOA function reduce the optical loss which is otherwise unavoidable when the inevitable alternative of a separate switch and a separate VOA must necessarily be employed. The resultant improved device can also be applied for correcting the difference in optical intensity created by the manufacturing tolerances inherent in the fabrication of array waveguide gratings.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) attenuators and more particularly to variable optical attenuators.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The telecommunications industry is undergoing dramatic changes with increased competition, relentless bandwidth demand, and a migration toward more data-centric network architectures. First generation point-to-point wave division multiplex systems have eased the traffic bottleneck in the backbone portion of a network. As a new cross-connect architecture moves the technology closer to the subscriber side of the network, operators are challenged to provide services at the optical layer, calling for more flexible networks that switch, attenuate and reroute wavelengths. This is placing great emphasis and demand for wavelength agile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The need to provide services “just in time” by allocation of wavelengths, and further migration of the optical layer from the high-capacity backbone portion to the local loop, is driving the transformation of the network toward an all optical network in which basic network requirements will be performed in the optical layer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The optical network is a natural evolution of point-to-point dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) transport to a more dynamic, flexible, and intelligent networking architecture to improve service delivery time. The main element of the optical network is the wavelength (channel), which will be provisioned, configured, routed, attenuated and managed in the optical domain. Intelligent optical networking will be first deployed as an “opaque” network in which periodic optical-electrical conversion will be required to monitor and isolate signal impairments. Longer range, the optical network will evolve to a “transparent” optical network in which a signal is transported from its source to a destination entirely within the optical domain.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A key element of the emerging optical network is an optical add/drop multiplexer (OADM). An OADM will drop or add specific wavelength channels without affecting the through channels. Fixed OADMs can simplify the network and readily allow cost-effective DWDM migration from simple point-to-point topologies to fixed multi-point configurations. True dynamic OADM, in which reconfiguration is done in the optical domain without optical-electrical conversion, would allow dynamically reconfigurable, multi-point DWDM optical networks. This dynamically reconfigurable multi-point architecture is slated to be the next major phase in network evolution, with true OADM an enabling network element for this architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On chip integration of optical switching and planar light circuits has the potential to greatly reduce the size and manufacturing costs of multi-component optical equipment such as Variable Optical Attenuators (VOAs). Current costs for Variable Optical Attenuators (VOAs) are significant, limiting their use to long-haul optical telecommunications networks. In order to extend their use into the metropolitan network the cost will need to be decreased by an order of magnitude without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One solution in particular to decreasing cost is through the integration of components, where the primary cost savings will be in packaging. A number of approaches are being pursued for optical integration using Planar Light Circuit (PLC) technologies. The majority of approaches use a silica-on-silicon platform with the VOA formed from the integration of silica Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWG's) for multiplexing and demultiplexing, with Thermo-Optic (TO) attenuators for performing the add/drop and pass of the demultiplexed signal. The use of a low-index contrast silica-on-silicon platform severely limits the yield of these components due to the requirement for uniform thick oxide films over large areas to form the waveguides. The use of TO attenuators limits the extensibility due to high-power requirements and thermal cross-talk.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A number of different materials and switching technologies are being explored for fabricating chip-scale photonic lightwave circuits such as AWG's for demultiplexers and multiplexers, Variable Optical Attenuators (VOA's) and Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs). The main material platforms include silica wafers, silica-on-silicon substrates using both thin film deposition and wafer bonding techniques, polymer waveguides defined on silicon substrates, and silicon-on-insulator substrates. The main switching technologies include Mach-Zehnder interferometers based on either a thermo-optic or electro-optic effect, and MEMS mechanical waveguide switches and attenuators.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While silica waveguides have optical properties that are well matched to the optical properties of conventional single mode fibers, and thus couple well to them, they require thick cladding layers due to the low index of refraction contrast between the waveguide core and cladding materials, making them difficult to fabricate using planar processing techniques for fabrication and integration with other on-chip optical devices. The low index of refraction contrast, An, between core and cladding also requires large bending radii to limit optical loss during propagation through the photonic lightwave circuit, leading to large chip footprints and low die yields (&lt;50%).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, silica based waveguide attenuators are typically based on Mach-Zehnder interference using thermo-optic effects, that have a limited Extinction Ratio (ER) of around 25-30 dB, require significant power due to the low thermo-optic coefficient of silica, have problems with thermal cross-talk between the different optical channels and have a sinusoidal rather than a digital optical response.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">What is needed is a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) platform for monolithically integrating optical, mechanical and electrical functions. The use of a silicon platform enables fabrication of components using the vast infrastructure and process development available for semiconductor IC manufacturing at silicon foundries. By fabricating the MEMS switches, attenuators and waveguides in the same material, single crystal silicon, there are no stress and strain issues as exist with heterogeneous materials sets such as silica-on-silicon. Fabrication in silicon also allows for integration with CMOS microelectronics for control and sensing capabilities, and for free-carrier plasma dispersion effects to enable signal leveling using integrated VOA's. The high index contrast of silicon (n=3.5) enables the ridge waveguide structures to make tight turns with minimum optical bending loss, decreasing overall chip size to centimeter dimensions.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The teaching as provided herein below provides for an improved waveguide shuttle optical switch design which provides the function of switching and also performs the function of a variable optical attenuator (VOA). After the optical switching of a movable waveguide associated with the waveguide shuttle optical switch, a small degree of intentional misalignment of the movable waveguide will create different levels of optical attenuation. By finely controlling the misalignment of a selected switched position, the device can thereby provide the functions of both switching and attenuating. This exemplary integration of the switching function and the VOA function also reduce the optical loss which is otherwise unavoidable when the inevitable alterative of a separate switch and a separate VOA must necessarily be employed. This improved device can also be applied for correcting the difference in optical intensity created by the manufacturing tolerances inherent in the fabrication of an array waveguide grating (AWG).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An optical micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) combination waveguide shuttle optical switch and attenuator is herein disclosed below. In one embodiment the optical MEMS attenuator is used as an M×N optical signal switching system. The optical MEMS attenuator comprises a plurality of optical waveguides formed on a waveguide shuttle platform for switching optical states wherein the state of the optical attenuator is changed by a system of drive and latch actuators. The optical MEMS device utilizes a latching mechanism in association with a thermal drive actuator for aligning the waveguide shuttle platform. MEMS waveguide shuttle provides a parallel and symmetric movement of waveguides for optical switching. The advantages of the design herein over an approach employing a cantilever waveguide, is the lower power consumption from lowering the spring constant, and the larger travel distance that may be readily realized. As will be evident to one skilled in the art, the optical MEMS device may be integrated with other optical components to form planar light circuits (PLCs). When attenuators and PLCs are integrated together on a silicon chip, compact higher functionality devices, such as Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs), can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown a top plane view of an optical MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) switch <b>200</b> in accordance with the present invention. All components shown may be fabricated in a single-crystal silicon (SCS) layer <b>240</b> using a self-aligned process. The optical MEMS switch utilizes a latching mechanism <b>220</b> in association with a thermal drive actuator <b>230</b> for aligning a waveguide shuttle <b>250</b>. The components fabricated in the device layer of an SOI wafer may be released by sacrificial etching of the buried oxide layer. In use the optical MEMS switch <b>200</b> may be integrated with other optical components to form planar light circuits (PLCs). When switches and PLCs are integrated together on a silicon chip, compact higher functionality devices, such as Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs), may be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the optical switch <b>200</b> comprises one or more thermal drive actuators <b>230</b> having associated during fabrication one or more thermal latch actuators <b>221</b>, each thermal latch actuator <b>221</b> defining translating latch teeth <b>222</b>. The movable waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b> defines a plurality of optical waveguides <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> which may be connected with suspension elements shown as one or more folded springs <b>270</b>. A tether <b>234</b> connects the one or more thermal drive actuators <b>230</b> to the movable waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b>. A linkage <b>228</b> connects one or more linkage teeth <b>224</b> to the thermal drive actuator <b>230</b>. The latch teeth <b>222</b> are located to determine one or more latched state positions wherein electrical stimuli is timed to actuate the thermal drive <b>230</b> and thermal latch actuators <b>221</b> so as to switch between equilibrium and latched states. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the one or more linkage teeth <b>224</b> move in an orthogonal direction with respect to the translating latch teeth <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the optical switch <b>200</b> is shown in its initial cross-state position. The thermal drive actuator(s) <b>230</b> are used to move the waveguide shuttle <b>250</b> to its non-equilibrium position (pass-state), while the thermal latch mechanism <b>220</b> can maintain the system in the pass-state. The latching thermal actuators <b>221</b> are fabricated to provide sufficient force to hold the waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b> in its non-equilibrium (cross-state) position. In operation the. optical switch <b>200</b> can be unlatched by passing current through the latch actuators <b>221</b>, thereby opening the latch so the waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b> returns to its equilibrium position (cross-state) under the restoring force provided by the four-folded shuttle springs <b>270</b>. The thermal drive and latch actuators <b>230</b> and <b>221</b> are defined during fabrication in the SCS layer <b>240</b> and are self-aligned. Similarly, the shuttle waveguides <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> and stationary waveguides <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> are also defined in the SCS layer <b>240</b> and are self aligned. Since the latching mechanism <b>220</b>, waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b> and waveguides are defined in a self-aligned process during manufacturing, the alignment between the shuttle waveguides <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and the stationary waveguides <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> will be near perfect in the x-y plane. Additionally, the optical switch <b>200</b> needs to be sufficiently stiff in the z direction, or carefully designed to avoid forces in the z direction, to avoid misalignment in the z direction. Sufficient displacement, restoring and suspension forces can be attained through the design of the thermal drive actuator <b>230</b> and the folded springs <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The folded springs <b>270</b> are used for restoring and suspending the waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b>. The folded springs <b>270</b> may be designed using the equation for the spring constant K=(Eab<sup>3</sup>)/(8L<sup>3</sup>) where “a” is the thick dimension of the beams that make up the spring and “b” is the thin dimension of the beam that make up the spring. “L” is the length of the beam that makes up the spring, and “E” is Young's modulus (165 GPa for polysilicon, 190 GPa for single crystal silicon). The length L of the beams and the width of the beams can be adjusted to make the springs sufficiently flexible for the thermal drive actuator(s) <b>230</b> to deflect them between the two functional positions (Δx˜12 μm).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, the waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b> has moving waveguides <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> respectively, wherein the waveguide shuttle platform <b>250</b> is moved between two positions. The first or equilibrium position (cross-state) has stationary input and output waveguides <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> aligned with shuttle waveguides <b>252</b> and <b>254</b>. In the second or non-equilibrium position (pass-state) the movable shuttle waveguide <b>256</b> connects the stationary input waveguide <b>244</b> to the stationary output waveguide <b>242</b>. The folded springs <b>270</b> provide the restoring force to return the switch channel to the cross-state once the latch <b>220</b> has been released. Therefore, the movable shuttle platform <b>250</b> is pulled or pushed by the one or more thermal drive actuators <b>230</b>. The one or more drive actuators <b>230</b> may also act as suspension elements for the movable shuttle platform <b>250</b>. The movable shuttle platform <b>250</b> can be deflected bi-directionally and has mechanical features to increase or reduce the stiffness of the movable shuttle platform <b>250</b> and associated suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Switches can often be described as “latching” or “non-latching”. A latching switch reliably preserves the switch state even if the power is removed or lost. A non-latching switch may revert to an unknown position when the power is lost, for example when the current provided to a thermal actuator or electromagnetic solenoid is lost.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> the timing sequence of the signals used to actuate the thermal drive <b>230</b> and thermal latch <b>220</b> mechanisms and corresponding movement are shown, where the voltages are labeled assuming the potential of the handle wafer or base substrate <b>260</b> is zero. The first portion <b>226</b> of the timing diagram shows the latching sequence. The first step in the latching sequence is to apply voltages <b>225</b> having equal but opposite polarities, a voltage +V<b>1</b> to one end of each thermal latch actuator <b>221</b>, and a voltage −V<b>1</b> to the other end of each latch actuator <b>221</b>. The voltages <b>225</b> on the thermal latch actuators <b>221</b> induce ohmic heating in the actuator beams, causing thermal expansion and the subsequent opening <b>227</b> of the latch <b>220</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. While the latch actuator voltage <b>225</b> is still applied, the drive actuator <b>230</b> is stimulated a second set of voltages <b>235</b> having equal but opposite polarities, a voltage +V<b>2</b> at one end and a voltage −V<b>2</b> at the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows how the resulting thermal expansion of the thermal drive actuator <b>230</b> sufficient to move the waveguide shuttle <b>250</b> and linkage having linkage teeth <b>224</b>. The drive actuator <b>230</b> is moved far enough to the right <b>237</b> for the linkage teeth <b>224</b> to be well to the right side of a pair of latch teeth <b>222</b> supported by thermal actuators <b>221</b>. Next the thermal latch actuator voltages return to zero, and the latch closes. To finish the latching sequence, the drive actuator voltages return to zero. As the drive actuator <b>230</b> cools, the linkage teeth <b>224</b> are drawn in tension against the latch teeth <b>222</b> which holds the shuttle <b>250</b> in the desired latched position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The shuttle waveguide <b>256</b> now connects the stationary waveguide <b>244</b> to stationary waveguide <b>242</b>. To return the optical switch to its original state, the same sequence of voltages are applied in the reverse timing, as shown in the unlatch portion <b>272</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that, although the timing diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts square wave voltage pulses, this depiction is meant to be illustrative only of the basic timing, and does not preclude the use of other waveforms. Furthermore, the voltages applied to the thermal actuators need not be symmetric about zero. However, the use of equal but opposite polarity pulses, as described above, results in a constant zero voltage at the center of each actuator throughout the latch and unlatch cycle, which reduces electrostatic forces between the thermal actuators and the handle wafer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</figref>, an additional strain relief element is included to reduce stress in the latched state. A “hitch” <b>332</b> and <b>333</b>, shown on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, transfers the pulling force to displace the shuttle <b>350</b> during drive actuation. After latching, the hitch <b>330</b> allows the drive actuator <b>320</b> to return to its initial state without compressing the linkage <b>334</b> between the drive and the latch, thereby decreasing the force load at the engaged teeth <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</figref>, there is shown the actuator <b>330</b> and in-plane hitch <b>332</b> and <b>333</b> respectively. The actuation of this system is analogous to the system embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the timing sequence of the signals is shown used to actuate the drive and latch mechanisms, where the voltages are labeled assuming the potential of the handle wafer or base substrate <b>360</b> is zero. Once again the first step in the latching sequence is to apply a pair of voltages <b>325</b>, +V<b>1</b> to one end of each latch actuator, and a voltage −V<b>1</b> to the other end of each latch actuator. The voltages on the latch actuators induce ohmic heating in the actuator beams, causing thermal expansion and the subsequent opening of the latch as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. While the latch actuator voltage is still applied, the drive actuator <b>330</b> is stimulated with a pair of voltages <b>335</b>, +V<b>2</b> at one end and a voltage −V<b>2</b> at the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows how the resulting thermal expansion <b>337</b> of the drive actuator <b>330</b> is sufficient to move the waveguide shuttle <b>350</b> and linkage <b>334</b> far enough to the right for the linkage teeth <b>324</b> to be well to the right side of the latch teeth <b>322</b>. Next the latch actuator voltages return to zero, and the latch closes. To finish the latching sequence, the drive actuator voltages return to zero. As the drive actuator cools, the linkage teeth <b>324</b> are drawn in tension against the latch teeth <b>322</b> which holds the switch in the desired latched position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The shuttle waveguide <b>356</b> now connects the stationary waveguide <b>344</b> with stationary waveguide <b>342</b>. To return the switch to its original state, the same sequence of voltages are applied in the reverse timing, as shown in the unlatch portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The attenuator waveguides are made together on a single crystal silicon wafer using widely available semiconductor processing equipment. Such on-chip integration avoids the complex alignment issues associated with manually connecting different and larger components with optical fibers, and avoids the cost and space associated with manufacturing, assembling and packaging the separate components of optical switches. On-chip integration with other components can drive down the cost of manufacturing attenuators and the installation of these complicated devices by a factor of ten or more.</p>

where k is the wave vector of the light. The Fabry-Perot resonance condition is thus:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>d=mλ/</i>2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where m=1, 2 . . . , and λ is the wavelength of the light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that the optimal gap value d are 0.775 μm, 1.55 μm, 2.325 μm, 3.1 μm, 3.875 μm, 4.65 μm etc for λ=1.55 μm. The gap distance of 2.325 μum has less loss by as much as 5 dB compared to the gap distance of 1.9 μm or 2.7 μm.
</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other methods such as applying antireflection (AR) coating <b>82</b> on the gap facet can also reduce the transmission loss through the gap (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Applying silicon oxide or silicon nitride coating <b>84</b> along the sidewall of the waveguide can also reduce the overall optical loss (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Such techniques are exemplary for increasing the effective dynamic range of useful attenuation that may be realized in a combined Integrated optical switch also functioning as a variable optical attenuator as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The simulation of light propagation through the gap between the fixed waveguide and the movable waveguide is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The waveguide width is 3 μm and the air gap is 2 μm in this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A &amp; 10B</figref> graphically show the perfectly aligned cantilever beam waveguide geometries and resultant attenuation <b>92</b> respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A &amp; 11B</figref> depict the waveguide geometries and resultant attenuation <b>94</b> respectively for a purposely misaligned cantilever beam waveguide as misaligned by 1 μm. The optical loss <b>92</b> for the perfectly aligned waveguides is due to the air gap between the “in” waveguide <b>52</b> on the cantilever and the “Out” waveguides <b>44</b>. Taper at the light-receiving waveguide <b>44</b> (width of 4 μm tapered to 3 μm over a distance of 200 μm in this study) is added for better optical coupling. The results clearly show that fine-tuning the misalignment could achieve the attenuation of the light intensity to the desired level.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> provides depiction of one embodiment for an Integrated optical switch functioning as a variable optical attenuator. Much here is as described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> above. However, here the linkage teeth <b>224</b> are provided with a plethora of latching teeth <b>222</b> with which they may be engaged. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> provides a blow-up of the area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicting in an alternative embodiment, another differentiation here from the structure otherwise the same as that provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The saw-tooth linkage teeth <b>224</b> are smaller here so as to best mate with the similarly saw toothed latching teeth <b>222</b> so as to allow small micro-incremental displacement of linkage <b>228</b>. By providing this small micro-incremental displacement of linkage <b>228</b> the movable optical waveguide <b>254</b> may be correspondingly micro-incrementally misaligned from the fixed stationary optical waveguide <b>244</b>. It is these small micro-incrementally misalignments from fixed stationary optical waveguide <b>244</b> (relative the fully aligned position) which will provide correspondingly varying amounts of optical attenuation. By the term micro-incrementally misaligned, here, it is meant that the amount of misalignment is but a fractional part of the total waveguide width.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As will be evident to those skilled in the art, and in alternative to the depiction provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the above methodology and arrangement may be applied with but a single fixed stationary optical waveguide <b>244</b> and a single movable optical waveguide <b>254</b>, so that only the attenuation function is provided, and is thus absent the above described switching functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The waveguide shuttle <b>250</b> may be actuated by MEMS actuators such as, but not limited to, heat actuators, electrostatic actuators, electromagnetic actuators, and piezoelectric actuators. Results of the waveguide shuttle <b>250</b> by using a heat actuator shows that the tip of waveguide <b>52</b> displaces 15.3 μm as a V-shape actuator is heated to 600° C. In some embodiments, this distance (15.3 μm) would be the total traveling distance as an optical switch. For useful function as a variable optical attenuator, the waveguide shuttle only needs to move 2 μm or less. Therefore, as 2 μm of misalignment can achieve the desired optical attenuation, the waveguide <b>52</b> and waveguide shuttle <b>250</b> need only travel 13.3 μm to provide the function both a switch and a VOA together.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Various servo type approaches may be taken to effectuate this single optical gap and waveguide shuttle <b>250</b> VOA. An analog approach may provide a static voltage level representative of a desired attenuation level. A down stream sensor would then provide a voltage level as indication of attenuation. A voltage comparator upon comparison of these two levels would then provide a resultant closed loop control signal indicative of any need to readjust the micro-misalignment of the moveable optical waveguide. Those skilled in the art will understand that this may just as easily be performed digitally under either hardwired or software control. The choice will typically reside in the system environment and chip hardware environment in which the VOA is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts an alternative embodiment for linkage teeth <b>224</b> and latching teeth <b>222</b> where a stair-step arrangement is provided on their respective mating faces. As thermal latch actuator <b>221</b> and thermal drive actuator <b>230</b> interoperate small micro-incremental displacements of linkage <b>228</b> may accordingly be latched in place. Additional linkage teeth <b>224</b> identically provided with the stair-step faces will be provided along linkage <b>228</b> corresponding for each stationary optical waveguide <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, etc. for which switching coupled with attenuation is desired. If attenuation is not needed then a single plain rectangular tooth devoid of the stair-step mating faces need only be substituted. It should be noted that one specific latched position between the linkage teeth <b>224</b> and the latching teeth <b>222</b> is for straight alignment of waveguides <b>244</b> and <b>252</b>. At this position there is no optical attenuation other than normal gap loss.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> provides yet another alternative embodiment for driving linkage <b>228</b> micro-incrementally. Wedge block <b>150</b> is driven by a thermal actuator between the tip of linkage <b>228</b> and a fixed pin <b>151</b> in direction <b>152</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> provides an alternative to the infinitely variable embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by providing facets <b>160</b> which will give distinct incremental values of misalignment. The linkage <b>228</b> has anchors <b>29</b> to reduce the torque of the linkage <b>228</b> and to ensure the moving direction of the linkage <b>228</b> is perpendicular to the direction <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> schematically depicts the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> as provided with a return spring <b>170</b> so as to counteract the force of a thermal actuator pushing the wedge block <b>150</b> in direction <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> there is depicted yet a further alternative embodiment for micro-incremental misalignment. A gear toothed cam <b>180</b> is driven by a mated toothed drive bar <b>181</b> affixed to a thermal actuator and directionally driven as noted by arrow <b>182</b>. To make the linkage <b>228</b> move incrementally, the cam <b>180</b> is anchored off the center where the radius R<b>1</b> is the same as the radius R<b>2</b>, but the radius R<b>3</b> is different than the radius R<b>4</b> and the radius R<b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> provides an alternative to the continuously variable embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> by providing facets <b>190</b> which will give distinct discretely variable incremental values of misalignment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> provides depiction of an embodiment essentially the same as that provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> but with the addition of a range limiting slot <b>195</b> and stop pin <b>196</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is much the same but the cam can be driven individually via connector rod <b>197</b> with readings <b>198</b> indicating the traveling distance of the linkage <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As will be well understood by those skilled in the art, there are many ways in which to actuate and provide micro-incremental misalignment, and indeed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> there is depicted yet a further embodiment employable where sufficient coefficients of friction are provided. Here teeth <b>222</b> are brought to bear directly upon linkage <b>228</b>. Typically the MEMS structures shown herein are made using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) on single crystalline silicon or silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. The etching gas can be SF<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, or combination of these gases. For example, the chlorine etching can create vertical roughness (i.e. the roughness pattern is vertical to the wafer face), whereas Bosch process (using SF<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) can create horizontal roughness. For these embodiments, a chlorine process is chosen to create vertical roughness for better friction force. In addition, the etchant gas concentration may be varied, as well as the etching temperatures and gas flow rates for optimized roughness so as to increase the friction coefficient and thereby enhance the tune-ability. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> provides linkage <b>228</b> with a dovetail structure <b>199</b> that can enhance the clamping operation where the friction coefficient is insufficient.</p>
