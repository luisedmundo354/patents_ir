<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is entitled to the benefit of my Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/432,037 filed in the United States Patent and Trademarks Office on Dec. 10, 2002.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to anti-theft devices mounted to the person, and more particularly for a belt mounted ID/credit card anti-theft device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the proliferate use of credit cards, health cards and identification cards there is an increased potential for loss, theft and fraudulent misuse of these cards and the data contained on them. Pockets, wallets and purses do not offer the anti-theft characteristics necessary to protect these valuable objects. Money belts, often used to store such items, are cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. There have been several attempts to develop an anti-theft device to hold these types of items. One example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,068,787 entitled “Money Buckle” issued to Craighead on Jan. 17, 1978. Craighead teaches a storage device that is mounted to a belt and is particularly adapted for paper objects and uses a flap to secure the contents within the storage chamber. Craighead is not adapted for securely storing a plurality of modern credit cards and identification cards. The flap closure and outward positioning of the Craighead device leaves such valuable items stored within it vulnerable to loss and theft. Furthermore, Craighead cannot be easily demounted from the belt to which it is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Given the increasing amount of information of a personal and commercial nature stored on modern cards, there is a continued need for an anti-theft device that can be easily worn by the wearer and provides a high degree of security to the contents stored in the device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to overcome the deficiencies in known anti-theft devices worn on the person.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a belt mounted anti-theft device for storing a plurality of identification cards and credit cards and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of the invention is to provide a belt mounted anti-theft device that is able to be comfortably worn by the wearer on a waist belt or bag strap.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a belt mounted anti-theft device that can be demounted from a belt without having to undo the belt.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The objects of the present invention are satisfied through the provision of a belt mounted ID/credit card anti-theft device adapted for securely holding at least one card. The anti-theft device comprises a first rectangular body and a second elongate body. The first rectangular body is dimensioned so as to receive and securely hold at least one card in a single chamber. The second elongate body is adapted to securely close the open end of the first rectangular body in a locking engagement and to fasten the first rectangular body to waist belt of the wearer or a strap on a bag or back pack worn by the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the rectangular first body is adapted to hold a plurality of cards in two chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and drawings.</p>

For the purpose, only, of describing the novel and inventive features of my device, I will describe the first rectangular body (<b>18</b>) as having an upper portion (<b>21</b>) and a bottom portion (<b>22</b>). A person skilled in the art of mold making will be able to use this detailed description in order to fabricate a mold in the most cost-effective and efficient manner available. The shape or type of mold or the manner of molding does not constitute an inventive aspect of my invention. However the use of modem, resilient thermoplastic polymers does constitute an inventive aspect of my invention. Furthermore, while it is understood that the device is fixed to a belt, for the purposes of illustration, the device depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described as if it were placed on a flat surface. Continuing, the bottom portion (<b>22</b>) is cohesively joined to the upper portion (<b>21</b>) at first end (<b>24</b>). When the belt mounted anti-theft device is mounted to a belt, upper portion (<b>21</b>) faces away from the waist of the wearer and the device is positioned between the belt and the waist of the wearer. The bottom portion (<b>22</b>) is adjacent to the waist of the wearer. The concave shape of the bottom portion (<b>22</b>) is adapted to conform comfortably to the waist of the wearer. Furthermore the first end (<b>24</b>) of the first rectangular body (<b>18</b>) and the second end (<b>26</b>) of the second elongate body (<b>20</b>) are also contoured for comfort of the wearer while the device is on the belt or in hand. Since Section A-A- is along the mid-line (<b>4</b>) of first rectangular body (<b>18</b>), it intersects the oblong cut out (<b>54</b>) and (<b>56</b>) located in the upper portion (<b>21</b>) and lower portion (<b>22</b>) respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the reader is provided with a further depiction of Section A-A showing the relationship between my invention (<b>10</b>) and a belt (<b>11</b>). Arrow (<b>15</b>) shows the direction of the waist of the wearer. Therefore, it is understood that the device is positioned behind the belt between the belt and the waist of the wearer. The belt (<b>11</b>) is held in place by finger member (<b>180</b>) as more fully explained herein. As well, belt (<b>11</b>) is looped through slot (<b>102</b>) in second elongate body (<b>20</b>) created by looping member (<b>100</b>) as more fully described herein with reference to subsequent figures. Belt (<b>11</b>) is positioned over oblong cut out (<b>54</b>). It is therefore, one advantage of my invention that once the card (<b>12</b>) is inserted into the chamber (<b>30</b>), second elongate body (<b>20</b>) acts to securely seal the chamber preventing the card from falling out. Furthermore, because my invention is located behind the belt of the wearer, the device remains invisible and theft is virtually impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, Section A-A and Section B-B, the joining at (<b>24</b>) of the top portion (<b>21</b>) and the bottom portion (<b>22</b>) forms a rectangular chamber (<b>30</b>).

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there are shown three views A, B and C of the second elongate body (<b>20</b>) of my invention. Referring first to view B, there is shown the resilient locking member (<b>82</b>) fixed to the second elongate closing body (<b>20</b>). Locking stud (<b>84</b>) is also shown at the free end (<b>83</b>) of member (<b>82</b>). The fixed end (<b>90</b>) of member (<b>82</b>) is positioned intermediate the length of the second closing body (<b>20</b>). Fixed end (<b>90</b>) of the member (<b>82</b>) depends from breach (<b>92</b>) that is adapted for sliding engagement with T-slot (<b>80</b>). Breach (<b>92</b>) commences at the top end (<b>94</b>) of the second elongate body (<b>20</b>) and terminates at the same point that member (<b>82</b>) commences, that is, intermediate the length of the second elongate body (<b>20</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another view of the breach (<b>92</b>). The cross section of breach (<b>92</b>) is shown in view C, a top end view, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and is T-shaped to conform to the shape of T-slot (<b>80</b>) so that when the member (<b>82</b>) is locked into place, the breach (<b>92</b>) is interposed within the T-slot (<b>80</b>) in a snug and secure fit. When locking stud (<b>84</b>) is disengaged from locking orifice (<b>86</b>), a light effort will be required from the wearer to withdraw second elongate body (<b>20</b>) from the T-slot (<b>80</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown means for demountably mounting my invention to a belt. In this preferred embodiment of second body (<b>20</b>) there is included a looping member (<b>100</b>) fixed cohesively to second body (<b>20</b>). The looping member (<b>100</b>) is positioned on the closing body (<b>20</b>) so as to create a slot (<b>102</b>) between the second body (<b>20</b>) and the looping member (<b>100</b>). The slot (<b>102</b>) is adapted to receive a belt. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, also illustrates looping member (<b>100</b>) and slot (<b>102</b>). As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Section A-A, the belt (<b>11</b>) is placed through slot (<b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the wearer of the devices wishes to retrieve a card from the device, the wearer can easily disengage second elongate member (<b>20</b>) from first rectangular body (<b>18</b>) by depressing the locking stud (<b>82</b>) and resilient member (<b>82</b>) thereby disengaging the locking stud (<b>84</b>) from the locking orifice (<b>86</b>). Some controlled effort is required by the wearer to slide member (<b>82</b>) out of the T-slot (<b>80</b>) so the wearer can maintain control of the movements. The finger (<b>180</b>) is easily disengaged from the belt by a slight pull. The cards can now be dispensed by the wearer's thumb moving frictionally across the exposed upper or lower surface of the card through the orifice (<b>54</b>) or (<b>56</b>). Second elongate body (<b>20</b>) remains attached to the waist belt. When the wearer is finished with the card, the card is reinserted into the chamber, and the second elongate body is engaged by way of locking member (<b>82</b>) with the first rectangular body. The locking stud engages the locking orifice with an audible click to tell the wearer that the second elongate body is property attached and the device is securely closed. This same action reattaches first rectangular body to the waist belt. Finger (<b>180</b>) can be re-engaged with the belt and the anti-theft device is once more securely locked onto the belt of the wearer and invisible to casual on lookers.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Alternative Embodiments of the Looping Member</heading>
