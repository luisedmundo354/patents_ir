<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to framing and hanging upon walls sheet-like display items such as posters, calendars, and charts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sheet-like display items, e.g., posters, are often mounted upon walls and other surfaces using tacks or tape. Such mounting means are usually unattractive and detract from the display items. Further, these mounting means frequently damage the display item. Alternatively, the display items may be mounted using conventional, four-sided frames that are usually expensive. Furthermore, conventional frames are difficult and inconvenient to reuse.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of this invention to provide a new and improved apparatus for framing and hanging sheet-like display items that is attractive, relatively inexpensive, simple to manufacture, easy to assemble without tools, that does not ordinarily damage the display item while securely supporting the display item, and permits simple replacement of the display items and reuse of the apparatus. It is also an object of this invention to provide a retaining means that enables secure and non-marring retention of an article within a generally U-shaped channel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These objects, and others, which become apparent as the specification progresses, are accomplished by the present apparatus for framing and hanging sheet-like display items that, briefly stated, comprises first and second generally identical elongate members, each member having a longitudinally extending, generally U-shaped channel, formed by a web from which first and second sides extend, for receiving an edge of the sheet-like display item. At least one pair of first and second wells, both generally cylindrical in shape, is disposed coaxially within each elongate member wherein the central axis of the wells is generally transverse to the central axis of the elongate member and perpendicular to the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A retaining means is provided within each well of the elongate members for captively retaining the edges of the sheet-like display item. The retaining means comprises a magnet and a magnetic pin, e.g., a pin made from iron, steel or other metallic substance that is attracted to a magnet, both of which are preferably cylindrical in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The retaining means acts to captively retain an edge of a sheet-like display item that has been inserted into the generally U-shaped channel of an elongate member as follows. After an edge of a sheet-like display item has been inserted into a channel of an elongate member, a magnet is inserted into the first well and a magnetic pin is inserted into the second well. As the magnet pin is drawn to the magnet, the edge of the sheet-like display item is securely sandwiched between the magnet and pin. Since the magnet and pin are disposed within the coaxial wells, the retaining means captively retains the edge of the sheet-like display item within the elongate member. The retaining means of the present invention can place substantial pressure on the sheet-like display item and securely hold the item within the channels of the present framing apparatus, without twisting, tearing, or otherwise damaging the sheet-like display item. Furthermore, the retaining means of the present invention is capable of securely retaining alternative display items such as tapestries. The surfaces of the magnet and/or magnetic pin that contact the sheet-like display item may be covered with a resilient and non-skid material, e.g., rubber, cork, neoprene, or vinyl, to facilitate the retention and protection of the sheet-like display item. Alternatively, the magnet and/or magnetic pin may be modified, e.g., scored or provided with a pointed tip, to facilitate retention of the sheet-like display item. In addition, decorative caps, buttons, medallions, etc., may be affixed to the magnet and/or magnetic pin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The framing and hanging apparatus of the present invention may further comprise a front-cover member, with or without a back-cover member, that provides support and protection to the sheet-like display item. The cover members may be formed from glass, acrylic or some other similar material. The elongate members may be formed in a variety of profiles, e.g., round or square, from natural materials, e.g., wood, marble, metal, or glass, or synthetic materials, e.g., plastic. The apparatus for framing and hanging sheet-like display items may further comprise an elongate member sheath that may provide a variety of decorative features.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a preferred embodiment of the present invention including a sheet-like display item <b>10</b> suspended between generally identical first elongate member <b>16</b> and second elongate member <b>18</b> attached to top edge <b>12</b> and bottom edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. The first elongate member <b>16</b> and second elongate member <b>18</b> have the same configuration, but are inverted with respect to each other. Accordingly, the following detailed description of the second elongate member <b>18</b> also applies to the first elongate member <b>16</b>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second elongate member <b>18</b> has a longitudinally extending, generally U-shaped channel <b>20</b> for receiving the edge <b>14</b> of the display item <b>10</b>. The channel <b>20</b> is formed by a web <b>22</b> from which first side <b>24</b> and second side <b>26</b> extend. At least one pair of a first well <b>28</b> and a second well <b>30</b>, both generally cylindrical in shape, is disposed coaxially within the second elongate member <b>18</b> such that the central axis W of the wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> is generally transverse to the central axis E of the elongate member <b>18</b> and perpendicular to the sides <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the channel <b>20</b>. The first well <b>28</b> has a first inner opening <b>32</b> in the first side <b>24</b> of the channel <b>20</b> and a first outer opening <b>34</b> in the exterior of the elongate member <b>18</b>. The second well <b>30</b> has a second inner opening <b>36</b> in the second side <b>26</b> of the channel <b>20</b> and a second outer opening <b>38</b> in the exterior of the elongate member <b>18</b>. The diameter of the first well <b>28</b> is slightly larger than the diameter of the second well <b>30</b>. The material used to form the elongate members <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> is preferably a solid, natural material such as wood, glass, metal, or marble. The channel <b>20</b> and cylindrical wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be introduced into the first and second elongate members <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> by conventional milling, cutting, and drilling techniques. Alternatively, the elongate members <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> may be formed from a synthetic material such as plastic. Where the elongate members <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are formed by injection molding techniques, the channel <b>20</b> and wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be formed by an appropriate structure, e.g., ribs. The outer profile of the elongate members may be varied, e.g., round, square, etc., to provide different decorative features.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>3</b><i>a </i>illustrate a preferred embodiment of the retaining means for captively retaining the bottom edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> within the elongate member <b>18</b> that includes a magnet <b>40</b> and a magnetic pin <b>42</b>, both being generally cylindrical in shape. After the edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> is placed into the channel <b>20</b> of the elongate member <b>18</b>, the magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b> are placed within the first well <b>28</b> and second well <b>30</b>, respectively. As the magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b> are drawn together, the edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> is securely sandwiched between the magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b>. The edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> is thereby captively retained within the elongate member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The size of the magnet <b>40</b> is determined so that the magnet <b>40</b> may be easily inserted into and extracted from the first well <b>28</b>. The size of the magnetic pin <b>42</b> is similarly determined with respect to the second well <b>30</b>, and the magnetic pin <b>42</b> is provided with a flange <b>44</b>. Further, the diameter of the magnet <b>40</b> is slightly larger than the diameter of the second well <b>30</b>. This difference in size allows a user to easily separate the magnetic pin <b>42</b> from the magnet <b>40</b> when extracting the magnetic pin <b>42</b> from the second well <b>30</b>. More specifically, the magnet <b>40</b>, having a larger diameter than the second well <b>30</b>, will be blocked by the second side <b>26</b> of the channel <b>20</b> as the magnetic pin <b>42</b> is extracted from the second well <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the force of the magnet <b>40</b> is distributed against the second side <b>26</b> of the channel <b>20</b>, thereby allowing separation of the magnetic pin <b>42</b> from the magnet <b>40</b> without any damage to the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. The sheet-like display item <b>10</b> may then be easily removed from the apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref> illustrate alternative embodiments of the retaining means of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</figref><i>a</i>, the diameters of the magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b> are the same, and the diameters of the first well <b>28</b> and second well <b>30</b> are the same. In this embodiment, the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> is removed by pulling the display item <b>10</b> from the channel <b>20</b>. The magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b> are held securely within the wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> while the display item <b>10</b> is pulled from the channel <b>20</b>. After the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> has been removed, the magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b> may then be extracted from the wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the well <b>28</b> is replaced with a blind well <b>46</b> in which the magnet <b>40</b> is seated. In a variation of this embodiment, the magnetic pin <b>42</b> without the flange <b>44</b> may be seated within the blind well <b>46</b>, and the magnet <b>40</b> inserted into the well <b>30</b>. The magnet <b>40</b>, or magnetic pin <b>42</b>, may be secured within the blind well <b>46</b> with an adhesive such as an epoxy. In yet another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a groove <b>48</b> replaces the flange <b>44</b> of the magnetic pin <b>42</b> and the second outer opening <b>38</b> of the well is chamfered to allow fingertip access to the groove <b>48</b> of the magnetic pin <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> depict an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which the first elongate member <b>50</b> and second elongate member <b>52</b> are hollow. The first and second hollow elongate members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> have the same configuration, but are inverted with respect to each other. Accordingly, the following detailed description of the second hollow elongate member <b>52</b> also applies to the first hollow elongate member <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the second hollow elongate member <b>52</b> has a longitudinally extending slot <b>54</b>, and a first aperture <b>56</b> and a second aperture <b>58</b> coaxially positioned with their central axis A generally perpendicular to the plane of the slot <b>54</b>. To accommodate the retaining means described above, a housing <b>60</b> is disposed within the second hollow elongate member <b>52</b> wherein the housing <b>60</b> mates with the interior of the second hollow elongate member <b>52</b>. The housing <b>60</b> has a generally U-shaped channel <b>20</b> that is formed by a web <b>22</b> from which first and second sides <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> extend. The housing <b>60</b> also has a first well <b>28</b> and a second well <b>30</b>, both generally cylindrical in shape. The wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are positioned coaxially within the housing <b>60</b> such that the central axis W of the wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> is transverse to the central axis H of the housing and perpendicular to the sides <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the channel <b>20</b>. When the housing <b>60</b> is disposed within the second hollow elongate member <b>52</b>, the opening of the channel <b>20</b> registers with the slot <b>54</b>, and the wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> register with the first and second apertures <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively. The housing <b>60</b> may be secured within the hollow elongate member <b>52</b> with a conventional adhesive or a mechanical means such as a set screw. As described in detail with respect to the first embodiment above, the retaining means for captively retaining the edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> includes the magnet <b>40</b> and the magnetic pin <b>42</b>. The various alternative embodiments of the retaining means described above also may be used with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The hollow elongate members and housing may be formed from a variety of materials such as wood, metal, or plastic. The outer profile, as well as the inner profile, of the hollow elongate members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> may be varied, e.g., round, square, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A resilient and non-skid material, e.g., rubber, cork, neoprene, or vinyl, may be applied to the magnet <b>40</b> and magnetic pin <b>42</b> to enhance the ability of the retaining means to captively retain and protect the edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> within the channels <b>20</b> of the elongate members <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. Alternatively, the magnet <b>40</b> and/or magnetic pin <b>42</b> may be modified, e.g., scored or provided with a pointed tip, to facilitate retention of the sheet-like display item. While a cylindrical shape is the preferred profile for the wells, magnet and magnetic pin, other profiles, e.g., square, may be employed for these elements of the present apparatus for framing and hanging a sheet-like display item. In addition, the magnetic pin <b>42</b> may be replaced with another magnet <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The lengths of the first and second elongate members <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>50</b>, and <b>52</b>, and the number of retaining means may vary according to the size of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. For relatively narrow display items, a single retaining means centrally positioned in each elongate member may be sufficient for captively retaining the edges of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. For wider display items, two retaining means positioned in the elongate members near the corners of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> may be employed. Additional retaining means may be added and positioned appropriately in the elongate members as required by the width and/or weight of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. As an additional feature of the present invention, weight may be added to the elongate members to facilitate a tensioning of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> thereby smoothing the surface of the display item and enhancing the stability of the apparatus against disruption by wind or vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present apparatus for framing and hanging a sheet-like display item may further include a front-cover member <b>62</b> that provides additional support and protection to the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b</i>, <b>9</b><i>c </i>and <b>9</b><i>d </i>illustrate an embodiment of the front-cover member <b>62</b> having a top return <b>64</b> and a bottom return <b>66</b>. The front cover member <b>62</b> is sized so that it generally covers the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> with the top return <b>64</b> surrounding the top edge <b>12</b> and the bottom return <b>66</b> surrounding the bottom edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b>. The following descriptions of the second elongate member <b>18</b> and bottom return <b>66</b> also applies to the first elongate member <b>16</b> and top return <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, the bottom return <b>66</b> of the front-cover member <b>62</b> is provided with one or more cover member openings <b>68</b> that are positioned to correspond with the wells that are disposed in the elongate members. Accordingly, when a magnet <b>40</b> and a magnetic pin <b>42</b> are inserted into their respective wells <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, the magnetic pin <b>42</b> may pass through the cover member opening <b>68</b> to press the edge <b>14</b> of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> and the front-cover member <b>62</b> against the first side <b>24</b> of channel <b>20</b> due to the attraction of the magnet <b>40</b>, thereby captively retaining the edge <b>14</b> and front-cover member <b>62</b> within the elongate member <b>18</b>. In addition, since the magnetic pin <b>42</b> passes through the cover member opening <b>68</b> of the front-cover member <b>62</b> and may engage an inner edge of the opening <b>68</b>, the retaining means may more securely retain the combination of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> and front-cover member <b>62</b> within the channel <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>c </i>and <b>9</b><i>d </i>show another embodiment of the front-cover member <b>62</b><i>a </i>wherein the bottom return <b>66</b><i>a </i>does not extend past the well <b>30</b>. Accordingly, while a cover member opening <b>68</b> is not required in this embodiment, the magnetic pin <b>42</b> may engage the edge of the bottom return <b>66</b><i>a </i>to secure the combination of the sheet-like display item <b>10</b> and front-cover member <b>62</b><i>a </i>within the channel <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>e </i>shows another embodiment where a front-cover member <b>62</b><i>b</i>, which is formed without the returns, is used in conjunction with a back-cover member <b>70</b>. Both the front-cover member <b>62</b><i>b </i>and the back-cover member <b>70</b> are provided with cover member openings <b>68</b> that correspond to the location of the magnets <b>40</b> and magnetic pins <b>42</b>. The front- and back-cover members <b>62</b>, <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>70</b> may be formed from glass, acrylic or some other similar substantially rigid, transparent material. The back-cover member <b>70</b> may also be formed from cardboard, mat board, or the like. Alternatively, front-cover member <b>62</b> may be formed from a flexible, transparent material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To provide different decorative features on the framing and hanging apparatus, one or both of the elongate members may be enclosed with an elongate member sheath <b>72</b> having a plurality of cuffs <b>74</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The sheath may be applied to the elongate members <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> by inserting one end of an elongate member into a cuff <b>74</b> of the elongate member sheath <b>72</b>, and then bringing the other cuff <b>74</b> over the other end of the elongate member. A variety of materials, e.g., cloth, leather, plastic, or faux fur, may be used to form the elongate member sheath <b>72</b>. In addition, finials, of which the outer profile may be varied, may be added to the ends of the elongate members for added weight, as mentioned above, and for added decorative features. The framing and hanging apparatus of the present invention may be mounted or hung from ceilings or walls in a conventional manner. For example, the first elongate member <b>16</b> or first hollow elongate member <b>72</b> may be provided with a hole for hanging the assembly upon a nail or hook. Alternatively, the assembly may be hung by a wire or string that may be run through the channel <b>20</b>.</p>
