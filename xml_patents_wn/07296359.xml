<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the alignment of lasers, in particular gas lasers and other lasers with physically separate cavity mirrors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lasers are used for many purposes (e.g. etching, marking, cutting, and other heat or light related uses). For these purposes, alignment of the laser, for example for marking packages, requires alignment of the laser's output beam from the mounted position to the desired location. In conventional gas lasers, such as CO<sub>2 </sub>lasers, and some other laser types that use physically separate cavity mirrors, the laser beam is often not well aligned with the optical axis of the laser, and therefore not well aligned with the laser module housing the laser. Thus, when a laser in a production environment fails and is replaced with a new laser, some kind of re-alignment of the output beam is usually required. For example, the laser itself can be adjusted by adjusting the alignment of the cavity mirrors, or the laser module can be realigned as a whole so that the output beam points in the desired direction, or the output beam can be redirected by external optical components. This re-alignment is clearly not desirable. In some cases, users are provided with an in situ re-alignment component with a limited adjustment. Thus, when the output beam direction of the new unit diverges too far from center, there is often insufficient adjustment possible to re-align the output beam correctly. In these cases, customers reject the new unit completely and return it to the manufacturer as unusable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would thus be desirable to provide a laser module, in particular a gas laser module, in which the variation in output beam direction from unit to unit was minimized, or ideally minimal, so that the amount of beam adjustment needed would be kept low, or eliminated.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the invention there is provided a laser alignment method comprising: establishing a reference line, wherein the reference line is defined by a line intersecting a first datum point and a second datum point, where the first and second datum points are on a laser support system, wherein a laser is moveable with respect to the laser support system; establishing a laser beam line; rotating the laser about a first axis; rotating the laser about a second axis having a different direction of extent than the first axis, wherein the rotation about the first and second axis aligns the laser beam line so that the laser beam line is parallel to the reference line; and securing the laser support system to the laser.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an alternative of this laser alignment method, instead of rotating the laser, the laser is provided with a wedged output coupler and the output coupler is rotated to steer the beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following description of exemplary embodiment(s) is merely illustrative in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. Alternative embodiments can be devised without departing from the spirit or the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To avoid obscuring the relevant details, the discussion herein may not discuss all well-known elements associated with laser systems and the alignment of laser systems; however such details are intended to be included within the scope of embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As mentioned, laser beams are not typically aligned to the laser's optical axis. One way this misalignment can be caused is by an output coupler, which serves as the exit optic. The output coupler's front surface reflects a portion of the laser light through a lasing medium to a rear mirror (e.g. near total reflector) creating the internal optical axis. The lasing medium lies between the output coupler's front surface and the rear mirror. Since optics have thicknesses, the output coupler's rear surface is anti-reflective coated to eliminate reflections off the rear surface back through the lasing medium to the rear mirror. However, when the output beam exits the laser, there is a refraction by the front surface of the output coupler. Since the front and rear surfaces of the output coupler can not be exactly parallel, the output coupler's rear surface refracts the beam such that the beam's exit path is not co-linear with the laser's internal optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For free space lasers, laser beams are not co-linear with the optical axis, but additionally, the exiting laser beam angle varies greatly from one laser to another. For lasers with free space resonators, the front surface of the output coupler and/or the rear mirror are/is curved. The optical axis' best alignment position between the curve-to-curve or curve-to-flat optics is defined for the maximum power or maximum beam quality position, and due to variances in the manufacturing and mounting of the curved optic(s), the optimal alignment position between the two mirrors points the exit beam at various angles from one laser to another.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The refraction discussed above results in a laser beam line that fails to be aligned with the optical laser axis. When a laser is placed into a manufacturing unit in a warehouse, or other larger system, alignment of the new laser is by trial and error, by moving the placement of the laser, such that no two lasers likely have the same exact placement of a laser's support. In at least one exemplary embodiment the laser beam line is aligned with a reference line on the laser's support, so that upon placement of a laser, in accordance with at least one exemplary embodiment, the laser support can be placed in the same position as a previous laser that has been aligned with its laser's support, with the replacement laser's alignment being substantially the same as the previous laser assembly made in accordance with at least one exemplary embodiment. Thus the laser can be placed, with minimal alignment adjustments if needed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments provide at least one method and system for alignment of a laser with its support system. At least one exemplary embodiment provides methods and/or apparatus for aligning a laser beam with references on its laser support system, where references can be any point on the support system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top view of a laser assembly <b>100</b>, in accordance with at least one exemplary embodiment. A laser module <b>110</b> (illustrated without its cooling fin array for clarity) is shown attached to a front end plate <b>120</b> and a rear end plate <b>130</b>. The front end plate <b>120</b> is operatively attached to a front laser foot <b>150</b>, whereas the rear end plate <b>130</b> is operatively attached to a rear laser foot <b>160</b>. The laser module <b>110</b> has a nominal optical axis A-A associated with it. However, the laser's output beam (reference numeral <b>140</b>) exits the laser module off-axis making an angle θ to a vertical plane containing reference line B-B and an angle α to a horizontal plane containing reference line B-B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). It will be appreciated that the angles are shown grossly exaggerated in the figures for illustration purposes. It is also noted that the nominal optical axis A-A is parallel to reference line B-B in this example. It is convenient to have the reference line directed in this way, but not essential. The degree of angular mis-alignment between the output beam and the nominal optical axis of the laser module varies from laser unit to laser unit, which results in the alignment problem discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In use, as described in the following, the laser module <b>110</b> is adjusted with respect to the support system, of which the front laser foot <b>150</b> and the rear laser foot <b>160</b> are a part, so that the laser beam <b>140</b> is re-aligned to travel down a line parallel to the reference line B-B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which shows the laser system after alignment). Thus, a new laser assembly can be placed in the same seating on an optical table, using the locators, e.g. holes, of the support system, so that the laser beam <b>140</b> travels parallel to the reference line B-B. Note that the nominal optical axis A-A will move as the laser module <b>110</b> is adjusted with respect to its support system. The result of adjustment is to have the laser beam <b>140</b> aligned with the reference line B-B, or aligned with one or more datum points (e.g. first datum point <b>170</b>, second datum point <b>180</b>) on the support system. Upon mounting in a manufacturing unit, or other system, the datum points can be aligned with corresponding datum points on the optical bench in the system's reference system, so that the laser is substantially aligned in the system's reference system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows two datum points, the first datum point <b>170</b> and the second datum point <b>180</b>. In additional exemplary embodiments a datum line can be used. A reference line B-B can be defined by passing a line through both datum points <b>170</b> and <b>180</b>. In the embodiment shown, the first datum point is in the middle of a front laser foot hole <b>175</b> that serves as a locator for the first datum point, whereas the second datum point <b>180</b> is in the middle of a rear laser hole <b>185</b> that serves as a locator for the second datum point. Datum points and/or datum lines in embodiments are not limited to the center of holes, the datum point(s) can be located anywhere on the support system, which can include a front foot assembly <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a rear foot assembly <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). To make further adjustments a front laser slot <b>190</b> is included in the front laser foot <b>150</b>, and a rear laser foot slot <b>195</b> in included in a rear laser foot <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the side view of the laser assembly <b>100</b> with attached fin arrays, namely a top cooling fin array <b>210</b> and a bottom cooling fin array <b>220</b>, although fin cooling arrays in the embodiments are not limited to the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The laser module <b>110</b>, front end plate <b>120</b>, and rear end plate <b>130</b> are attached to the support system, which includes a front foot assembly and a rear foot assembly. The front foot assembly shown includes a top front mounting foot <b>230</b>, a bearing <b>235</b>, and the front laser foot <b>150</b>, while the rear foot assembly includes a top rear mounting foot <b>255</b>, a rear foot adjust block <b>275</b>, and the rear laser foot <b>160</b>. Associated with the front foot assembly and the rear foot assembly are fixed coordinate systems with axes <b>305</b>, <b>307</b>, <b>405</b>, and <b>407</b> being illustrated. These coordinate systems are best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> respectively. These axes are stationary while the rotation of the support system is in reference to these axes, although other reference axes can be used within the scope of other embodiments. The side view, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shows the laser beam <b>140</b> exiting the front end plate <b>120</b>, where the projection of the laser beam <b>140</b> in the side view plane makes an angle α with the reference line B-B.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> illustrates a front foot assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with at least one exemplary embodiment. The front foot assembly <b>300</b> comprises a front laser foot <b>340</b>, a bearing <b>335</b>, and a top front mounting foot <b>330</b>. A first datum point <b>370</b> lies in the middle of front laser foot hole <b>375</b>, with a front laser foot slot <b>390</b> in the front laser foot <b>340</b>. Note as discussed above the first datum point can lie anywhere on the front foot assembly <b>300</b>. The bearing <b>335</b> (e.g. half-hemispherical bearing, spherical bearing) allows movement about a first rotation axis. Likewise a bearing support pin (not visible—but situated in the same bore and below locking grub screw <b>357</b>) connects the top front mounting foot <b>330</b> to the bearing <b>335</b> and operatively to the front laser foot <b>340</b>, and also allows rotation about a second rotation axis. The two mounting mechanisms <b>355</b> and <b>356</b> (e.g. screws, nails, pins, bolts, and other fastening systems known by those of ordinary skill for fastening the top front mounting foot <b>330</b> to a front end plate) fasten the top mounting foot <b>330</b> to a front end plate of the laser module (e.g. <b>130</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additional mechanical combinations can be used to add various other rotations and translations, for example other connection plates with ball joints, separate adjust plates to translate the spacing between the front laser foot <b>340</b> and the top front mounting foot <b>330</b>, grooves in the front laser foot <b>340</b>, a cylindrical ball bearing for bearing <b>335</b>, and other systems as would be known by one of ordinary skill to adjust the angular and translation orientation between the top front mounting foot <b>330</b> and the front laser foot <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> illustrates a rear foot assembly <b>400</b> in accordance with at least one exemplary embodiment. The rear foot assembly <b>400</b> comprises a rear laser foot <b>490</b>, a rear foot adjust block <b>475</b>, and a top rear mounting foot <b>455</b>. A second datum point <b>480</b> is located in the middle of a rear laser foot hole <b>485</b>. Note as discussed above the second datum point can lie anywhere on the rear foot assembly <b>400</b> or a datum line can be used. Additional adjustment can be made using a rear laser foot slot <b>495</b>, in the rear laser foot <b>490</b>. The rear laser foot <b>490</b> is attached to the rear foot adjust block <b>475</b>, by fastening mechanisms <b>480</b> and <b>485</b> (e.g. screws, nails, pins, bolts, and other fastening systems known by those of ordinary skill for fastening rear laser foot <b>490</b> is attached to the rear foot adjust block <b>475</b>). The rear adjust block <b>475</b> is operatively connected to the top rear mounting foot <b>455</b>, by a bearing peg <b>450</b>, which has a bearing peg extension <b>452</b> that fits into a bushing <b>454</b> (e.g. made of ceramic, brass, plastic, or another appropriate metal). The bearing peg <b>450</b>, bearing peg extension <b>452</b>, and the bushing <b>454</b> allows a first rotation about the principal or long axis of the bearing peg <b>450</b> (axis <b>405</b>), a second rotation about an axis perpendicular to the top view plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> (axis <b>407</b>), and translation along the long axis of the bearing peg <b>450</b> (axis <b>405</b>). Additional mechanical combinations can be used to add various other rotations and translations, for example other connection plates with ball joints, separate adjust plates to translate the spacing between the rear laser foot <b>490</b> and the top rear mounting foot <b>455</b>, grooves in the rear laser foot <b>490</b>, and other systems as would be known by one of ordinary skill to adjust the angular and translation orientation between the top rear mounting foot <b>455</b> and the rear laser foot <b>490</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In at least one exemplary embodiment the laser support system includes the front foot assembly <b>300</b> and the rear foot assembly <b>400</b>. The front foot assembly <b>300</b> can have a first front rotation axis, and a second front rotation axis, where the front foot assembly <b>300</b> is operatively connected with a front end plate (e.g. <b>120</b>) of a laser module or housing (e.g. the combination of <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>130</b>) so that the front end plate can rotate about the first and second front rotation axes. In at least one exemplary embodiment a rotation about the first and second front rotation axes can align a laser beam (e.g. <b>140</b>) with a reference line (e.g. B-B). Additionally exemplary embodiments can have various numbers (e.g. additional or fewer) of front translation and front rotation axis, and the discussion herein should not be interpreted to limit the scope to two front rotation axes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Likewise, in at least one exemplary embodiment the rear foot assembly <b>400</b> can include a first rear rotation axis, a second rear rotation axis, and a rear translation axis, where the rear foot assembly <b>400</b> is operatively connected with the rear end plate (e.g. <b>130</b>) of the laser module or housing, so that that rear end plate <b>130</b> can rotate about the first and second rear rotation axis and translate along the rear translation axis. Additional exemplary embodiments can have various numbers (e.g. additional or fewer) of rear translation and rear rotation axis, and the discussion herein should not be interpreted to limit the scope to two rear rotation axes and a rear translation axis.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In at least one exemplary embodiment, the front foot assembly <b>300</b> can have directions (axes) associated with the front foot assembly's movement and orientation, for example a front vertical direction <b>307</b>, a front horizontal direction <b>305</b>, and a front perpendicular direction <b>309</b>. In this example the front perpendicular direction <b>309</b> can be perpendicular to the front vertical <b>307</b> and horizontal <b>305</b> directions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similarly in at least one exemplary embodiment the rear foot assembly <b>400</b> can have directions associated with the rear foot assembly's orientation, a rear vertical direction <b>407</b> (from top to bottom of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>), a rear horizontal direction <b>405</b> (from left to right of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>), and a rear perpendicular direction <b>409</b> (from top to bottom of the page in FIG. <b>4</b>B). In this example the rear perpendicular direction <b>409</b> can be perpendicular to the rear vertical <b>407</b> and horizontal <b>405</b> directions.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In at least one exemplary embodiment the top front mounting foot <b>330</b> can rotate about the front perpendicular direction <b>309</b> and/or the front vertical direction <b>307</b> and/or the front horizontal direction <b>305</b>. For example, in the front foot assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the top front mounting foot <b>330</b> can rotate about the bearing support pin, and about bearing <b>335</b>. In at least one exemplary embodiment the rear laser foot <b>490</b> can rotate about the rear perpendicular direction <b>409</b> and/or the rear vertical direction <b>407</b> and/or the rear horizontal direction <b>405</b>. For example, in the rear foot assembly <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the top rear mounting foot <b>455</b> can rotate about the bearing peg <b>450</b> and rotate a slight angle ψ about the rear vertical direction <b>407</b> by the flexibility of the bearing peg extension <b>452</b> in the bushing <b>454</b>, which could be made up of soft material (e.g. silicon, plastic) or the bearing peg extension <b>452</b> can be a ball bearing connected to the bearing peg <b>450</b> seated in the bushing <b>454</b> allowing rotation about several axes. Note a similar bearing arrangement can be devised for the front foot assembly by copying such rear foot assembly features. Additionally the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> allows translation in the rear horizontal direction <b>405</b> by movement of the bearing peg in and out of the bushing <b>454</b>. Again features shown for the front foot assembly can be adopted for the rear foot assembly and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In at least one exemplary embodiment the rear laser foot <b>490</b> can be attached to the rear foot adjust block <b>475</b> so that there is no relative rotation or translation (e.g. bolted, soldered, welded, glued, latched, and similar other attachment methods know by those of ordinary skill in the arts to limit relative motion between the rear laser foot <b>490</b> and the rear foot adjust block <b>475</b>). The bearing peg <b>450</b> can be attached to the rear foot adjust block <b>475</b>. In further variations the top rear mounting foot <b>455</b> can include a ball joint, which can be seen as the bearing peg extension <b>452</b>, in this case not connected to the bearing peg <b>450</b>. The bearing peg extension (e.g. ball joint) can have a hole through which the bearing peg <b>450</b> passes. In such an exemplary embodiment the bearing peg <b>450</b> of the rear foot adjust block <b>475</b> can pass through the hole in the ball joint, so that the ball joint can support a translational motion in and out of the hole by the bearing peg <b>455</b>. Additionally the movement of the ball joint and bearing peg <b>455</b> provide a mechanism for relative rotation about several rotation axes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates at least one exemplary embodiment where a method <b>500</b> of alignment comprises, establishing a reference line <b>510</b>, where the reference line is defined by a line intersecting a first datum point and a second datum point, where the first and second datum points are on a laser support system, where a laser is moveable with respect to the laser support system. The reference line can define the intersection on two planes a first reference line plane and a second reference line plane. The laser emits a beam, which establishes a laser beam line <b>520</b> along the centerline of the laser beam (e.g. <b>140</b>). The laser beam line may not be parallel with the reference line (e.g. B-B) or the optical axis (e.g. A-A) and thus alignment of the laser beam with the reference line is desirable in at least one exemplary embodiment. In at least one exemplary embodiment, to align the laser beam line to be substantially parallel to the reference line, the laser can be rotated about a first axis <b>530</b> so that a first projection of the laser beam line in the first reference plane is parallel to the reference line. For example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the rotation can be about the front vertical direction <b>307</b>, so that the angle θ is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If further alignment is needed, then a rotation about a second axis <b>540</b> can occur so that a second projection of the laser beam line in the second reference plane is substantially parallel to the reference line. For example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the rotation can be about the front perpendicular direction <b>309</b>, so that the angle α is minimized. After alignment of the laser beam line to be substantially parallel to the reference line, the laser support system can be secured to the laser <b>550</b> so that no substantial variation in relative movement occurs between the laser and it's support system. The rotation and translation ability in the rear and foot assemblies can be manipulated to line up the front laser foot hole <b>375</b>, the rear laser foot hole <b>485</b>, the front laser foot slot <b>390</b> and the rear laser foot slot <b>495</b> with conventional optical table holes such that the laser assembly can be set in optical table holes, with the laser module <b>110</b> slightly skewed, so that the laser beam travels parallel to the reference line B-B.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a skewed laser that has been aligned with the laser support assembly adjusted to align the mounting. Once alignment has been achieved the various pieces are secured with respect to each other to minimize further rotations and translations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A specific example of an alignment method is now described. The aim of the alignment method is to make a line defined by connecting the dowel hole in the front laser foot to the hole in the rear laser foot (reference line B-B) to be parallel (co-linear is not required) to the line <b>140</b> defined by the output beam that exits the laser. This is performed through two axes of movement. Currently, it is considered that the easiest way to perform the alignment in practice is in conjunction with a testing jig, such as an optical table, and a projection panel for the laser beam with a target, such as a wall with a target point marked by a spot and/or one or more target rings marked on it. The testing jig has two dowels upstanding from its surface in positions for receiving the locator holes <b>375</b> and <b>485</b> in the front and rear foot assemblies respectively. The alignment method currently used involves the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">1. Place the laser assembly in the jig with the locator hole <b>375</b> of the front laser foot <b>340</b> in the front dowel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">2. Slew the back of the laser assembly left and right rotating around the front dowel (i.e. about the vertical axis defined by the first datum point <b>370</b>) until a laser beam spot on the projection panel is aligned horizontally with the target point, i.e. so that the spot lies on a vertical line through the target point.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">3. Move the rear laser foot <b>490</b> and set it in the testing jig rear dowel location. Lock down the first set of locking screws <b>470</b>, <b>472</b> in their adjustment slots.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">4. Tilt the laser up and down about the front foot bearing <b>335</b> to vertically align the laser beam spot on the projection panel so that it lies on the target point.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">5. Lock down the second set of screws <b>480</b>, <b>485</b> of the rear laser foot in their adjustment slots, and lock down the screw <b>357</b> of the front laser foot to lock the front laser foot bearing <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably there is a spherical bearing in the rear laser foot (not shown). The spherical bearing provides two functions. First it allows for a tilt that matches the tilt in the front laser foot bearing <b>335</b>. Second it can have a through hole through which passes the peg <b>450</b> on which the laser module is mounted, so that thermally induced extension or contraction of the laser module in use can be accommodated, avoiding distortion of the laser module not along the optical axis. This keeps the laser aligned as it heats.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The laser support system and components (e.g. <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>) can be composed of various materials (e.g. metals. composites, ceramics, plastics, silicon and other materials one of ordinary skill would know) and made from various processes (extrusions, molding, milling, and other manufacturing processes known by one of ordinary skill) and the discussion herein fails to limit the scope of the invention to any particular material composition or material process.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a wedged output coupler <b>700</b> used for beam steering in one axis <b>740</b> in an alternative embodiment. In this embodiment, the laser <b>710</b> is provided with a wedged output coupler <b>700</b>. This is a component well known in the art. The wedged output coupler <b>700</b> is rotatably mounted and by rotating it <b>730</b> (see double headed arrow with curved interconnecting line) the output beam <b>720</b> can be steered to provide alignment of the beam in one axis. The further alignment in the second axis, and optionally the third axis, is performed as in the main embodiment described further above by rotation or translation of the laser module.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically reflected in the examples provided and such practice is intended to lie within the scope of the invention.</p>
