<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for outputting an audio signal, and more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for outputting an audio signal capable of removing noise generated when the audio signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As techniques of processing a digital signal have been developed, a method of processing an audio signal that employs a digital processing technique has also been developed. In a method of outputting a digital audio signal, a method of converting an analogue audio signal into a digital signal includes a pulse code modulation method. In the PCM method, the audio signal is digitalized, transmitted and accumulated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A digital audio power amplifier that employs a digital pulse width modulation (PWM) method is used to output the pulse code modulated audio signal obtained in the PCM method with high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The high reliability of the digital audio power amplifier using the PWM method depends on a high accuracy DC source. Accordingly, any ripple caused by the power source influences on the PWM digital audio power amplifier. That is, the output audio signal may be damaged by the ripple of the power source.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, methods for solving the aforementioned problem have been suggested. First, a method of compensating for a damage of an audio signal due to a ripple of a power source is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,467, entitled “Digital, Pulse width modulation audio power amplifier with noise and ripple shaping” issued to Smedley. As disclosed in the U.S. Patent issued to Smedley, a divider outputs a value obtained by dividing an audio input signal x, which is over sampled and transmitted, by a source signal y. The source signal y is converted into a digital source signal by an analogue to digital (AD) converter and supplied, thereby generating the ripple.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, a relation z=x/y is satisfied. However, the PWM signal increases or decreases depending on a duty ratio with respect to the PCM signal that is the input signal x, and the duty ratio is non-zero during a PWM operation. However, the aforementioned equation suggested by Smedley does not consider the duty ratio of the PWM.</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">Accordingly, perfect compensation with respect to the PWM value cannot be obtained according to the U.S. Patent issued to Smedley.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are practical problems caused by the source ripple in various fields in which the apparatus for outputting a digital audio signal is used. In a TDMA transmission method that is one of multiple access methods in mobile communication networks, a voltage drop due to a TDMA burst periodically occurs, thereby generating noise in an output audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To solve the problem, there is provided a technique. The technique is disclosed in Korean Patent Application No.2005-0003647 entitled “Method of removing noise from communication terminal” filed by Woongkil Choi. As disclosed in the Korean Patent Application, audio output noise is removed by applying an offset voltage during a burst period to reduce a battery voltage drop.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in the Korean Patent Application, only a source voltage drop is compensated, and however, the noise caused by the TDMA burst ripple is not prevented from being introduced into the audio output signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a method and an apparatus for outputting an audio signal capable of removing noise of the audio signal caused by voltage drops.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for outputting an audio signal comprising: a power source; a compensator for compensating an input signal by adding the input signal to an offset value reciprocally proportional to a source voltage; a pulse width modulator for modulating an audio signal transmitted from the compensator; and an output stage for outputting the modulated audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of outputting an audio signal, the method comprising steps of: compensating a signal by adding a value reciprocally proportional to a source voltage to an input signal; pulse width modulating the compensated signal to output the pulse width modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the method and the apparatus for outputting the audio signal remove noise caused by drops of a source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the above aspect of the present invention, the compensator may add the offset value to a value obtained by dividing the input signal by the source voltage, and an analogue digital converter may be connected between the power source and the compensator. In addition, a scaler or normalizer may be connected between the power source and the compensator, the input signal may be a pulse code modulated signal, a noise shaper may be connected between the compensator and the pulse width modulator, and the input signal input in the step of compensating the signal is a signal that is input during a burst period of a mobile communication terminal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, an apparatus for outputting an audio signal according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for outputting an audio signal according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus for outputting the audio signal according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a power source <b>200</b>. The power source <b>200</b> supplies DC power. The power source <b>200</b> generates driving power and supplies the driving power to an output stage <b>212</b> and an AD converter <b>206</b>. Then, a voltage drop occurs in the voltage supplied by the power source <b>200</b>. The voltage drop periodically occurs whenever the audio signal is output.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The input audio signal is over sampled and pulse code modulated by an over sampler <b>202</b>. The apparatus includes a compensator <b>204</b> which receives the pulse code modulated signal as an input signal and a voltage output from an AD converter <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The compensator <b>204</b> compensates the PCM signal according to a predetermined compensation equation. According to the compensation equation, the audio signal is compensated by adding the input signal to an offset value reciprocally proportional to the source voltage. The compensation equation will be described in detail in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A noise shaper <b>208</b> may be connected to the output of the compensator <b>204</b>. The noise shaper <b>208</b> attenuates the noise of the compensated PCM signal. A PWM modulator <b>210</b> is connected to the output of the noise shaper <b>208</b>. The PWM modulator <b>210</b> modulates pulse width of the PCM signal to supply the pulse width modulated PCM signal to an output stage <b>212</b>. Accordingly, the output stage <b>212</b> is connected to the output of the PWM modulator <b>210</b> and outputs the finally compensated digital audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for outputting an audio signal according to another embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a scaler <b>300</b> is connected between the AD converter <b>206</b> and the compensator <b>204</b>. The scaler <b>300</b> may be connected between the power source <b>200</b> and the AD converter <b>206</b>. A normalizer may be selectively connected to any location between the power source <b>200</b> and the compensator <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The scaler <b>300</b> is used to scale the output value of the power source, and the normalizer is used to normalize the output value of the power source. Specifically, when voltage drops are different depending on types of the apparatus for outputting the audio signal, the normalizer and the scaler <b>300</b> equalizes the voltage drops to suitably compensate the audio signal depending on the noise. In addition, when the voltage drops are abnormally high, the normalizer and the scaler <b>300</b> also have a function of suppressing a sharp compensation of the audio signal due to the voltage drop.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, a method of outputting an audio signal and a method of compensating the audio signal performed by the compensator <b>204</b> and the aforementioned compensation equation will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is a view for illustrating a PWM area change due to a voltage drop.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, when a source voltage value input through an AD converter <b>206</b> is 1, the PWM area is 1×(N+x)=N+x with respect to a PCM signal x. Here, N is a PWM value corresponding to a duty ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When a voltage drop occurs in a voltage supplied by the power source <b>200</b>, that is, a voltage value input through the AD converter <b>206</b> decreases to y, the PWM area is y×(N+x) with respect to a PCM signal x.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">That is, when the voltage drop occurs, and noise occurs in the audio signal, the PWM area decreases from A+B to B by A. Accordingly, in order to compensate for the reduced area and remove the noise, the PCM signal x is converted into a signal z so that the area of A is an area C.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, the compensation equation according to the embodiment of the present invention will be derived on the basis of the aforementioned area change. The compensated value z satisfies the area relation A+B=B+C. Accordingly, the compensated value z is derived by Equation 1.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to Equation 1, the compensated value is defined by Equation 2.

</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, as described above, N is the PWM value corresponding to a duty ratio. Accordingly, N is set as an offset value A that is a predetermined constant. When the voltage is dropped, the compensator <b>204</b> outputs the compensated PCM signal obtained by compensating the input PCM signal according to Equation 2.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">There are various multiple access methods in a digital mobile communication method. A time division multiple access method among the various multiple access methods is a method in which a predetermined frequency bandwidth is periodically divided into predetermined time intervals, and each user transmits its signal during the time interval allocated to each user by turns. The time interval is referred to as a burst period or time slot. On the other hand, in the TDMA method, noise occurs in the output stage <b>212</b> due to a time burst ripple during the burst period. Specifically, when information to be transmitted by a mobile communication terminal is output in high frequency, a power amplifier uses a pulse current of the power source with the maximum current of 2.5 Ampere during the time slop (557us).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The process is repeatedly performed every 4.615 ms during the transmission. On the other hand, a voltage level is also influenced by the burst. When the power source is a lithium ion battery, a serial resistance is 120 mΩ(ohm) at the worst case. Accordingly, a voltage drop of 300 mV (120 mV×2.5) occurs during 557 us.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, when the drop of the voltage C<sub>1 </sub>occurs during the burst period, the level of the PCM signal C<sub>2 </sub>also drops. When the audio signal is output, noise occurs due to the drop of the PCM signal level.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, the harmonic components D<sub>2 </sub>to D<sub>9 </sub>in addition to the frequency of the first spectrum D<sub>1 </sub>of the ripple during the burst period are concurrently decreased. As the sampling frequency and the input bit number increase, the AD converter <b>206</b> can sharply decrease the level of the frequency component.</p>
