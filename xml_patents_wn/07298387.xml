<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to thermal printing and, more particularly, to techniques for improving thermal printer output by compensating for the effects of thermal history on thermal print heads.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thermal printers typically contain a linear array of heating elements (also referred to herein as “print head elements”) that print on an output medium by, for example, transferring pigment or dye from a donor sheet to the output medium or by activating a color-forming chemistry in the output medium. The output medium is typically a porous receiver receptive to the transferred pigment, or a paper coated with the color-forming chemistry. Each of the print head elements, when activated, forms color on the medium passing underneath the print head element, creating a spot having a particular density. Regions with larger or denser spots are perceived as darker than regions with smaller or less dense spots. Digital images are rendered as two-dimensional arrays of very small and closely-spaced spots.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A thermal print head element is activated by providing it with energy. Providing energy to the print head element increases the temperature of the print head element, causing either the transfer of pigment to the output medium or the formation of color in the receiver. The density of the output produced by the print head element in this manner is a function of the amount of energy provided to the print head element. The amount of energy provided to the print head element may be varied by, for example, varying the amount of power to the print head element within a particular time interval or by providing power to the print head element for a longer time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In conventional thermal printers, the time during which a digital image is printed is divided into fixed time intervals referred to herein as “print head cycles.” Typically, a single row of pixels (or portions thereof) in the digital image is printed during a single print head cycle. Each print head element is typically responsible for printing pixels (or sub-pixels) in a particular column of the digital image. During each print head cycle, an amount of energy is delivered to each print head element that is calculated to raise the temperature of the print head element to a level that will cause the print head element to produce output having the desired density. Varying amounts of energy may be provided to different print head elements based on the varying desired densities to be produced by the print head elements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One problem with conventional thermal printers results from the fact that their print head elements retain heat after the conclusion of each print head cycle. This retention of heat can be problematic because, in some thermal printers, the amount of energy that is delivered to a particular print head element during a particular print head cycle is typically calculated based on an assumption that the print head element's temperature at the beginning of the print head cycle is a known fixed temperature. Since, in reality, the temperature of the print head element at the beginning of a print head cycle depends on (among other things) the amount of energy delivered to the print head element during previous print head cycles, the actual temperature achieved by the print head element during a print head cycle may differ from the desired temperature, thereby resulting in a higher or lower output density than is desired. Further complications are similarly caused by the fact that the current temperature of a particular print head element is influenced not only by its own previous temperatures—referred to herein as its “thermal history”—but by the ambient (room) temperature and the thermal histories of other print head elements in the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As may be inferred from the discussion above, in some conventional thermal printers, the average temperature of each particular thermal print head element tends to gradually rise during the printing of a digital image due to retention of heat by the print head element and the over-provision of energy to the print head element in light of such heat retention. This gradual temperature increase results in a corresponding gradual increase in density of the output produced by the print head element, which is perceived as increased darkness in the printed image. This phenomenon is referred to herein as “density drift.”</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, conventional thermal printers typically have difficulty accurately reproducing sharp density gradients between adjacent pixels both across the print head and in the direction of printing. For example, if a print head element is to print a black pixel following a white pixel, the ideally sharp edge between the two pixels will typically be blurred when printed. This problem results from the amount of time that is required to raise the temperature of the print head element to print the black pixel after printing the white pixel. More generally, this characteristic of conventional thermal printers results in less than ideal sharpness when printing images having regions of high density gradient.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above-referenced patent applications disclose a model of a thermal print head that predicts the thermal response of thermal print head elements to the provision of energy to the print head elements over time. The amount of energy to provide to each of the print head elements during a print head cycle in order to produce a spot having the desired density is calculated based on: (1) the desired density to be produced by the print head element during the print head cycle, (2) the predicted temperature of the print head element at the beginning of the print head cycle, (3) the ambient printer temperature at the beginning of the print head cycle, and (4) the ambient relative humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The techniques disclosed therein assume that printing is performed in equal time steps, and therefore calculate the input energy in equal time steps, each corresponding to the time taken to print a single pixel on the thermal medium. In particular, the disclosed techniques implement a thermal model for the thermal print head. The thermal model is composed of multiple layers, each having a different spatial and temporal resolution. The resolutions for the layers are chosen for a combination of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the techniques disclosed in the above-referenced patent applications implement a media model that computes the energy needed to print a desired optical density on the medium, given the current temperature profile of the print element. The media model is expressed in terms of two functions of the desired density, G(d) and S(d). G(d) corresponds to the inverse gamma function at a specified reference temperature, and S(d) is the sensitivity of the inverse gamma function to temperature at a fixed density.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The assumption that all print intervals are of equal duration may not be valid under all circumstances. For example, in the system disclosed in the above-referenced patent application entitled “Thermal Imaging System,” the print head is capable of writing two colors in a single pass on a single print medium. Each print line time is divided into two parts. It is possible to write one color in one part of the line time and another color in another part of the line time. The time division between the two colors, however, may not be equal. For example, if printing yellow and magenta, the yellow may be printed during a smaller fraction of the line time interval than magenta. An attempt to apply the thermal history control techniques disclosed above to such a print mechanism may, therefore, produce suboptimal results, because the assumption of equally-sized print intervals would be violated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">What is needed, therefore, are improved techniques for controlling the temperature of print head elements in a thermal printer having unequally-sized print intervals to more accurately render digital images.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Techniques are disclosed for performing thermal history control in a thermal printer in which a single thermal print head prints sequentially on multiple color-forming layers in a single pass. Each pixel-printing interval may be divided into subintervals, which may be of unequal duration. Each sub-interval may be used to print a different color. The manner in which the input energy to be provided to each print head element is selected may be varied for each of the subintervals. For example, although a single thermal model may be used to predict the temperature of the print head elements in each of the subintervals, different parameters may be used in the different subintervals. Similarly, different energy computation functions may be used to compute the energy to be provided to the print head in each of the subintervals based on the predicted print head element temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, in one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided which includes steps of: (A) identifying a density of a pixel in a digital image, the density including: (1) a first color component associated with a first printing subinterval of a printing line time and having a first value, and (2) a second color component associated with a second printing subinterval of the printing line time and having a second value; (B) identifying a first print head element temperature; (C) identifying a first energy computation function associated with the first color component; (D) identifying a first input energy using the first energy computation function based on the first value and the first print head element temperature; (E) identifying a second print head element temperature; (F) identifying a second energy computation function associated with the second color component; and (G) identifying a second input energy using the second energy computation function based on the second value and the second print head element temperature.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Techniques are disclosed for performing thermal history control in a thermal printer in which a single thermal print head prints sequentially on multiple color-forming layers in a single pass. Each pixel-printing interval may be divided into subintervals, which may be of unequal duration. Each sub-interval may be used to print a different color. The manner in which the input energy to be provided to each print head element is selected may be varied for each of the subintervals. For example, although a single thermal model may be used to predict the temperature of the print head elements in each of the subintervals, different parameters may be used in the different subintervals. Similarly, different energy computation functions may be used to compute the energy to be provided to the print head in each of the subintervals based on the predicted print head element temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in the above-referenced patent applications, techniques are disclosed for performing thermal history control by computing the input energy to provide to a print head element at each of a plurality of successive time steps based on the predicted temperature of the print head element at the beginning of each of the time steps and a plurality of 1-D functions of desired density. All of the time steps are assumed to be of equal duration, and each time step is assumed to be equal in duration to the amount of time required to print a single pixel. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a diagram is shown illustrating such a pixel printing scheme. The diagram illustrates a plurality of successive time steps <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of equal duration. Each of the time steps <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>corresponds to one of a plurality of pixel-printing times <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In other words, a single pixel is printed during each of the successive time steps <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A thermal model may be used to predict the temperature of each thermal print head element at the beginning of each of the time steps <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. An energy computation function may then be used to compute the input energy to provide to each of the print head elements during each of the time steps <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The computed energies may be provided to the print head elements during each of the corresponding pixel-printing intervals to print pixels of the appropriate densities.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The above-referenced patent application entitled “Thermal Imaging System” describes a thermal printing system in which a single thermal print head prints sequentially on multiple color-forming layers in a single pass. In such a system, each pixel-printing time may be divided into two or more sub-intervals, each corresponding to the time during which printing is accomplished on each of the different color-forming layers. Such subintervals typically are of different durations.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a diagram is shown illustrating such a pixel printing scheme, in which a single print head alternately prints two colors in a single pass. For purposes of example, the diagram illustrates a plurality of successive time steps <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>of unequal duration. Each successive pair of time steps <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>corresponds to one of a plurality of pixel-printing times <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In particular, time steps <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>correspond to pixel-printing time <b>108</b><i>a</i>, time steps <b>106</b><i>c</i>-<i>d </i>correspond to pixel-printing time <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and time steps <b>106</b><i>e</i>-<i>f </i>correspond to pixel-printing time <b>108</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In each pair of time steps <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, the first step corresponds to a pixel-printing subinterval in which a first color is printed, and the second step corresponds to a pixel-printing subinterval in which a second color is printed. For example, the first color may be printed during subintervals corresponding to time steps <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>c</i>, and <b>106</b><i>e</i>, while the second color may be printed during subintervals corresponding to time steps <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>d</i>, and <b>106</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Note that the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> differs from the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> in two ways: (1) the time steps <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are of equal duration, while the time steps <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> are of unequal duration; and (2) the print head prints a single color in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, while the print head alternately prints two colors on two color-forming layers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The thermal history control techniques disclosed in the above-referenced patent applications may be modified to accommodate the features of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for predicting the temperature of the print head elements at the beginnings of successive time steps of unequal duration. In another embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for computing the energies to provide to the print head elements based on properties of the color-forming layer on which the print head elements are printing. Both techniques may be combined with each other, thereby providing the ability to perform thermal history control in a printer which is capable of printing sequentially on multiple color-forming layers using printing subintervals of unequal durations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a flowchart is shown of a method <b>200</b> that is performed in one embodiment of the present invention to perform thermal history control on a digital image. As described in more detail below, the method <b>200</b> may predict the temperature of each of a plurality of print head elements at the beginning of each of a plurality of pixel-printing time subintervals. The subintervals may, for example, be of unequal duration, as in the case of the subintervals <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Furthermore, the method <b>200</b> may vary the energy computation function that is used to calculate the input energy to provide to the print head elements during the subintervals.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Assume that the method <b>200</b> is used to print a multi-color digital image including a plurality of pixels. Assume further that the image is represented in three dimensions: width, length, and color. Such an image may be transformed into an equivalent two-dimensional image with interleaved lines of alternating color, effectively combining the length and the color into a single dimension.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A distinct correction factor f<sub>t</sub>(c) may thereby be obtained for each value of c. If we select the value of f<sub>t </sub>in Equation 11 based on the thermal characteristics of a single one of the color-forming layers, for example c=c<sub>0</sub>, then the corrected thermistor temperature is given by Equation 14:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T′</i><sub>s</sub><i>=T</i><sub>s</sub><i>+f</i><sub>t</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>0</sub>)Δ<i>T</i><sub>r </sub>  Equation 14<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Any value may be selected for c<sub>0</sub>. Since the corrected thermistor temperature propagates down to the absolute temperature of all the sub-intervals as described in the above referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/934,703, the correction is inaccurate for all color forming layers other than c=c<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment of the present invention, additional corrections δ(c) are then selected for each of the color-forming layers (i.e., for 0≦c&lt;C), as shown in Equation 15:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>δ(<i>c</i>)=(<i>f</i><sub>t</sub>(<i>c</i>)−<i>f</i><sub>t</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>0</sub>))Δ<i>T</i><sub>r </sub>  Equation 15<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The net correction may then be added to the absolute temperatures of each of the color-forming layers as in Equation 16.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T′</i><sub>h</sub><i>=T</i><sub>h</sub>+δ(<i>c</i>)   Equation 16<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The appropriate value of δ(c) may then be selected and used in Equation 16 for each subinterval when performing thermal history control. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, a flowchart is shown of a method <b>280</b> for modifying the method <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in the manner just described. The method <b>280</b> identifies the ambient temperature T<sub>r </sub>(step <b>262</b>) in the manner described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The method <b>280</b> selects a value for c<sub>0 </sub>(step <b>282</b>) and calculates f<sub>t</sub>(c) using Equation 13 with c=c<sub>0 </sub>(step <b>284</b>). The method <b>280</b> calculates δ(c) for all values of c using Equation 15 (step <b>286</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The method <b>280</b> performs steps <b>202</b>-<b>216</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. After predicting the absolute temperature T<sub>h </sub>(step <b>216</b>), the method <b>280</b> identifies the modified absolute temperature T′<sub>h </sub>using Equation 16 (step <b>288</b>). The method <b>280</b> computes the input energy E based on the print density d and the modified print head element temperature T′<sub>h </sub>(step <b>290</b>). The method <b>280</b> performs steps <b>220</b>-<b>226</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Note that for c=c<sub>0</sub>, δ(c)=0. Therefore, as may be seen from Equation 16, no correction to T<sub>h </sub>is needed for the color-forming layer for which c=c<sub>0</sub>, thereby obtaining some savings in computation in steps <b>288</b>-<b>290</b>. The techniques disclosed herein may be combined with the techniques disclosed in the above-referenced patent application to take the relative humidity into account when performing thermal history control.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The techniques disclosed herein have a variety of advantages. For example, the techniques disclosed herein may be applied to perform thermal history control in a thermal printer in which a single thermal print head prints sequentially on multiple color-forming layers in a single pass. By applying different energy computation functions to different color-forming layers, the techniques disclosed herein enable the thermal history control to be optimized for each of the color-forming layers, thereby improving the quality of printed output. By applying different thermal model parameters to different color-forming layers, the techniques disclosed herein may be used to model the thermal response of the output medium during printing subintervals of unequal duration. As a result, the thermal history control algorithm may be used in conjunction with printers having such unequal subintervals, thereby improving the quality of printed output. Such use of varying energy computation functions and thermal model parameters may be used in combination, thereby optimizing the thermal history control algorithm for use with thermal printers in which a single thermal print head prints sequentially on multiple color-forming layers in a single pass using pixel-printing subintervals of unequal duration.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, the techniques disclosed herein have the advantages disclosed in the above-referenced patent applications. For example, the techniques disclosed herein reduce or eliminate the problem of “density drift” by taking the current ambient temperature of the print head and the thermal and energy histories of the print head into account when computing the energy to be provided to the print head elements, thereby raising the temperatures of the print head elements only to the temperatures necessary to produce the desired densities. A further advantage of various embodiments of the present invention is that they may either increase or decrease the input energy provided to the print head elements, as may be necessary or desirable to produce the desired densities.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In general, the techniques described above may be implemented, for example, in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. The techniques described above may be implemented in one or more computer programs executing on a programmable computer and/or printer including a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including, for example, volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. Program code may be applied to data entered using the input device to perform the functions described herein and to generate output information. The output information may be applied to one or more output devices.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Printers suitable for use with various embodiments of the present invention typically include a print engine and a printer controller. The printer controller may, for example, receive print data from a host computer and generates page information to be printed based on the print data. The printer controller transmits the page information to the print engine to be printed. The print engine performs the physical printing of the image specified by the page information on the output medium.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Elements and components described herein may be further divided into additional components or joined together to form fewer components for performing the same functions.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Each computer program within the scope of the claims below may be implemented in any programming language, such as assembly language, machine language, a high-level procedural programming language, or an object-oriented programming language. The programming language may be a compiled or interpreted programming language.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Each computer program may be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage device for execution by a computer processor. Method steps of the invention may be performed by a computer processor executing a program tangibly embodied on a computer-readable medium to perform functions of the invention by operating on input and generating output.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It is to be understood that although the invention has been described above in terms of particular embodiments, the foregoing embodiments are provided as illustrative only, and do not limit or define the scope of the invention. Other embodiments are also within the scope of the present invention, which is defined by the scope of the claims below.
