<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for anaerobic digestion of sludge from the treatment of sewage effluents, an anaerobic digester of primary sludge containing effluents, as well as treatment plant comprising mainly such a digester.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Anaerobic digestion of sludge from the treatment of sewage effluents, for example household effluents, consists of hydrolysis and methane fermentation with considerable cell-destroying power, such as to be able to eliminate a considerable amount of the organic material contained in this sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The sludge results, for example, from the settling of raw sewage. At the outlet of the digester, digested sludge is obtained on the one hand, together with effluents on the other, these two parts can then be separately subjected to a number of additional treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Document U.S. Pat. No. 6,673,243 presents an anaerobic sludge digester comprising a tank divided into several successive compartments by means of transversal walls that do not reach the top of the tank. In the first upstream compartment, at the bottom, the sludge to be treated is inserted through a feeding pipe, the treated effluents being drained off from the final downstream compartment through a discharge pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The median transversal wall comprises an opening at the bottom that allows the sludge and effluents to pass from the upstream compartment to the downstream compartment it defines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, none of the other transversal walls have a bottom opening. It follows that, on the one hand, the flow of the effluents alternates between rising and falling and, on the other hand, the sludge can build up in a compartment but cannot flow downstream after being digested. The effectiveness of the digester is therefore considerable diminished.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention aims to solve these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For this purpose, according to a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for anaerobic digestion of sludge, which comprises the following steps:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">inserting a flow of primary sludge in the upstream part of an anaerobic sludge digester, the said primary sludge containing effluents having a dry matter concentration of less than 40 g/l;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">maintaining a layer of sludge in the digester with a thickness of less than 0.6 m, the sludge being transformed by anaerobic digestion;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">making the said effluents circulate within the digester, above and through the layer of sludge, in a substantially horizontal manner at least in the useful part of the digester, from the upstream part towards the downstream part of the digester, and draining off the said effluents from the digester, so as to drain off the soluble products of sludge digestion from the digester;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">draining off the sludge from the digester.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">Thus, from the start of the digestion by hydrolysis of the dry matter, the soluble components formed are extracted from the layer of sludge. In this way, the phenomena of inhibition or at least of slowing down of the digestion of the sludge in the tank are prevented or considerably reduced. The digestion therefore continues to take place at an optimized speed, and the necessary retention of the sludge in the digester is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">According to a possible embodiment of the invention, a layer of sludge with a thickness of less than 0.5 m is maintained in the digester. For example, the primary sludge has a dry matter concentration of less than 20 g/l.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">According to a second aspect, the invention relates to an anaerobic digester of primary sludge containing effluents, with the aim implementing the method as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">The digester comprises a tank with a substantially horizontal bottom, a pipe for feeding the primary sludge into the tank, a pipe for discharging the digested sludge from the tank, the said tank comprising at least one wall positioned transversally to the flow of the effluents, the wall defining an upstream and compartment and a downstream compartment, in order for the tank to have a first upstream compartment, into which the pipe for feeding primary sludge flows, and a final downstream compartment, from which the effluent discharge pipe flows.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">According to the invention, the wall has, at the bottom, an opening to link the upstream compartment with the downstream compartment, so as to allow the passage of the sludge and the circulation of the effluents, above and through the layer of sludge maintained on the bottom of the tank, in a substantially horizontal manner from the first upstream compartment to the final downstream compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">The transversal wall extends from the bottom of the tank to a height that is less than the height of the tank, so as to allow the floating matter in the effluents to overflow from one compartment to another.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">For example, the digester comprises at least two transversal walls, each of which has a linking opening at the bottom, such as to define at least three successive compartments in the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">Finally, according to a third aspect, the invention relates to a sewage effluent treatment plant comprising at least one such digester.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a digester <b>200</b> according to the invention, intended for the treatment of primary sludge containing effluents is shown. This sludge is the result of a prior treatment of sewage effluents, for example, resulting from a settling process.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">The digester <b>200</b> comprises a tank <b>201</b> with an axis <b>202</b>, which is used here to define the term “longitudinal”. The following description is made in relation to a tank <b>201</b> with a substantially cylindrical overall shape. However, the tank can also have a substantially rectangular vertical section: it is therefore possible to provide a very wide tank (on the horizontal plane), while keeping a reduced height.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">The tank <b>201</b> is sealed, with the exception of three main openings and one or several inspection traps, as can be seen below, such as to guarantee the absence of oxygen in order to enable the methane fermentation. The tank <b>201</b> has a relatively low height (matching the diameter of the cylinder), of between 50 and 70 cm, and length comprised between 2 and 3 m. For example, the tank can have a volume of 250 to 300 1, for example, 270 1. In the case of a tank with a rectangular section, the volume increases according to its width, and can reach several thousand litres.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">The tank <b>201</b> is positioned that the axis <b>202</b> is substantially horizontal. It comprises a substantially cylindrical side wall defining a bottom <b>203</b> and a top wall <b>204</b>, as well as an upstream end wall <b>205</b> and a downstream end wall <b>206</b>, which are substantially disc-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">An opening is made at the top of the upstream wall <b>205</b> to allow the primary sludge to enter the digester <b>200</b> by means of a feeding pipe. The feeding pipe <b>207</b> extends inside the tank <b>201</b>, substantially parallel to the axis <b>202</b> for a short length, and then vertically downwards for an approximate length of 10 cm, for example, such as to form inside the tank <b>201</b> and near the upstream wall <b>205</b>, an elbow <b>208</b> that opens towards the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b>. The opening of the feeding pipe <b>207</b> may be above or below the level of the effluents in the tank <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">The downstream wall <b>206</b> has, substantially halfway up, an opening that allows the effluents to be drained off from the digester <b>200</b>, by means of a discharge pipe <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The discharge pipe <b>209</b> extends inside the tank <b>201</b>, substantially parallel to the axis <b>202</b> for a short length, and then vertically downwards for an approximate length of 10 cm, for example, such as to form, inside the tank <b>201</b> and near the downstream wall <b>206</b>, an elbow <b>208</b> that opens towards the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b>, forming a siphon-shaped inlet. The siphon-shaped inlet is located substantially halfway between the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b> and the level of the effluents maintained in the tank <b>201</b>, so as not to allow the floating matter or the matter resting on the bottom <b>203</b> to escape.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The top wall <b>204</b> of the tank <b>201</b> can comprise at least one inspection trap <b>211</b>; three inspection traps in the embodiment of the invention shown. Devices for sampling the gas produced by methane digestion can also be connected to the top wall <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Finally, an orifice for draining off digested sludge is made in the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b>, near the downstream wall <b>206</b>, the said orifice being connected to a discharge pipe <b>212</b> for the said sludge, with means for cutting off the said discharge pipe <b>212</b> being provided.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">The digester <b>200</b> also comprises three transversal walls, respectively upstream <b>213</b><i>a</i>, intermediate <b>213</b><i>b </i>and downstream <b>213</b><i>c</i>. According to other foreseeable embodiments of the invention, the digester may comprise a different number of transversal walls, for example comprised between 1 and 6, as required in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The walls <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c </i>have substantially the same shape, namely that of a portion of a disc. The annular contour <b>214</b> of the walls matches the shape of the inside of the tank <b>201</b>, from the bottom <b>203</b> to a height that is lower than the height of the tank, so that each wall <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c </i>extends along the entire width of the tank <b>201</b>. The walls <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c </i>also have a top edge <b>215</b> that is substantially flat and horizontal, located at a distance from the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b> comprised between 40 and 70% of the height of the tank <b>201</b>. For example, the height at the walls is somewhere between 20 and 40 cm, mainly 30 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">A linking opening <b>216</b>, substantially disc-shaped, is made at the bottom of each wall <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c</i>. The opening <b>216</b> comprises a substantially annular top edge <b>217</b> and extends from the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b> to a height comprised between 30 and 60% of the height of the transversal wall <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c</i>. For example, the opening <b>216</b> extends to a height of approximately 10 to 15 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Each transversal wall <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c </i>defines an upstream compartment and a downstream compartment, so that the tank <b>201</b> of the digester <b>200</b> is divided longitudinally into four compartments <b>218</b><i>a</i>, <b>218</b><i>b</i>, <b>218</b><i>c </i>and <b>218</b><i>d: </i>
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0043">a first upstream compartment the <b>218</b><i>a</i>, into which the primary sludge feeding pipe <b>207</b> flows, for example at the top;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0044">two consecutive intermediate compartments <b>218</b><i>b</i>, <b>218</b><i>c; </i></li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0045">a final downstream compartment <b>218</b><i>d</i>, from which the effluent discharge pipe <b>209</b> flows.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">The walls <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c </i>make it possible to keep the sludge formed by agglomeration of the suspended matter in each compartment <b>218</b><i>a </i>to <b>218</b><i>d</i>, while the excess floating matter is able to pass by overflowing, from an upstream, compartment to a downstream compartment, or vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">The axial lengths of the compartments can be similar or, as an alternative, different. In the example shown, the first three compartments <b>218</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c </i>have substantially identical lengths, while the final downstream compartment <b>218</b> is shorter, approximately half the length of the other compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">The number of compartments and the length of the digester can be reduced or, on the contrary, increased to refine the treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">The following is a description of the operation of the digester <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050">The primary sludge containing effluents is inserted in the tank <b>201</b> of the digester <b>200</b> by means of the feeding pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051">“Primary sludge” is used here to refer to sludge that has a relatively low concentration of dry matter, lower than 25 g/l, or even lower than 20 g/l. It is possible particularly to insert sludge with a concentration comprised between 5 and 10 g/l into the digester. A lower concentration is possible, but the process becomes less cost-effective (larger digester volume, larger pumping flows, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052">This sludge can be the result of a settling process, and thus still obviously contain effluents. As an alternative, it can be previously concentrated sludge (dry matter concentration of 10 to 15%), mainly in order to facilitate transporting it from one treatment site to another.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053">In this case, the concentrated sludge is diluted with diluting effluents—for example, settled effluents that result from settling sewage effluents—before being inserted in the digester, so as to obtain a dry matter concentration that is compatible with the process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054">The sludge settles on the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b> in the form of a thin stable layer, for example, less than 0.5 m, or even less than 0.3 m. According to a specific embodiment, the thickness of the layer of sludge can be less than 0.2 m. A level <b>219</b> of effluents is maintained in the tank <b>201</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The level <b>219</b> of effluents is substantially at the same height as the top end of the same as discharge pipe <b>209</b> and the top edge <b>215</b> of the walls <b>213</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055">The sludge is gradually broken down inside the digester <b>200</b>. As it is digested, the sludge liquefies and passes into the consecutive compartments <b>218</b><i>a </i>to <b>218</b><i>d</i>, through the linking openings <b>216</b> made in the transversal walls <b>213</b><i>a </i>to <i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0056">As regards the effluents, they flow substantially parallel to the axis <b>202</b>, at least in the useful part of the tank <b>201</b>, in other words, excluding the feeding and draining areas, where the effluents respectively flow in a locally downward direction from the feeding pipe <b>207</b> towards the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank and in an upward direction from the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank towards the discharge pipe <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057">The effluents therefore circulate substantially horizontally through the openings <b>216</b> between the bottom <b>203</b> of the tank <b>201</b> and the top edge <b>217</b> of the said openings <b>216</b>, and do so from the first upstream compartment <b>218</b><i>a </i>towards the final downstream compartment <b>218</b><i>d</i>. During this flow, the effluents circulate above and through the layer of sludge. In this way, on the one hand, they carry with them the soluble products that result from the digestion of the sludge and, on the other hand, they force the sludge to move towards the compartments that are further downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0058">The effluents and the soluble products are then drained off from the tank <b>201</b> through the discharge pipe <b>209</b> and transported, as required, to another treatment unit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0059">The digested sludge contained in the final downstream compartment <b>218</b><i>d </i>is drained off through the discharge pipe <b>212</b>, through the simple action of gravity or with the help of a suitable pumping device. The emptying processes can be either partial or complete, and either regular (periodic emptying of the digester, or consisting of periodic or continuous emptying, daily for example. As an alternative, the tank <b>201</b> is unequipped with the sludge discharge pipe, the sludge therefore being temporarily stored in the digester <b>200</b> and periodically drained off via the traps <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0060">The digester according to the invention makes it possible to eliminate by liquefaction or gasification at least 40% of the dry matter in the sludge and up to over 90%, and to do so with a retention of the sludge in the digester comprised between 5 and 15 days, without needing to heat the digester, as long as its temperature remains above 10.C. Shorter retention is possible if the digester is heated (for example to a temperature comprised between 20 and 35° C.) since the performance of the digester is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0061">In these conditions, the concentration of the digested sludge is greatly facilitated, since only 50% to under 10% of sludge remains.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">This can be compared with the methods of the previous technique, in which the sludge is concentrated prior to entering the digester. Its retention, in the form of a relatively thick layer is generally comprised between 12 and 40 days, the digester must be heated to between 25 and 35° C., and all this to obtain elimination of around 30% of the dry matter in the sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0063">Next is a description of a sewage effluent treatment plant <b>46</b>, made in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
