<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to the fields of polymer chemistry, lithography, and semiconductor fabrication. More specifically, the invention relates to novel compounds useful as precursors to fluoroalkanol-containing olefin monomers that are capable of undergoing polymerization to form a polymer suitable for use in a lithographic photoresist composition, particularly in a chemical amplification photoresist composition. The invention also relates to a method for synthesizing the novel precursors from a substituted olefinic reactant and a fluorinated carbonyl compound, to a method for using the precursors in the synthesis of fluoroalkanol-containing olefin monomers, and to related methods and compositions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The patterning of radiation-sensitive polymeric films with high energy radiation such as photons, electrons or ion beams is the principal means of defining high resolution circuitry found in semiconductor devices. The radiation-sensitive films, often referred to as “photoresists” regardless of the radiation source, generally consist of multicomponent formulations that are usually spin-cast onto a desired substrate such as a silicon wafer. The radiation is most commonly ultraviolet light of the wavelengths of 436, 365, 257, 248, 193 or 157 nanometers (nm), or a beam of electrons or ions, or “soft” x-ray radiation, also referred to as “extreme ultraviolet” (EUV) or x-rays. The radiation is exposed patternwise and induces a chemical transformation to occur that renders the solubility of the exposed regions of the films different from that of the unexposed areas when the films are treated with an appropriate developer, usually a dilute, basic aqueous solution, such as aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Photoresists are generally comprised of a polymeric matrix, a radiation-sensitive component, a casting solvent, and other performance enhancing additives. The highest performing photoresists in terms of sensitivity to radiation and resolution capability are the group of photoresists termed “chemically amplified.” Chemically amplified photoresists allow for high resolution, high contrast, and high sensitivity that are not afforded in other photoresists. These photoresists are based on a catalytic mechanism that allows a relatively large number of chemical events such as, for example, deprotection reactions in the case of positive photoresists or crosslinking reactions in the case of negative tone photoresists, to be brought about by the application of a relatively low dose of radiation that induces formation of the catalyst, often a strong acid. The nature of the functional groups that comprise the polymeric matrix of these photoresists dictates the tone of the photoresist (positive or negative) as well as the ultimate performance attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The nature of the polymeric matrix also dictates the suitability of a given photoresist for exposure with particular radiation sources. That is, the absorbance characteristics of a polymer must be carefully considered when designing a material for lithographic applications. This is important with optical lithography where polymers are chosen to provide a relatively transparent matrix for radiation-sensitive compounds such as photoacid generators (PAGs). Absorbance characteristics are also important because the wavelength of radiation used in optical lithography is directly proportional to the ultimate resolution attainable with a photoresist. The desire for higher resolution causes a continuing drive to shorter and shorter radiation wavelengths. For example, the phenolic polymers used for 248 nm imaging, namely derivatives of poly(4-hydroxystyrene)(PHS), are unsuitable for use with 193 nm radiation as the opacity of these PHS materials at 193 nm does not allow for sufficient radiation to create an appropriate image profile throughout the photoresist film thickness. That is, in order for photoresists to function properly, their films must be transparent enough at the exposing wavelength to enable sufficient light to penetrate to the bottom of the film to create usable developed relief images.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to exhibiting the requisite transparency at a particular wavelength, it is important that a photoresist polymer be sufficiently polar so as to ensure solubility in industry standard developers. Polymers having lower solubility in these developers reduce the efficiency of resist development, a significant drawback in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is, accordingly, a need in the art for a cost-effective and controllable method for incorporating functionality into polymers to impart desirable properties, including both polarity (and thus solubility in aqueous acid or base) and transparency at a particular wavelength. U.S. Pat. No. 3,444,148 to Adelman describes polymers prepared by direct polymerization of an alkene hexafluoroalcohol (i.e., an alkene containing a —C(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>—OH group) with a variety of comonomers. The resulting copolymer compositions were found to have desirable characteristics relative to homopolymers that did not have an incorporated hexafluoroalcohol (HFA) group. This approach suffers from low incorporation of the desired HFA functionality (less than 2 mole percent) and is wasteful of valuable fluorinated monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Incorporation of fluorinated alcohols into polymers for use in photoresist compositions has recently been described, but the availability of the requisite materials is limited. An attempt to incorporate an HFA moiety into polymerizable ethylene-containing monomers (vinyl ethers and some olefins) has been described in International Patent Publication Nos. WO 02/079287 A1, WO 01/86352 A2 and WO 03/040827 (DuPont). The methodology described in the aforementioned references involves the reaction of a heteroatom nucleophile with hexafluoroisobutene oxide. This restrictive chemistry limits the structural diversity of target molecules and is not suitable for the preparation of acrylate or methacrylate monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for new compounds and methods that can be used to “tailor” the properties of a photoresist composition. Optimally, such compounds and methods would enable preparation of a broad range of polymer structures having desirable properties without need for costly starting materials or complex syntheses. The present invention is directed to the aforementioned need in the art, and, in part, provides compounds and methods that allow for the incorporation of fluoroalkylalcohol (i.e., fluorinated hydroxyalkyl or “fluoroalkanol”) groups in a cost-effective, controlled, reproducible manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first embodiment, a method is provided for synthesizing an alkene fluoroalkanol, i.e., an alkene containing a semi-fluorinated or perfluorinated hydroxyalkyl group. These alkene fluoroalkanols, which are new compositions of matter, are particularly useful as starting materials in the preparation of polymerizable olefin monomers via saturated fluorinated polyol intermediates. The alkene fluoroalkanols have the structure of formula (III)</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">I. Definitions and Nomenclature</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Unless otherwise indicated, this invention is not limited to specific compositions, components, or process steps. It should also be noted that the singular forms “a” and “the” are intended to encompass plural referents, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms, which shall be defined to have the following meanings:</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the phrase. “having the formula” or “having the structure” is not intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that the term “comprising” is commonly used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term “alkyl” as used herein refers to a linear or branched, saturated hydrocarbon substituent that generally, although not necessarily, contains 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl, and the like. Generally, although again not necessarily, alkyl groups herein contain 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, more typically 1 to about 8 carbon atoms. The term “lower alkyl” intends an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the term “cycloalkyl” intends a cyclic alkyl group, typically having 3 to 8, preferably 3 to 7, carbon atoms. The term “substituted alkyl” refers to alkyl substituted with one or more substituent groups, i.e., wherein a hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen substituent group, and the terms “heteroatom-containing alkyl” and “heteroalkyl” refer to alkyl substituents in which at least one carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom such as O, N, or S. If not otherwise indicated, the terms “alkyl” and “lower alkyl” include linear, branched, cyclic, unsubstituted, substituted, and/or heteroatom-containing alkyl and lower alkyl, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term “alkylene” as used herein refers to a difunctional linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon linkage, typically although not necessarily containing 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, such as methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, n-butylene, n-hexylene, decylene, tetradecylene, hexadecylene, and the like. Preferred alkylene linkages contain 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferred alkylene linkages contain 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, and the term “lower alkylene” refers to an alkylene linkage of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The term “substituted alkylene” refers to an alkylene linkage substituted with one or more substituent groups, i.e., wherein a hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen substituent group, and the terms “heteroatom-containing alkylene” and “heteroalkylene” refer to alkylene linkages in which at least one carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom. If not otherwise indicated, the terms “alkylene” and “lower alkylene” include linear, branched, cyclic, unsubstituted, substituted, and/or heteroatom-containing alkylene and lower alkylene, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The term “alicyclic” is used to refer to cyclic, non-aromatic compounds, substituents and linkages, e.g., cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl substituents, and cycloalkylene and cycloalkenylene linkages. Often, the term refers to polycyclic compounds, substituents, and linkages, including bridged bicyclic, compounds, substituents, and linkages. Preferred alicyclic moieties herein contain in the range of 3 to about 30 carbon atoms, typically 3 to about 18 carbon atoms, and more typically 5 to about 14 carbon atoms. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “alicyclic” includes substituted and/or heteroatom-containing such moieties. It will be appreciated that the term “cyclic,” as used herein, thus includes “alicyclic” moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term “fluorinated” refers to replacement of a hydrogen atom in a molecule or molecular segment with a fluorine atom, and includes perfluorinated moieties. The term “perfluorinated” is also used in its conventional sense to refer to a molecule or molecular segment wherein all hydrogen atoms are replaced with fluorine atoms, while the term “semi-fluorinated” refers to a molecule or molecular segment wherein fewer than all hydrogen atoms are replaced with fluorine atoms. Thus, a “fluorinated” methyl group encompasses —CH<sub>2</sub>F and —CHF<sub>2 </sub>as well as the “perfluorinated” methyl group, i.e., —CF<sub>3 </sub>(trifluoromethyl).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term “fluoroalkanol” as used herein refers to a compound or substituent containing a fluorinated, hydroxyl-substituted alkyl group, with “alkyl” defined as above. Fluoroalkanols and fluoroalcohol substituents may be semi-fluorinated or perfluorinated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The term “heteroatom-containing” as in a “heteroatom-containing alkyl group” (also termed a “heteroalkyl” group) refers to a molecule, linkage or substituent in which one or more carbon atoms are replaced with an atom other than carbon, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus or silicon, typically nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Examples of heteroalkyl groups include alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyaryl, alkylthio-substituted alkyl, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Unless otherwise indicated, the term “hydrocarbyl” is to be interpreted as including substituted and/or heteroatom-containing hydrocarbyl moieties. “hydrocarbyl” refers to univalent hydrocarbyl radicals containing 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, most preferably 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, including linear, branched, cyclic, alicyclic, and aromatic species. “Substituted hydrocarbyl” refers to hydrocarbyl substituted with one or more substituent groups, and the terms “heteroatom-containing hydrocarbyl” and “heterohydrocarbyl” refer to hydrocarbyl in which at least one carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The term “polyol” refers to an organic compound containing two or more hydroxyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By “substituted” as in “substituted alkyl,” “substituted alkylene,” and the like, as alluded to in some of the aforementioned definitions, it is meant that in the alkyl, alkylene, or other moiety, at least one hydrogen atom bound to a carbon (or other) atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen substituent. Examples of such substituents include, without limitation, functional groups such as halide, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, alkoxy, and acyl (including alkylcarbonyl (—CO-alkyl)), and hydrocarbyl moieties such as alkyl, including linear, branched, and cyclic alkyl. The functional groups may, if a particular group permits, be further substituted with one or more additional functional groups or with one or more hydrocarbyl moieties such as those specifically enumerated, and analogously, a hydrocarbyl substituent may be further substituted with one or more functional groups or additional hydrocarbyl moieties such as those specifically enumerated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When two substituents are indicated as being “taken together to form a ring,” several possibilities are encompassed. That is, when R and R′ of the following hypothetical compound are indicated as being taken together to form a ring</p>

the resulting compounds include (1) those wherein a single spacer atom links the carbon atoms indicated at * and ** (i.e., R and R′ “taken together” together form a single atom that may or may not be substituted, e.g., CH<sub>2 </sub>or O), (2) those wherein a direct covalent bond is formed between R and R′, and (3) those wherein R and R′ are linked through a bifunctional moiety containing one or more spacer atoms. In addition, compounds in which R and R′ are “taken together to form a ring” include compounds in which the linked atoms are not necessarily contained within a terminal group.

<p id="p-0133" num="0133">The fluoroalkanol-substituted α,β-unsaturated esters can be polymerized to provide a fluoroalkanol-substituted polymer using any effective polymerization process, e.g., radical polymerization using a suitable free radical initiator such as benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). For instance, the monomers can be dissolved in an appropriate solvent that, at reflux, will afford a medium that maintains a constant temperature suitable for activation of the initiator without inducing side reactions involving functional groups of the monomers. The solution can be prepared so as to afford a relatively high concentration of monomer, for example 30 wt %. The initiator is then added and the solution is degassed by bubbling with dry nitrogen. The reaction flask is then immersed in preheated oil bath and allowed to reflux for several hours. After cooling the solution to room temperature, the polymer is isolated by precipitation into an excess volume, for example twenty-fold, of an appropriate nonsolvent. The polymer is isolated by filtration, washed with the nonsolvent and dried to constant weight under vacuum. Polymers prepared using the fluoroalkanol-substituted α,β-unsaturated esters of the invention are useful in the manufacture of lithographic photoresist compositions.</p>
