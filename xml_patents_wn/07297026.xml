<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to prior Japanese patent application JP 2005-273502, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a connector with a shell having an opening for insertion of a mating connector. The connector with the shell will be called hereunder a shell connector.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2001-93626 discloses a conventional shell connector. The connector comprises a housing holding a contact and a shielding metal shell overlapped on a surface of the housing by a bending process. To the metal shell, a locking member as a separate component is coupled. The locking member is adapted to be engaged with a terminal portion of a mating connector. However, the above-mentioned connector requires a large number of parts and the bending process such as staking or caulking upon assembling. Accordingly, much time and labor are required to produce the connector and a finished product is varied in quality.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2004-319522 discloses another conventional shell connector. The connector comprises a housing holding a contact and a shielding shell fitted over the housing. The shell has a spring contacting member to be contacted with a mating connector and a tongue member to be ground-connected to a substrate. However, since the spring contacting member is formed by a bending process such as staking or caulking, much time and labor are required to produce the connector and a finished product is varied in quality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In either case, it is difficult to finish the connector at a low cost and with high accuracy. In addition, high-density mounting is difficult. Furthermore, although a mechanical strength of an outer surface is assured, no consideration is made about a mechanical strength of a coupling portion for insertion of the mating connector. Therefore, if the mating connector is repeatedly inserted and removed for a long period of time, the coupling portion may be worn or the spring contacting member may be subjected to buckling distortion, Sometimes, the spring contacting member is broken. As a result, it is impossible to guarantee high durability and reliability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a shell connector improved in mechanical strength so that a mating connector is stably inserted and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is another object of this invention to provide a shell connector having a shell structure high in durability and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is still another object of this invention to provide a shell connector which can easily be produced at a low cost, with high accuracy, and at high productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other objects of the present invention, there is provided a connector comprising a contact having a contacting portion, a housing holding the contact, and a shell coupled with the housing, the housing having a coupling portion to be coupled with a mating connector in a first direction, the contacting portion being disposed in the coupling portion, the shell comprising an opening edge defining an opening faced to the coupling portion and a guide portion disposed in the coupling portion to guide movement of the mating connector in the first direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, description will be made of a whole of a shell connector according to an embodiment of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The shell connector illustrated in the figures is of a female type adapted to be connected to and disconnected from an I/O connector of a male type or the like as a mating connector. The connector comprises a housing <b>10</b> including an insulating front housing <b>12</b> and an insulating rear housing <b>13</b> coupled with the front housing <b>12</b>. The housing <b>10</b> holds a plurality of types of conductive contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b>. Herein, the contacts <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are connected to signal lines while the contacts <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are connected to ground lines.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The front housing <b>12</b> has a coupling portion, i.e., a coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>adapted to receive the mating connector coupled thereto in a first direction (back-and-forth direction) A<b>1</b>. The coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>is opened at a front surface of the front housing <b>12</b>, i.e., a coupling surface. Each of the contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b> has a part exposed in the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>as a contacting portion. However, the contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b> are insulated from one another by an inner protrusion <b>19</b>. In the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b> are arranged in a second direction (transversal direction) A<b>2</b> perpendicular to the first direction A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The front housing <b>12</b> is provided with a pair of screw fitting holes <b>12</b><i>b </i>formed near opposite ends in the second direction A<b>2</b>, respectively, locking claws <b>12</b><i>c </i>formed on its upper and lower surfaces near the opposite ends in the second direction A<b>2</b>, respectively, and protruding portions <b>12</b><i>d </i>formed on opposite end faces in the second direction A<b>2</b>, respectively. To the front housing <b>12</b>, a shell <b>11</b> formed by a conductive plate-like material is coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">On the other hand, the rear housing <b>13</b> has a fitting hole <b>13</b><i>a </i>formed on its rear side to fit a connection object component <b>14</b>. The connection object component <b>14</b> comprises a conductive component shell <b>14</b><i>a </i>connected to a FFC (Flexible Flat Cable) <b>14</b><i>b </i>comprising a collection of a predetermined number of conductive wires. When the connection object component <b>14</b> is inserted to the fitting hole <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the component shell <b>14</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected to the contact <b>17</b> and the FFC <b>14</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected to the other contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The rear housing <b>13</b> has locking members <b>13</b><i>b </i>engaged with the locking claws <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the front housing <b>12</b>, respectively. The locking members <b>13</b><i>b </i>are elastically flexible in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> in addition, description will be made of the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The shell <b>11</b> has a main body <b>111</b> covering the coupling surface of the front housing <b>12</b>. The main body <b>111</b> has an opening edge <b>111</b><i>b </i>defining an insertion opening <b>111</b><i>a </i>faced to the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the front housing <b>12</b>. The opening edge <b>111</b><i>b </i>has an asymmetrical shape with respect to a virtual plane extending along the first and the second directions A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> and including the inner protrusion <b>19</b>. Specifically, the opening edge <b>111</b><i>b </i>has a linear upper side and a curved lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shell <b>11</b> further has a pair of plate-like guide portions <b>113</b> extending from upper and lower edges of the main body <b>111</b> and inserted into the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the front housing <b>12</b>. The guide portions <b>113</b> serves to guide movement of the mating connector in the first direction A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the guide portions <b>113</b> has a flat guide surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>positioned on a substantial extension of the opening edge <b>11</b><i>b </i>in the first direction A<b>1</b>. Specifically, each of a plane containing a lower surface of the upper guide portion <b>113</b> and the upper side of the opening edge <b>111</b><i>b </i>and a plane containing an upper surface of the lower guide portion <b>113</b> and a lowermost part of the lower side of the opening edge <b>111</b><i>b </i>is substantially parallel to the above-mentioned virtual plane.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the guide portions <b>113</b> has a plurality of, i.e., two spring members <b>114</b> formed at an intermediate position in the second direction A<b>2</b> and protruding from the guide surface <b>113</b><i>a</i>. The spring members <b>114</b> are elastically press-contacted with an outer wall surface of the mating connector inside the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the front housing <b>12</b> and serve as ground springs as will later be described. Each of the spring members <b>114</b> extends towards the insertion opening <b>111</b><i>a </i>and has an end portion bent outward.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the guide portions <b>113</b> has a plurality of, i.e., two press-fit dowels <b>115</b> and a fixing member <b>116</b> formed at each of opposite ends in the second direction A<b>2</b>. The press-fit dowels <b>115</b> are press-fitted to recesses (not shown) formed on the front housing <b>12</b>. The fixing member <b>116</b> is formed by bending. The fixing member <b>116</b> is fitted to a recess <b>12</b><i>e </i>formed on the front housing <b>12</b> and fixedly engaged with the front housing <b>12</b> in the first direction A<b>1</b>. Thus, each of the guide portions <b>113</b> is kept spaced from the contacting portions of the contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b>. A combination of the press-fit dowels <b>115</b> and the fixing member <b>116</b> will herein be called a holding portion. End faces at end portions of the fixing members <b>116</b> are exposed on the upper and the lower surfaces of the front housing <b>12</b> after the shell <b>11</b> is coupled to the front housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The shell <b>11</b> has a pair of spring locking members <b>117</b> formed at opposite ends of the main body <b>11</b> in the second direction A<b>2</b> and extending in the first direction A<b>1</b> to face side surfaces of the front housing <b>12</b>, respectively. Each of the spring locking members <b>117</b> has an engaging hole <b>117</b><i>a </i>fitted to and engaged with the protruding portion <b>12</b><i>d </i>of the front housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon forming the guide portions <b>113</b>, projecting portions <b>112</b> are formed at six positions by bending. Between adjacent ones of the projecting portions <b>112</b>, the ground springs <b>114</b> are formed via a punching process including cutting. These projecting portions <b>112</b> are fitted to a plurality of recesses <b>12</b><i>f </i>formed on upper and lower edge portions of the coupling surface of the front housing <b>12</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The shell <b>11</b> and the front housing <b>12</b> are fixed to a casing or the like of an electrical unit or an electronic unit by the use of screw fixing members (nuts) <b>20</b>, a middle housing <b>21</b>, and screws (bolts). For this purpose, the main body <b>111</b> is provided with screw openings <b>111</b><i>c </i>formed near the opposite ends in the second direction A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, description will be made of a method of using the above-mentioned shell connector.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At first, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connection object component <b>14</b> is fitted into the fitting hole <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, the component shell <b>14</b><i>a </i>press-contacted with a single solid ground surface M<b>1</b> of the FFC <b>14</b><i>b </i>is connected to the contact <b>17</b>. On the other hand, conductive patterns on a patterned surface M<b>2</b> of the FFC <b>14</b><i>b </i>are connected to the contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the mating connector is inserted into the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the first direction A<b>1</b>. At this time, the mating connector is guided by the guide surfaces <b>113</b><i>a</i>. In particular, since the spring members <b>114</b> are elastically press-contacted with the outer wall surface of the mating connector, a guiding function is improved and insertion is stably carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the mating connector is completely fitted into the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the mating connector is contacted with the contacts <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b> inside the coupling hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>and achieves desired electrical connection to the connection object component <b>14</b>. Simultaneously, since the spring members <b>114</b> are elastically press-contacted with the outer wall surface of the mating connector, the shell <b>11</b> is electrically connected to at least one of the contacts <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> via the mating connector. Therefore, the shell <b>11</b> is connected to the solid ground surface M<b>1</b> of the FFC <b>14</b><i>b</i>. At this time, the spring members <b>114</b> serve as the ground springs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the present invention has thus far been described in connection with a single embodiment thereof, it will readily be possible for those skilled in the art to put this invention into practice in various other manners. For example, although the description has been made about the case where the connector has a plurality of contacts, this invention is similarly implemented in a connector having a single contact. Although the housing comprises a combination of a plurality of components in the foregoing, the housing may be integrally formed. Although the shell has a pair of guide portions, one of the guide portions may be replaced by a wall surface of the housing.</p>
