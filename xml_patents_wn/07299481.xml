<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a divisional application of prior application Ser. No. 10/058,857, filed on Jan. 30, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,880,164, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a support mechanism and a feeding unit including such a mechanism, and more specifically to a support mechanism, which moves a pickup for optically writing and reading information on and from a recording surface of a recording medium, along the recording surface thereof, while supporting the pickup, as well as a feeding unit including such a support mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, optical discs including CDs (Compact Discs), DVDs (Digital Video Discs), and MDs (Mini Discs) have been put into practical use as information recording media onto or from which information is written and read utilizing an optical beam such as a laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A device, which is known as a pickup, is used to radiate an optical beam onto an information-recording surface of the optical disc and receive the light reflected from the surface. While the pickup is moved in parallel with the information-recording surface in the radial direction of the optical disc, the optical disc rotates. This rotation enables bits of information to optically be written or read onto or from information trucks formed spirally on the optical disc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>, a conventional feeding unit for moving the pickup in the radial direction of the optical disc in parallel with the information-recording surface will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a plan view illustrating the conventional feeding unit, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a cross-sectional view cut along the line. XIV-XIV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a bottom view illustrating the conventional feeding unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a supporting mechanism included in the conventional feeding unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref>, the conventional feeding unit S′ includes a pickup casing <b>100</b> on which a pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>is secured. The pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>has a lens <b>101</b> and various drive parts. The lens <b>101</b> is used to radiate an optical beam B and receive light that is reflected on an optical disc DK. The drive parts drive optical parts, such as a semiconductor laser, and the lens <b>101</b>, both of which produce the optical beam B cooperatively, in the trucking or focus direction of the optical disc DK.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pickup casing <b>100</b> has two sides facing to each other. On one side thereof, two main support members <b>102</b> are mounted so as to protrude from the side. On the other side thereof, one sub support member <b>105</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A through hole is formed through each of the two main support members <b>102</b> that allow a main shaft <b>103</b>, which is secured by a not-shown chassis or others, to move through the through holes in the direction parallel with the direction of movement of the pickup casing <b>100</b>. The main shaft <b>103</b> passing through the through holes permits the one side of the pickup casing <b>100</b> to be supported movably.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the other hand, the sub support member <b>105</b> is formed so that it is able to pinch a sub shaft <b>106</b> secured by a not-shown chassis or other members in the direction parallel with the main shaft <b>103</b>. The sub support member <b>105</b> receives the sub shaft <b>106</b>. This receipt enables the other side of the pickup casing <b>100</b> to be supported movably by the sub shaft <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">On the outer circumferential surface of the main shaft <b>103</b>, a feeding screw <b>103</b><i>a </i>is made in the form of a helical to move the pickup casing <b>100</b> along the feeding screw. A rack gear <b>111</b> engaging with the feeding screw <b>103</b><i>a </i>is provided at the tip of a pressing spring <b>112</b> secured at the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b> with the help of a screw <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pressing spring <b>112</b> presses the rack gear <b>111</b> in a pressing direction shown by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This makes it possible that the rack gear <b>111</b> engages with the feeding screw <b>103</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the conventional feeding unit S′, the main shaft <b>103</b> is driven to rotate by an electric motor not shown, with the result that the rack gear <b>111</b> engaging with the feeding screw <b>103</b><i>a </i>travels along the main shaft <b>103</b>. Concurrently with this travel, the sub support member <b>105</b> travels-along the sub shaft <b>106</b>, which allows the pickup casing <b>100</b> itself to move in the radial direction of the optical disk DK together with the pickup <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the pickup casing <b>100</b> moves, delayed movement of the sub support member <b>105</b> relative to the movement of the rack gear <b>111</b> occurs due to friction between the sub shaft <b>106</b> and the surface of the sub support member <b>105</b>, which comes into contact with the sub shaft <b>106</b>. In such a case, force having a function of turning clockwise or counterclockwise the pickup casing <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref> is applied to the pickup casing <b>100</b>. The two main support members <b>102</b> are provided so as to be apart from each other, with the result that the pickup casing <b>100</b> is supported on the main shaft <b>103</b>. In addition, a resilient force is applied to the region of the main shaft <b>103</b> between the two main support members <b>102</b> by means of the pressing spring <b>112</b>. It is therefore possible to prevent the pickup casing <b>100</b> from turning clockwise or counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, in the conventional feeding unit S′, in order to ensure a smooth movement of the pickup casing <b>100</b> with backlash of the pickup casing <b>100</b> restricted to a minimum, it is required that the through holes of the main support members <b>102</b> (through which the main shaft <b>103</b> passes) be worked with precision in relation to the diameter or other factors of the main shaft <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To realize such a higher precision, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>, the conventional feeding unit S′ adopts a metal bush <b>110</b> tightly inserted into the through hole of each main support member <b>102</b>. Then, working of a sizing treatment is performed to raise the precision of a coaxial degree to the main shaft <b>103</b>. Alternatively, the through holes are subjected to the finishing treatment of the through holes, which is conducted as the secondary finishing treatment. In addition, in the case that the main support members <b>102</b> are formed of resin, it is required to use a mold produced with precision. Even when any finishing treatment is used, it is required that the through holes be formed under severe quality control.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, the conventional feeding unit S′ having the above-described structure provides higher costs for the parts, because it is required that the inner surface of each through hole be formed with a high precision. In addition, in cases where suspended dusts go into the through hole and remain in a gap between the main shaft <b>103</b> and the through hole (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), it may be difficult for the pickup casing <b>100</b> to move smoothly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An object of the present invention, which was made in view of the above-mentioned problems, is to provide a support mechanism that permits to decrease its manufacturing cost, minimize influences of dusts or others put on the main shaft on the movement of the pickup casing, and reduce frictional resistance generated between the main support member and the main shaft, leading to a smooth movement of the pickup casing, as well as to provide a feeding unit for a pickup casing, which includes such a support mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to realize the above object, the supporting mechanism of the present invention for movably supporting a member to be supported along a supporting shaft, comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">a plurality of supporting members provided on the member, each of said supporting members contacting with the supporting shaft on at least two contact points so as to be movable on the supporting shaft, the at least two contact points being apart from each other; and</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">a pressing device for pressing the plurality of supporting members against the supporting shaft so that the contact points of each supporting member simultaneously come into contact with the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the pressing device presses the plurality of supporting members against the supporting shaft so that the contact points of each supporting member simultaneously come into contact with the supporting shaft. All the contact points of each supporting member come into contact with the supporting shaft simultaneously and all of the plural supporting members come into contact with the supporting shaft simultaneously on the contact points. Hence, with the supporting members pressed on only the plurality of points as they contact the supporting shaft, the supporting members still hold the member in a stable manner. It is unnecessary to form the whole bodies of the supporting members with a high precision, which helps to reduce a manufacturing cost of the feeding unit itself. Additionally, even when dusts come onto the supporting shaft, influence of such dusts on the movement of the member can be minimized. Furthermore, a frictional resistance caused between the supporting members and the supporting shaft can be reduced remarkably to provide a smooth movement of the member to be supported.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the supporting member has two contact surfaces, which include the contact points, respectively and are in parallel with the supporting shaft, and the pressing device comes into contact with the supporting shaft at a position existing between the supporting members in a parallel direction with the supporting shaft to press the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, the supporting members come into contact with the supporting shaft through the two contact surfaces and the pressing device presses each supporting member against the supporting shaft in a place between the supporting members in the parallel direction with the supporting shaft. This makes it possible to movably support the member in a more stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is also preferred that the supporting shaft has an outer circumferential surface on which a threaded portion is formed to move the member to be supported, and the pressing device is fixed to the member to be supported and includes a rack gear engaging with the threaded portion so as to move the member along the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, the pressing device fixed to the member allows the rack gear to be pressed and engaged against and with the threaded portion formed on the supporting shaft. It is therefore possible to support the member to be supported and move it smoothly along the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is also preferred that the supporting mechanism further comprises a feeding shaft being disposed in parallel with the supporting shaft and having an outer circumferential surface on which a threaded portion is formed to move the member to be supported, and is characterized in that the pressing device is fixed to the member to be supported and includes a rack gear engaging with the threaded portion so as to move the member along the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus, the feeding shaft is provided on its outer circumferential surface with the threaded portion. In addition, the pressing device is fixed to the member to be supported and includes the rack gear engaging with the threaded portion. It is therefore possible to support the member to be supported and move it smoothly along the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the supporting mechanism of the present invention, the at least two contact points may be apart from each other in a circumferential direction of the supporting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention also provides a feeding unit comprising:

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">Each embodiment will now be described about a configuration in which the present invention is applied to a feeding unit for moving a pickup optically reading and writing information from and onto an optical disc. The feeding unit is constructed to move the pickup in parallel with an information-recording surface of the optical disc in a radial direction of the surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">The first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view illustrating the feeding unit of the first embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view cut along the line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a bottom view of the feeding unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the feeding unit of the first embodiment of the present invention, illustrating the main shaft <b>103</b> and its peripheral components.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the feeding unit S<b>1</b> includes a pickup casing <b>100</b> on which a member, i.e., a pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>to be supported is secured. The pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>has a lens <b>101</b> and various drive parts. The lens <b>101</b> is used to not only radiate an optical beam B but also receive light that reflected on an optical disc DK. The drive parts drive optical parts, such as a semiconductor laser, and the lens <b>101</b>, both of which produce the optical beam B cooperatively, in the trucking or focus direction of the optical disc DK.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">The pickup casing <b>100</b> has two sides facing to each other. On one side thereof, two main support members <b>1</b> are provided so as to protrude from the side surface of the pickup casing <b>100</b>. On the other side thereof, one sub support member <b>105</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">The feeding unit S<b>1</b> of the first embodiment of the present invention differs from the conventional feeding unit S′ in structure and shape of (i) the main support members <b>1</b> serving as the supporting members, which are provided on the one of the opposite side surfaces of the pickup casing <b>100</b>, i.e. the member to be supported, and (ii) a pressing spring <b>2</b> serving as the pressing device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">The pressing spring <b>2</b> is formed into a leaf spring. The pressing spring <b>2</b> has a base end portion and a bent portion. The pressing spring <b>2</b> is placed on the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b> so that its longitudinal direction is perpendicular to the main shaft <b>103</b>. In such a state, the base end portion of the pressing spring <b>2</b> is fixed to the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b> by means of a screw <b>113</b>. The bent portion of the pressing spring <b>2</b> comes into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> and presses it so that the main shaft <b>103</b> is held between the main support member <b>1</b> and the bent portion of the pressing spring <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">A rack gear <b>111</b> is provided on the bent portion of the pressing spring <b>2</b> so as to engage with a threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the main shaft <b>103</b>. Rotation of the main shaft <b>103</b> therefore cause the pickup casing <b>100</b> to move. The bent portion of the pressing spring <b>2</b> pushes the main shaft <b>103</b> against the receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the support member <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The main shaft <b>103</b> is located to pass through the two main support members <b>1</b> and the pressing spring <b>2</b>. On the outer circumferential surface of the main shaft <b>103</b>, a threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>is formed in the helical pattern so as to engage with the rack gear <b>111</b>. The main shaft <b>103</b> is driven by an electric motor <b>4</b>, so that the rotation of the main shaft <b>103</b> is transmitted to the rack gear <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">On the other hand, the sub support member <b>105</b> is formed so as to be capable of pinching a sub shaft <b>106</b> secured by a not-shown chassis or other members. The sub shaft <b>106</b> is directed in parallel with the main shaft <b>103</b>. This enables the other side of the pickup casing <b>100</b> to be supported movably by the sub shaft <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">In the first embodiment, each of the two main support members <b>1</b> has smooth receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, which are at right angles to each other. The receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the main support member <b>1</b> come into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> so that the pickup casing <b>100</b> can be supported.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tip end of the pressing spring <b>2</b>, on which the rack gear <b>111</b> is provided, is bent at a slight angle. Thus the pressing spring <b>2</b> is permitted to apply a pressing force to the main shaft <b>103</b> in the directions shown by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This force caused the main shaft <b>103</b> to contact with the receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>formed on each main support member <b>1</b>, thereby producing component forces X and Z at each main support member <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The reaction to the component forces X and Z causes each main support member <b>1</b> to be pressed against the main shaft <b>103</b> at the same time. The one side of the pickup casing <b>100</b>, on which the main support members <b>1</b> are provided, can be supported by the main shaft <b>103</b> in such a manner that the pickup casing <b>100</b> is prohibited from moving in any direction orthogonal to the movement thereof. Accordingly, no backlash will be caused in the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">The threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>is formed in a helical pattern on the outer circumferential surface of the main shaft <b>103</b>, like the conventional feeding unit. The rack gear <b>111</b> engaging with the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>is pressed through a pressing force generated by the pressing spring <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with the result that the rack gear <b>111</b> tightly engages with the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a</i>. With both of the rack gear <b>111</b> and the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>engaged therewith, the motor <b>4</b> is driven to move the pickup casing <b>100</b>. Because the rack gear <b>111</b> is forced to move along the main shaft <b>103</b>, with the sub support member <b>105</b> allowed to freely travel along the sub shaft <b>106</b>, the drive of the motor <b>4</b> causes the pickup casing <b>100</b> together with the pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>to travel in the radial direction of the optical disc DK.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">The travel of the pickup casing <b>100</b> also causes friction resistance between the sub shaft <b>106</b> and a contact surface of the sub support member <b>105</b> to the sub shaft <b>106</b>. This resistance causes the sub support member <b>105</b> to move later than the rack gear <b>111</b>. Such a delay causes a force having a function of turning the pickup casing <b>100</b> in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. However, the two main support members <b>1</b> are disposed apart from each other in order to support the pickup casing <b>100</b> on the main shaft <b>103</b> and the pressing spring <b>2</b> pushes a certain intermediate position of the main shaft <b>103</b> existing between the two main support members <b>1</b>. Such a structure prevents the pickup casing <b>100</b> from turning in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">As described above, the feeding unit S<b>1</b> of the first embodiment enables each main support member <b>1</b> to be pressed against the main shaft <b>103</b>. In this action, each of the plurality of main support members <b>1</b> provided on the pickup casing <b>100</b> is brought into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> on at least two points, when the support members <b>1</b> move along the main shaft <b>103</b>. These contact points are apart from each other in the circumferential direction of the main shaft <b>103</b> All the contact points of each main support member <b>1</b> come into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> simultaneously and all the two main support members <b>1</b> come into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> simultaneously on the contact points.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">Accordingly, with the main support members <b>1</b> pressed on only the two points as they contact the main shaft <b>103</b>, the main support members <b>1</b> still hold the pickup casing <b>100</b> in a stable manner. It is unnecessary to form the whole bodies of the main support members <b>1</b> with high precision, which helps to reduce a manufacturing cost of the feeding unit itself. Additionally, even when dusts come onto the main shaft <b>103</b>, influence of such dusts on the movement of the pickup casing <b>100</b> can be minimized. Furthermore, a frictional resistance caused between the main support members <b>1</b> and the main shaft <b>103</b> can be reduced remarkably, providing a smooth movement of the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">Each of the main support members <b>1</b> comes into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> on the two receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, the pressing spring <b>2</b> comes into contact with the main shaft <b>103</b> at a given position between the main support members <b>1</b>, which causes each main support member <b>1</b> to be pressed steadily against the main shaft <b>103</b>. As a result, the pickup casing <b>100</b> can be supported with more stability.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">In addition, one end of the pressing spring <b>2</b> is secured on the pickup casing <b>100</b>, and the rack gear <b>111</b> is provided on the other end of the spring <b>2</b>. The rack gear <b>111</b> engages with the threaded portion formed on the outer circumferential surface of the main shaft <b>103</b>. This structure makes it possible to smoothly move the pickup casing <b>100</b> along the main shaft <b>103</b>, while still being supported.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">The second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0083">In the second embodiment, the same reference numerals are given to the same structural components as those in the first embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> as well as in the conventional feeding unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>, and detailed explanation thereof will therefore be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">The feeding unit S<b>2</b> of the second embodiment differs from the conventional feeding unit S′ in the following configurations. The feeding unit S<b>2</b> is provided with main support members <b>10</b> and the pressing spring <b>11</b>, both of which are arranged on the one side of the pickup casing <b>100</b> and are different in construction and shape from those in the first embodiment. In addition, unlike the conventional feeding unit S′, the main shaft <b>13</b> for supporting the pickup casing <b>100</b> is provided independently from the feeding shaft <b>12</b> on which the threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref>, to support the pickup casing <b>100</b>, the feeding unit S<b>2</b> of the second embodiment adopts the sub shaft <b>106</b> and the main shaft <b>13</b>, which is formed into a cylindrical rod-shape with no threaded portion and arranged in parallel with the sub shaft <b>106</b>. In order to move the pickup casing <b>100</b> in parallel with the information-recording surface of an optical disk DK in the radial direction thereof, the feeding shaft <b>12</b> is additionally disposed at an outward position beyond the main shaft <b>13</b>, when viewed from the pickup casing <b>100</b>, but still parallel with the main shaft <b>13</b>. On the outer circumferential surface of the feeding shaft <b>12</b>, a threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is formed to move the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">On one of the opposite sides of the pickup casing <b>100</b> of the second embodiment, two main support members <b>10</b> are provided so as to be apart from each other. The main support members <b>10</b> come into contact with the main shaft <b>13</b> so as to movably support the pickup casing <b>100</b> in parallel with the information-recording surface in the radial direction of the optical disc DK. On the other side thereof, the sub support member <b>105</b> is provided so as to come into contact with the sub shaft <b>106</b>. The sub support member <b>105</b> also movably supports the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">Flat receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are formed respectively on each main support member <b>10</b> so as to be right angles to each other in the same manner as the main support members <b>1</b> described in the first embodiment. The receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>come into contact with the main shaft <b>13</b> to support the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">The pressing spring <b>11</b> has a length extending from the side edge of the pickup casing <b>100</b> on the side of the main shaft <b>13</b> to the threaded portion <b>12</b>. On the tip end of the pressing spring <b>11</b>, a rack gear <b>111</b> is provided to engage with the threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>to move the pickup casing <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the tip end of the rack gear <b>111</b> is bent so as to press the feeding shaft <b>12</b> in the directions shown by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The other ends of the pressing spring <b>11</b> are fixed on the pickup casing <b>100</b> by screws <b>113</b><i>a </i>and <b>113</b><i>b</i>. As a result, two forces, which are equal in strength to two component forces of a pressing force caused by the pressing spring <b>11</b> to the feeding shaft <b>12</b> through the rack gear <b>111</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, are applied to the main shaft <b>13</b> at each main support member <b>10</b>. The reaction to the two component forces applied to the main shaft <b>13</b> causes each main support member <b>10</b> to be pressed against the main shaft <b>13</b> at the same time. The one side of the pickup casing <b>100</b>, on which the main support members <b>10</b> are provided, can be supported by the main shaft <b>13</b> such that the pickup casing <b>100</b> is prohibited from moving in any direction orthogonal to the movement thereof. Accordingly, no backlash will be caused in the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">The threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>for moving the pickup casing <b>100</b> is formed into a helical pattern on the outer circumferential surface of the feeding shaft <b>12</b>, as described above. The rack gear <b>111</b> engaging with the threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is pressed by a pressing force generated by the pressing spring <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the result that the rack gear <b>111</b> tightly engages with the threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The rack gear <b>111</b> and the threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>engage with each other. A not-shown motor is driven to move the pickup casing <b>100</b>. Because the rack gear <b>111</b> is forced to move along the feeding shaft <b>12</b> together with the sub support member <b>105</b> allowed to freely travel along the sub shaft <b>106</b>, the drive of the motor causes the pickup casing <b>100</b> together with the pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>to travel in the radial direction of the optical disc DK.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">The travel of the pickup casing <b>100</b> causes a frictional resistance between the sub shaft <b>106</b> and the contact surface of the sub support member <b>105</b> coming into contact thereto in the same manner as the first embodiment of the present invention. This resistance causes the sub support member <b>105</b> to move later than the rack gear <b>111</b>. Such a delay causes a force having a function of turning the pickup casing <b>100</b> in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref>. However, the two main support members <b>10</b> are disposed apart from each other in order to support the pickup casing <b>100</b> on the main shaft <b>13</b> and the pressing spring <b>11</b> pushes a certain intermediate position of the main shaft <b>13</b> existing between the two main support members <b>10</b>. Such a structure prevents the pickup casing <b>100</b> from turning in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">As described above, the feeding unit S<b>2</b> of the second embodiment enables each main support member <b>10</b> to be pressed against the main shaft <b>13</b>. In this action, each of the plurality of main support members <b>10</b> provided on the pickup casing <b>100</b> is brought into contact with the main shaft <b>13</b> on at least two points, when the support members <b>10</b> move along the main shaft <b>13</b>. All the contact points of each main support member <b>10</b> come into contact with the main shaft <b>13</b> simultaneously and all the two main support members <b>10</b> come into contact with the main shaft <b>13</b> simultaneously on the contact points.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Accordingly, with the main support members <b>10</b> pressed on only the two points as they contact the main shaft <b>13</b>, the main support members <b>10</b> still hold the pickup casing <b>100</b> with a stable manner. It is unnecessary to form the whole bodies of the main support members <b>10</b> with high precision, which helps to reduce a manufacturing cost of the feeding unit itself. Additionally, even when dusts come onto the main shaft <b>13</b>, influence of such dusts on the movement of the pickup casing <b>100</b> can be minimized. Furthermore, a frictional resistance caused between the main support members <b>10</b> and the main shaft <b>13</b> can be reduced remarkably, providing a smooth movement of the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">Each of the main support members <b>10</b> comes into contact with the main shaft <b>13</b> on the two receiving surfaces <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, the pressing spring <b>11</b> comes into contact with the feeding shaft <b>12</b> at a prescribed position between the main support members <b>10</b>. This causes each main support member <b>10</b> to be pressed steadily against the main shaft <b>13</b>. As a result, the pickup casing <b>100</b> can be supported with more stability.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">In addition, one end of the pressing spring <b>11</b> is secured on the pickup casing <b>100</b>, and the rack gear <b>111</b> is provided on the other end of the spring <b>11</b>. The rack gear <b>111</b> engages with the threaded portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>formed on the outer circumferential surface of the feeding shaft <b>12</b> disposed in parallel with the main shaft <b>13</b>. This structure makes it possible to smoothly move the pickup casing <b>100</b> along the main shaft <b>13</b>, while still being supported.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">The third embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view illustrating the feeding unit of the third embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a side view of the feeding unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a bottom view of the feeding unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view illustrating the feeding unit of the third embodiment of the present invention, illustrating the main shaft <b>103</b> and its peripheral components.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">In the third embodiment, the same reference numerals are given to the same structural components as those in the first embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> as well as in the conventional feeding unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>, and detailed explanation thereof will therefore be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">The feeding unit S<b>3</b> of the third embodiment differs from the conventional feeding unit S′ in the arrangement of both of the sub shaft <b>106</b> and the main shaft <b>103</b> for supporting the pickup casing <b>100</b>. More specifically, both of the sub shaft <b>106</b> and the main shaft <b>103</b> are arranged so as to pass below the pickup casing <b>100</b> when viewing from the top. Therefore, the pickup casing <b>100</b> is moved so as to bridge a space between the shafts <b>106</b> and <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, in the feeding unit S<b>3</b> of the third embodiment, a recess <b>23</b>, which is rectangular in section with its one side opened, is formed along one end of the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b>. The size of the recess <b>23</b> is determined so that the recess <b>23</b> exactly receives the sub shaft <b>106</b> to support the pickup casing <b>100</b>. A receiving surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>is formed along one wall of the recess <b>23</b> and comes into contact with the sub shaft <b>106</b> when the recess <b>23</b> receives the sub shaft <b>106</b>. A sub support member <b>21</b> is fixed on the bottom so as to cover the lower opening of the recess <b>23</b>. Thus, the sub shaft <b>106</b> can be held between the receiving surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the sub support member <b>21</b>, resulting in that one side end of the pickup casing <b>100</b> is movably supported along the sub shaft <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">On the other hand, on the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b>, two recesses <b>22</b> are further formed so as to be apart from each other at prescribed positions along a groove on the opposite side to the above-mentioned recess <b>23</b>. The recesses <b>22</b> are used to receive the main shaft <b>103</b>. Each recess <b>22</b> is formed in section into a reversed V-shape, so receiving surfaces <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>capable of contacting with the main shaft <b>103</b> are formed on the walls of each recess <b>22</b>, respectively. A pressing spring <b>20</b> is secured on the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b>. The one end of the pressing spring <b>20</b> is located at a center between the recesses <b>22</b>. Therefore, pinching the main shaft <b>103</b> between the recesses <b>22</b> (i.e., the receiving surfaces <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of each recess <b>22</b>) and the one end of the pressing spring <b>20</b> permits the other side end of the pickup casing <b>100</b> to be supported movably.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">On the outer circumferential surface of the main shaft <b>103</b>, a threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>is formed to move the pickup casing <b>100</b> in parallel with the information-recording surface in the radial direction of an optical disc DK.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">The other ends of the pressing spring <b>20</b> are fixed on the bottom of the pickup casing <b>100</b> by screws <b>113</b><i>a </i>and <b>113</b><i>b</i>. A rack gear <b>111</b> is provided on the tip end of the pressing spring <b>20</b> to move the pickup casing <b>100</b> by engaging with the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the pressing spring <b>20</b> has a shape so as to press at its end the main shaft <b>103</b> in the direction of a pressing force indicated by arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">The pressing force permits the main shaft <b>103</b> to contact with the receiving surfaces <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of each recess <b>22</b> simultaneously, generating two component forces as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The reaction to the two component forces causes the receiving surfaces <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of each recess <b>22</b> to be pressed against the main shaft <b>103</b> at the same time. The main shaft <b>103</b> can support the pickup casing <b>100</b>, while preventing the pickup casing <b>100</b> from moving in any direction orthogonal to the movement thereof. Accordingly, no backlash will be caused in the pickup casing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">The threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>for moving the pickup casing <b>100</b> is formed in a helical pattern on the outer circumferential surface of the main shaft <b>103</b>, as described above. The rack gear <b>111</b> engaging with the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>is pressed by a pressing force generated by the pressing spring <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, with the result that the rack gear <b>111</b> tightly engage s with the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a</i>. The rack gear <b>111</b> and the threaded portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>engaged with each other. A not-shown motor is driven to move the main shaft <b>103</b>. Because the rack gear <b>111</b> is forced to move along the main shaft <b>103</b> with the sub support member <b>21</b> allowed to freely travel along the sub shaft <b>106</b>, the drive of the motor causes the pickup casing <b>100</b> together with the pickup <b>100</b><i>a </i>to travel in the radial direction of the optical disc DK.</p>

Such a delay causes a force having a function of turning the pickup casing <b>100</b> in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>. However, the two recesses <b>22</b> (the two sets of receiving surfaces <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>) are disposed apart from each other in order to support the pickup casing <b>100</b> on the main shaft <b>103</b> and the pressing spring <b>20</b> pushes a certain intermediate region of the main shaft <b>103</b> existing between the two recesses <b>22</b>.
