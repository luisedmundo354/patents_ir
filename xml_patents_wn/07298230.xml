<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a duplexer and particularly to a duplexer with a compact splitter circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Duplexers that divide transmit signals and receive signals are widely used in conventional mobile communications equipment, typified by mobile telephones. A duplexer basically includes a transmit filter connected between the antenna terminal and transmit terminal, and a splitter circuit and receive filter connected between the antenna terminal and receive terminal in series. The splitter circuit contained in the duplexer is used to isolate the effects that the transmit/receive signals have on the circuits of the other party, and thus the transmit signals sent from the transmit terminal are sent to the antenna terminal without reaching the receive terminal, and the receive signals sent from the antenna terminal are supplied to the receive terminal without reaching the transmit terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A splitter circuit used in a duplexer typically includes an ordinary LC circuit and a quarter-wavelength phaseline. (See Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2001-24476.)</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, if the splitter circuit used in a duplexer is composed of an LC circuit and quarter-wavelength phaseline, this results in a problem wherein it impedes attempts to make the duplexer more compact. Namely, in a splitter circuit that uses an LC circuit, the inductor (L element) and capacitor (C element) are of a large size, so a plurality of electrode pads are required for mounting and thus it is intrinsically difficult to make the circuit more compact. In addition, in a splitter circuit that uses a quarter-wavelength phaseline, when a substrate with a dielectric constant of approximately 7, for example, is used, a phaseline of approximately 10 mm is required in the 2 GHz band, so the size is considerably large in comparison with transmit filters or receive filters that can be implemented with a size of roughly 1-1.5 mm square, respectively, in the same frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is apparent from foregoing, in order to make the duplexer more compact, it is necessary to make the splitter circuit contained therein more compact.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a compact, high-performance duplexer by making improvements to the splitter circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above and other objects of the present invention can be accomplished by a duplexer, having an antenna terminal, a transmit terminal and a receive terminal, comprises a transmit filter connected between the antenna terminal and the transmit terminal, and a splitter circuit and a receive filter connected in series between the antenna terminal and the receive terminal, wherein said splitter circuit includes at least one phaseline connected between said antenna terminal and said receive filter and at least one resonator connected in parallel with said phaseline.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, the length of the phaseline contained in the splitter circuit can be made much shorter than in the prior art, so the entire duplexer can be made more compact in size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred aspect of the present invention, said splitter circuit further includes a first inductor connected between one end of said phaseline and one end of said resonator and a second inductor connected between the other end of said phaseline and the other end of said resonator. As these inductors, the inductance of a wire or via formed within the package can be used, so this does not cause an increase in the size of the splitter circuit. Moreover, the resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency of said resonator are preferably lower than the passband of said transmit filter or higher than the passband of said receive filter. Thus, attenuation poles for the transmit filter and the receive filter appear at the resonance frequencies of the resonator, so the characteristics of the duplexer can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further preferred aspect of the present invention, said at least one phaseline includes a first phaseline with one end connected to said antenna terminal and a second phaseline with one end connected to said receive filter, and said at least one resonator includes a first resonator connected in parallel with said first phaseline and a second resonator connected in parallel with said second phaseline. In this case, it is preferably that said splitter circuit further includes a first inductor connected between said one end of said first phaseline and one end of said first resonator, a second inductor connected between the other end of said first phaseline and the other end of said first resonator, a third inductor connected between said one end of said second phaseline and one end of said second resonator, and a fourth inductor connected between the other end of said second phaseline and the other end of said second resonator. Furthermore, said at least one resonator preferably further includes a third resonator connected between the ground and the point of connection between said second inductor and said fourth inductor. Thereby, the lower edge of the passband of the receive filter can be made extremely sharp, so the characteristics of the duplexer can be greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further preferred aspect of the present invention, the resonance frequencies of said first and second resonators are preferably lower than the antiresonance frequency of said third resonator, and the effective coupling coefficient of said third resonator is preferably less than the effective coupling coefficients of said first and second resonators. According to this aspect of the present invention, the characteristics of the duplexer can be greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, said resonator preferably is constituted of a film bulk acoustic resonator. Thereby, not only can the splitter circuit be made more compact in size but better electric power resistance can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the present invention in this manner, it is possible to make the length of the phaseline contained in the splitter circuit much shorter than in the prior art, so the entire duplexer can be made more compact in size. In addition, attenuation poles corresponding to the resonance frequencies of the resonators can be generated, so the characteristics of the duplexer can be improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Before describing details of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the basic constitution of a duplexer will be first described.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of the basic configuration of a duplexer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the duplexer <b>100</b> includes a transmit filter <b>120</b> connected between an antenna terminal <b>100</b><i>a </i>and a transmit terminal <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and a splitter circuit <b>110</b> and receive filter <b>130</b> connected in series between the antenna terminal <b>100</b><i>a </i>and a receive terminal <b>100</b><i>c</i>. When in actual use, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the antenna terminal <b>100</b><i>a </i>is connected to an antenna element <b>141</b>, the transmit terminal <b>100</b><i>b </i>is connected to a transmit circuit <b>142</b> and the receive terminal <b>100</b><i>c </i>is connected to a receive circuit <b>143</b>. Thereby, receive signals received via the antenna element <b>141</b> are supplied to the receive circuit <b>143</b> without reaching the transmit circuit <b>142</b>, and transmit signals sent from the transmit circuit <b>142</b> are sent to the antenna element <b>141</b> without reaching the receive circuit <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of a specific circuit configuration of a splitter circuit <b>110</b> used in a duplexer <b>100</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the splitter circuit <b>110</b> includes a phaseline <b>111</b> connected between its input end <b>110</b><i>a </i>(=antenna terminal <b>100</b><i>a</i>) and its output end <b>110</b><i>b</i>, a resonator <b>112</b> connected in parallel with the phaseline <b>111</b>, a first inductor <b>113</b> connected between the resonator <b>112</b> and input end <b>110</b><i>a</i>, and a second inductor <b>114</b> connected between the resonator <b>112</b> and output end <b>110</b><i>b</i>. As the inductors <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, the inductance of a wire or via formed within the package can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By adopting such a circuit configuration, it is possible to make the length of the phaseline <b>111</b> much shorter than when a quarter-wavelength phaseline is used as in the prior-art splitter circuit. Specifically, it is possible to make the length of the phaseline <b>111</b> approximately one-tenth of a wavelength, so the duplexer <b>100</b> can be made more compact in size than in the prior art. While a film bulk acoustic resonator or surface acoustic wave resonator can be used as the resonator <b>112</b>, among these it is preferable to use a film bulk acoustic resonator. This is because if a film bulk acoustic resonator is used as the resonator <b>112</b>, not only can the splitter circuit <b>110</b> be made more compact in size but also it is possible to obtain a high power durability.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Here, it is necessary to set the resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency of the resonator <b>112</b> different from the passbands of the transmit filter <b>120</b> and receive filter <b>130</b>. Specifically, in a system in which the passband of the receive filter <b>130</b> is higher than the passband of the transmit filter <b>120</b>, it is preferable to set the resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency of the resonator <b>112</b> lower than the passband of the transmit filter <b>120</b>. If the resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency of the resonator <b>112</b> are set in this manner, then attenuation poles corresponding to the resonance frequencies of the resonator <b>112</b> appear in the transmit filter <b>120</b> and receive filter <b>130</b>. Thereby, the characteristics of the duplexer can be improved in comparison to the case that the splitter circuit is constituted using a quarter-wavelength phaseline.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross section showing the structure of a film bulk acoustic resonator which is preferably used as a resonator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the film bulk acoustic resonator preferably used as the resonator <b>112</b> includes a substrate <b>10</b>, an acoustic multilayer <b>11</b> provided upon the substrate <b>10</b>, a lower electrode <b>12</b> provided upon the acoustic multilayer <b>11</b>, a piezoelectric film <b>13</b> provided upon the lower electrode <b>12</b> and an upper electrode <b>14</b> provided upon the piezoelectric film <b>13</b>, while the first inductor <b>113</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is connected to one of the lower electrode <b>12</b> and upper electrode <b>14</b> and the second inductor <b>114</b> is connected to the other one.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The substrate <b>10</b> serves the role of a base that gives the film bulk acoustic resonator mechanical strength, being made of silicon (Si), sapphire or other monocrystalline substrate, alumina, AlTiC or other ceramic substrate, a quartz substrate or glass substrate or the like. Among these, it is most preferable to use monocrystalline silicon substrate which is inexpensive and for which advanced wafer processes are established.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The acoustic multilayer <b>11</b> has a structure constituted of alternately laminated reflective films <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>made of materials that are different from each other, serving the role of improving the characteristics of the film bulk acoustic resonator by reflecting vibrations propagating in the direction of the substrate <b>10</b>. While there is no particular limit to the number of reflective layers making up the acoustic multilayer <b>11</b>, in this example, four pairs of reflective films <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are laminated. The materials used for the reflective films <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are not particularly limited as long as the acoustic impedance of reflective film <b>11</b><i>a </i>is higher than that of reflective film <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and among the paired reflective films <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, it is preferable to use aluminum nitride (AlN) for the reflective film <b>11</b><i>a </i>positioned on the substrate <b>10</b> side, and preferable to use silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) for the reflective film <b>11</b><i>b </i>positioned on the lower electrode <b>12</b> side. Regarding the thickness of reflective films <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, this may be set appropriately depending on the target resonance frequency, being preferably set to approximately one-quarter of the wavelength, respectively. The wavelength referred to here is defined by the ratio of the speed of sound of the bulk acoustic waves to the target resonance frequency (speed of sound/resonance frequency).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lower electrode <b>12</b> is used as one electrode of the film bulk acoustic resonator and also is the under layer for the piezoelectric film <b>13</b> at the time of fabrication. The lower electrode <b>12</b> is preferably a metallic thin film formed by disposing platinum (Pt), gold (Au), iridium (Ir), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), or other material having a face-centered structure with a single orientation upon a (111) surface, or a metallic thin film formed by disposing osmium (Os), rhenium (Re), ruthenium (Ru) or other material having a hexagonal closest packed structure with a single orientation upon a (0001) surface. This is because the crystallinity of the piezoelectric material formed thereupon by an epitaxial growth becomes extremely good. As the lower electrode <b>12</b>, it is also possible to use a metallic thin film of molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) or other material with a body-centered structure, or SrRuO<sub>3 </sub>or other oxide conductor thin film with a perovskite structure. The thickness of the lower electrode <b>12</b> may be set depending on the target resonance frequency, being preferably set to approximately one-tenth of the wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The piezoelectric film <b>13</b> serves the role of converting the electrical signals applied between the lower electrode <b>12</b> and the upper electrode <b>14</b> into bulk acoustic waves and the material used for it may be ZnO, AlN, GaN or other piezoelectric material having a wurtzite crystal structure. The thickness of the piezoelectric film <b>13</b> may be set depending on the target resonance frequency, being preferably set to approximately one-half of the wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The upper electrode <b>14</b> is used as the other electrode of the film bulk acoustic resonator and the material used therefor may be aluminum (Al), gold (Au), platinum (Pt) or other metal or alloys of these metals with copper (Cu) or the like, or a multilayer formed by laminating these metals with titanium (Ti) or other metal may also be used. The thickness of the upper electrode <b>14</b> may be set depending on the target resonance frequency, being preferably set to approximately one-tenth of the wavelength.</p>

The splitter circuit <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> further includes a first inductor <b>113</b><i>a </i>connected between the one end of the first phaseline <b>111</b><i>a </i>(=input end <b>110</b><i>a</i>) and one end of the first resonator <b>112</b><i>a</i>, a second inductor <b>114</b><i>a </i>connected between the other end of the first phaseline <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the other end of the first resonator <b>112</b><i>a</i>, a third inductor <b>113</b><i>b </i>connected between one end of the second phaseline <b>111</b><i>b </i>(=output end <b>110</b><i>b</i>) and one end of the second resonator <b>112</b><i>b</i>, a fourth inductor <b>114</b><i>b </i>connected between the other end of the second phaseline <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the other end of the second resonator <b>112</b><i>b </i>and a third resonator <b>115</b> connected between ground and the point of connection between the second inductor <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the fourth inductor <b>114</b><i>b</i>. As the inductors <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>and <b>114</b><i>b</i>, the inductance of a wire or via formed within the package can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the resonance frequency of the first and second resonators <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>is set lower than the antiresonance frequency of the third resonator <b>115</b>, and the effective coupling coefficient of the third resonator <b>115</b> is less than (preferably approximately half of) the effective coupling coefficients of the first and second resonators <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As the phaseline <b>111</b> contained within the splitter circuit <b>110</b>, a stripline with a length of approximately 6 mm formed within an LTCC package with a dielectric constant of approximately 7 was used. Note that if the dielectric constant of the substrate is 7, then the line length of one wavelength at 1.9 GHz is about 60 mm, so the length of the phaseline <b>111</b> is one-tenth of one wavelength. In addition, as the resonator <b>112</b> contained in the splitter circuit <b>110</b>, a film bulk acoustic resonator having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is used and its resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency are set to 1.76 GHz and 1.80 GHz, respectively, which are lower than the passband of the transmit filter <b>120</b>. Moreover, the inductance of the inductors <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> were set to 0.45 nH.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, regarding the resonators <b>121</b> to <b>125</b> that make up the transmit filter <b>120</b>, film bulk acoustic resonators having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are used, the resonator <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> that make up the series arm had their resonance frequency set to 1.89 GHz and their antiresonance frequency set to 1.925 GHz, while the resonators <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> that make up the parallel arm had their resonance frequency set to 1.85 GHz and their antiresonance frequency set to 1.89 GHz. Moreover, the inductance of the inductor <b>126</b> was set to 2.9 nH.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Moreover, regarding the resonators <b>131</b> to <b>137</b> that make up the receive filter <b>130</b> also, film bulk acoustic resonators having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are used, the resonators <b>131</b> to <b>133</b> that make up the series arm had their resonance frequency set to 1.98 GHz and their antiresonance frequency set to 2.03 GHz, while the resonators <b>134</b> to <b>137</b> that make up the parallel arm had their resonance frequency set to 1.914 GHz and their antiresonance frequency set to 1.962 GHz.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, resonator <b>112</b> is connected in parallel to phaseline <b>111</b> in this example, so one can see that attenuation poles appear in the transmit signal characteristic TX and receive signal characteristic RX at frequencies corresponding to the resonance and antiresonance of the resonator <b>112</b>.</p>

As described above, if the dielectric constant of the substrate is 7, then the line length of one wavelength at 1.9 GHz is about 60 mm, so the length of phaseline <b>111</b><i>a </i>is 0.06 wavelength and the-length of phaseline <b>111</b><i>b </i>is 0.09 wavelength. In addition, as the resonators <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and <b>115</b> contained in the splitter circuit <b>110</b>, film bulk acoustic resonators having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are used, their resonance frequency is set to 1.927 GHz and their antiresonance frequency is set to 1.981 GHz.
