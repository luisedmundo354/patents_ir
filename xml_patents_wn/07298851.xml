<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention, electronic book security and copyright protection system, provides for secure distribution of electronic text and graphics to subscribers and secure storage. The method may be executed at a content provider's site, at an operations center, over a video distribution system or over a variety of alternative distribution systems, at a home subsystem, and at a billing and collection system. The content provider or operations center and/or other distribution points perform the functions of manipulation and secure storage of text data, security encryption and coding of text, cataloging of books, message center, and secure delivery functions. The home subsystem connects to a secure video distribution system or variety of alternative secure distribution systems, generates menus and stores text, and transacts through communicating mechanisms. A portable book-shaped viewer is used for secure viewing of the text. A billing system performs the transaction, management, authorization, collection and payments utilizing the telephone system or a variety of alternative communication systems using secure techniques.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sparked by the concept of an information superhighway, a revolution will take place in the distribution of books. Not since the introduction of Gutenberg's movable typeset printing has the world stood on the brink of such a revolution in the distribution of text material. The definition of the word book will change drastically in the near future. Due to reasons such as security, convenience, cost, and other technical problems, book and magazine publishers are currently only able to distribute their products in paper form. This invention solves the problems encountered by publishers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The electronic book selection and delivery system is a new way to distribute books to bookstores, public libraries, schools and consumers. The technological breakthroughs of this invention provide a secure electronic system for both delivering selected books and receiving payments. The system has an unusual combination of features that provides the consumer with a daily use household appliance that has a high tech aura while being very practical, portable, and easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An advantage of the system is that it eliminates the distribution of any physical object such as a paper book or computer memory device from any book or text distribution system. The purchase of a book becomes a PAY-PER-READ event avoiding the overhead, middle-men, printing costs, and time delay associated with the current book distribution system. Published material and text such as the President's speech, a new law, a court decision on abortion, or O. J. Simpson's testimony can be made immediately available to the consumer at a nominal fee. Alternatively, books may be made available free to the end use consumer, subsidized by advertisers who sponsor books or embed advertising within the books.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The system is a novel combination of new technology involving the television, cable, telephone, and computer industries. It utilizes high bandwidth data transmissions, strong security measures, sophisticated digital switching, high resolution visual displays, novel controls, and user friendly interface software.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The primary components of the text delivery system are the subsystem for preparing the text for secure delivery and the subsystem for receiving and selecting text that was delivered. An embodiment of the system includes additional components and optional features that enhance the system. The system may be configured for use by bookstores, public libraries, schools and consumers. In one embodiment, the system for consumer use is made up of four subsystems, namely: (1) an operations center, (2) a distribution system, (3) a home subsystem including reception, selection, viewing, transacting and transmission capabilities, and (4) a billing and collection system. Alternative configurations of the system are defined to allow for a variety of traditional and non-traditional delivery methods.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The operations center performs several primary functions: manipulating text data (including receiving, formatting and storing of text data), security encoding of text, cataloging of books, providing a messaging center capability, and performing uplink and secure delivery functions. In one embodiment, the system delivers the text from the operations center to consumer homes by inserting text data within analog video signals. The insertion of text is generally performed with an encoder at an uplink site that is within or near the operations center. The system can use several lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI), all the lines of the analog video signal, a digital video signal or unused portions of bandwidth to transmit text data. Using the VBI delivery method, the top ten or twenty book titles may be transmitted with video during normal programming utilizing existing cable or broadcast transmission capability without disruption to the subscriber's video reception. Using the entire video signal, thousands of books may be transmitted within just one hour of air time. Nearly any analog or digital video or data distribution system may be used to deliver the text data. The text data may also be transmitted over other low and high speed signal paths including a telephone network (e.g., a public switched telephone network) having a high speed connection such as an asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL) connection and the Internet, for example. The text data is delivered in a secure fashion over the distribution systems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The home subsystem performs at least four functions: connecting to the distribution system, selecting text, storing text, and transacting through a communicating mechanism. The components of the home subsystem may be configured in a variety of hardware configurations. Each function may be performed by a separate component, the components may be integrated, or the capability of existing cable set top converter boxes, computers, and televisions may be utilized. A connector, library unit and viewer unit may be used. In one embodiment, the connector portion of the home subsystem receives an analog video signal and strips or extracts the text from the video. The home library stores the text signal, provides a user friendly software interface to the system and processes the transactions at the consumer home. The viewer provides a screen for viewing text or menus and novel user friendly controls. Alternative embodiments are presented that support the secure delivery and storage of text using a variety of communication and security mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The viewing device may be a portable book shaped viewer which securely stores one or more books for viewing and provides a screen for interacting with the home library unit. A high resolution LCD display is used to both read the books and to interact with the home library software. In one embodiment, an optional phone connector or return-path cable connection initiates the telephone calls and, with the aid of the library, transmits the necessary data to complete the ordering and billing portion of the consumer transaction. Alternative embodiments are presented in the referenced related applications that support ordering and billing using a variety of communication mechanisms. The user-friendly controls include a bookmark, current book and page turn button. The billing and collection system performs transaction management, authorizations, collections and publisher payments automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A system similar to the system for consumer use may be used in bookstores, schools and public libraries.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The electronic books are delivered from an operations center or other remote location to an end-user location such as a home system using security mechanisms that prevent unauthorized access to the electronic books. An asymmetric public key encryption technique may be used by the operations center, serving as a sending party. The operations center encrypts the electronic book using a symmetric key and a symmetric key encryption algorithm. The symmetric key may be randomly generated, or the symmetric key may be previously defined and retrieved from storage. The operations center then encrypts the symmetric key. The encrypted electronic book and the encrypted symmetric key are delivered to the home system. The home system decrypts the encrypted symmetric key and uses the symmetric key to decrypt the encrypted electronic book.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, only symmetric key encryption is used to protect the electronic book during delivery. A third party trusted source may provide a symmetric key to both the party sending the electronic book and the party receiving the electronic book. The trusted source encrypts the symmetric key using a symmetric key of the sending party and delivers the encrypted symmetric key to the sending party. The sending party decrypts the symmetric key and uses the decrypted symmetric key to encrypt the electronic book. The receiving party, which also receives the symmetric key from the trusted source in an encrypted format, decrypts the symmetric key using the receiving party's symmetric key. The receiving party then uses the decrypted symmetric key from the trusted source to decrypt the electronic book.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the sending party and the receiving party negotiate a shared key for use in the delivery of the electronic book. The parties exchange key negotiation information and use the same key generation algorithm to generate the same key.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another embodiment, a seed key generation algorithm is used to generate a sequence of encryption keys.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the encrypted electronic book is broadcast to home systems. In another embodiment, the encrypted electronic book is provided on demand. In yet another embodiment, the encrypted electronic book is provided on a physical storage medium such as a smart card.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The system for providing secure electronic book delivery may also include integrity checking algorithms to ensure the electronic book was not altered in route. The system may also include mechanisms that identify the sending party and the receiving party.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Secure delivery of electronic books may be provided between a content provider such as a publisher and a distribution center such as an operations center. Secure delivery may also be provided between the operations center and a home system, between the home system library and the home system viewer, between a lending facility such as a public library and a home system, and between multiple viewers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system may also incorporate copyright protection mechanisms including application of visible copyright notices to the delivered electronic books. Other copyright information may be embedded within the electronic book using a visible watermark, for example.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows an electronic book distribution system <b>100</b> that may be used for secure distribution of an electronic book. A content provider <b>110</b> may publish hard copy versions of books or other printed media including newspapers, magazines, and product catalogs, for example. The content provider <b>110</b> may convert printed materials to an electronic format, apply security mechanisms, and provide the electronic formatted materials to a distribution center <b>120</b>, over uplink path <b>115</b>. The uplink path <b>115</b> may be a wired or a wireless path. The uplink path <b>115</b> may be a telecommunications network, for example. The uplink path <b>115</b> may be a satellite relay path or a wireless telephone path. The uplink path <b>115</b> may involve providing electronic books to the distribution center on a fixed media, such as a CD-ROM, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the content provider <b>110</b> and the distribution center <b>120</b> are shown as separate components of the electronic book distribution system <b>100</b>. However, the content provider <b>110</b> and the distribution center <b>120</b> may be co-located. The distribution center <b>120</b> may convert printed matter into an electronic format. Alternately, the distribution center <b>120</b> may receive electronic files from an outside source, such as the content provider <b>110</b>. The distribution center <b>120</b> may process and store electronic books using secure techniques as presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The distribution center <b>120</b> distributes electronic books. The distribution may be, for example, over distribution path <b>125</b>, distribution network <b>130</b>, and distribution path <b>135</b> to an electronic book subsystem or terminal <b>140</b>, which may include an electronic book viewer (not shown). The terminal may also be a television, a set top terminal, a personal computer, or similar device. An apparatus and method for the secure distribution of electronic books is disclosed in greater detail later. The distribution network <b>130</b> may be an electronic book store, an Internet web site, a wired or wireless telecommunications network, an intranet, a radio program delivery system, a television program delivery system, including cable television, satellite television broadcast, and over-the-air broadcast, for example. The electronic book distribution network <b>130</b> could include direct delivery through a mail delivery system of electronic books on a fixed media, such as a CD-ROM, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows components of an electronic book distribution system <b>170</b> using a television program delivery system to distribute electronic books. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the components of the electronic book selection and delivery system <b>170</b> are an encoder <b>174</b>, a video distribution system <b>178</b>, a connector <b>182</b>, and a text selector <b>186</b>. The encoder <b>174</b> places textual data on a video signal to form a composite video signal. Although the composite signal may contain only textual data, it usually carries both video and textual data. A variety of equipment and methods may be used to encode text data onto a video signal. The video distribution system <b>178</b> distributes the composite video signal from the single point of the encoder <b>174</b> to multiple locations, which have connectors <b>182</b>. The connector <b>182</b> receives the digital or analog video signal from the video distribution system <b>178</b> and separates, strips or extracts the text data from the composite video signal. If necessary, the extracted text data is converted into a digital bit stream. The text selector <b>186</b> works in connection with the connector <b>182</b> to select text.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Using the connector <b>182</b> and text selector <b>186</b> combination, various methods of selecting and retrieving desired text from a composite or video signal are possible. Text may be preselected, selected as received or selected after being received and stored. One method is for the connector <b>182</b> to strip or extract all the text from the video signal and have the text selector <b>186</b> screen all the text as received from the connector <b>182</b>. The text selector <b>186</b> only stores text in long term or permanent memory if the text passes a screening process described below.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows another embodiment of an electronic book selection and delivery system <b>200</b>. The delivery system <b>200</b> includes: an operations center <b>250</b> including an uplink site <b>254</b>, a video distribution system <b>208</b>, a home system <b>258</b> including a video connector <b>212</b>, a library <b>262</b>, a viewer <b>266</b>, and a phone connector <b>270</b>, telephone system <b>274</b>, an Internet web site <b>279</b> and a billing and collection system <b>278</b>. Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the home system <b>258</b> may include connections to a television <b>259</b> and a personal computer <b>261</b> may be used to display menu screens, electronic books, electronic files, or any other information associated with the electronic book delivery system <b>200</b>. In addition, the television <b>259</b> and the personal computer <b>261</b> may provide control functions that replicate and supplement those of the viewer <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The operations center <b>250</b> receives textual material from outside sources <b>282</b> such as publishers, newspapers, and on-line services. Alternately, the outside sources may maintain electronic books at the Internet web site <b>279</b>. The outside sources <b>282</b> may convert textual and graphical material to digital format and apply security mechanisms, or may contract with another vendor to provide this service. The operations center <b>250</b> may receive the textual and graphical material in various digital formats and may convert the textual material to a standard compressed format for storage. In so doing, the operations center <b>250</b> may create a pool of textual material that is available to be delivered to the home system <b>258</b>. The textual material may be grouped by books or titles for easy access.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As used herein, “book” means textual or graphical information such as contained in any novels, encyclopedias, articles, magazines, newspapers, catalogues, periodicals, or manuals. The term “title” may represent the actual title assigned by an author to a book, or any other designation indicating a particular group, portion, or category of textual information. The title may refer to a series of related textual information, a grouping of textual information, or a portion of textual data. For example, “Latest Harlequin Romance”, “Four Child Reading Books (Ages 10-12),” “Encyclopedia ‘BRITANNICA’™,” “President's Speech,” “Instruction Manual,” “Schedule of 4th of July Events,” “Pet Handbooks,” “Roe v. Wade,” and “The Joy of Cooking,” are suitable titles. Also, the title may be a graphical symbol or icon. Thus, a picture of a wrench may be a title for a repair book, a picture of a computer a title for a computer book, a graphical symbol of a telephone a title for a telephone book, a drawing of a dagger a title for a mystery book, a picture of a bat and ball a title for a sports book, and a picture of tickertape a title for a business book.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The operations center <b>250</b> includes the uplink site <b>254</b> for placing the text onto a telecommunications signal in a secure fashion and sending the telecommunications signal into a distribution system. The uplink site <b>254</b> would generally include an encoder <b>204</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to encode the text onto the telecommunications signal.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Many analog and digital video distribution systems may be used with the electronic book delivery system <b>200</b>, such as cable television distribution systems, broadcast television distribution systems, video distributed over telephone systems, direct satellite broadcast distribution systems, and other wire and wireless video distribution systems. Nearly any distribution system which can deliver a telecommunications signal, including a video signal, will work with the electronic book delivery system <b>200</b>. It is also possible to distribute the electronic book without using a telecommunications signal as described in the embodiments presented in the referenced related applications. Methods used for securing the distribution of materials over the electronic book delivery system <b>200</b> are presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The home system <b>258</b> performs five functions: (1) connecting with a video distribution system; (2) selecting data; (3) storing data; (4) displaying data; and (5) handling transactions. An important optional function of the home system <b>258</b> is communicating using, in one embodiment, a telephone communication system <b>274</b>. The home system <b>258</b> may be made up of four parts: a video connector <b>212</b> or similar type of connector for connecting with the distribution system <b>208</b>, a library <b>262</b> for storing and processing, a viewer <b>266</b> for viewing menus and text and a telephone connector <b>270</b> for connecting with a telephone communications system <b>274</b>. Additional embodiments are presented in the referenced related applications that address alternative communication mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The billing and collection system <b>278</b> may be co-located with the operations center <b>250</b> or located remote from the operations center <b>250</b>. The billing and collection system <b>278</b> may be in communication with the home system <b>258</b> using telephone-type communication systems (for example <b>274</b>). Any of a number of communication systems as presented in the referenced related applications, such as a cellular system or the Internet, will operate with the billing and collection system <b>278</b>. The billing and collection system <b>278</b> records the electronic books or portions of text that are selected or ordered by the subscriber. The collection system will charge a subscriber's credit account or bill the subscriber. In addition, the billing and collection system <b>278</b> may monitor that amount due to publishers or other outside sources <b>282</b> who have provided textual data or other services such as air time to enable the text delivery system <b>200</b> to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an intranet <b>279</b>′. The intranet <b>279</b>′ may be used as a part of a private distribution network for distributing and circulating electronic books. For example, a university library may use the intranet <b>279</b>′ to circulate electronic books to university students and professors.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an expanded overview of a delivery plan <b>301</b> for the electronic book delivery system <b>200</b>. It is a comprehensive delivery plan <b>301</b> to support various types of users and various billing systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that publishers <b>282</b> may provide text transfer <b>302</b> to the operations center <b>250</b>′ and receive payments <b>306</b> from the billing and collection system <b>278</b>′. A separate channel uplink site <b>254</b>′ is shown in this configuration receiving data <b>310</b> from the operations center <b>250</b>′. The operations center <b>250</b>′ has three separate sections (<b>318</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>326</b>) one for text receiving, formatting and re-entry <b>318</b>, a second for security encoding and processing <b>322</b> and a third section for catalog and messaging center functions <b>326</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The collection and billing system <b>278</b>′ shown has two sections (<b>330</b>, <b>334</b>) one for transaction management, authorizations and publisher payments <b>330</b>, and the other for customer service <b>334</b>. The customer service section <b>334</b> provides for data entry and access to customer account information. Transaction accounting information <b>338</b> is supplied to credit card companies <b>342</b> by the transaction management section <b>330</b> of the billing and collection system <b>278</b>′. The credit card companies <b>342</b> provide billing <b>346</b> to customers either electronically or by mail.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Methods for communicating between the subscriber base <b>348</b> and the billing and collection system <b>278</b>′ include: by telephone switching <b>350</b> alone, cellular switching <b>354</b> and telephone switching <b>350</b> combined, and by use of the cable system <b>358</b> and the telephone switching <b>350</b>. The system shown supports both one-way <b>362</b> and two-way cable communication <b>366</b> with subscribers. Additional communication methods are presented in the referenced related applications. Public libraries and schools <b>370</b> as well as bookstores <b>374</b> may use the delivery system <b>301</b>. Methods used for securing these communications are presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Public libraries and schools <b>370</b> could have a modified system to allow the viewer to be checked-out or borrowed while bookstores <b>374</b> would rent or sell the viewer and sell electronic book data. The bookstores <b>374</b> as well as the public libraries and schools <b>370</b> may be serviced by cable <b>378</b>. Optional direct broadcast systems (DBS) <b>382</b> can also be used with the system <b>200</b> as detailed in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">I. The Operations Center</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic of the operations center <b>250</b>, which includes the uplink The operations center <b>250</b> may gather text or books by receiving, decrypting, formatting, storing, and encoding. A data stream <b>302</b> containing text may be received at the operations center <b>250</b> by a data receiver <b>402</b>. The data receiver <b>402</b> is under the control of a processor <b>404</b>. After reception, the data stream is decrypted using digital logic for decrypting <b>403</b> which is under the control of the processor <b>404</b>. The data stream is then formatted using digital logic for formatting <b>406</b> which is also under the control of the processor <b>404</b>. If any additional text is generated at the operations center <b>250</b> locally for insertion into the distributed signal, the text generation is handled through text generator hardware <b>410</b>, which may include a data receiver and a keyboard (not shown). Following processing by the text generator <b>410</b>, the additional text can be added to the text received by the combining hardware <b>414</b> that includes digital logic circuitry (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The processing at the operations center <b>250</b> is controlled by a processor <b>404</b>, which uses an instruction memory <b>416</b>. The processor <b>404</b> and instruction memory <b>416</b> may be supplied by a personal computer or mini-computer, for example. To perform the catalog and messaging functions, the operations center <b>250</b> uses a catalog and message memory <b>420</b> and the text generator <b>410</b> if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The data stream of text, catalog and messages may be encoded by security module encoding <b>424</b> prior to being sent to the uplink module <b>254</b>. Various encoding techniques may be used by the security encoding module <b>424</b> such as the commercial derivative of NSA's encryption algorithm (Data Encryption System (DES)) and General Instrument's DigiCipher II. Additional embodiments are presented n Section VII. Following encoding, the encoded text may be stored in text memory <b>428</b> prior to being sent to the uplink <b>254</b>. A first-in-first-out text memory arrangement may be used under the control of the processor <b>404</b>. Various types of memory may be used for the text memory <b>428</b> including RAM. The operations center <b>250</b> may use file server technology for the text memory <b>428</b> to catalog and spool books for transmission as is described below. The operations center <b>250</b> may also store the electronic book as secure compressed data files using the secure storage techniques presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an embodiment, to transmit textual data, the distribution system <b>208</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may use high bandwidth transmission techniques such as those defined by the North American Broadcast Teletext Standard (NABTS) and the World System Teletext (WST) standard. Using the WST format (where each line of the Vertical Blanking Interval contains 266 data bits), a four hundred page book, for example, may be transmitted during regular television programming using four lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval at a rate of approximately one book every 1.6 minutes (63,840 bits per second). Alternatively, books may be transmitted over a dedicated channel, which interrupts programming so that 246 lines of video can be used to transmit approximately 2,250 books every hour (3.9 Mbits per second). A teletext type format is the simplest but possibly the slowest text format to use with the electronic book delivery system <b>200</b>. In either event, an encoder <b>204</b> may be used at an uplink site <b>254</b> to insert textual data into the analog video signal. In many other respects, the delivery of the textual information may be completed using an existing cable television plant and equipment. Alternative transmit formats and delivery systems are presented in the referenced related applications.</p>

As shown in block <b>500</b>, the publisher <b>282</b> processes data files of text for books, compresses, encrypts and sends the data files to the operations center <b>250</b> or uplink <b>254</b>. Text files for books may be sent one book at a time. As shown in block <b>504</b>, the uplink <b>254</b> or operations center <b>250</b> receives and processes the data stream from the publisher <b>282</b>. Generally, part of this processing includes encryption and error correction. Specific embodiments used for encryption are presented in Section VII. Text files may be delivered for receipt by multiple home subsystems simultaneously, or to a specific individual home subsystem.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, the electronic books are distributed to consumers using a video distribution system such as a cable television system. However, the electronic books may also be packaged as data packets and distributed over other telecommunications networks such as a digital wireless telephone network, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment, as shown in block <b>508</b>, files are broken into smaller packets of information. Header information is added to the packets. The bit stream is converted from a serial digital bit stream to an analog bit stream that is compatible with an NTSC video signal. Block <b>512</b> shows the switching of analog data into the video lines of a video signal. The analog data may be placed either in the VBI or the active video lines. In some instances, unused portions of bandwidth (such as 5-40 MHZ, 70-75 MHZ, 100-109 MHZ or other guard bands) may be used instead of the video lines. Alternate transmission methods are presented in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>is an example of a hardware configuration to perform some of the functions for blocks <b>508</b> and <b>512</b>. A video feed <b>516</b> is received and processed through a sync stripper <b>520</b>. The stripped sync signal <b>532</b> is used by the digital logic control <b>524</b>. The digital logic control <b>524</b> receives the sync signal <b>532</b> and a serial digital bit stream <b>528</b> for processing. The digital logic control <b>524</b> passes the serial digital bit stream to the Digital to Analog converter <b>536</b> and outputs a control signal <b>540</b> for the video switch The video switch <b>544</b> integrates the video feed <b>516</b> and analog data stream <b>548</b> into a video feed with analog data signal inserted <b>552</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As an alternative to cable, broadcast or other television delivery methods, the public telephone system may be used to transmit books to the subscribers. An average book would take about 7 minutes to transmit over the public telephone system. Using the telephone system, it is not necessary to combine video and text into a composite signal. In most other respects, the operations center would remain similar whether text delivery was by telephone or cable. File server technology (such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875, entitled AUDIO/VIDEO FILE SERVER INCLUDING DECOMPRESSION/PLAYBACK MEANS, issued to Mincer, et al., and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, entitled FILE SERVER SYSTEM HAVING HIGH-SPEED WRITE EXECUTION, issued to Noveck, et al., incorporated herein by reference) may be used at the operations center with a telephone system text delivery method.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As another alternative to cable, television, and telephone system delivery, the public telephone system may be used to provide access to the Internet, where the Internet web site <b>279</b> may be accessed. Electronic books may be ordered, paid for, and delivered directly from the Internet web site <b>279</b> over the telephone system. In addition, the electronic book viewer <b>266</b> may be used for wireless voice and data communications using the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When a wireless telephone network is used to distribute electronic books, or otherwise communicate with the home system <b>258</b>, the home system <b>258</b> may receive data using any one or more standard protocols including time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), Global Systems for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMPS) protocols. In any delivery system using the telephone system, individual subscribers may increase the electronic book deliver rate by incorporating high speed modems or other communications devices such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connector, or by use of a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). These alternative delivery methods are presented in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">II. The Home System</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The hardware configuration for a four component home system <b>258</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows a hardware configuration for a two component home subsystem. The home system <b>258</b> performs several functions, such as receiving data and video transmissions, stripping (or extracting) the data from the video signal, decrypting the data, screening and storing the data, providing user friendly interface controls and software, displaying menus and text, processing transactions, initiating telephone calls and transmitting billing data. Various hardware configurations may be utilized to achieve the desired functions of the home system <b>258</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the home system <b>258</b> can be configured to utilize the reception and channel tuning capability of the current installed subscriber base of cable converter boxes and televisions <b>601</b> and networked computers. The home system <b>258</b> can also be designed as an advanced set top terminal converter box with menu generation capability, electronic memory and a telephone modem as described in section V below. Alternatively, the home system <b>258</b> can be configured to support alternate delivery and ordering methods as described in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The electronic components which make up the home system <b>258</b> can be arranged in a variety of ways. In the four unit subsystem of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>the viewer <b>266</b> and library <b>262</b> are wired together while the remaining components communicate through RF transceivers <b>604</b>. In a simple version of the home system <b>258</b> there are only two units, a library <b>262</b> and a viewer <b>266</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows a two unit home system <b>258</b> with certain optional features.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The viewer <b>266</b> is generally equipped with a high resolution viewing area <b>602</b>, digital logic (including a key <b>605</b>, security <b>606</b>, and a microprocessor <b>621</b>), video graphics control and memory <b>607</b>, power supply circuitry <b>602</b> (not shown), an optional battery <b>603</b> and an optional RF transceiver <b>604</b>. In a two unit arrangement, the library <b>262</b> contains the connector function to the electronic book distribution system <b>208</b>, connector function to a public telephone communications system, and memory <b>600</b> (which may be removable and portable <b>600</b>′). More specifically, the library <b>262</b> would include data stripping functions <b>617</b>, digital logic <b>609</b>, memory storage <b>600</b>, power circuitry <b>610</b>, optional connections <b>611</b> (including cellular or PCN <b>611</b>′), optional battery (not shown), optional tuner module <b>613</b> and an optional RF transceiver <b>604</b>. The connector <b>212</b> and the public telephone system connection <b>270</b>, as well as the removable portable memory unit <b>600</b> of the library <b>262</b> may be broken out into separate components. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows a removable portable hard disk memory <b>600</b>′ with removable cartridges <b>614</b>.) Finally, the home system <b>258</b> may include an attached keyboard <b>267</b> or a wireless keyboard <b>268</b>. Both the attached keyboard <b>267</b> and the wireless keyboard <b>268</b> may be used to communicate with the viewer <b>266</b> (not shown) or the library unit <b>262</b>. The wireless keyboard <b>268</b> may communicate using radio frequency (RF) signaling, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In an alternate arrangement, all functions of the home system <b>258</b> may be incorporated into a single unit. The functions of the library <b>262</b>, for example, may be carried out by a card or chipset in the viewer <b>266</b>. All the communications devices needed to couple the home system <b>258</b> to various telecommunications networks may also be incorporated into the viewer. All interfaces between the home system <b>258</b> and the subscriber may be included with the viewer <b>266</b>. In this embodiment, the viewer <b>266</b> may include a communication device for receiving inputs from a separate keyboard. The viewer <b>266</b> may also include a built-in video camera <b>608</b>″ that may be used to transmit images of the subscriber. Using the transceiver <b>608</b>, the camera <b>608</b>″ and the speaker/microphone <b>608</b>′, the subscriber may use the viewer <b>266</b> for video conferencing, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Therefore, the home system <b>258</b> may have as many as five separate components, which communicate with each other. The two, three, four or five separate components which make up the home subsystem can communicate with each other in a variety of ways, including hardwired connection <b>615</b>, RF transceiver <b>604</b> and other wireless methods.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">RF communications may be used in the home, allowing separate components to be located throughout the home without restriction. The data communicated between the units may be secure data using security techniques presented in Section VII. In addition, the library <b>262</b> may provide power to the viewer <b>266</b> through the hard wire communication link <b>615</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">To receive and strip data from a video signal at the consumer's home, a device such as a cable interface device or cable connector <b>212</b> is used. The cable connector device includes a tuner <b>613</b>, while the cable interface device makes use of existing tuning equipment in the home. In either configuration, data is stripped from the video signal and stored at the subscribers location in the library <b>262</b>. The phone connector <b>270</b>, optional connector <b>611</b>, and modular connector <b>701</b> initiate communications and transmit ordering and billing information to the operations center <b>250</b> or billing and collection system <b>278</b>. A digital connector <b>619</b> is provided to communicate digital information with the set top <b>601</b>. The library <b>262</b> is the intelligent component of the home subsystem, incorporating the hardware and software necessary to store the text data, generate menus and effect the purchase transactions. In addition to an RF transceiver <b>604</b>, the home library <b>262</b> also includes the necessary jacks and connections to allow the system to be connected to the viewer <b>266</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the library <b>262</b> communicates the text data to the viewer <b>266</b> in a secure format, which requires a key <b>605</b> for decryption. The text may be decrypted page by page just before viewing. Alternative security embodiments for library <b>262</b> to viewer <b>266</b> communications are presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">a. The Video Connector</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the flow of the processes performed by the video connector <b>212</b>. The video connector <b>212</b> receives the video signal <b>608</b>, tunes to the channel containing the text data <b>612</b>, strips the text data from the video signal <b>616</b>, and communicates the text data stream to logic components in the library <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The connection to the video distribution system may be a cable connector to a cable television delivery system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>. The cable connector includes a data stripper circuit <b>617</b>, which accepts video input from either a set top converter, TV or VCR <b>601</b>, or an optional tuner block <b>613</b> that receives the CATV signal through the cable connector <b>212</b>′. The data stripper circuit <b>617</b> strips data out of the video, and outputs a digital bit stream to the digital logic portion <b>609</b> of the library unit <b>262</b>. The data is embedded in the video signal either in the vertical blanking interval or the active video portion in an encrypted and compressed format. The data stripper circuit <b>617</b> can be placed inside the set top converter box <b>601</b>, TV, or in the library <b>262</b>. The data stripper circuit <b>617</b> outputs the digital bit stream to be used by the library digital logic <b>609</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The video connector <b>212</b> may also contain a channel tuner module <b>613</b> that can tune to the video channel and provide access to the video that contains the data to be stripped. Using the optional tuner module <b>613</b>, a set top converter, VCR, or TV tuner is not needed in the home system <b>258</b>. The optional tuner module <b>613</b> would instead receive the CATV signal directly through the cable connector <b>212</b>. Additional connector options, which allow for the receipt of text files using alternative delivery methods, are presented in the referenced related applications. This ubiquitous access is provided using the modular connector <b>700</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">b. Library</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">An embodiment of the library <b>262</b> for a two unit home subsystem is shown in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The embodiment shown includes the following optional parts: the video connector <b>212</b>, phone connector <b>270</b>, RF transceiver <b>604</b>, and battery pack <b>624</b> in addition to a removal portable memory <b>600</b>′, microprocessor <b>628</b>, instruction memory unit <b>632</b>, digital logic <b>636</b>, and power unit <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The library <b>262</b> contains a digital logic section <b>609</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) which includes the microprocessor <b>628</b>, the digital logic <b>636</b> and the instruction memory unit <b>632</b>. The microprocessor <b>628</b> may be a secure microprocessor such as the Mot SC21 device sold by Motorola. The digital logic section <b>609</b> will receive the serial digital bit stream from the data stripper circuit <b>617</b> and process the data. Error correction and security processing will also be performed by the digital logic section <b>609</b> and the data will be checked for proper address. If the address of the data is correct and the library <b>262</b> is authorized to receive the data, the data will be decrypted and transferred to the memory storage unit <b>600</b>, <b>600</b>′. Authorization to receive the data may be provided by the cable headend or another distribution point. An authorization code may be sent in the serial digital bit stream. The digital logic section <b>609</b> will send appropriate text and graphical data to the memory storage unit <b>600</b>, <b>600</b>′. It may decrypt then re-encrypt the data or transfer this data in a compressed and encrypted format and the data remains stored in a compressed and encrypted format.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">i. Memory Storage Unit</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The memory storage unit of the library may be a removable portable memory unit <b>600</b>′ (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b>). A variety of options are available for memory storage: a hard disk drive, such as an 80 megabyte, a 200 megabyte, a hard disk with removable platters, and CD ROM. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, a hard disk drive unit <b>600</b>′, which contains removable platters, may also be used. This would provide virtually unlimited library storage capacity. Data may be stored in the memory storage unit in a compressed and encrypted format. As is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the data may also contain a key or unique ID number that matches the ID or key of the viewer <b>266</b>. This matching of a unique key or ID number prevents unauthorized transfer of text data from the memory storage unit to an unauthorized viewer. Alternative embodiments to store text data in encrypted format are addressed in Section VII. Small memory devices such as smart cards, electronic memory cards or PCMCIA cards (personal computer memory card industry association) may also be used to store the data.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">ii. Power Circuitry</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>b </i>and <b>8</b>, the library <b>262</b> will accept power from AC wall power <b>610</b>, DC power <b>640</b>, or optional battery power <b>624</b>. The power circuitry <b>610</b>, <b>640</b> may provide all the voltage necessary from either the battery <b>624</b> or AC unit for the various circuitry in the library. The power circuitry <b>610</b>, <b>640</b> may also provide power to the viewer through a single data cable when connected to the viewer. The power circuitry <b>610</b>, <b>640</b> will recharge the battery using AC power when in operation. With the optional battery unit <b>624</b> installed, the library <b>262</b> becomes a portable unit and can still provide power to the viewer <b>266</b>. In order to extend battery life, power conservation measures may be utilized, such as shutting down the memory system when not in use. When the viewer unit <b>266</b> is being utilized and the library circuitry is not being utilized, virtually all power may be shut down to the library <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">iii. Connection to the Public Telephone System</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In an embodiment, the connection to the telephone system may be provided by a connector device <b>611</b>, which consists of a modem. Various available modems may be used to perform this function. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, cellular phone or PCN phone connections <b>611</b>′ may also be provided. When the home system <b>258</b> is first initialized, the modem may be used to transfer the name and credit card information of the consumer to the billing and collection system <b>278</b>. The telephone connection <b>270</b> may be utilized each time an electronic book is purchased by a consumer to complete and record the transaction. The telephone connection <b>270</b> may also be used to receive the text data from the operations center <b>250</b>, by-passing the video distribution system <b>208</b>. The phone connection <b>270</b> may be a separate unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>. However, alternate means exist to connect the home system <b>258</b> to the billing and collection system <b>278</b> or the operations center <b>250</b>. The modular connector <b>701</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>b </i>and <b>8</b>) provides access to each communication network to provide a path from the home system <b>258</b> to the billing and collection system <b>278</b> or the operations center <b>250</b>. These alternatives are presented in detail in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">iv. Library Processing</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows for one embodiment, an example of processing performed by the digital logic section <b>609</b> of the library <b>262</b> on the data stream <b>651</b> received from the video connector <b>212</b> or stripper circuit <b>617</b>. In step S<b>650</b>, digital logic section <b>609</b> checks the data stream <b>651</b> for error correction. If an error is detected, in step S<b>654</b> digital logic section <b>609</b> de-interleaves the data and in step S<b>658</b> runs a FEC (Forward Error Correcting) algorithm. In steps S<b>650</b>, S<b>654</b> and S<b>658</b>, the digital logic section <b>609</b> performs the error correction needed on the data stream. If no error correction is necessary the digital logic section <b>609</b> proceeds to step S<b>662</b> and checks data packets individually for packet address.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">If the address is a unique address, the process moves to step S<b>666</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> checks whether the address of the packet matches the library box ID number. The library box ID number is a unique number associated with the library <b>262</b>. The library box ID is used to ensure security of the data. The process then moves to Step S<b>668</b>, and the digital logic section <b>609</b> performs the decryption processing, as presented in Section VI. The process then moves to step S<b>670</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> determines whether an electronic file has already been opened into which the data packet can be saved. If no data file has been opened, the digital logic section <b>609</b> opens a new data file for that packet. If an electronic file has been opened, the process moves to step S<b>678</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> saves the packet in the electronic file on disk. The process moves to step <b>682</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> checks to see if this is the last packet for a particular book for a particular textual data block being received. If it is the last packet of information, the process moves to step <b>686</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> closes the electronic file and updates the directory of available electronic files. Following either step S<b>682</b> or S<b>686</b>, the process returns to receive another data packet from the data stream received from the data stripper block.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">If the packet address is checked and the address is determined to be a broadcast address, the process moves to step S<b>690</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> determines the type of message that is being sent. The message may be an index of book titles, menu (and menu graphics) information, announcements, special offerings, discounts, promotions, and previews, for example. The process then moves to step S<b>694</b> and the digital logic section <b>609</b> stores the message in an appropriate electronic message file. The process then returns to step S<b>650</b> to receive another data packet and perform another error check.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Using the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the library <b>262</b> is able to receive, store and update directories related to the textual data and graphical data (that can be used to depict pictures in a given book or to generate menus). Variations of the processes are possible depending on the format of the data and operating system of the library <b>262</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example of the processing of information requests from the viewer <b>266</b> at the library <b>262</b>. Information requests from the viewer <b>266</b> are received either through the cable connecting the viewer <b>266</b> to the library <b>262</b> or through wireless transmissions such as RF. It is possible in some embodiments for subscribers' requests to come from a set top converter box <b>602</b> (see Section V).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Information requests received from the viewer <b>266</b> generally fall into three categories: (1) directory data of books stored in the library <b>262</b>, (2) index of all available books on the system, and (3) requests for a specific book (step S<b>700</b>). In step S<b>704</b>, the digital logic section <b>609</b> answers a request from the viewer <b>266</b> for a directory of data showing the books stored at the viewer <b>266</b>. The directory of data is sent to the viewer <b>266</b> so that it may be displayed to the subscriber. In step S<b>708</b>, the digital logic section <b>609</b> handles requests from the viewer <b>266</b> for an index of all available books on the system. The library <b>262</b> will obtain an index of all the available books on the system and transmit that index, in step S<b>712</b>, with menu information to the viewer <b>266</b>. In step S<b>716</b>, the digital logic section <b>609</b> replies to a request from the viewer <b>266</b> for a specific book. In step S<b>720</b>, the digital logic section <b>609</b> opens an electronic file for the specific book requested by the viewer <b>266</b> and transmits the record or transmits the information on a packet-by-packet basis to the viewer <b>266</b>. This process of transmitting the specific book, record, or packets to the viewer <b>266</b> continues until the last record or packet has been sent in step S<b>724</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition to the processes shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in handling a request for a specific book, the library <b>262</b> also orders and receives specific books from the operations center <b>250</b> using the process as described in step S<b>716</b>. Following a request for a specific book which is not stored at the library <b>262</b>, the library <b>262</b> will proceed to determine the next available time the book will be on the video distribution system <b>208</b> or an alternative delivery system and ensure reception and storage of that book (process not shown). In performing this process the library <b>262</b> will transmit to the viewer information on when it will obtain the text data for the book so that the subscriber may view the book. In addition to timing information, price and other ordering information may also be passed by the library <b>262</b> to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">C. The Viewer</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram of a viewer <b>266</b> showing its internal components.

In one embodiment, the secure microprocessor <b>621</b> compares the ID number of the viewer <b>266</b> with the incoming data stream and only stores the text data if the ID number of the viewer <b>266</b> matches that within the incoming data stream. The viewer <b>266</b> may be configured to not output text data or other data and that the data is decompressed and decrypted only at the moment of viewing and only for the current page being viewed. These measures provide additional security against unauthorized access to data. Additional embodiments are presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">(3) A video graphics controller <b>607</b>′ that is capable of assisting and displaying VGA quality text and graphic images is included in the viewer <b>266</b>. The graphics controller <b>607</b>′ is controlled by the digital circuitry described above. Text may be displayed in multiple font sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">(4) The viewer <b>266</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has touch panel controls <b>740</b>. These unique and novel controls <b>740</b> allow the consumer to select stored electronic books and electronic books from catalogues, move a cursor, and turn pages in an electronic book. Typically, the controls <b>740</b> include forward and reverse page buttons <b>742</b>, <b>741</b>, a ball <b>743</b> for cursor movement, one or more selection buttons <b>745</b>, a current book button <b>747</b> and a bookmark button <b>749</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The controls <b>740</b> should be easy to use and conveniently located. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>, the controls for the viewer <b>266</b> may be located below the screen <b>602</b> at the bottom portion of the viewer <b>266</b>. The next page turn button <b>742</b> is the most used button <b>740</b> and is located towards the right edge of the page. The subscriber is likely to use right hand thumb movements to work the controls particularly the page turn buttons <b>741</b>, <b>742</b>. Therefore, the buttons may be arranged in such a manner that the buttons are easily controlled by a subscriber's right thumb. Generally, this can be accommodated either on the lower portion of the viewer <b>266</b> (as shown) or along the right hand margin of the viewer <b>266</b> (not shown). The current book button <b>747</b> and bookmark button <b>749</b> are usually the least used of the controls <b>740</b>. Therefore, in the example shown, those buttons <b>747</b>, <b>749</b> are located on the inside portion towards the binder of the viewer <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Locating the ball <b>743</b> or other cursor movement device (such as four pointer arrows not shown) in the bottom center of the viewer <b>266</b> is both easier for the subscriber to use and easier in manufacturing the viewer <b>266</b>. The selection buttons for the cursor <b>745</b> may be located below the middle diameter of the cursor ball <b>743</b> on the right and left sides of the ball as shown. If pointer arrows are used for cursor movement, a selection button <b>745</b> may be located in the center of the four arrow buttons (not shown). Again, the most used controls <b>740</b> should be located where a subscriber's right hand thumb would normally rest.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">(5) Book memory <b>728</b> for at least one electronic book or more of text is included in the viewer <b>266</b>. The memory <b>728</b> stores text and any graphics, which represent pictures in a book. The memory <b>728</b> can also store menu graphics data. Two different memory <b>728</b> devices may be used in the viewer <b>266</b>, one for the instructions for the microprocessor <b>621</b> in the digital circuitry and a second type of memory may be used for the book memory <b>728</b> (and graphics). Various memory devices available on the market may be used such as, ROM, RAM or a small hard disk. Since an electronic book requires approximately 0.6 megabytes of storage, a small hard disk providing approximately 60 MBytes of storage provides memory to store approximately 100 electronic books.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Text for electronic books may be displayed in various font sizes. To accommodate various fonts for display, a variety of fonts are stored in instruction <b>732</b> or book memory <b>728</b>. Thus larger or smaller fonts may be recalled from memory <b>621</b>, <b>728</b> to create displays desired by the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">(6) Power supply circuitry <b>736</b> in the viewer <b>266</b> will accept power from either an AC power source or from an optional battery <b>603</b>′, or the library <b>262</b>. The power supply circuitry <b>736</b> provides the necessary voltages to accommodate the various systems within the viewer <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">(7) An optional battery <b>603</b>′ is provided in one embodiment. The battery <b>603</b>′ is automatically recharged when AC power is available.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0136">(10) The optional wired (attached) keyboard <b>267</b> and wireless (e.g., RF) keyboard <b>268</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>) may be used with the viewer <b>266</b> to provide communications between the subscriber and the viewer <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">(11) The optional speaker and microphone <b>608</b>′ allow the viewer <b>266</b> to provide audio signals to the subscriber, and allow the subscriber to provide an audio input. The speaker and microphone <b>608</b>′ may be used in conjunction with the cellular transceiver <b>608</b> or other telecommunications equipment to provide for reception and transmission of telephony and data.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">(12) The optional alternative communication interface devices allow the viewer <b>266</b> to make use of a variety of communication paths, including wireless Internet paths.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The viewer <b>266</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has parts available for providing connections to: a library <b>744</b>, electronic card memory <b>748</b>, CD ROM units <b>752</b>, and a portable memory unit <b>756</b> (such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>as <b>600</b>′). Various electronic memory cards such as PCMCIA can be used with the viewer <b>266</b> to supply and store electronic books.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Security, low power consumption and excellent display technology are desired features of the viewer <b>266</b> design. The viewer <b>266</b> should be lightweight and portable. The viewer <b>266</b> contains a software operating system that allows electronic books to be stored, read and erased and includes the capability to order electronic books and retain them in memory <b>728</b> for a predefined period of time determined by the system operator. The software can be configured to allow the electronic book to be read during a period of time (i.e., two weeks) and then automatically erased, read once and erased, or held in memory permanently. In one embodiment, each viewer <b>266</b> may have a unique key <b>605</b>. All of the data storage may be encrypted with the key <b>605</b> for an individual viewer <b>266</b> to prevent more than one viewer <b>266</b> accessing the text file or electronic book file. Alternative security embodiments are presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow diagram of some of the processes executed by the microprocessor <b>621</b> in the viewer <b>266</b>. The viewer <b>266</b> may receive inputs from the subscriber through touch panel controls <b>740</b>. In step S<b>800</b>, the subscriber's information requests are then processed by the microprocessor <b>621</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In step S<b>804</b>, if the subscriber requests a menu of available electronic books, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will select an electronic book menu. In step S<b>808</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will open the electronic files that list the electronic books which are available (related to the category of topic of the menu) and display the menu with the names of the available electronic books.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">If the subscriber selects a particular book to read, then in step S<b>812</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will process the selection and determine the electronic file that contains the specific electronic book. In step S<b>816</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will open the file for that specific electronic book and normally access the first page. (If a pointer has already been set in that books electronic file, the process may default to that page.) In step S<b>820</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will then determine which page needs to be displayed. That is, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will determine whether a next page, previous page or a bookmarked page needs to be displayed. If the pointer for the electronic file is not in the correct location then in step S<b>828</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will move the pointer and obtain the previous page of data from the stored file. Otherwise, in step S<b>824</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will normally obtain the next page of text from the stored electronic file. In step S<b>832</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> decrypts the text data using one of the embodiments presented in Section VII, decompresses the text data and sends the data to the video display. The video display will generally have a video display memory associated with it. In step S<b>832</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> will send the data directly to that video display memory. The circuitry for the display then completes the process of displaying the page of text.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">If the subscriber, through the controls <b>740</b>, requests (from step S<b>800</b>) that the power be turned off, then in step S<b>836</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> initiates power off. In step S<b>840</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> saves the pointer in memory to the page number in the book that the viewer <b>266</b> is currently reading. In step S<b>844</b>, the microprocessor <b>621</b> closes all the electronic files and signals the power circuitry to shut down the power to the various circuits in the viewer <b>266</b>. With these examples of basic processes the viewer <b>266</b> is able to display book selections and display text from those electronic books.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">d. Menu System</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the electronic book system <b>200</b> may have a menu system <b>851</b> for selecting features and books from the electronic book system <b>200</b>. The operating software and memory required for the menu system <b>851</b> may be located at the viewer <b>266</b> (e.g., the instruction memory <b>732</b> and/or book memory <b>728</b>). However, it can also be located at the library <b>262</b> (e.g., the instruction memory <b>632</b>) or the library <b>262</b> and the viewer <b>266</b> can share the software and memory needed to operate the menu system <b>851</b>. Since the menus are usually displayed on the viewer, and since the viewer <b>266</b> may be capable of operating in the absence of the library <b>262</b>, the basic software and memory to create the menus is more conveniently located at the viewer <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The menu system <b>851</b> allows sequencing between menus and provides menu graphics for graphical displays such as on the LCD display <b>602</b> of the viewer <b>266</b>. In an electronic book system that uses a set top converter these menus may also be displayed on a television screen. In an electronic book system that uses a computer, these menus may also be displayed on the computer monitor. In an embodiment, the menus provide just basic text information from which the subscriber makes choices. In other embodiments, the menus provide visual displays with graphics and icons to assist the subscriber and allow for subscriber interaction and real-time ordering of electronic books or other content available to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts the menu system <b>851</b> with sequencing. The primary menus in the menu system <b>851</b> are an introductory menu <b>850</b>, a main menu <b>854</b> and various submenus <b>858</b>. In the embodiment shown, there are three levels of submenus <b>858</b>. In certain instances one or two submenus <b>858</b> is sufficient to easily direct the subscriber to the selection or information requested. However, there are features in which three or more submenus <b>858</b> make the user interface more friendly for the subscriber. Each level of submenus <b>858</b> may consist of multiple possible menus for display. The particular menu displayed depends on the selection by the subscriber on the previous shown menu. An example of this tree sequence of one to many menus are the help submenus <b>887</b>, <b>888</b>. Depending upon the specific help requested, a different level two help menu is displayed to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">An example of an introductory menu <b>850</b> is shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>. Generally the introductory menu <b>850</b> introduces the viewer <b>266</b> to the system and provides initial guidance, announcements and instruction. The introductory menu <b>850</b> is followed by a main menu <b>854</b>, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>. The main menu provides the viewer <b>266</b> with the basic selection or features available in the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b </i>is an example of a main menu <b>854</b> offering many additional features and submenus <b>858</b> to the subscriber. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b </i>shows that the viewer <b>266</b> is able to choose by a point and click method, many options including: (1) free previews, (2) books you can order, (3) books in your library, (4) your current book, (5) help, (6) on-line services and (6) other system features. Following a selection on the main menu <b>854</b>, a corresponding submenu <b>858</b> is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows fourteen available primary or first level submenus. They are (1) account set up <b>862</b>, (2) free previews <b>866</b>, (3) book suggestion entries <b>855</b>, (4) books in your library <b>872</b>, (5) books you can order <b>878</b>, (6) your current book <b>884</b>, (7) help <b>887</b>, (8) available features <b>890</b>, (9) messages <b>893</b>, (10) account information <b>896</b>, (11) outgoing message submenu <b>898</b>, (12) show links submenu <b>970</b>, (13) create links submenu <b>980</b>, and (14) show interactive files submenu <b>990</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>c </i>is an example of a first level submenu for books in your library <b>872</b>. This “Book In Your Library” example submenu <b>872</b> shows six available books by title and author and provides the subscriber with the ability to check a different shelf of books <b>874</b> or return to the main menu <b>854</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>d </i>and <b>14</b><i>e </i>show example submenus <b>858</b> for books that may be ordered using the “Books You Can Order” submenu <b>878</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>f </i>is an example of a confirmation menu which confirms a subscribers order. In this particular example, the subscriber is required to enter a PIN number to complete the subscriber's order. Any alpha-numeric or similar password may be used to ensure the subscriber is an authorized subscriber. In one embodiment, the subscriber confirms an order with a PIN or password and then receives a final confirmation screen. The final confirmation screen is primarily text and may state:

<p id="p-0153" num="0157">Examples of the “Account Set Up Menu” 862 and further submenus <b>858</b> related to account set up (which provide instructions and account input <b>864</b>) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>g </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>h</i>. These submenus <b>858</b> allow initialization of an account at the operations center <b>250</b> and orders to be charged to credit cards. The submenus <b>858</b> include the ability to enter data related to your desired PIN number or password, credit cards, phone numbers, etc. In one embodiment, the account set up is performed using the telephone system. A confirmation menu verifies that the account has been properly set up with the desired PIN or password and credit card. However, additional set-up methods are presented in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0158">Free previews for books <b>866</b> are also provided by submenus (<b>868</b>, <b>870</b>). Examples of the free preview menus are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>i </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>j</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>i </i>shows a menu depicting various books for which previews are available for viewing. Following a book selection, a screen submenu showing an excerpt of the selected book cover's description is provided along with an excerpt from a critic's review of the selected book. In one embodiment, this preview screen for a particular book also allows the subscriber to select a submenu, which provides information about the author. The book preview submenu may also include a still video picture or graphics portraying a book cover or a scene from the book. An example of such a still video picture or graphics is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>j</i>, which depicts a preview screen <b>870</b> about the author. The author's preview screen <b>870</b> shows a picture of the author, provides a short biography, and may allow the subscriber to order the author's books. The price for ordering the authors various books may also be shown on the menu.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0159">In addition to free previews, in other embodiments, the electronic book system <b>200</b> provides the subscriber with a book suggestion feature (see <b>855</b>). This is accomplished using the menu system <b>851</b> and the processor with associated memory located at the viewer <b>266</b>, library <b>262</b> or at the distribution point (<b>1020</b> or <b>250</b>). When necessary, information for the book suggestion feature is sent in the text data of the signal to the home system <b>258</b>. With this feature, books or authors are suggested to a subscriber based upon historical data of the subscriber's previous orders, demographics or mood of the subscriber, other indicators, and/or by text word searches.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0160">In one book suggestion embodiment, text word searches of preview information (such as book cover descriptions, critics reviews and biographies about the author) and/or text of books or other titles are performed by the library <b>262</b> using databases stored in the library memory <b>600</b>. Personalized book or author suggestions are made to the subscriber by obtaining information from the subscriber indicative of general subscriber interests. Subscriber entries may be solicited from the subscriber using the book suggestion entry submenu <b>855</b>. The system uses these subscriber entries either directly or indirectly to search for books or authors to suggest to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0161">Generally, the electronic book suggestion methods may be categorized into two categories, either responsive methods (which respond to a series of subscriber menu entries), or intelligent methods (which analyze data to suggest a book). Using a responsive or intelligent method, the system <b>200</b> determines a list of suggested titles or authors and creates a second or third level submenu <b>856</b>, <b>857</b> to suggest the titles for subscriber selection.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0162">Responsive methods of suggesting titles include, for example, the use of mood questions, searching for authors, and keyword searching. Using the instruction memory <b>732</b> and menu generation hardware (e.g., <b>607</b>) of the viewer <b>266</b>, a series of mood questions can be presented on menus to determine a subscribers interest at a particular time. For this methodology, the home system's <b>250</b> processor <b>404</b> and instruction memory <b>416</b> assign each title mood indicators (and sub-indicators) from a group such as light, serious, violent, short, long, dull, exciting, complex, easy-read, young theme, old theme, adventure, romance, drama, fiction, science-fiction, etc. These indicators are sent to the home system <b>258</b> with the text data and are stored in library memory <b>600</b>. Based upon the subscriber entries, the processor associates a set of indicators with the subscriber's request and a set of books with matching indicators are located for suggesting to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0163">Responsive searches for authors or keywords (a search word provided by the subscriber) are generally performed by the library processor <b>628</b> and instruction memory <b>632</b> on data stored in the library memory <b>600</b>. For example, a keyword given by the subscriber may be searched for a match in library memory <b>600</b> storing the book reviews, critics and previews databases. Thus, if a subscriber provided an entry of the word “submarine” on an appropriate submenu, the title “Hunt For Red October” may be located by the microprocessor <b>628</b> using instruction from a routine in instruction memory <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0164">Intelligent methods of suggesting programs include analyzing personal profile data on the subscriber and/or historical data about the subscriber such as past books ordered by the subscriber (or buy data). This method may be performed at the distribution point or operations center <b>250</b> by the on-site processor <b>404</b> using subscriber databases stored in memory <b>428</b>. The home system <b>258</b> receives the text data including program suggestion information from the distribution point or operations center <b>250</b> and generates the program suggestion submenus <b>855</b>, <b>856</b>, <b>857</b> using the same text data receiving <b>212</b> and viewer menu generation hardware (e.g., <b>607</b>, <b>621</b>) described above. Software routines and algorithms stored in instruction memories (e.g., <b>632</b>, <b>732</b>) are used to analyze historical data and book ordered data to determine a line of books to suggest to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0165">The algorithms for this powerful feature of suggesting books or authors to subscribers is disclosed in great detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,785, entitled TERMINAL FOR SUGGESTING PROGRAMS OFFERED ON A TELEVISION PROGRAM DELIVERY SYSTEM, filed Dec. 2, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0166">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, submenus <b>858</b> are shown on the “Books In Your Library” submenu <b>872</b> and may be broken into shelf numbers with submenus for each shelf <b>874</b>, The submenus <b>858</b> for the “Books You Can Order” submenu <b>878</b> is similarly broken out into submenus by shelves <b>880</b>, <b>882</b>. These shelves may each be a category or genre of books. Books may be grouped into categories such as best sellers, novels, fiction, romance, etc. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0167">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the submenu <b>858</b> for “Your Current Book” <b>884</b> allows a subscriber to select a current book <b>884</b> and then determine what page to view. This selection is confirmed with a level two submenu <b>885</b>. The help submenu <b>887</b> provides the subscriber with additional help screens <b>888</b>. The submenus <b>858</b> for available features <b>890</b> may be broken out into a sequence of separate submenus for each feature <b>891</b>, <b>892</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, messages can also be sent with the electronic book selection and delivery system <b>200</b>. A level one message screen provides the subscriber with the ability to select from various messages the subscriber has pending <b>893</b>.

The billing and collection system <b>278</b> may also connect with subscribers through two-way cable connections, cellular, or other communication means. These additional methods are detailed in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0171">The billing and collection system <b>278</b> communicates with the operations center to track changes in available books and to provide statistical data to the operations center <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">IV. Public Library, School, and Bookstore System</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0172">The electronic book system can be modified to be used at public libraries, schools, bookstores, newsstands, or stand-alone kiosks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows one possible arrangement of components for the distribution location. The main unit is the file server <b>900</b>. The file server <b>900</b> is a large electronic memory unit that can store thousands of books, newspapers, or periodicals. Various electronic storage means may be used in the file servers, such as hard disks, read-write CD ROMs and read-only CD ROMs.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0173">The system comprises five components; the file server <b>900</b>, a converter or video connector <b>904</b> or connector capable of interfacing to one of the alternative delivery systems presented in the referenced related applications, a controller <b>908</b>, a viewer <b>912</b>, and a catalog printer <b>916</b>. The software for controlling the system is primarily located in the controller <b>908</b>. The converter or video connector <b>904</b> is similar to those described above. In this configuration the controller unit <b>908</b> monitors the data being transferred to the file server <b>900</b> by the converter <b>904</b>. The controller <b>908</b> may be provided with a viewing screen and several control buttons. When it is necessary to have a larger screen to perform more sophisticated controlling of the system a viewer <b>266</b> may be connected to the controller <b>908</b> and the viewer screen and controls <b>740</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0174">For security reasons, the controller <b>908</b> is only able to download books to public viewers <b>912</b> which are authorized to receive books from the particular file server <b>900</b>. Also for security reasons it is not desirable that the public viewer <b>912</b> have access to more than one file server <b>900</b>. In this way, security can be maintained over the text data for books. The public viewer <b>912</b> may be limited to receiving one or two books at a time from the controller <b>908</b>. When the user of the public viewer <b>912</b> needs a new or additional book, the user returns the viewer <b>912</b> to the school or public library where the user receives a new book from the controller <b>908</b>. Additional security mechanisms associated with this kiosk-based distribution of electronic books are presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0175">In order to track the books that are available on the file server <b>900</b>, the titles of the available books may be printed on a catalog printer <b>916</b>. The catalog printer <b>916</b> is connected to the library controller <b>908</b> and the titles of the books are downloaded to the catalog printer <b>916</b>. For security reasons, the coded text for any of the electronic books may not be authorized for printing using the controller <b>908</b> and catalog printer <b>916</b>. In order to maintain security over the data, none of the electronic book data may be allowed to be downloaded to the printer <b>916</b>. Once a complete printout of available book titles, magazines, or other textual material is complete, a hard copy of the catalog <b>920</b> can be maintained at the file server <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0176">The system shown may also be used at bookstores. The bookstores can rent the public viewer <b>912</b> to customers with the text for one or two books loaded onto the public viewer <b>912</b>. The public viewer <b>912</b> may be provided with an automatic timeout sequence. The timeout sequence would erase the textual data for the books after a certain period of time, for example, two weeks. It is expected that after a period of time (perhaps within two weeks) the renter would return the public viewer <b>912</b> to the bookstore and receive additional books for viewing. Using this arrangement, it is also possible for the bookstore to (permanently) sell a viewer <b>912</b> to a regular customer. The customer then returns to the bookstore from time to time to receive textual data for a book which the customer can then store permanently on the customer's own viewer <b>912</b>. Various other configurations are possible for bookstores, schools and public libraries using the file server <b>900</b> and public viewer <b>912</b> can be described.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">V. Use of a Set Top Converter</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0177">Existing set top converter boxes such as those made by Scientific Atlanta or General Instruments are presently unequipped to handle the book selection system of the present invention. Although set top converters may be built which include the library functions, hardware modifications are necessary in order to use the book selection system with existing set top converter technology.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are examples of hardware modifications or upgrades. A port is used to attach hardware upgrades described below to a set top terminal. Two upgrades are possible to set top converters <b>601</b> to assist in receiving and selecting electronic books, a menu generation card upgrade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>) and an information download unit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b</i>). Each of these upgrades may be connected to the set top terminal unit through an upgrade port. A four wire cable, ribbon cable, FireWire (IEEE 1394B) interface connector, USB connector, or the like may be used to connect the upgrade to the set top converter <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0179">A card addition <b>950</b> to a set top converter <b>601</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>. The card <b>950</b> shown provides the additional functionality needed to utilize the book selection system with existing set top converter <b>601</b> technology. The card <b>950</b> may be configured to slip inside the frame of a set top terminal and become part of the set top terminal, an advanced set top terminal. The primary functions the card <b>950</b> adds to the set top converter <b>601</b> are the interpreting of data signals, generating of menus, sequencing of menus, and, ultimately, the ability of the subscriber to select a book using either the television or a viewer <b>266</b>. The card <b>950</b> also provides a method for a remote location, such as the cable headend, to receive information on books ordered. The books ordered information and control commands may be passed from the cable headend to the card <b>950</b> using telephone lines or alternative ordering methods as presented in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0180">The primary components of the card <b>950</b> are a PC chip CPU <b>952</b>, a VGA graphic controller <b>954</b>, a video combiner <b>956</b>, logic circuitry <b>958</b>, NTSC encoder <b>960</b>, a receiver <b>962</b>, demodulator (not shown), and a connector <b>611</b>′, which consists of a dialer. The card <b>950</b> operates by receiving the data text signal from the cable headend through the coaxial cable. The logic circuitry <b>958</b> of the card <b>950</b> receives data <b>964</b>, infrared commands <b>966</b>, and synchronization signals (not shown) from the set top converter <b>601</b>. Menu selections made by the viewer <b>266</b> on the remote control are received by the set top converter's <b>601</b> IR equipment and passed through to the card <b>950</b>. The card <b>950</b> interprets the IR signal and determines the book (or menu) the subscriber has selected. The card <b>950</b> modifies the IR command to send the information to the set top converter <b>601</b>. The modified IR command contains the channel information needed by the set top converter <b>601</b>. Using the phone line <b>968</b> and dialer <b>611</b>′, the card <b>950</b> is able to transmit electronic books ordered information to the cable headend. It is also possible to receive the electronic books over the telephone lines and other telecommunications networks, including wireless networks, and by-pass the video distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0181">These commands are passed through the interface linking the set top terminal's microprocessor with the microprocessor of the hardware upgrades. In this way, subscriber inputs, entered through the set top terminal keypad or remote control, can be transferred to any of the hardware upgrades for processing and responses generated therein can then be sent back to the set top terminal for display. In one embodiment the IR commands <b>966</b> are transferred from set top terminal <b>601</b> to hardware upgrade.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0182">Hardware upgrades may include a microprocessor, interactive software, processing circuitry, bubble memory, and a long-term memory device. In addition to these basic components, the hardware upgrade may make use of an additional telephone modem or CD-ROM device.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0183">An information download hardware upgrade <b>1001</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b </i>allows the subscriber to download large volumes of information from the operations center <b>250</b> or cable headend using a set top terminal <b>610</b>. The hardware upgrade <b>1001</b> will enable subscribers to download data, such as electronic books and electronic magazines, to local secure storage. Primarily, the hardware upgrade <b>1001</b> is an additional local storage unit <b>1003</b> (e.g., hard disk, floppy, optical disk or magnetic cartridge and may include a microprocessor <b>1005</b>, instruction memory <b>1007</b>, and a random access memory <b>1009</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b</i>). A small portable viewer may also provided with the upgrade <b>1001</b> to enable downloaded text to be read without the use of a television.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0184">The downloadable information may be text or graphics supplied by the operations center <b>250</b> or cable headend. With the upgrade <b>1001</b>, electronic books may be downloaded and read anywhere with the viewer <b>266</b>. Using the upgrade <b>1001</b>, electronic books may be downloaded and stored in compressed form for later decompression. The electronic books may be decompressed only at the time of viewing. Important text that the public desires immediate access may made available through this system. Text such as the President's speech, a new law, or a recent abortion decision rendered by the Supreme Court may be made immediately available.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0185">In one embodiment, electronic book ordering information is stored at each set top terminal <b>610</b> until it is polled by the cable headend using a polling request message format. An example of a polling request message format consists of six fields, namely: (1) a leading flag at the beginning of the message, (2) an address field, (3) a subscriber region designation, (4) a set top terminal identifier that includes a polling command/response (or P/F) bit, (5) an information field, and (6) a trailing flag at the end of the message. A similar response frame format for information communicated by the set top terminal to the cable headend in response to the polling request may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows components of a set top terminal <b>610</b>′. The components include a data receiver <b>617</b>′ and a data transmitter <b>1011</b>. The data transmitter provides upstream data communications capability between the set top terminal <b>610</b>′ and the cable headend. Upstream data transmissions are accomplished using the polling system described and, using a data transmitter <b>1011</b>. Both receiver <b>617</b>′ and transmitter <b>1011</b> may be built into the set top terminal <b>610</b>′ itself or added through an upgrade module. Regardless of the specific hardware configuration, the set top terminal's data transmission capabilities may be accomplished using the hardware shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows RF signals, depicted as being received by a data receiver <b>617</b>′ and tuner <b>613</b> working in unison. Both of these devices are interfaced with the microprocessor <b>1013</b>, which receives inputs <b>1015</b>, from the subscriber, either through a set top terminal's keypad, a remote control unit or viewer <b>266</b>. Generally, all cable signals intended for reception on the subscriber's TV are accessed by the tuner <b>613</b> and subsequently processed by the processing circuitry <b>1017</b>. This processing circuitry <b>1017</b> typically includes additional components (not shown) for descrambling, demodulation, volume control and remodulation on a Channel 3 or 4 TV carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0187">Data targeted to individual set top terminals is received by the data receiver <b>617</b>′ according to each set top terminal's specific address or ID. In this way, each addressable set top terminal <b>610</b>′ only receives its own data. The data receiver <b>617</b>′ may receive set top terminal <b>610</b>′ specific data in the information field of the signal frame described or on a separate data carrier located at a convenient frequency in the incoming spectrum. The received data includes information regarding electronic books and menus available for selection. The subscriber may enter a series of commands <b>1015</b> using a keypad or remote control in order to choose an electronic book or menu. Upon receipt of such commands, the set top terminal's microprocessor <b>1013</b> instructs the tuner to tune to the proper frequency of the channel carrying data and subsequently instructs the processing circuitry <b>1017</b> to begin descrambling of this data.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0188">Upon selection of an electronic book, the microprocessor <b>1013</b> stores any selection information in local memory (not shown) for later data transmission back to the cable headend. The set top terminal's microprocessor <b>1013</b> coordinates all CATV signal reception and also interacts with various upstream data transmission components. Typically, the data transmitter <b>1011</b> operates in the return frequency band between 5 and 30 MHZ. In an alternative embodiment, the frequency band of 10 to 15 MHZ may be used. Regardless, however, of the frequency band used, the data transmitter <b>1011</b> sends information to the cable headend in the information field of the response frame described. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of variations and combinations of the above-described set top terminal hardware components may be used to accomplish upstream data transmissions.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">VI. Books-On-Demand System</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0189">The electronic book system <b>200</b> described may also be configured in a book-on-demand style. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a </i>shows one example of a configuration for a book-on-demand system. A book on demand system requires more powerful two-way communications between the consumer's home, bookstore, school or public library and either the operations center <b>250</b> or a distribution site <b>1020</b> such as the cable headend. In one embodiment, this type of two-way communication can be provided by the hardware shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and described above. Additional methods related to alternative communication paths are presented in the referenced related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0190">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a</i>, in a book-on-demand system, the subscriber selects the book to be download from an available menu of books (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>d </i>and <b>14</b><i>e</i>). The data for menus of available books is usually sent to the subscriber location by the distribution site <b>1020</b>. After the subscriber's menu selection, information about the subscriber selection (or request) is then communicated to either a distribution point <b>1020</b> (such as a cable headend) or the operations center <b>250</b>. Upon receipt of this request, the needed textual and graphical information for the book is spooled and sent to the subscriber. In this manner, electronic books are only sent when requested by the subscriber and are sent immediately upon demand for the electronic book (or text).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0191">In order to support such a demand system, the text delivery and distribution must be conducted on a strong nodal architecture distribution system, such as, a video-on-demand cable or telephone television system, through use of individual telephone calls on the public telephone system or cellular phone system, through the use of the Internet, or a number of other data network options.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0192">The book-on-demand system allows for a greater selection of electronic books to the subscriber and limits the amount of communicated book data that is unnecessary or unneeded. It also provides the electronic book to the subscriber in a much timelier fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0193">In addition to a stronger distribution system, a book-on-demand system requires a distribution point <b>1020</b> to have more sophisticated equipment to access and “spool out” the textual information. This can be accomplished using file server technology <b>1024</b> for storing the books and distribution technology such as ATM <b>1028</b> or telephone-type switching (not shown) to distribute the textual information. The file server <b>1024</b> and distribution technology that can be used in configuring such a book-on-demand system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, cited above.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a </i>shows an embodiment for a book-on-demand system that utilizes file server technology. In addition to books, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a </i>will support distribution of nearly any digital data. Books or textual files are received from publishers <b>282</b> and other sources through local feeds <b>1032</b>, ATM <b>1028</b>, or by satellite dish <b>1036</b>, for example. The data is then stored in memory <b>1040</b> at the file server <b>1024</b>. In one embodiment, the distribution point <b>1020</b> is a cable headend that receives requests from subscribers and delivers text to subscribers over a two-way communication system (such as a video-on-demand system (VOD) <b>1044</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0195">The library <b>262</b> can be connected to either a basic premium-type service cable system <b>1048</b>, a near video-on-demand type cable system (or pay-per-view (PPV) <b>1052</b>) or a video-on-demand cable system <b>1044</b>. In connecting with either of these three systems the library <b>262</b> may access the cable directly or may access the system through a set top terminal <b>601</b>′, <b>601</b>″, or <b>601</b>′″.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0196">Using the two-way video-on-demand system <b>1044</b>, a subscriber is able to request a specific book title and receive that text immediately following its request. To accomplish this, the distribution point <b>1020</b> transmits a list of available books through the cable delivery system to the library <b>262</b>. The library <b>262</b> displays the list of available books on a menu or similar format. As described earlier, the library <b>262</b> may use menus which list categories of available books to form its request from the distribution point <b>1020</b>. After selecting a book the library <b>262</b> then sends a request signal on the two-way communication system <b>1044</b> back to the distribution point <b>1020</b>. This request signal can be handled in two ways. The library <b>262</b> either initiates the request or the distribution point <b>1020</b> polls the various libraries on to the two-way system <b>1044</b>. Upon receiving the request for the book title, the text associated with that book title is transmitted to the library <b>262</b> using the two-way cable system <b>1044</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>b </i>is an expanded view of an operations center <b>250</b> that supports a regional or national book-on-demand system. In fact, the operations center <b>250</b> shown supports distribution of nearly any digital data. The operations center <b>250</b> supports multiple feeds to receive digital information by tape <b>1060</b>, <b>1060</b>′, ATM <b>1028</b>, or satellite <b>1036</b>. The information is processed through an input MUX <b>1064</b> and a small file server <b>1068</b> before reaching the master file server <b>1072</b>. Digital data such as books received from publishers <b>282</b> is then stored on the master file server <b>1072</b>. The digital data may be stored compressed in a standard format such as MPEG2.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0198">A system controller <b>1076</b> provides control over the regional or national book-on-demand system. Books may be packaged into groups to provide feeds to various cable headends. In addition, scheduling and marketing research are conducted at the operations center <b>250</b>. In order to handle the scheduling and market research, book buy data is received at the operations center <b>250</b> through a multiplexer <b>1082</b>. Book buy information can be provided by the operations center <b>250</b> to the billing and collection system <b>278</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0199">The operations center <b>250</b> is also equipped to insert messages or advertisements into the file server. These messages or advertisements will eventually be received by the subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0200">The master file server <b>1072</b> uses an output multiplexer <b>1080</b> and ATM <b>1028</b> as well as satellite connections to distribute digital data.

After receiving the digital book data, the cable headends store the books in a local file server <b>1024</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a</i>'s distribution point <b>1020</b> is an example of a cable headend which may receive data from the operations center <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>b </i>through an ATM hookup <b>1088</b> or satellite hookup. All communications and storage in the Book on Demand system may make use of the security mechanisms presented in Section VII.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">VII. Electronic Book Security Mechanisms</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0201">The electronic book distribution system and components may incorporate various forms of security using cryptographic mechanisms. Cryptography consists of an encryption and reversing decryption process. A basic encryption process operates on a string of digital bits, or clear text, by modifying the clear text using a series of mathematical operations with both the clear text and a second string of bits, called an encryption key, as inputs, resulting in a third string of bits, called ciphertext. A reversing process exists using a fourth string of bits, called a decryption key, that, when input into a decryption process consisting of a second series of mathematical operations, along with the ciphertext, the resulting output is the original clear text string of digital bits.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0202">Two types of techniques underlie the majority of encryption mechanisms associated with electronic book security: symmetric encryption and asymmetric public key encryption. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref><i>a</i>, symmetric encryption uses a cryptographic algorithm where the same key used by encryption process <b>5001</b> to encrypt data is also used by decryption process <b>5002</b> to decrypt data. Henceforth, for uses of symmetric key encryption, encryption of unencrypted content X <b>5003</b>, using symmetric key SK <b>5004</b> is represented as E<sub>SK</sub>[X] <b>5005</b>, whereas decryption of encrypted content E<sub>SK</sub>[X] <b>5005</b> using symmetric key SK <b>5004</b>, is represented as D<sub>SK</sub>[E<sub>SK</sub>[X]] and results in unencrypted content X <b>5003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0203">Asymmetric public key encryption is a cryptographic system using two keys, one key to encrypt content, and a different key to decrypt the same content. These key pairs and the associated cryptographic algorithms are constructed such that knowledge of one of the two keys does not reveal the other key. Additionally, in asymmetric public key encryption, content encrypted using one key cannot be decrypted using the same key. Therefore, one of the keys of the key pair, the public key, can be distributed widely, while the other key of the key pair is held closely and protected, the private key. This allows a first party, or a sender S to encrypt content using the sender's private key, pKS <b>5013</b> and encryption process E<sub>pKS </sub><b>5011</b>. The sender can then distribute the resulting encrypted content E<sub>pKS</sub>[X] <b>5014</b> to any second party, or recipient that possesses the sender's public key PKS <b>5015</b>. The recipient can then decrypt the encrypted content E<sub>pKS</sub>[X] <b>5014</b> using the sender's public key, PKS <b>5015</b> and decryption process D<sub>PKS </sub><b>5012</b>. Encryption of unencrypted content X <b>5003</b> using the private key of sender S is represented as E<sub>pKS</sub>[X], whereas decryption of the encrypted content, using the public key of the sender is represented as D<sub>PKS</sub>[E<sub>pKS</sub>[X]]. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref><i>b </i>depicts the case where content is encrypted in a private key. Alternatively, the sender could use the recipient public key PKR <b>5023</b> and encryption process E<sub>PKR </sub><b>5021</b> to encrypt the unencrypted content X <b>5003</b>. Then, only the recipient, using a recipient's private key pKR <b>5025</b>, is able to decrypt the encrypted content E<sub>PKR</sub>[X] <b>5024</b> using decryption process D<sub>pKR </sub><b>5022</b>. Encryption of the unencrypted content X <b>5003</b> using the recipient's public key PKR <b>5025</b>, is represented as E<sub>PKR</sub>[X], whereas decryption of the encrypted content E<sub>pKS</sub>[X] <b>5014</b>, using the recipient's private key <b>5025</b> is represented as D<sub>pKR</sub>[E<sub>PKR</sub>[X]]. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref><i>c </i>depicts the case where content is encrypted in a public key.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0204">A. Publisher to Operations Center Communications Security</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0205">Publishers <b>282</b> or other content providers <b>110</b> can deliver their electronic book content to the operations center <b>250</b> via a secured mechanism. In one embodiment, an asymmetric public key encryption technique is used, as described in Contemporary Cryptography, edited by Gustavus Simmons, published by IEEE Press in 1992, and hereby incorporated by reference. Public key algorithms used may include the Merkle-Hellman Knapsacks technique, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,218,582 to Hellman and Merkle, the RSA technique, as described in U.S. Pat.

Key negotiation information <b>5190</b> is exchanged between the publisher <b>282</b> and the operations center <b>250</b>. As a result of the negotiation process, a publisher's key generator algorithm <b>5191</b> generates the transaction symmetric key SKT <b>5193</b> and the operations center's key generator algorithm <b>5192</b> generates the transaction symmetric key SKT <b>5193</b>.

The operations center <b>250</b> returns a message to the publisher <b>282</b> that contains: 1) a book identifier <b>5292</b>, identifying the requested electronic book; 2) the signed authentication string <b>5293</b> that has been signed using a one-way hash function and then encrypted using the private key of the operations center <b>250</b>; and 3) operations center <b>250</b> certification information <b>5294</b> that the publisher <b>282</b> can authenticate with the certificate authority <b>4997</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0227"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> presents the remaining steps of a secure delivery process, where the publisher <b>282</b> serves as the sender <b>4998</b> and the operations center <b>250</b> serves as the recipient <b>4999</b>. First, the publisher <b>282</b> authenticates the operations center <b>250</b>, shown as authentication step <b>5309</b>. The publisher <b>282</b> then creates the requested electronic book file <b>5300</b> in file creation step <b>5310</b>, creates an unprotected metadata header <b>5301</b> containing non-secure information about the electronic book in step <b>5311</b>, and creates a protected metadata header <b>5302</b> containing secure information about the electronic book, shown in metadata header step <b>5312</b>. Secure information about the electronic book may include an electronic book identifier, an identifier of the format being used for the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>, the content decryption key <b>5306</b> and decryption algorithm to be used to decrypt the electronic book content, the number of copies of the electronic book that are allowed to be derived from the original electronic book version, distribution features supported for the electronic book, fair use features associated with the electronic book, and integrity checking information to ensure the protected metadata header <b>5302</b> is unaltered since its creation.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0228">Distribution features may include the ability to sell one or more copies of the electronic book at a cost, distribute one or more copies of the electronic book at no cost, or loan one or more copies of the electronic book. Fair use features may include the ability to use the electronic book for a defined time period, the ability to loan or print a number of copies of the entire electronic book or portions of the electronic book, and the ability to define and track the number of copies already loaned or printed. The publisher <b>282</b> may then compress the electronic book file <b>5300</b>, shown in compression step <b>5313</b>, and the publisher <b>282</b> may then perform an encryption process on the electronic book file <b>5300</b>, shown in encryption step <b>5314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0229">Alternatively, the publisher <b>282</b> may perform the encryption process on the electronic book file <b>5300</b> and then compress the encrypted electronic book file. To encrypt the electronic book, the publisher <b>282</b> may use a pre-defined or randomly generated symmetric key or the publisher <b>282</b> may use its own private key. The content decryption key <b>5306</b> may then be placed in the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>, shown in decryption key loading step <b>5315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0230">The publisher <b>282</b> then may calculate and place integrity checking information in the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>, as shown in integrity checking steps <b>5316</b> and <b>5317</b>, respectively. Integrity checking information may include the results of a one-way hashing algorithm <b>5304</b>, for example, using an algorithm as presented in Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier, performed on all or a portion of the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>. The hashing function <b>5304</b> may be performed using the content decryption key <b>5306</b> or another predefined hashing key, resulting in hashing value <b>5305</b>. The publisher <b>282</b> may then encrypt the entire protected metadata header <b>5302</b> or some portion of the protected metadata header <b>5302</b> using the public key of the operations center <b>250</b> or a pre-determined symmetric key known by both the publisher <b>282</b> and the operations center <b>250</b>, as shown in encryption step <b>5318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0231">The packaged electronic book with metadata headers may then be delivered to the operations center <b>250</b> or the operations center <b>250</b> may retrieve the packaged electronic book from the publisher <b>282</b>, as shown in delivery step <b>5319</b>. Upon receipt of the packaged electronic book, along with metadata headers <b>5301</b> and <b>5302</b>, by the operations center <b>250</b>, the operations center <b>250</b> may decrypt the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>, validate that the protected metadata header <b>5302</b> has not been altered by performing a one-way hash calculation on the protected metadata header <b>5302</b> and comparing the result to the hash value <b>5305</b> contained in the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>, and re-encrypt the protected metadata header <b>5302</b> for storage. Alternatively, the operations center <b>250</b> may store the received packaged electronic book directly without decrypting the protected metadata header <b>5302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0232">Processing and storage of the decryption and encryption keys used on the protected metadata header <b>5302</b> at the operations center <b>250</b> may be done entirely in software, entirely on a secure smart card or removable device, or some combination of the two.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0233">In still another embodiment, a publisher <b>282</b>, or third party electronic book formatter, converts the electronic book content and associated metadata into a deliverable format. The prepared electronic book file is then delivered to the operations center <b>250</b>, for example over the Internet using a secure socket layer (SSL) protected communication link. This exchange, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, may be initiated by the operations center <b>250</b>, serving as the recipient <b>4999</b>, sending a request message <b>5330</b> to the publisher <b>282</b>, serving as the sender <b>4998</b>, to deliver the requested electronic book content <b>5100</b> to the operations center <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0234">The request message <b>5330</b> may contain a login and password sequence that is used by the publisher <b>282</b> to initially validate the operations center <b>250</b>.

In response, the publisher <b>282</b> may send a certificate <b>5331</b>, which may include identifying information and the publisher's public key PKS, to the operations center <b>250</b>. The operations center <b>250</b> verifies the certificate <b>5331</b> was issued by a trusted third party certificate authority <b>4997</b>. The operations center <b>250</b> compares the information in the certificate that is received from the trusted third party certificate authority <b>4997</b>, including the publisher's identifying information and public key PKS.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0235">The operations center <b>250</b> then notifies the publisher <b>282</b> which encryption algorithms that the operations center <b>250</b> can support using a supported algorithm message <b>5332</b>.

The publisher <b>282</b> then notifies the operations center <b>250</b> which encryption algorithms the publisher <b>282</b> can support using a supported algorithms message <b>5342</b>. The operations center <b>250</b> selects an algorithm and notifies the publisher <b>282</b> of the selection via a selected algorithm message <b>5434</b>.

<p id="p-0236" num="0240">To ensure the publisher <b>282</b> that the electronic book content delivered to the operations center <b>250</b> was received, the operations center <b>250</b>, serving the recipient <b>4999</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, may respond to the publisher <b>282</b>, serving as the sender in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, by first generating a reply message REP as shown in reply generation step <b>5260</b>.

To authenticate an viewer <b>266</b> or the public viewer <b>912</b> requesting an electronic book from the kiosk, an authentication sequence may be initiated by the viewer <b>266</b> or the public viewer <b>912</b>. The authentication sequence begins with the viewer <b>266</b> or the public viewer <b>912</b> sending a request <b>5290</b> to the kiosk for a given electronic book content file <b>5300</b>. The kiosk then responds to the viewer <b>266</b> or the public viewer <b>912</b> by generating and returning an authentication string <b>5291</b> to the viewer <b>266</b> or the public viewer <b>912</b>.</p>

The copyright information may be displayed the first time an electronic book is viewed. The copyright information may be displayed initially, each time an electronic book is viewed. Alternatively, the information may always be displayed whenever an electronic book is being viewed. This copyright information may be inserted as actual text, overlaid on electronic book text, or inserted as background graphical information in the electronic book.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0365">Associated with a delivered electronic book may be an indication of an electronic book's printing rights. Printing rights information may be applied to all users of an electronic book title, or printing rights may apply to a specific user of an electronic book. Printing rights information may be delivered with an electronic book by the operations center <b>250</b> and used by the home system <b>258</b> in determining what printing capabilities are allowed. An electronic book may be allowed to be printed an unlimited number of times. An electronic book may be allowed to be printed one time only. An electronic book may not be allowed to be printed at all.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0366">Finally, an electronic book may be allowed to be printed, but the electronic version of the electronic book title may be deleted after this one printing. If the electronic book viewer <b>266</b> or library <b>262</b> has a printing capability, the copyright information may be applied to the printed content. The copyright information may be applied on the first page printed, on several pages printed, or on all pages printed. The software running on the secure processor in the home system <b>258</b> performs the print management function.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0367">The electronic book distribution system can make use of steganography to further protect electronic books from copyright violation attempts. Steganography serves to hide secret messages in other messages, concealing the existence of the secret message. The most familiar form of steganographic technique is invisible ink. Steganographic techniques can allow for hidden identifiers to be inserted into electronic books for identifying and tracking purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0368">In one embodiment, the source and various intermediate handlers of electronic book content can insert their identifying marker within an electronic book. This identifier may be a message signed with the private key of the entity inserting the identifier. In another embodiment, an identification value representing the purchasing viewer <b>266</b> or the public viewer <b>912</b> may be inserted in the electronic book using steganographic techniques. The operations center <b>250</b> may insert the purchasing viewer's identifier, or alternatively, the home system <b>258</b> may insert the purchasing viewer's identifier. In one embodiment, the steganographic technique of modifying graphics on a pixel basis is used to encode hidden identifying information. In another embodiment, non-obvious markings are added to the text of an electronic book. In yet another embodiment, modification of line spacings is used to encode hidden identifying information.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0369">Audio watermarking techniques can be used to encode identifying information into audio provided with electronic books. Graphic watermarking, using HighWater Designs' fingerprinted binary information technique or Digimarc Corporation's DigiMarc technology, as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,788, Method and System for Digital Image Signature, to Powell, hereby incorporated by reference, may be used. In yet another embodiment, video watermarking techniques may be used to encode identifying information into video provided with electronic books.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0370">Prior to the delivery of the electronic book containing steganographic identifiers, a hashing value may be calculated and also delivered with the electronic book. The hashing value may be recalculated and compared with the hashing value calculated prior to delivery of the electronic book to the home system <b>258</b>. If the hashing values match, the steganographic identifiers can be assured to be unaltered.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0371">Steganographics may be incorporated into a security and validation system. Embedded steganographic information, including the electronic book publisher <b>282</b>, rightholders, the originating operations center <b>250</b>, and other intermediate sources and the purchasing home system <b>258</b> identifier, may be delivered within each electronic book sold to a home system <b>258</b>. Whenever a home system <b>258</b> requests the purchase of a new electronic book, the operations center <b>250</b> or billing and collection subsystem <b>278</b> may query the home system <b>258</b> to determine the sources of all resident electronic books and to ensure that the books are assigned to that specific home system <b>258</b>. This query may include the operations center <b>250</b> or billing and collection subsystem <b>278</b> accessing and retrieving the steganographically-hidden information from within each electronic book stored at the home system <b>258</b>. If the home system <b>258</b> contains an electronic book from a source that is not valid or an electronic book for which the home system <b>258</b> was not the valid recipient, the operations center <b>250</b> or billing and collection subsystem <b>278</b> may not allow the transaction to proceed and may send a disable command that disables the home system <b>258</b> from operation until the issue can be resolved with the operations center <b>250</b>. Alternatively, the home system <b>258</b>, under the control of the secure processor, may only display electronic books that are watermarked with that home system's unique identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0372">Critical to the security of electronic book distribution system is the ability to modify the security algorithms in case of a security breach.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0373">In one embodiment, the security algorithms operating on the electronic book home system <b>258</b> are updated by software downloaded using a communication network. In an alternative embodiment, the security algorithms operating on the electronic book home system <b>258</b> are updated using software downloaded from a smart card, PC-MCIA device, or other memory device attached to the home system <b>258</b>.</p>
