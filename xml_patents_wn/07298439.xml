<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to transflective liquid crystal devices. In particular, the present invention relates to multi-gap type liquid crystal devices in which the thickness of a liquid crystal layer between a transmissive display region and a reflective display region in each pixel is changed to a suitable value.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In various types of liquid crystal devices, those which are capable of displaying both in a transmissive mode and in a reflective mode are referred to as transflective liquid crystal devices and are used in all scenes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in (A), (B), and (C) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a transflective liquid crystal device has a transparent first substrate <b>10</b> having a first transparent electrode <b>11</b>, a transparent second substrate <b>20</b> having a second transparent electrode <b>21</b> opposing the first transparent electrode <b>11</b>, and a TN (twisted nematic) liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> held between the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b>. The first substrate <b>10</b> has a light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> defining a reflective display region <b>31</b> in a pixel region <b>3</b> where the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> opposes the second transparent electrode <b>21</b>. An opening <b>40</b> in the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> defines a transmissive display region <b>32</b>. The outer surfaces of the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b> have polarizers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively, and a backlight device <b>7</b> opposes the polarizer <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the liquid crystal device <b>1</b> having such a structure, light emitted from the backlight device <b>7</b> and entering the transmissive display region <b>32</b> enters the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> through the first substrate <b>10</b>. The light is modulated in the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> and emitted from the second substrate <b>20</b> to serve as transmissive display light to display images (transmissive mode), as indicated by Arrow L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, light entering the reflective display region <b>31</b> through the second substrate <b>20</b> reaches the reflecting layer <b>4</b> through the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b>. The light is reflected at the reflecting layer <b>4</b> and emitted from the second substrate <b>20</b> through the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> to serve as reflective display light to display images (reflective mode), as indicated by Arrow L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the first substrate <b>10</b>, the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> are provided with a reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> and a transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b>, respectively, so that color images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In such optical modulation, if the twist angle of liquid crystal is set small, the change in polarization is expressed as a function of the product of the difference Δn between refractive indexes and the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> (retardation Δn·d). Therefore, by appropriately setting this value, the visibility of images can be improved. In the transflective liquid crystal device <b>1</b>, however, while the transmissive display light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> only once, the reflective display light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> twice. Therefore, it is difficult to optimize the retardations Δn·d of both the transmissive display light and the reflective display light. Specifically, when the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> is set so that the visibility in the reflective mode is improved, images in the transmissive mode are degraded. In contrast, when the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> is set so that the visibility in the transmissive mode is improved, images in the reflective mode are degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 11-242226 discloses a structure in which the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> in the reflective display region <b>31</b> is set smaller than the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> in the transmissive display region <b>32</b>. This structure is referred to as a multi-gap type and is realized, for example, by providing a thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> having an opening <b>61</b> formed in the region corresponding to the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, under the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and above the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b>, as shown in (A), (B), and (C) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Specifically, since the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> in the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is larger than that in the reflective display region <b>31</b> by the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>, the retardations Δn·d of both the transmissive display light and the reflective display light can be optimized. In order to adjust the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b>, the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> formed must be large. Such a thick layer is formed of a photosensitive resin or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> is formed of a photosensitive resin, photolithography is used. However, the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> inevitably has slopes <b>60</b> diverging upward at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> because of the low exposure accuracy and side etching caused by development during the photolithography. As a result, the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> changes continuously at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, and the retardation Δn·d continuously changes accordingly. Also, the initial orientation of liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal layer <b>5</b> is determined by alignment layers <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> formed on the innermost surfaces of the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b>. However, since the alignment strength of the alignment layer <b>12</b> acts in tilted directions in the slopes <b>60</b>, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is disordered in these areas, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, and thus disclination occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, if the known liquid crystal device <b>1</b> is designed for use in a normally white mode, the entire image should be displayed black while an electric field is applied. However, light leaks from the region corresponding to the slopes <b>60</b> and, thus, display failures, such as contrast degradation, occur. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> (A) shows the results of a simulation for estimating the distribution of the reflected light intensity for each rubbing direction from the reflective display region <b>31</b> to the transmissive display region <b>32</b> when the entire image is displayed black. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(A)</figref>, light leaks at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>. This continuously variable light leakage is caused by an unsuitable retardation Δn·d and the sharp peak of the light leakage is caused by an alignment failure of liquid crystal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> (B) shows the results of a simulation for estimating the distribution of the transmitted light intensity for each rubbing direction from the reflective display region <b>31</b> to the transmissive display region <b>32</b> when the entire image is displayed black. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(B)</figref>, light leaks at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>. This continuously variable light leakage is also caused by an unsuitable retardation Δn·d and the sharp peak of the light leakage is caused by an alignment failure of liquid crystal. The leakage level of the transmitted light is notably lower than that of the reflected light.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a multi-gap type liquid crystal device in which the thickness of the liquid crystal layer is changed to proper values from the transmissive display region to the reflective display region in one pixel region and to provide an electronic apparatus using the liquid crystal device. In the structure of the liquid crystal device, even if the retardation is not proper or the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, high-quality images can still be displayed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to solve the problems, a transflective liquid crystal device of the present invention comprises: a first substrate having first transparent electrodes on a surface thereof; a second substrate having second transparent electrodes on a surface thereof, the second transparent electrodes opposing the first transparent electrodes; and a liquid crystal layer held between the first substrate and the second substrate. The first substrate includes: a light-reflecting layer defining reflective display regions in pixel regions where the first transparent electrodes oppose the second transparent electrodes and transmissive display regions in the regions of the pixel regions other than the reflective display regions; a thickness-adjusting layer (e.g., variable thickness layer) for causing the thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the reflective display regions to be smaller than the thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the transmissive display regions; and the first transparent electrodes, in that order, in the upward direction. At the boundary between each reflective display region and transmissive display region, slopes formed at ends of the thickness-adjusting layer substantially overlap with edges of the light-reflecting layer in plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, since the regions where the light-reflecting layer and the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer overlap each other at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions do not transmit light, the amount of light transmitted through and emitted from the slopes can be reduced in a transmissive mode. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, the amount of light transmitted through and emitted from such regions can be reduced in a transmissive mode.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, since the regions where the light-reflecting layer and the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer do not overlap at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions do not reflect light, the amount of light transmitted through and emitted from the slopes can be reduced in a reflective mode. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, the amount of light transmitted through and emitted from such a region can be reduced in a reflective mode.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, the contrast and the quality of images can be improved in both the transmissive mode and the reflective mode. Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease as compared to when the entire boundary between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions is covered with a shading film, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, the edges of the light-reflecting layer may be substantially aligned with the top edges of the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions. In this structure, the light-reflecting layer is not formed in the region overlapping with the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As a result, reflected light does not enter the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions (the regions where the thickness-adjusting layer forms the slopes at the ends thereof). Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, light does not leak from such regions in a reflective mode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed. Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease in comparison with when the entire boundary between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions is covered with the shading film, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Also, at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, the edges of the light-reflecting layer may be substantially aligned with the bottom edges of the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer. In this structure, the light-reflecting layer overlaps with the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, in plan view. As a result, transmitted light does not enter the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions (the regions where the thickness-adjusting layer forms the slopes at the ends thereof). Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, light does not travel through such regions in a transmissive mode. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed. Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease in comparison with when the entire boundary between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions is covered with a shading film, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect of the present invention, a transflective liquid crystal device comprises: a first substrate having first transparent electrodes on a surface thereof; a second substrate having second transparent electrodes on a surface thereof, the second transparent electrodes opposing the first transparent electrodes; and a liquid crystal layer held between the first substrate and the second substrate. The first substrate comprises: a light-reflecting layer defining reflective display regions in pixel regions where the first transparent electrodes oppose the second transparent electrodes and transmissive display regions in the regions of the pixel regions other than the reflective display regions; a thickness-adjusting (e.g., variable thickness) layer for causing the thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the reflective display regions to be smaller than the thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the transmissive display regions; and the first transparent electrodes, in that order, in the upward direction. Each pixel region is rectangular, each transmissive display region is rectangular and has a side defining the transmissive display region and positioned in the clear viewing direction, and the side overlaps with a side defining the pixel region, in plan view. Also, a shading film is formed so as to substantially overlap, in plan view, the sides which overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this structure, at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, the edges of the light-reflecting layer may be disposed in the region substantially overlapping, in plan view, with the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer. The edges of the light-reflecting layer may overlap with the top edges of the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer. Alternatively, the edges of the light-reflecting layer may overlap with the bottom edges of the slopes formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In liquid crystal devices, light leakage is generally liable to be visually noticed at a side positioned in the clear viewing direction at the periphery of the transmissive display regions. In the present invention, however, the side positioned in the clear viewing direction overlaps with a side defining the pixel regions. Since, at the boundaries between adjacent pixel regions, shading films referred to as a black matrix or black stripes or shading wires run, the light to leak through the side positioned in the clear viewing direction at the periphery of the transmissive display regions is blocked with the shading films. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed. Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease as compared to when the entire boundary between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions is covered with the shading film, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the sides defining each pixel region and transmissive display region and overlapping with each other are adjacent to the reflective display region of an adjacent pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this structure, since the sides positioned in the clear viewing direction of the transmissive display regions are each adjacent to a reflective display region of an adjacent pixel region, the light which would otherwise leak through the boundaries between the transmissive display regions and the adjacent reflective display regions (the regions where the thickness-adjusting layer forms the slopes) is blocked with the shading films. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, part or all of the light to pass through these regions is blocked with the shading layer and, thus, the contrast and the quality of images can be improved. Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease in comparison with when the entire boundary between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions is covered with the shading film, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the liquid crystal device further comprises reflective-display color filters in the reflective display regions and transmissive-display color filters, which are colored more strongly than the reflective-display color filters, in the transmissive display regions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this structure, the difference between color tones of lights produced by passing through the color filters twice in a reflective mode and by passing through the color filters once in a transmissive mode can be reduced, and thus the visibility can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In particular, at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, the edges of the reflective-display color filters may substantially overlap with the edges of the light-reflecting layer in plan view. In this structure, since light reflected at the light-reflecting layer can surely pass through the reflective-display color filters, the visibility is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Alternatively, at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, overlaps may be formed by depositing at least two layers having different colors and forming the reflective-display color filters and/or the transmissive-display color filters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By depositing at least two colored layers to form the overlaps, the light absorption of the overlaps can be increased. As a result, the amount of light transmitted through and emitted from the overlaps decreases and, thus, the overlaps become dark visually. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, light leaking from these regions becomes inconspicuous because part of the light is absorbed by the overlaps. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular, the edges of the reflective-display color filters and the edges of the transmissive-display color filters may overlap with each other in the overlaps. In this structure, overlaps can be relatively easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the thickness-adjusting layer forms slopes at ends thereof at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and the slopes are positioned in the regions overlapping with the overlaps in plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes at the slopes where the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer continuously changes, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, this structure ensures that light leaking from these regions passes through the overlaps, so that the light becomes inconspicuous.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the thickness-adjusting layer forms the slopes at the ends thereof at the boundaries between the reflective display regions and the transmissive display regions, and the width of the slopes in plan view is 8 μm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The twist angle of the liquid crystal in the liquid crystal layer of the present invention is preferably 90° or less.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transflective liquid crystal device of the present invention can be used as display units of electronic apparatuses such as cellular phones and mobile computers.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. The scales of layers and parts in the drawings used for the following description are allowed to differ so that the layers and the parts can be identified in the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">(A), (B) and (C) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are a schematic plan view of one of a plurality of pixel regions formed in a matrix of a liquid crystal device in (A), a sectional view taken along line A-A′ in (B), and a sectional view taken along line B-B′ in (C), respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustration showing the physical relationship between a light-reflecting layer and a thickness-adjusting layer of the liquid crystal device. Since the fundamental structure of the liquid crystal device of the present invention is the same as the known liquid crystal device, parts having the same function are designated by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The pixel region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (A), (B), and (C) shows a part common to the below-mentioned active matrix liquid crystal devices using TFTs or TFDs as non-linear elements for switching pixels. A liquid crystal device <b>1</b> shown here comprises a transparent first substrate <b>10</b> formed of quartz or glass and having a first transparent electrode <b>11</b> formed of ITO or the like on the surface thereof, a transparent second substrate <b>20</b> formed of quartz or glass and having a second transparent electrode <b>21</b> formed of ITO or the like so as to oppose the first electrode <b>11</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> held between the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b> and formed of TN liquid crystal. The region between the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and the second transparent electrode <b>21</b> defines a pixel region <b>3</b>, which directly contributes to displaying images.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first transparent electrode <b>11</b> of the first substrate <b>10</b> is provided with an alignment layer <b>12</b> on the surface thereof, and the second transparent electrode <b>21</b> of the second substrate <b>20</b> is also provided with an alignment layer <b>22</b> on the surface thereof. The alignment layers <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> are formed by applying and baking a polyimide film and, subsequently, by rubbing the film in a predetermined direction. By being subjected to this rubbing process, the alignment layers <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> allow the liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> to align at a twist angle of 90° or less. Thus, the downward direction (the six o'clock direction) of the pixel region <b>3</b> defined by four sides in the drawing is the clear viewing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The liquid crystal device <b>1</b> has many pixel regions <b>3</b> in a matrix. The boundaries of the pixel regions <b>3</b>, in plan view, are provided with a shading film <b>9</b>, referred to as a black mask or black stripes, on the second substrate <b>20</b> or with shading wires (not shown in the drawing) on the first substrate <b>10</b>. Hence, each pixel region <b>3</b> is surrounded by the shading film <b>9</b> or the shading wires.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first substrate <b>10</b> has a rectangular light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> (indicated by oblique lines sloping down to right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>) formed of an aluminum film or a silver alloy film. The light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> defines a reflective display region <b>31</b> in the rectangular pixel region <b>3</b> between the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and the second transparent electrode <b>21</b> and has a rectangular opening <b>40</b>. Thus, in the pixel region <b>3</b>, while the region provided with the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> defines the reflective display region <b>31</b>, the region corresponding to the opening <b>40</b> defines a rectangular transmissive display region <b>32</b>, where the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> is not formed. One side <b>33</b> of the four sides of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is positioned in the clear viewing direction (the six o'clock direction) and overlaps with a side <b>34</b> of the pixel region <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The side <b>33</b> positioned in the clear viewing direction of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is adjacent to another reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>of an adjacent pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b> have polarizers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively, on the outer surfaces thereof, and a backlight device <b>7</b> opposes the polarizer <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the liquid crystal device <b>1</b> having the structure described above, light emitted from the backlight device <b>7</b> to enter the transmissive display region <b>32</b> enters the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> through the first substrate <b>10</b> and is modulated in the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>. Then, the light is emitted from the second substrate <b>20</b> to serve as transmissive display light to display images (transmissive mode), as indicated by Arrow L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Light entering the reflective display region <b>31</b> through the second substrate <b>20</b> reaches the reflecting layer <b>4</b> through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>. The light is reflected at the reflecting layer <b>4</b> and is emitted from the second substrate <b>20</b> through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> to serve as reflective display light to display images (reflective mode), as indicated by Arrow L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the first substrate <b>10</b>, the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> are provided with a reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> and a transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b>, respectively, so that color images can be displayed. The transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b> contains, for example, a large amount of pigment, and it is, thus, colored more strongly than the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b>. The edges of the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> are aligned with the edges of the reflecting layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this transflective liquid crystal device <b>1</b>, while the transmissive display light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> only once, the reflective display light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> twice. In the first substrate <b>10</b>, accordingly, a thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> is formed of a photosensitive resin under the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and above the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b>. The thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> has the opening <b>61</b> formed in the region corresponding to the transmissive display region <b>32</b>. Since the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> in the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is larger than that in the reflective display region <b>31</b> by the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>, the retardations Δn·d of both the transmissive display light and the reflective display light can be optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> is formed by photolithography. However, the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> has slopes <b>60</b> diverging upward between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> because of the low exposure accuracy and side etching caused by development during the photolithography. The slopes <b>60</b> have a width of 8 μm in plan view. As a result, the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> changes continuously at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, and the retardation Δn·d continuously changes accordingly. Also, the initial orientation of liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> is determined by alignment layers <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> formed on the surfaces of the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b>. However, since the alignment strength of the alignment layer <b>12</b> acts in tilted directions in the slopes <b>60</b>, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is disordered in these areas.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Such unstable boundaries degrade the quality of the displayed images. Accordingly, this embodiment is intended to improve the quality of images displayed in a reflective display mode. As shown magnified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, the edges <b>45</b> of the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> are aligned with the top edges <b>65</b> of the slopes <b>60</b> formed at ends of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> when viewed from above.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Hence, at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> of the embodiment, the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> is not formed in the region overlapping with the slopes <b>60</b> formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>. As a result, reflected light does not travel through the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> (the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b> at the ends thereof). Transmitted light enters the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> (the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b> at the ends thereof); however, the leakage level of the transmitted light is notably lower than that of the reflected light, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(B)</figref>. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, reflected light does not travel through these regions in a reflective mode. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease as compared to when the entire boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> are covered with the shading film, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The one side <b>33</b> of the four sides of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is positioned in the clear viewing direction (the six o'clock direction) and overlaps with the side <b>34</b> of the corresponding pixel region, thus overlapping the shading film <b>9</b> when viewed from above. As a result, although the clear viewing direction side of the sides defining the transmissive display region <b>32</b> tends to cause light leakage, the light which would otherwise leak through the clear viewing direction side is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b> and is, consequently, not emitted. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, since the side <b>33</b> positioned in the clear viewing direction of the transmissive display regions <b>32</b> is adjacent to a reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>of an adjacent pixel region, the light which would otherwise leak through the boundary between the transmissive display region <b>32</b> and the adjacent reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>(the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms one of the slopes <b>60</b> at an end thereof) is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b>. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes in the regions where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b>, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, the light which would otherwise leak through these regions is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b>. Thus, the contrast and the quality of images can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Also, since the transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b> is colored more strongly than the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b>, transmitted light can be colored as strongly as reflected light which passes through the reflective-display color filter twice and high-quality color images can be displayed, even though the transmitted display light passes through the transmissive-display color filter only once.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the liquid crystal device <b>1</b> is manufactured, the first substrate <b>10</b> having such a structure is processed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">First, the first substrate <b>10</b> formed of quartz or glass is prepared, and then a reflective metallic layer, such as an aluminum layer or a silver alloy layer, is formed on the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b>. The metallic layer is patterned by photolithography to form the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> and the transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b> are formed in predetermined regions by flexography, photolithography, or an ink jet method.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, a photosensitive resin is applied to the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> by spin coating, and is subsequently subjected to light exposure and development to form the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, a transparent conductive layer is formed of ITO or the like on the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b>, and then the transparent conductive layer is patterned to form the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Next, a polyimide resin is applied to the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> by spin coating, and is subsequently baked. Then, the polyimide resin is subjected to alignment treatment, such as rubbing, to form the alignment layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The resulting first substrate <b>10</b> is bonded to the second substrate <b>20</b>, which has been formed separately, with a predetermined gap therebetween. Then, liquid crystal is injected into the gap to form the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since the liquid crystal device <b>1</b> may have non-linear elements for switching pixels, such as TFDs or TFTs, on the first substrate <b>10</b>, the shading film <b>9</b> for the boundary and other layers may be formed using part of the process for forming the TFDs or the TFTs.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">(A) and (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are a schematic plan view of one of a plurality of pixel regions formed in a matrix of a liquid crystal device in (A), and a sectional view taken along line B-B′ in (B), respectively. Since the fundamental structure of the liquid crystal device of this embodiment is the same as Embodiment 1, parts having the same function are designated by the same reference numerals and the description for these parts is not repeated. Also, the manufacturing method is the same as in Embodiment 1 and the description is not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The pixel region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (A) and (B) shows a part common to the below-mentioned active matrix liquid crystal devices using TFTs or TFDs as non-linear elements for switching pixels, as in Embodiment 1.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The liquid crystal device <b>1</b> has many pixel regions <b>3</b> in a matrix. The boundaries of the pixel regions <b>3</b> are provided with a shading film <b>9</b>, referred to as the black mask or the black stripe, on the second substrate <b>20</b> or with shading wires (not shown in the drawing) in the first substrate <b>10</b> in plan view. Hence, each pixel region <b>3</b> is surrounded by the shading film <b>9</b> or the light-shielding wires in plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first substrate <b>10</b> has a rectangular light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> (indicated by oblique lines sloping down to right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>) formed of an aluminum film or a silver alloy film. The light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> defines a reflective display region <b>31</b> in the rectangular pixel region <b>3</b> between the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and the second transparent electrode <b>21</b> and has a rectangular opening <b>40</b>. Thus, in the pixel region <b>3</b>, while the region provided with the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> defines the reflective display region <b>31</b>, the region corresponding to the opening <b>40</b> defines a rectangular transmissive display region <b>32</b>, where the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> is not formed. One side <b>33</b> of the four sides of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is positioned in the clear viewing direction (the six o'clock direction) and overlaps with a side <b>34</b> of the pixel region. Sides <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> of the four sides of the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, adjoining the side <b>33</b> positioned in the clear viewing direction (the six o'clock direction), overlap with sides <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> of the pixel region <b>3</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The side <b>33</b> positioned in the clear viewing direction of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is adjacent to another reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>of an adjacent pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b> have polarizers <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively, on the outer surfaces thereof and a backlight device <b>7</b> opposes the polarizer <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the liquid crystal device <b>1</b> having such a structure, light emitted from the backlight device <b>7</b> to enter the transmissive display region <b>32</b> enters the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> through the first substrate <b>10</b> and is modulated in the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>. Then, the light is emitted from the second substrate <b>20</b> to serve as transmissive display light to display images (transmissive mode), as indicated by Arrow L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Light entering through the second substrate <b>20</b> to the reflective display region <b>31</b> reaches the reflecting layer <b>4</b> through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>. The light is reflected at the reflecting layer <b>4</b> and emitted from the second substrate <b>20</b> through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> to serve as reflective display light to display images (reflective mode), as indicated by Arrow L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the first substrate <b>10</b>, the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> are provided with a reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> and a transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b>, respectively, so that color images can be displayed. The transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b> contains, for example, a large amount of pigment, and is thus colored more strongly than the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b>. The edges of the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> are aligned with the edges of the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> in plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this transflective liquid crystal device <b>1</b>, while the transmissive display light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> only once, the reflective display light passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> twice. In the first substrate <b>10</b>, accordingly, a thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> is formed of a photosensitive resin under the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and above the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b>. The thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> has the opening <b>61</b> formed in the region corresponding to the transmissive display region <b>32</b>. Since the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> in the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is larger than that in the reflective display region <b>31</b> by the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>, the retardations Δn·d of both the transmissive display light and the reflective display light can be optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> is formed by photolithography. However, the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> has slopes <b>60</b> diverging upward between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> because of the low exposure accuracy and side etching caused by development during the photolithography. The slopes <b>60</b> have a width of 8 μm in plan view. As a result, the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> changes continuously at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, and the retardation Δn·d continuously changes accordingly. Also, the initial orientation of liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> is determined by alignment layers <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> formed on the surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>20</b>. However, since the alignment strength of the alignment layer <b>12</b> acts in tilted directions in the slopes <b>60</b>, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Such an unstable boundary degrades the quality of displayed images. Accordingly, this embodiment is intended to improve the quality of images displayed in a reflective display mode. As shown magnified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, the edges <b>45</b> of the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> are aligned with the top edges <b>65</b> of the slopes <b>60</b> formed at ends of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> in plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Hence, at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> of the embodiment, the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> is not formed in the region overlapping with the slopes <b>60</b> formed at the ends of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>, in plan view. As a result, reflected light does not enter the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> (the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b> at the ends thereof). Transmitted light enters through the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> (the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b> at the ends thereof); however, the leakage level of the transmitted light is notably lower than that of the reflected light, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(B)</figref>. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes according to the continual change in the thickness of the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, reflected light does not travel through these regions in a reflective mode. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Also, since the amount of display light does not decrease in comparison with when the entire boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is covered with the shading film, the liquid crystal device of this embodiment can produce the same effect as in Embodiment 1 and, thus, bright images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The one side <b>33</b> of the four sides defining the transmissive displaying region <b>32</b> is positioned in the clear viewing direction (the six o'clock direction) and overlaps with the side <b>34</b> of the pixel region which overlaps with the shading film <b>9</b> in plan view. As a result, although the clear viewing direction side of the sides of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> tends to cause light leakage, the light which would otherwise leak through the clear viewing direction side is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b> and is consequently not emitted. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The sides <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> of the four sides defining the transmissive displaying region <b>32</b> also overlap with the sides <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> of the pixel region <b>3</b>, thus overlapping with the shading film <b>9</b> when viewed from above. Therefore, the light which would otherwise leak from the region corresponding to the sides <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> of the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b>, and is consequently not emitted. Thus, high-contrast high-quality images can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, since the side <b>33</b> positioned in the clear viewing direction of the transmissive display regions <b>32</b> is adjacent to a reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>of an adjacent pixel region, the light which would otherwise leak through the boundary between the transmissive display region <b>32</b> and the adjacent reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>(the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms one of the slopes <b>60</b> at an end thereof) is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b>. Therefore, even if the retardation Δn·d continuously changes in the regions where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b>, and even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is not aligned, the light which would otherwise leak through these regions is blocked with the shading film <b>9</b>.

In the liquid crystal device of this embodiment, the same parts as in Embodiment 1 are designated by the same reference numerals and the description is not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The embodiment is different from Embodiment 1 in that a shading film <b>9</b><i>a </i>is provided between the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b> and the transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b> at the boundary between the transmissive display region <b>32</b> and the reflective display region <b>31</b><i>a </i>of an adjacent pixel region.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The shading film <b>9</b><i>a </i>is formed by applying, for example, an acrylic resin containing carbon black with a spin coater and, subsequently, by patterning the acrylic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">This structure produces the same effect as in Embodiment 1.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In this embodiment, a light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> is formed of aluminum or a silver alloy on the first substrate <b>10</b> and the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b> has a rectangular opening <b>40</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The first substrate having such a structure is processed, as, for example, in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">First, as in Embodiment 1, a reflective metallic layer is formed on the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b>, and then the metallic layer is patterned by photolithography to form the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Next, the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b><i>a </i>is formed to cover the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> by flexography, an ink jet method, or the like, and then an unnecessary region (the transmissive display region <b>32</b> other than the overlap <b>83</b>) is removed by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, the transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b><i>a </i>is formed in the transmissive display region <b>32</b> by flexography, an ink jet method, photolithography, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Next, a photosensitive resin is applied to the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> by spin coating, and is subsequently subjected to light exposure and development to form the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Then, the first transparent electrode <b>11</b> and the alignment layer <b>12</b> (neither shown in the drawing) are formed as in Embodiment 1.</p>

As a result, since, in the region where the slopes <b>60</b> are formed, light from the backlight passes through the overlap <b>83</b> and then radiates through the liquid crystal layer, the light is inconspicuous. Thus, display failures occurring at the region where the slopes <b>60</b> are formed are inconspicuous and, consequently, the contrast and the quality of displayed images can be improved. Also, since the overlap <b>83</b>, which does not contribute to displaying images, is disposed at the boundary between the reflective display region <b>31</b> and the transmissive display region <b>32</b>, display failures are hardly caused by errors in the manufacturing process.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The lower substrate of the liquid crystal device of the embodiment is processed as in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">First, as in Embodiment 1, a reflective metallic layer is formed on the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b>, and then the metallic film is patterned by photolithography to form the light-reflecting layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Next, the reflective-display color filter <b>81</b><i>a </i>is formed to cover the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> by flexography, an ink jet method, or the like, and then an unnecessary region in the transmissive display region <b>32</b> is removed by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Next, the transmissive-display color filter <b>82</b>R is formed in the transmissive display region <b>32</b> by flexography, an ink jet method, photolithography, or the like.

Therefore, in the region where the thickness-adjusting layer <b>6</b> forms the slopes <b>60</b> at the ends thereof, most of transmitted light from the backlight is absorbed into the overlap <b>83</b> and, thus, this region is displayed substantially black. Thus, display failures caused by the formation of the slopes <b>60</b> are inconspicuous and, consequently, the contrast and the quality of displayed images can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Also, since the width of the overlap <b>83</b> is larger than the width w of the slopes <b>60</b> in plan view and the slopes <b>60</b> are positioned within the overlap <b>83</b> when viewed from above, light which does not pass through the overlap <b>83</b> is surely prevented from being emitted from the slopes <b>60</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The liquid crystal <b>106</b> uses a conventional TN liquid crystal, in which light is modulated by changing the polarization direction thereof.

Also, the TFTs <b>230</b> may be self-aligned TFTs prepared by self-alignment in which a high concentration of impurity ions are implanted using the gate electrodes (part of the scanning lines <b>203</b><i>a</i>) as a mask to form the heavily doped source regions and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Although each source-drain region has only one gate electrode (part of the scanning line <b>203</b><i>a</i>) of the TFT <b>230</b> in the embodiment, the source-drain region may have two or more gate electrodes. In this instance, the same signals are applied to the gate electrodes. The TFTs <b>230</b> having a dual-gate (double-gate) structure or a triple-gate structure or more, as described above, can prevent current from leaking from the junction of the channels with the source-drain regions, thus reducing current in an off state. By forming at least one of these gate electrodes in the LDD structure or the offset structure, current in the off state is further reduced, and thus, the resulting switching elements can be stable.</p>

Therefore, the amount of light passing through the slopes can be reduced in a transmissive mode. Thus, even if the retardation is not appropriate at the boundaries between the transmissive display regions and the reflective display regions or the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules are not aligned, the resulting liquid crystal device can display high-quality images.</p>
