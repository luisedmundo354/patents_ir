<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A coupling mechanism mainly includes a coupling member and two bucking blades. The coupling member has two anchor ends on two sides to anchor a plugging main board on the coupling member, and a groove on an upper side and a lower side, to hold the bucking blades. The bucking blades are squeezed and deformed when the coupling member is moved and latched on a coupling interface of an electronic device to fill the tolerance between the two, thus can prevent electromagnetic waves from leaking out. The two anchor ends are made of metal and can also prevent the electromagnetic waves from leaking out from two sides. The coupling mechanism solves the interference problem during assembly occurring to conventional coupling mechanisms that use annular conductive-foamed plastics. The cost of the coupling mechanism also decreases.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a coupling mechanism and particularly to a coupling mechanism to reduce leaking of electromagnetic waves.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The design of conventional electronic devices often involves reducing unstable electric current leakage and generation and leaking of electromagnetic waves, to comply with the requirements of international safety certifications, and prevent users from being hurt by the leaking current and electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The general approach to meet this objective is to channel the leaking current to the ground or use a shielding means to prevent the leaking current and electromagnetic wave from infiltrating through the tolerance of a coupling mechanism (assembly interface) which bridges a coupling interface and a plugging mainboard (such as the mainboard of a blade server, a graphic card, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C for the conventional coupling mechanisms to prevent electromagnetic waves from leaking. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a first coupling mechanism. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a second coupling mechanism. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates assembly of the second coupling mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the first coupling mechanism uses metal to provide a shielding effect, to prevent leaking of electromagnetic waves. On the outside (which is coupled with a coupling interface of an electronic device) of the coupling mechanism <b>10</b>, an annular spacer <b>12</b> made of metal is provided to be wedged between a gap, formed between the coupling interface (not shown in the drawing) of the electronic device and the coupling mechanism <b>10</b>, to reduce leaking of electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As there is a tolerance in the product design, a gap is formed between the annular spacer <b>12</b> and the coupling interface. Hence leaking of electromagnetic waves cannot be totally prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To remedy the aforesaid problem, the second coupling mechanism is developed, including a conductive foamed plastic, capable of shielding electromagnetic waves, to prevent leaking of electromagnetic waves as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The coupling mechanism <b>20</b> has an annular conductive foamed plastic <b>24</b> located between an annular spacer <b>22</b> and a latch side of the coupling interface, to fill the tolerance mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, for assembly, the coupling mechanism <b>20</b> is moved and latched on a coupling interface <b>30</b> of an electronic device (not shown in the drawing), and the conductive foamed plastic <b>24</b> is squeezed by the coupling interface <b>30</b> and the annular spacer <b>22</b> and deformed, so that a tight coupling is formed between the coupling mechanism <b>20</b> and the coupling interface <b>30</b>, and the gap of tolerance is filled to shield the electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the second coupling mechanism mentioned above still has drawbacks. Because the coupling mechanism <b>20</b> that attaches to the annular conductive foamed plastics <b>24</b> should be formed in a size slightly larger than the coupling interface <b>30</b> to enable the annular conductive foamed plastic <b>24</b> to be squeezed, to achieve a compensation effect, when the coupling mechanism <b>20</b> is moved and latched on the coupling interface <b>30</b> (for assembly), the periphery of the annular conductive foamed plastic <b>24</b> is extended outside the coupling interface <b>30</b>. Hence it is difficult to squeeze the annular conductive foamed plastic <b>24</b> into the coupling interface <b>30</b>. As a result, interference occurs, and assembly cannot be done smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, adding the annular spacer and the annular conductive foamed plastic increases the cost of the coupling mechanism. Hence how to reduce the interference of the annular conductive foamed plastic during assembly and reduce the cost of the coupling mechanism are issues pending to be overcome.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the aforesaid problems, the present invention aims to provide a coupling mechanism adopted for use on a mainboard to reduce interference during assembly and prevent leaking of electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The coupling mechanism according to the invention mainly includes a coupling member and two bucking blades. The coupling member has a coupling portion and two anchor ends. The coupling portion has an upper side and a lower side, each having a groove. The two anchor ends are vertically located on two sides of the coupling portion in a parallel manner to enable the plugging main board to be anchored on the coupling mechanism. Further, electromagnetic waves are prevented from leaking from the two sides of the coupling portion. The two bucking blades are wedged respectively in the upper and the lower grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing, as well as additional objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for the invention in an assembly condition. The coupling mechanism <b>100</b> aims to anchor a plugging main board <b>200</b> on a coupling interface <b>300</b> of an electronic device (not shown in the drawing).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The general plugging main board <b>200</b> has at least one anchor hole <b>202</b> to couple with a fastening element from the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>, to anchor the plugging main board <b>200</b> firmly on the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The coupling interface <b>300</b> may be located on the host frame of the electronic device. Hence when the coupling mechanism <b>100</b> is latched on the coupling interface <b>300</b>, it is held on the host frame of the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The plugging main board <b>200</b> generally is used on the blade main board of razor servers, graphic cards, sound cards, and the like. The coupling interface <b>300</b> has a size slightly larger than the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>, for holding the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the coupling mechanism <b>100</b> mainly includes a coupling member <b>110</b> and two bucking blades <b>150</b> and <b>150</b>′. Details of the structure are elaborated as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The coupling member <b>110</b> includes a coupling portion <b>112</b> and anchor ends, <b>114</b> and <b>114</b>′. The coupling portion <b>112</b> has an upper side and a lower side that have respectively a groove <b>116</b> and <b>116</b>′. The anchor ends <b>114</b> and <b>114</b>′ are located vertically on two sides of the coupling portion <b>112</b> in a parallel manner, to anchor the plugging main board <b>200</b> (not shown in the drawing) on the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>, and prevent electromagnetic waves from leaking through the two sides of the coupling portion <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In practice, the anchor ends <b>114</b> and <b>114</b>′ are formed in an L-shape, and may be fabricated integrally, or formed by stamping, soldering, riveting or the like on two sides of the coupling member <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, the anchor ends <b>114</b> and <b>114</b>′ may have respectively a latch section or aperture to enable the plugging main board <b>200</b> to be anchored on the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> for an embodiment that uses the latch section, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> for another embodiment that uses the aperture, for anchoring the plugging main board <b>200</b> on the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a latch section <b>120</b> is provided that has a retaining section <b>122</b> and a cavity <b>124</b>. When the plugging mainboard <b>200</b> (not shown in the drawing) is subject to a force and the anchor hole <b>202</b> passes through the retaining section <b>122</b> to the cavity <b>124</b>, the retaining section <b>122</b> confines the anchor hole <b>202</b> to prevent the plugging mainboard <b>200</b> from escaping and anchor the plugging mainboard <b>200</b> on the coupling mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an aperture <b>130</b> is provided on the anchor ends <b>114</b> or <b>114</b>′ to couple with the anchor hole <b>202</b> of the plugging main board <b>200</b> through a fastening element <b>132</b>, to anchor the plugging main board <b>200</b> on the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In practice, the fastening element <b>132</b> may be a screw or a tenon. When the fastening element <b>132</b> is a screw, the aperture <b>130</b> and the anchor hole <b>202</b> of the plugging main board <b>200</b> have respectively internal screw threads to engage with the external screw threads of the screw, to enhance the fastening effect.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For assembly, move the coupling mechanism <b>100</b> close to the coupling interface <b>300</b> of the electronic device until the coupling interface <b>300</b> is engaged with the bottom of a latch portion <b>140</b> of the anchor end <b>114</b> or <b>114</b>′ so that the coupling mechanism <b>100</b> is maintained at a latch position. At the latch position the plugging main board <b>200</b> is electrically connected to the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The two bucking blades <b>150</b> and <b>150</b>′ are located respectively in the grooves <b>116</b> and <b>116</b>′ of the coupling member <b>110</b> and bonded by an adhesive means such as a double-sided adhesive tape or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In practice, the bucking blades <b>150</b> and <b>150</b>′ may be conductive foamed plastics that can prevent penetration of electromagnetic waves, or any material that can be squeezed and deformed when the coupling member <b>110</b> is compressed by the coupling interface <b>300</b>, to fill the tolerance there between and block the electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiments of the invention, the latch sections <b>120</b>, apertures <b>130</b> and fastening elements <b>132</b> are not limited. However, at least one must be provided to anchor the plugging main board <b>200</b> on the coupling mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been set forth for the purpose of disclosure, modifications of the disclosed embodiments of the invention as well as other embodiments thereof may occur to those skilled in the art.
