<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A communication network apparatus and method for routing communication signals from a source device to a receiving device. The apparatus performs only local processing on communication signals to thereby increase the speed of processing the signals. A plurality of the processing nodes are combined into a plurality of sub-networks that comprise the network apparatus. Each processing node of a sub-network need only process address information pertaining to the node's current layer, one layer above it, if any, and one layer below it, if any. Additionally, each processing node has associated communication signal frequencies/wavelengths that identify the processing node as the intended recipient of the communication signal. When a communication signal having a carrier signal with a frequency/wavelength corresponding to the processing node is received, the processing node demodulates the carrier signal and forwards the communication signal data to a processing module used to process address information to determine how to route the communication signal through the network. Communication signals may be assigned “express” frequencies/wavelengths, in which case, all of the processing nodes, except the destination processing node, of the network pass the communication signal without performing processing on the communication signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention pertains to an apparatus and method for routing communication signals from a source device to a destination device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional networks require routers and switches to process full destination addresses in order to route communication signals to a destination device. Buffers within the routers and switches that queue the communication signals must account for the full destination addresses of communication traffic that circulates through the routers and switches. The routers and switches must process all incoming traffic regardless of its destination and must process each element of the entire address of each incoming communication signal. Thus, the routers and switches must perform global routing on every communication signal that is received. Furthermore, the routers and switches must know the entire topology of the network in order to route each of the incoming communication signals. Thus, high volume communication signals destined to one address may become a bottleneck to low volume communication signals destined to another address. Therefore, there is a need for new technology to relieve such bottleneck conditions and to generally improve communication network efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a plurality of processing nodes, organized into a network, that route communication signals from a source device to a destination device. Each of the processing nodes include a processing module and a medium interface. The processing module of a processing node performs only local processing on communication signals to thereby increase the speed and efficiency of processing the signals. Local processing involves processing portions of an address as a single entity. Global routing of communication signals is accomplished by the medium interface of the processing node.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The network is divided into sub-networks of processing nodes. Addresses of devices and processing nodes are also organized based on the sub-network structure and are divided into three portions. For each processing node, a first portion relates to addresses of other processing nodes that are in sub-networks that are “above” the sub-network of the processing node; a second portion relates to addresses of other processing nodes that are within the “same” sub-network as the processing node; and a third portion relates to addresses of processing nodes or devices that are in sub-networks that are “below” the sub-network of the processing node or are “child” devices of the processing node, respectively. Each of the three portions of the address is treated as one entity. The processing module of each processing node of a sub-network processes address information in terms of these three portions. Thus, in this sense, the process module processes only addresses that are local to the processing node. Accordingly, each node need not perform global routing processing on the received communication signals.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, each processing node may be associated with carrier signal frequencies/wavelengths that identify the processing node as the intended recipient of the carrier signal. When a received carrier signal has a frequency/wavelength corresponding to the processing node, the processing module of the processing node receives the carrier signal and processes address information modulated on the carrier signal to determine how to route the communication signal through the network. Carrier signals of other frequencies/wavelengths are passed on to other processing nodes by the medium interface without processing by the processing module of the processing node.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a general diagram of a network structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of user devices <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> are connected via communication links to local access providers (LAPs) <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. The LAPs <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are in turn connected to the network <b>100</b>. Reference numerals <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> refer to user devices that are associated with LAPs <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, respectively. When a user device is identified using one of the reference numerals <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>107</b>, it is intended to indicate any one of the user devices so labeled. The context will explicitly state when more than one of the user devices is intended.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When a user device <b>101</b> desires to communicate with a user device <b>105</b>, for example, communication signals are sent from the user device <b>101</b> through the LAP <b>102</b> to the network <b>100</b>. The network <b>100</b> routes the communication signals by way of switches and routers in the network <b>100</b> to the LAP <b>106</b> which then forwards the communication signals to the appropriate user device <b>105</b>. The communication signals include address information that is used to direct the routing of the communication signals through the network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a network architecture for facilitating the routing of communication signals through the network <b>100</b>. The network <b>100</b> includes a plurality of switches “S” <b>110</b> and routers “R” <b>120</b> where each of the switches <b>110</b> and routers <b>120</b> are able to send and receive signals to any other switch <b>110</b> and/or router <b>120</b> in the network <b>100</b> through one or more of the other switches <b>110</b> or routers <b>120</b>. Each switch <b>110</b> and router <b>120</b> processes the complete address information of received communication signals in order to direct the communication signals to their respective destinations. Thus, each switch <b>110</b> and router <b>120</b> in the network <b>100</b> performs global routing processes for all received communication signals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exemplary diagram of a conventional router <b>120</b>. The router <b>120</b> may have a plurality of input ports <b>301</b> and a plurality of output ports <b>303</b>. Both the input and output ports <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> may be connected via a bus <b>300</b> and controlled by a central processing unit (CPU) <b>305</b>, for example. Communication signals received in any one of the input ports <b>301</b> are processed by the CPU <b>305</b> and routed by the CPU <b>305</b> to any one of the output ports <b>303</b> via the bus <b>300</b>. Thus, the CPU <b>305</b> and the bus <b>300</b> may be “bottlenecks” during high volume congestion conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, communication signals, such as data packets, are queued serially at each of the input and output ports <b>301</b> and <b>303</b>. If the lead data packet (the data packet to be transferred next) of one of the input ports <b>301</b> is destined to an output port that is full due to backup congestion of the network <b>100</b>, for example, then the other data packets behind the lead data packet cannot be transferred to their respective output ports <b>303</b>, even if these output ports <b>303</b> have room for the data packet. Thus, congestion at one output port <b>303</b> adversely affects transfer rates of other output ports <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exemplary diagram of a conventional switch <b>110</b>. The switch <b>110</b> includes a plurality of input ports <b>401</b> and a plurality of output ports <b>403</b> connected via a crossbar switch <b>402</b>, for example. While the crossbar switch <b>402</b> eliminates the congestion problem of the bus <b>300</b> in the router <b>120</b>, output port congestion problems described above remain unresolved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The efficiency of the network <b>100</b> may be significantly increased by organizing the network <b>100</b> into groups of processing nodes and interconnecting the processing nodes via respective medium interfaces. Each of the groups of processing nodes make up a sub-network. The relationship among the sub-networks may be described using the words “same,” “above,” and “below,” for example. When a first sub-network is directly “above” a second sub-network, the first sub-network receives all communication signals from the second sub-network that are not destined to a processing node within the second sub-network. Correspondingly, when a third sub-network is directly “below” the second sub-network, all the communication signals destined to devices not “below” the third sub-network are received by the second sub-network. Processing nodes of the “same” sub-network may directly communicate without communication signals traversing other processing nodes that are above or below the “same” sub-network.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The words “same,” “above,” and “below” do not restrict the network organization into a hierarchical structure because there is no requirement that the first sub-network cannot be both above and below the second sub-network, for example. As used in the following description of the embodiments of this invention, a sub-network means a plurality of processing nodes that are logically or physically linked in such a way that they form a sub-group of a network. Communication signals are transmitted between processing nodes based on the sub-network organization.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary block diagram of one of the processing nodes <b>500</b>. As discussed above, the processing nodes <b>500</b> are grouped together to form sub-networks. Each processing node <b>500</b> has at least three interfaces with respect to the sub-network organization. Interface <b>502</b> couples a particular processing node <b>500</b> to other processing nodes <b>500</b> of the same sub-network. Interface <b>504</b> couples the processing node <b>500</b> to processing nodes <b>500</b> of sub-networks that are above (above sub-networks) the sub-network of the particular processing node <b>500</b>. Interface <b>506</b> couples the processing node <b>500</b> to processing nodes <b>500</b> of sub-networks or devices that are below (below sub-networks) the sub-network of the particular processing node <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a more detailed exemplary block diagram of processing node <b>500</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.6</figref>, the processing node <b>500</b> includes a medium interface <b>510</b>, a processing module <b>900</b> and an input/output interface <b>520</b>. The medium interface <b>510</b> sends and receives communication signals to medium interfaces <b>510</b> of other processing nodes <b>500</b> within the same sub-network via interface <b>502</b>, to input/output interfaces <b>520</b> of other processing nodes <b>500</b> in above sub-networks via interface <b>504</b>, and to medium interfaces <b>510</b> of other processing nodes <b>500</b> in below sub-networks via the interface <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the medium interface <b>510</b> may route communication signals from any sub-network to any other sub-network, Table 1 shows the preferred routing possibilities of the communication signals using the medium interface <b>510</b>. As shown in Table 1, communication signals may be routed from below, same and above sub-networks to below, same and above sub-networks with two preferred exceptions. Communication signals from below sub-networks are preferably not routed through the medium interface <b>510</b> to other below sub-networks because these communication signals may be more efficiently handled by the input/output interface <b>520</b>. Communication signals from above sub-networks are preferably not routed to other above sub-networks through the medium interface <b>510</b> because such communication signals may be better handled directly by the above sub-networks.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, as described in greater detail hereafter, certain communication signals may be “express” communication signals that are capable of bypassing the processing module <b>900</b> altogether. Whether a communication signal is “express” or “non-express” may be determined in many different ways. For example, a subscriber may subscribe to “express” service when subscribing to network service. A user may request express service when initiating a communication. Certain destination addresses may be designated “express,” such as emergency destination addresses, hotlines, and the like. Alternatively, the network itself may designate a communication signal to be “express” based on a network status. Any manner of designating a communication signal to receive “express” treatment is intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In these cases, no processing of the communication signal is performed by the processing module <b>900</b> and the express communication signals traverse the network <b>100</b> from one medium interface <b>510</b> to another until a processing node <b>500</b> is reached where the express communication signals are not “express” and are processed by that processing module <b>900</b>. Thus, communication signals may be “express” in some processing nodes <b>500</b> and “non-express” in other processing nodes <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Non-express communication signals that are destined to below sub-networks or below devices with respect to the processing node <b>500</b> are directed to the processing module <b>900</b> through communication link <b>512</b>. The processing module <b>900</b> processes received communication signals and sends the processed communication signals to the input/output interface <b>520</b> for output through interface <b>506</b> to the below sub-networks or below devices. Non-express communication signals received from a below device or a processing node in a below sub-network are passed to the processing module <b>900</b> via interface <b>506</b>, received by the input/output interface <b>520</b> and sent to the processing module <b>900</b> via communication link <b>524</b>. These communication signals are processed by the processing module <b>900</b>, output to the medium interface <b>510</b>, and then forwarded to other processing nodes <b>500</b> of the same or above sub-networks via the interfaces <b>502</b> or <b>504</b>, respectively, or to another below sub-network or below device via interface <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted above, in certain instances, communication signals may be considered “express” communication signals that allow the processing node <b>500</b> to route the communication signals while bypassing the processing module <b>900</b>. In these cases, the “express” communication signals are assigned attributes that designate the communication signal to be an express communication signal. When a processing node <b>500</b> receives a communication signal that has the attribute defined as “express,” the processing node <b>500</b> routes the communication signal without being processed by the processing module <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, if the processing node <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> receives a communication signal that is express, from a below sub-network processing node <b>500</b>, the input/output interface <b>520</b> separates express communication signals by filtering, for example, so that they bypass the processing module <b>900</b>. The express communication signal is passed to the medium interface <b>510</b> via the communication link <b>532</b> thereby bypassing the processing module <b>900</b>. The medium interface <b>510</b> receives the express communication signals and routes the express communication signals to another processing node <b>500</b> in the same sub-network via the interface <b>502</b> or to the medium interface of another processing node <b>500</b> of an above sub-network via the interface <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Similarly, express communication signals from processing nodes <b>500</b> in above sub-networks may bypass the processing module <b>900</b> via the filter <b>580</b>, for example, and communication link <b>534</b>. The filter <b>580</b> performs a similar function to that of input/output interface <b>520</b> in separating express communication signals so that they may bypass the processing module <b>900</b>. The filter <b>580</b> may be a separate element (as shown) or may be incorporated, for example, into the medium interface <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Likewise, express communication signals may be received from processing nodes <b>500</b> in the same sub-network. In this case, if the express communication signals are destined for a processing node <b>500</b> in a sub-network that is only reachable through an above sub-network, the medium interface <b>510</b> routes the express communication signals to the above sub-network through interface <b>504</b> without the express communication signals being processed by the processing module <b>900</b>. If the express communication signals are destined for a processing node <b>500</b> that is reachable by another processing node <b>500</b> in the same sub-network, the medium interface <b>510</b> passes the express communication signals to another node in the same sub-network via interface <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Otherwise, if the express communication signals are destined for a processing node <b>500</b> reachable through the present processing node <b>500</b>, the medium interface <b>510</b> routes the express communication signals to the destination processing node via the communication link <b>512</b>, the filter <b>580</b>, the communication link <b>534</b>, the input/output interface <b>520</b> and the interface <b>506</b>. Alternatively, if the express communication signals are destined for a child device of the present processing node <b>500</b>, the express communication signals are processed in a similar fashion as other non-express communication signals, by the processing module <b>900</b> and routed to the appropriate child device through the communication link <b>522</b>, the input/output interface <b>520</b> and the interface <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this way, the express communication signals bypass the processing modules <b>900</b> of the processing nodes <b>500</b> until the express communication signals are received by a processing node <b>500</b> for which the communication signals are “non-express” such as the destination processing node, for example. This reduces delay in routing the express communication signals, since less processing is performed and thus, network congestion is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram showing the three exemplary groupings of the processing nodes <b>500</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the processing nodes <b>500</b> are organized into three sub-networks. Each of the processing nodes <b>500</b> may be linked directly or indirectly to one or more processing node <b>500</b> in an above sub-network, one or more below sub-network or below device, and other processing nodes <b>500</b> in the same sub-network, if there are more than one processing node in the same sub-network, via interfaces <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>, respectively. When processing non-express communication signals, each processing node <b>500</b> only needs to determine if the non-express communication signal is to be routed to a processing node in an above sub-network, a below sub-network or below device, or other processing nodes of the same sub-network. Thus, only local processing of non-express communication signals is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a more detailed-diagram of the medium interface <b>510</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the medium interface <b>510</b> includes input ports <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> and <b>804</b> and output ports <b>803</b>, <b>805</b> and <b>806</b>. The input and output ports <b>801</b> and <b>805</b> form the interface <b>502</b>; the input and output ports <b>804</b> and <b>803</b> form the interface <b>504</b>; and the input and output ports <b>802</b> and <b>806</b> receive and output communication signals from and to the processing module <b>900</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the input and output ports <b>801</b>-<b>806</b> of the medium interface <b>510</b> are shown as single ports, each of the ports <b>801</b>-<b>806</b> may comprise a plurality of ports depending on particular implementation details. Furthermore, the input and output ports <b>801</b>-<b>806</b> may be combined into single input/output ports or multiple input/output ports without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Additional ports may be provided to support routing of express communication signals.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The medium interface receives communication signals in the form of modulated carrier signals. When a device initiates a communication, the first processing node <b>500</b> that receives communication data of the communication selects an appropriate carrier signal and modulates the selected carrier signal with the communication data. The modulated carrier signal is then routed through the network via the medium interface <b>510</b> of the first processing node <b>500</b>. Express and non-express communication signals may be distinguished by allocating a group of carrier signals as express while other carrier signals may be non-express, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The medium interface <b>510</b> includes a filter <b>807</b> that performs the routing function among the ports <b>801</b>-<b>806</b>. If each of the output ports <b>803</b>, <b>805</b> and <b>806</b> are assigned to specific carrier signals by frequency or wavelength groups, for example, then the filter <b>807</b> may separate the communication signals received via input ports <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> and <b>804</b> by the carrier signal frequency/wavelength group and direct communication signals having appropriate carrier signals to the respective output ports <b>803</b>, <b>805</b> and <b>806</b>.</p>

Thus, the filter <b>807</b> filters out carrier signals within frequency range: (1) f<sub>1</sub>-f<sub>2 </sub>of Group 1 received from input port <b>801</b> and directs them to output port <b>805</b>; (2) f<sub>3</sub>-f<sub>4 </sub>of Group 2 received from input port <b>801</b> and directs them to output port <b>806</b>; (3) f<sub>5</sub>-f<sub>6 </sub>of Group 3 received from input port <b>802</b> and directs them to output port <b>803</b>; (4) f<sub>7</sub>-f<sub>8 </sub>of Group 4 received from input port <b>802</b> and directs them to output port <b>805</b>; (5) f<sub>9</sub>-f<sub>10 </sub>of Group 5 received from input port <b>804</b> and directs them to output port <b>805</b>; (6) f<sub>11</sub>-f<sub>12 </sub>of Group 6 received from input port <b>804</b> and directs them to output port <b>806</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Additionally, certain frequencies/wavelengths may be predetermined to be “express” frequencies/wavelengths. For example, if the carrier signal is of a frequency/wavelength not assigned to the processing node <b>500</b> for processing, and the frequency/wavelength is designated an express frequency/wavelength, the corresponding carrier signal is routed to an appropriate output port. The express frequencies or wavelengths are handled by the medium interface <b>510</b> in the same manner as communication signals having non-express frequencies/wavelengths. Furthermore, additional ports may be added that are pre-defined for receiving express frequency/wavelength communication signals from the filter <b>807</b>. In such a case, the filter <b>807</b> will route communication signals having these express frequencies and wavelengths to the pre-defined ports.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When RF frequencies are used, the filter <b>807</b> may include band pass, low pass and high pass filters as is well known in the art. When optical frequencies or wavelengths are used, dichroic mirrors, prisms, grading filters and other types of optical filters and optical switches may be used as is well known in the art. Thus, direct routing of carrier signals among the input/output ports <b>801</b>-<b>806</b> may be accomplished by known devices that may not require computational power. Such direct routing significantly reduces computational loads of the processing module <b>900</b> of each processing node <b>500</b> for routing network traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In particular, “global” routing may be accomplished by the medium interface <b>510</b> together with frequency/wavelength assignments and the sub-network organization while “local” routing may be performed by the processing module <b>900</b>. In other words, “global” routing may be performed without having to process address information of the communication signals. “Global” routing may be performed by frequency/wavelength assignments and the particular configuration of the filters in the medium interfaces <b>510</b> of the processing nodes <b>500</b>. If a medium interface <b>510</b> of a processing node <b>500</b> determines, through filtering of the communication signals, that the communication signal is to be processed by the processing node <b>500</b>, “local” routing is performed on the address information of the communication signal by the processing module <b>900</b>, as described in more detail hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When communication signals (or traffic), that are received from the interface <b>506</b>, are destined to processing nodes <b>500</b> or user devices (e.g., telephone stations or terminals, not shown) that are reachable only via an above sub-network, the communication data is modulated by the processing module <b>900</b> onto a carrier signal that has a frequency/wavelength that is assigned to an above sub-network processing node <b>500</b>. The modulated carrier signal is then sent to the above sub-network processing node <b>500</b> via the input port <b>802</b>, the filter <b>807</b> and the output port <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Non-express traffic received through the interface <b>506</b>, destined for another processing node <b>500</b> of the same sub-network, are modulated onto a carrier signal having a frequency/wavelength assigned to a same sub-network processing node <b>500</b>. The modulated carrier signal is then sent to the same sub-network processing node <b>500</b> via the input port <b>802</b>, the filter <b>807</b> and the output port <b>805</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Namely, each processing node <b>500</b> is assigned a specific carrier frequency/wavelength or frequency/wavelength range. By use of the medium interface <b>510</b>, the processing module <b>900</b> is assured that only traffic that it must process is received and thus, processing associated with “pass through” or “express” traffic that are destined elsewhere, is avoided. In this way, traffic routing may be reduced to only local considerations because “global” routing issues are resolved by the medium interface <b>510</b>, the carrier signal frequency/wavelength assignments and the sub-network organization. The above three architectural elements (the medium interface <b>510</b>, sub-network organization, and frequency assignment) can be predetermined and do not require “real-time” computations. Thus, the processing nodes <b>500</b> provide for significant network efficiency improvement by reducing processing node computational power requirements and by reducing network congestion.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When communication signals are received from user devices or processing nodes <b>500</b> in a below sub-network that do not have an express frequency/wavelength carrier signals, through input/output interface <b>520</b>, for example, the processing module <b>900</b> demodulates the carrier signals to extract the communication data. Processing is then performed on the extracted communication data to determine local routing of the communication signals, as described hereinafter. Based on the results of the processing, the processing module <b>900</b> sends a modulated carrier signal, i.e. communication signal, to the medium interface <b>510</b> via input port <b>802</b>, having the appropriate frequency/wavelength for routing by the medium interface <b>510</b>. Alternatively, if carrier signals are received from user devices or processing nodes <b>500</b> in a below sub-network and the carrier signals have an express frequency or wavelength, the carrier signals, and hence the communication signals, are routed by the medium interface <b>510</b> without processing by the processing section <b>580</b> and processing module <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that all communication signals received through any of the input ports <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, are passed through the filter <b>807</b>, not all communication signals need be passed through the filter <b>807</b>. Direct communication links may be provided, for example, between input port <b>804</b> and output port <b>806</b>. For example, if every below sub-network processing node <b>500</b> only receives communication signals that are destined for below sub-networks or below devices, all communication signals received through input port <b>804</b> are passed directly to output port <b>806</b>. Similarly, direct connections may be utilized for passing express communication signals from input ports to appropriate output ports.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an exemplary flowchart of the operation of the medium interface <b>510</b>. In step <b>601</b>, modulated carrier signals, i.e. communication signals, are received by the medium interface <b>510</b> through at least one of the input ports <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, and the medium interface <b>510</b> goes to step <b>602</b>. In step <b>602</b>, the medium interface <b>510</b> performs the filtering function described above to separate the modulated carrier signals into groups such as shown in Tables 1, 2 or 3, and goes to step <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step <b>603</b>, the medium interface <b>510</b> directs group 6 modulated carrier signals received through port <b>804</b>, i.e. the modulated carrier signals from an above sub-network, and group 2 modulated carrier signals received from input port <b>801</b> to output port <b>806</b>. In step <b>604</b>, the medium interface <b>510</b> directs group 3 modulated carrier signals received through port <b>802</b>, i.e. the modulated carrier signals from the processing module <b>900</b>, to the output port <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step <b>605</b>, the medium interface <b>510</b> directs group 1 modulated carrier signals from input port <b>801</b> to the output port <b>805</b>. In step <b>606</b> the medium interface <b>510</b> directs group 4 modulated carrier signals from input port <b>802</b> to the output port <b>805</b>. In step <b>607</b>, the medium interface <b>510</b> directs group 5 modulated carrier signals from input port <b>804</b> to output port <b>805</b>. Although not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, similar functions may be performed for the express frequencies/wavelengths, such as those shown in Table 3. The above steps may be performed in any order and may be performed in parallel as well as serially.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The medium interface <b>510</b> may continue the above process even if the processing module <b>900</b> becomes inoperative because the functions of the medium interface <b>510</b> may be independent of the functions performed by the processing module <b>900</b>. For example, if the medium interface <b>510</b> is comprised of optical elements, then the modulated carrier signals are modulated light signals and the various colors of light may be directed to appropriate output ports <b>803</b>, <b>805</b> and <b>806</b> as long as the optical elements are functioning. If the optical elements are passive elements, then the medium interface <b>510</b> continues to operate even during electric power outages. Thus, the medium interface <b>510</b> may be a reliable coupling element in the network <b>500</b> allowing the network <b>500</b> to function independent of the state of the processing module <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The functions of the medium interface <b>510</b> described above, may be performed by elements such as passive or active filters, or digital computational elements such as a dedicated processing elements, e.g., digital filters using application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or PLAs, etc., or general purpose processors as implementation details dictate. That is to say that computational elements may be used in the medium interface <b>510</b>, if desired, but non-computational elements may also be used to achieve the functions of the medium interface <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows one embodiment where the sub-networks are organized hierarchically into layers L1, L2and L3.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The processing nodes <b>500</b> of each of the sub-networks SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>2</b> and SN<b>6</b>-SN<b>7</b> are coupled to one processing node <b>500</b> of an above sub-network SN<b>3</b> or SN<b>5</b>. A processing node <b>500</b> that is in an above sub-network SN<b>3</b> or SN<b>5</b> is referred to as a parent processing node <b>500</b> to the processing nodes <b>500</b> that are in a below sub-network and coupled directly to it.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is only exemplary and various modifications to the particular network architecture may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the processing nodes <b>500</b> of below sub-networks communicating with a single above processing node <b>500</b>, the invention is not limited to such an arrangement. Each processing node <b>500</b> may communicate with one or more above or below sub-network processing nodes <b>500</b>. Furthermore, the sub-networks are not limited to a circular architecture as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The sub-networks may be organized serially or in a broken star fashion, for example. Other modifications as will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a plurality of user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> communicate with one another over the network <b>700</b>. Each processing node <b>500</b> in the network <b>700</b> may serve as an access provider for one or more of the user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b>. The user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> may communicate with each other by entering the destination address of other user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b>, such as the telephone number, IP address, electronic mail address, and the like. For example, if one of the user devices <b>101</b> desires to communicate with one of the user devices <b>105</b>, an operator of the user device <b>101</b> may enter the destination address for the user device <b>105</b> through a user interface, such as a keypad, touch-screen, voice recognition device, and the like. The communication signals are routed from the user device <b>101</b> through the network <b>700</b> traversing a path, for example, as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">(1) user device <b>101</b> to processing node “S” of SN<b>1</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">(2) processing node “S” to processing node “A” of SN<b>3</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">(3) processing node “A” to processing node “B” of SN<b>4</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">(4) processing node “B” to processing node “C” of SN<b>4</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">(5) processing node “C” to processing node “K” of SN<b>5</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">(6) processing node “K” to processing node “F” of SN<b>7</b>; and finally</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">(7) processing node “F” to the destination user device <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> may be any device that transmits and/or receives signals. For example, the user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> may be land-line telephones, cellular telephones, computers, personal digital assistants, point of sale devices, two-way pagers, WebTV™, and the like. For simplicity of discussion, the following description will assume that the user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> are land-line telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> are in communication with the network <b>700</b> over communications links. These communications links may be any type of connection that allows the transmission of information. Some examples include conventional telephone lines, fiber optic lines, direct serial connection, wireless communication links, satellite communication links, and the like. The processing nodes <b>500</b> of the network <b>700</b> may also be linked by similar communication links.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The communication signals may include communication data and address information. The communication data and address information are modulated onto the carrier signals which are “steered” through the network <b>700</b> via the medium interfaces <b>501</b> of the processing nodes <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When a child device initiates a communication with another child device by, for example, entering a destination address of the other child device and sending a transmit command, a communication signal from the child device to a first processing node <b>500</b> in the network <b>700</b> is sent. The communication signal from the child device may include such information as the calling child device identifier, a destination address, and the like. Based on the destination address, or an address generated from the destination address, the first processing node <b>500</b> determines whether to send the communication signal to another node in a same sub-network, a node in an above sub-network, or a node or child device in a below sub-network.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The destination address may be an identifier that indicates the routing necessary for the communication signal or may be an identifier of a child device from which routing address information is determined. Routing address information may be determined from the destination address by, for example, using a look-up table or the like, in the processing nodes <b>500</b>. For simplicity of the following description, it will be assumed that the destination address indicates the routing necessary for the communication signal.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Similarly, whether or not the communication signal is an express communication signal may be determined from the calling child device address, destination address, a look-up table or the like. Various criteria, such as network congestion, the type of call (which may be determined from the destination address, for example), and the like may be taken into consideration when determining if a communication signal is an “express” communication signal. Each processing node <b>500</b> of the network <b>700</b> may be capable of determining if a received non-express communication signal should be made “express” by use of a look-up table or the like. Thus, a communication signal may not be “express” in one portion of the network <b>700</b> and may be determined to be “express” in another portion of the network <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When a processing node <b>500</b> receives a communication signal from a child (either a child processing node or a child device) that does not have an express frequency/wavelength, via the interface <b>506</b>, the processing module <b>900</b> examines the destination address to determine whether the destination device is another child, a child of another processing node <b>500</b> of the same sub-network SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>7</b> or a child of some other processing node <b>500</b>. If the destination device is not another child, the processing module <b>900</b> selects the appropriate carrier signal frequency/wavelength and modulates the selected carrier signal with the communication signal and transmits the modulated carrier signal onto the communication medium via port <b>802</b> of the medium interface.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the destination address includes an address of a child processing node <b>500</b>, then the processing module <b>900</b> modulates the communication data onto a carrier signal that corresponds to the destination processing node <b>500</b> and outputs the modulated carrier signal to the medium interface <b>510</b> of the child processing node via the interface <b>506</b>. If the destination device is a child device, then the processing module <b>900</b> processes the communication signal for output to the child device in a manner that is known in the art and delivers the processed signal to the child device.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the processes described above, each processing module <b>900</b> is not required to determine a routing path for the communication signal, but only needs to distinguish based on the destination address, whether the destination device is reachable through an above, same or a below sub-network SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>7</b>/processing node <b>500</b>. Thus, the amount of processing required of each processing module <b>900</b> is greatly reduced when compared to that required by conventional routers and switches.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If the communication signal from the child device or below sub-network has a frequency/wavelength that is predetermined to be an express frequency/wavelength, the processing nodes <b>500</b> pass the communication signal, by way of the medium interfaces <b>510</b>, until the processing node to which the express frequency/wavelength is assigned receives the communication signal. For example, if processing node C in layer L3of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is assigned an express frequency of f<sub>13 </sub>and child device T generates a communication signal having frequency f<sub>13</sub>, the communication signal will be passed without processing through the medium interfaces of processing nodes R, Q, B and through the medium interfaces <b>510</b> of the processing nodes <b>500</b> in the sub-network SN<b>4</b> to the processing node C. When the processing node C receives the communication signal, its medium interface <b>510</b> recognizes, through filtering of the communication signal, that the communication signal is to be processed by its processing module <b>900</b>. The processing node C therefore, performs “local” processing on the address information of the communication signal to determine how to route the communication signal.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further efficiency is obtained by partitioning the address information in a manner that corresponds to the sub-network organization. For example, if the address is partitioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, into address fields <b>1101</b>-<b>1104</b>, then each field of the address corresponds to a layer L1-L3of the network and one field of the address may be used to address child devices. In this way, the determination of whether the destination device is reachable through an above, same or below sub-network SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>7</b> or processing node <b>500</b> may be accomplished by examining either the entire portion of the address above the level of the current processing node <b>500</b> or by examining the address immediately above the level of the current processing node <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when a user of one of the user devices <b>101</b> wishes to communicate with one of the user devices <b>107</b>, for example, the user activates (goes off-hook, for example) the user device <b>101</b> and enters the destination address information, such as a telephone number, IP address, access number, or the like as is well known in the art. The communication signals containing the address information are sent to the processing node S in the sub-network SN<b>1</b> of layer L1. The processing node S examines the fields of the destination address information to first determine if the parent processing node A is addressed. If so, then the destination device is a child of one of the processing nodes <b>500</b> of the same sub-network SN<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this case, the processing node S further examines the destination address to determine whether the destination device is a child of the processing node S or of another processing node of the same sub-network SN<b>1</b>. If a child of the processing node S, the communication signal is processed and sent to the child device <b>101</b>. If the destination device is a child of another processing node of the same sub-network SN<b>1</b>, then the processing node S modulates the communication signal onto a carrier signal assigned to the other processing node <b>500</b> and transmits the carrier signal via the port <b>805</b> of the medium interface <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The same process as described above is performed by each of the processing nodes A, B and C, assuming the carrier signal does not have an express frequency/wavelength assigned to it. Processing nodes D and E need not determined if their respective parent processing nodes are addressed or if they themselves are addressed since the communication signals are sent to them from their parent processing nodes. Thus, processing nodes D and E need only determine which below sub-network processing node <b>500</b> or child device to route the communication signals.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If the parent node A is not addressed, then the destination device is only reachable via the above sub-network SN<b>3</b>, and thus, the communication signal is modulated onto a carrier signal whose frequency/wavelength is allocated to the processing node A of the above sub-network SN<b>3</b>. The modulated carrier signal is transmitted to the processing node A via the port <b>803</b> of the medium interface <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The address information of the communication signals is organized in a manner corresponding to the sub-network organization. Each portion of the address information shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> corresponds to each of the layers of sub-networks in the network <b>700</b>. For the network <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the address information may contain four fields <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b>, <b>1103</b> and <b>1104</b> corresponding to addresses ADD<b>1</b>, ADD<b>2</b>, ADD<b>3</b> and ADD<b>4</b>, respectively. ADD<b>1</b> identifies a particular user device, ADD<b>2</b> identifies the first layer sub-network processing node, ADD<b>3</b> identifies a second layer sub-network processing node, and ADD<b>4</b> identifies a third layer sub-network processing node.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Each of the addresses ADD<b>1</b>-ADD<b>4</b> contains sufficient information to uniquely identify each processing node <b>500</b> of the sub-networks SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>7</b> within the respective layers L1-L3. ADD <b>1</b> includes enough bits to identify the particular user devices <b>101</b>-<b>113</b> connected to the processing nodes in layer L1; ADD<b>2</b> includes enough bits to address every processing node within one sub-network SN<b>1</b>, SN<b>2</b>, SN<b>6</b> and SN<b>7</b> of layer L1; ADD<b>3</b> includes enough bits to address every processing node within one sub-network SN<b>3</b> or SN<b>5</b> of layer L2; and ADD<b>4</b> includes enough bits to address every processing node within one sub-network SN<b>4</b> of layer L3.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The addresses ADD<b>1</b>, ADD<b>2</b>, ADD<b>3</b> and ADD<b>4</b> may be shared for sub-networks SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>7</b> within the same layer because the network <b>700</b> is organized into layers such that the sub-networks SN<b>1</b>-SN<b>7</b> in each layer L1-L3are separated, in a path traversal sense, from other sub-networks in the same layer L1-L3by at least one processing node <b>500</b> of an upper layer. For example, the address ADD<b>1</b> may be the same for the user device <b>101</b> and the user device <b>107</b> since addresses ADD<b>2</b>, ADD<b>3</b> and ADD<b>4</b> designate a unique communication “pathway” between the associated processing nodes. Similarly, ADD<b>2</b> may correspond to a processing node <b>500</b> in sub-networks SN<b>1</b> and SN<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">However, if address processing is based on examining the entire address above the current processing node <b>500</b> level, only a difference in the highest level address is necessary to designate a unique address for the destination user device. For example, if a user device whose parent node is processing node A in sub-network SN<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> wishes to communicate with a user device <b>111</b>, because there is a difference in the address for the processing node in sub-network SN<b>4</b>, the communication signals will be properly routed. That is, the address for communication signals from processing node A in sub-network SN<b>3</b> to user device <b>111</b> is CA. The address for communication signals from user device <b>111</b> to processing node A in sub-network SN<b>3</b> is BA. If both the processing nodes <b>500</b> in sub-networks SN<b>3</b> and SN<b>5</b> had the same parent processing node <b>500</b>, communication signals will only be routed to below processing nodes <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Furthermore, the communication signals will be routed up the levels L1-L3of the network <b>700</b> until a same entire above address is encountered. At this point, the communication signals will be routed back down the levels of the network <b>700</b>. Thus, for example, if an address for a destination user device is CABQ and an address for the originating user device is CALH, when the communication signal is processed by a processing node <b>500</b> in level L2, the above address “CA” designates the parent processing node of the level L2sub-network. Accordingly, the communication signal may not be routed further up the levels of the network <b>700</b> and the communication signal may be routed back down the network <b>700</b> levels, if possible.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If address processing is based on examining the immediate above address, each above address at each level must be different from other above addresses for processing nodes <b>500</b> at the same level having the same address. Thus, processing node A in sub-network SN<b>5</b> cannot have a below sub-network processing node with the address S since communication signals from user devices <b>101</b> would not be able to be routed to user devices connected to the processing node S. That is to say, the address for communicating with the user devices would be CAS, however, when the processing node S examines the immediate above processing node address it will appear as if the above processing node address corresponds to the parent processing node of processing node S in sub-network SN<b>1</b>. Thus, communication signals will be routed to below processing nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Communication signals that do not have an express frequency/wavelength may be routed through the network <b>700</b> using the addresses ADD<b>4</b>-ADD<b>1</b> as explained below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-17</figref>. When the user device <b>101</b> (a child of processing node S) initiates a call to the user device <b>107</b> (a child of processing node E), processing node S first receives the carrier signal from the user device <b>101</b> via the interface <b>506</b>. The input/output interface <b>520</b> extracts the communication signal and provides the address information to the processing module <b>900</b>. The processing module <b>900</b> processes the address information to determine where to send the communication by analyzing the addresses ADD<b>4</b>-ADD<b>1</b>. For this example, ADD<b>4</b>-ADD<b>1</b> have the values C, D, E and X corresponding to addresses of processing nodes C, D, E and user device X, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As mentioned above, routing of communication signals may be based on the entire above address or may be based only on the immediate above address. The entire above address approach involves examining the entire address above a current level of the system architecture. The immediate above address approach involves examining the address associated with the level immediately above a current level in the system architecture. For purposes of the following description, the immediate above address approach will be assumed. The entire above address approach will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The processing module <b>900</b> of the processing node S determines from the above address ADD<b>3</b>, whether the address identifies the parent processing node A in the above sub-network SN<b>3</b>. If the address ADD<b>3</b> identifies the parent processing node A in the above sub-network SN<b>3</b>, then the communication is destined for a user device <b>101</b> that is a child of one of the processing nodes <b>500</b> in the same sub-network SN<b>1</b> because the address for all processing nodes <b>500</b> within the sub-network SN<b>1</b> has the same value for ADD<b>3</b>. However, in this example, the destination address is for the user device <b>107</b>, thus ADD<b>3</b> identifies processing node D in sub-network SN<b>5</b>. Thus, the processing module <b>900</b> modulates the communication data onto a carrier signal having a frequency or wavelength that is assigned to parent node A and transmits the modulated carrier signal via port <b>803</b> of the medium interface <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the processing node A receives the modulated carrier signal via its interface <b>506</b>, the address information is extracted and is processed. The processing module <b>900</b> of the processing node A determines whether the address of its parent node B is part of the address information. Thus, the processing module <b>900</b> examines ADD<b>4</b>, because the processing node A is in layer L2and all layer L2sub-networks SN<b>3</b> and SN<b>5</b> have parents in the above sub-networks in layer L3and the address of processing nodes <b>500</b> in layer L3is ADD<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In this example, ADD<b>4</b> has a value that is the address of processing node C, thus ADD<b>4</b> is not the address of processing node B. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for this example, a modulated carrier signal is generated and sent to the parent processing node B through port <b>803</b>. The processing module of processing node B demodulates the carrier signal and processes the address ADD<b>4</b> of the communication data to determine to which processing node <b>500</b> in the sub-network SN<b>4</b> of the layer L3to send the communication signal. Since the sub-network SN<b>4</b> is in the top layer L3of the network <b>500</b>, there is no layer above it and the address ADD<b>4</b> corresponds to the address for a processing node <b>500</b> in the sub-network SN<b>4</b> of layer L3. In the present example, a modulated carrier signal is generated and sent to processing node C in sub-network SN<b>4</b>. The modulated carrier signal is passed through the medium interfaces <b>510</b> of all intervening processing nodes <b>500</b> without processing until the modulated carrier signal is received by the processing node C.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When processing node C receives the carrier signal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the carrier signals are passed by the filter <b>807</b> of the medium interface <b>510</b> to the port <b>806</b> and hence, to the processing module <b>900</b> of processing node C. The processing node C then reads the address ADD<b>3</b>, determines that it corresponds to an address for processing node D, and generates a modulated carrier signal having a frequency/wavelength assigned to processing node D. The modulated carrier signal is transmitted to the processing node D via the input/output interface <b>520</b> and the interface <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Processing node D receives the modulated carrier signal via the interface <b>504</b> and input port <b>804</b>. The medium interface outputs the modulated carrier signal via output port <b>806</b> to the processing module <b>900</b> of processing node D. The processing module <b>900</b> performs processing on the received carrier signal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The processing module of the processing node D reads address information ADD<b>2</b>, determines that it corresponds to the processing node E and generates a modulated carrier signal and sends the modulated carrier signal through the input/output interface <b>520</b> and the interface <b>506</b> to route the communication signal to the processing node E. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the processing node E reads address ADD<b>1</b>, determines that the address corresponds to a user device X, and outputs the communication signals to the user device X. It should be noted that when a processing node <b>500</b> receives a communication signal from an above sub-network processing node <b>500</b>, the communication signal has already been determined to be one, that is to be processed by the receiving processing node <b>500</b>. Thus, the receiving processing node <b>500</b> of a communication signal from an above sub-network need not read its own address field but only needs to read the address for the below sub-network processing node or child device.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">If the user device <b>101</b> called a user device <b>103</b>, then when the processing node A receives a modulated carrier signal having address ADD<b>4</b> which corresponds to an address for the parent processing node B in the sub-network SN<b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the processing module <b>900</b> of the processing node A determines that the carrier signal is destined for another processing node in the same sub-network SN<b>3</b>. The processing module <b>900</b> of the processing node A processes the address ADD<b>3</b> to determine to which processing node in the sub-network SN<b>3</b> to route the communication signals. The processing module <b>900</b> then generates a modulated carrier signal having a frequency/wavelength assigned to the designated processing node <b>500</b>, in this case processing node Q.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The processing module <b>900</b> of processing node Q then receives the modulated carrier signal, demodulates the carrier signal to obtain the address information, and processes the addresses. The processing module <b>900</b> then processes the address ADD<b>2</b> to determine to which processing node <b>500</b> in sub-network SN<b>2</b> of the lower layer L1to route the communication signals. In this case, the processing node <b>500</b> in sub-network SN<b>2</b> is the processing node R. The processing module <b>900</b> then generates a modulated carrier signal and sends the carrier signal to processing node R through port input/output interface <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The processing module <b>900</b> of processing node R then processes address ADD<b>1</b> to determine to which user device to send the communication signal, in this case user device T. In this way, user device <b>101</b> may send communication signals to user device <b>103</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">If the user device <b>101</b> enters a destination address for the user device <b>109</b>, a similar process as discussed above occurs except the destination address may not specify ADD<b>2</b> because the user device <b>109</b> is coupled directly to processing node K. ADD<b>2</b> may be set to a predetermined pattern such as all “1s” for a “place holder,” for example. Thus, destination addresses of communication signals that are destined to the user device <b>109</b> have address information of the form “B,K, . . . P.” When ADD<b>2</b> is determined to be “. . . ,” the processing node K sends the communication signals to the user device <b>109</b>. Similarly, if a communication signal is destined to the user device <b>113</b>, the address information would have the form “O, . . . , . . . , M.”</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">If a received communication signal has a frequency/wavelength that has been predetermined to be an express frequency/wavelength, the above address processing is only performed by the processing node <b>500</b> to which the express frequency/wavelength is assigned. Thus, as previously described, no processing is performed on the express communication signals until they are received by their intended processing node <b>500</b>. The medium interfaces <b>510</b> of each of the processing nodes <b>500</b> of the network <b>700</b> pass the communication signals without processing until the communication signals are received by the designated processing node <b>500</b>. Once the designated processing node <b>500</b> receives the communication signals, the designated processing node <b>500</b> performs similar address processing on the communication signals to determine how to route them to the appropriate child device.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As demonstrated by the above example, communication signals are routed by a combination of the operation of the medium interface <b>510</b> and local address processing by each of the processing nodes <b>500</b>. Thus, each of the processing nodes <b>500</b> only need provide processing power for local addresses and thus, greater processing node efficiency is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, each sub-network has designated linking processing nodes that link the sub-network to above and below sub-networks. With this architecture, when a processing node <b>500</b> in a sub-network requires that the communication be routed to a sub-network in an above or below layer, the processing node <b>500</b> generates and sends a modulated carrier signal having a frequency/wavelength assigned to the appropriate linking processing node. Once the linking processing node receives the modulated carrier signal, the carrier signal is demodulated and the address information is processed in a manner similar to that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">For example, in a case where user device <b>101</b> wishes to communicate with user device <b>107</b>, the communication signals are routed:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">

        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0128">(8) from processing node E to a user device <b>107</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0129">Any of the above communication routing links 1-8 may be designated as “express” and processing by the processing modules <b>900</b> of the processing nodes <b>500</b> in the designated links may be bypassed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0130">While the above description assumes that the entire above address or each of the addresses ADD<b>1</b>, ADD<b>2</b>, ADD<b>3</b> and ADD<b>4</b> are processed without modification, processing these addresses may be performed before use, to correspond to network topologies more complex than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. For example, there may be more than one above sub-network corresponding to any one sub-network so that communication signals have a plurality of possible communication pathways to traverse. Such an architecture would allow multiple communication pathways in the event that one or more pathways are congested.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows an example of a sub-network organization in which each below sub-network SN<b>102</b>, SN<b>104</b>, SN<b>106</b> and SN<b>108</b> has at least one above sub-network SN<b>110</b>, SN<b>112</b> and SN<b>114</b>, and the sub-networks SN<b>110</b>, SN<b>112</b> and SN<b>114</b>, likewise, may have more than one above sub-networks SN<b>120</b> and SN<b>122</b>. In this example, below sub-network SN<b>102</b> is associated with two above sub-networks SN<b>110</b> and SN<b>112</b>, below sub-network SN<b>104</b> is associated with above sub-network SN<b>114</b>, below sub-network SN<b>106</b> is associated with above sub-networks SN<b>112</b> and SN<b>122</b>, and below sub-network SN<b>108</b> is associated with above sub-networks SN<b>112</b> and SN<b>114</b>. The below sub-network SN<b>102</b> may send communication signals to either one of sub-networks SN<b>110</b> or SN<b>112</b> based on network conditions such as network congestion, for example. If the above sub-network SN<b>112</b> is experiencing heavy traffic, the processing node <b>500</b> in the below sub-network SN<b>102</b> may direct a greater amount of communication signals to the above sub-network SN<b>110</b>. In this way, load balancing of communication signal processing may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0132">As a specific example using the network organization of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, consider a communication between a user device associated with a processing node <b>500</b> in the sub-network SN<b>102</b> and a user device associated with a processing node <b>500</b> in the sub-network SN<b>108</b>. Normally, communication signals between these two user devices are routed from sub-network SN<b>102</b> to above sub-network SN<b>112</b> and then to below sub-network SN<b>108</b> using communication pathways P<b>106</b> and P<b>116</b> because these are the shortest pathways, for example. However, if above sub-network SN<b>112</b> is experiencing heavy traffic, the processing node <b>500</b> in sub-network SN<b>102</b> may direct, through proper addressing and carrier signal frequency/wavelength assignment, the communication signals to above sub-network SN<b>110</b>, SN<b>120</b>, SN<b>114</b> and SN<b>108</b> via communication pathways P<b>100</b>, P<b>102</b>, P<b>110</b> and P<b>118</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0133">The address processing for the above example may be as follows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.20</figref> shows the address fields that correspond to sub-network levels L(N), L(N+1), L(N+2) and L(N+3). ADD<b>1</b> may correspond to an address of sub-networks that are in the level L(N) which are below the sub-networks SN<b>102</b>-SN<b>108</b> of level L(N+1), ADD<b>2</b> may correspond to an address of sub-networks SN<b>102</b>-SN<b>108</b> which are below sub-networks SN<b>110</b>-SN<b>114</b> of level L(N+2), ADD<b>3</b> may correspond to an address of sub-networks SN<b>110</b>-SN<b>114</b> which are below sub-networks of level L(N+3), and ADD<b>4</b> may correspond to an address of sub-networks SN<b>120</b>-SN<b>122</b> of level L(N+3). When sub-network SN<b>102</b> receives communication signals from child devices, the processing module of SN<b>102</b> first applies a masking process to the destination address <b>1200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The masking allows the entire above address to be examined to determine proper routing of the communication signals rather than just the immediate above address.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0134">The destination address is divided into three portions <b>1202</b>, <b>1204</b> and <b>1206</b>. the first portion <b>1202</b> includes addresses of all levels of above sub-networks that are above the sub-network SN<b>102</b>; the second portion <b>1204</b> is the address ADD<b>3</b> and the third portion is the address ADD<b>2</b>. Thus, the first address portion <b>1202</b> is obtained by masking the destination address <b>1200</b> with a mask <b>1208</b> that includes all “1s” starting with a leftmost address bit down to and including ADD<b>4</b> and “0s” elsewhere. Once the first address portion <b>1202</b> is obtained, the process module <b>900</b> of the sub-network SN<b>102</b> searches a database <b>1220</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, for an entry that matches the first address portion <b>1202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0135">The database <b>1220</b> includes all valid first portion addresses where each valid first portion address corresponds to an entry <b>1222</b>-<b>1226</b>. Each of the entries <b>1222</b>-<b>1226</b> includes fields <b>1230</b>-<b>1234</b>. The field <b>1230</b> identifies the valid first portion address 1−M where M is an integer and fields <b>1232</b>-<b>1234</b> may indicate information relating each of the valid first portion addresses <b>1222</b>-<b>1226</b>. For example, the field <b>1232</b> may indicate the congestion level, and the field <b>1234</b> may indicate an operational status of each of the valid first portion addresses <b>1222</b>-<b>1226</b>. The information in the database <b>1220</b> may be shared among the processing nodes <b>500</b> via a network that is separate from the network <b>700</b> or the network <b>700</b> may be used. If the network <b>700</b> is used, special fields may be added to specifically that the communication signal is network related and not communication signals among child devices. For example, all address of below sub-networks/child device may be set to a fixed reserved pattern such as “1 . . . 1” to indicate that the communication signal is directed to the processing node of the lowest level sub-network addressed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0136">The database <b>1220</b> may be further organized into blocks <b>1240</b>-<b>1242</b> of entries where all the entries within each block may be substituted for each other. For example communication signals having a first portion address that corresponds to the first portion address <b>1222</b> may also be destined to first portion address <b>1224</b>. The structure of the network <b>700</b> is configured so that all the sub-networks reachable via the above sub-networks of the first portion address <b>1222</b> is also reachable via the above sub-networks of the first portion address <b>1224</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the first portion address that includes SN<b>112</b> and SN<b>120</b> is also reachable via the first portion address that includes SN<b>110</b> and SN<b>120</b>. Thus, the above first portions addresses may be in a same block in the database <b>1220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0137">Returning to the example, after the information relating to the first address portion <b>1222</b> of the communication signal is retrieved, the procession module <b>900</b> of sub-network SN<b>102</b> determines whether the communication signal should be set to the addressed above sub-network or other possible above sub-networks that in the same block <b>1240</b>-<b>1242</b> of the database <b>1220</b>. For this example, the field <b>1232</b> corresponding to the first portion address of SN<b>112</b> indicates heavy congestion and the field <b>1232</b> corresponding to SN<b>110</b> does not indicate congestion. Thus, the processing module <b>900</b> replaces the first portion address that was received from the child device with a new first portion address and redirects the communication signal to an appropriate processing node <b>500</b> of the sub-network SN<b>110</b>. In this way, traffic load of the network <b>700</b> may be balanced without compromising local address processing that achieves processing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is an exemplary block diagram of the processing module <b>900</b> of the processing node <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the processing module <b>900</b> includes a medium interface <b>510</b>, a transmitter <b>902</b>, a receiver <b>903</b>, a controller <b>904</b>, a memory <b>905</b>, a database <b>906</b>, an input/output interface <b>520</b>, a frequency/wavelength assignor <b>909</b> and a buffer queue manager <b>910</b>. These elements are in communication with one another via the bus <b>907</b> or other connection type. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is only an exemplary block diagram of the processing module <b>900</b> and is not meant to limit the invention to any one architecture. Other architectures are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0139">When communication signals are routed to the processing node <b>500</b> from an above or a same sub-network, the communication signals are received by the receiver <b>903</b> through the medium interface <b>510</b> of the processing node <b>500</b>. The receiver <b>903</b> stores the communication signals in the memory <b>905</b> based on commands of the buffer queue manager <b>910</b>. The buffer queue manager <b>910</b> may manage communication signal data corresponding to the received communication signals according to any number of buffer management schemes such as based on a priority of the communication signals. The priority scheme may assign priorities to the received communication signals based on various factors including the source of the communication signals, processing load, and the like. Once communication signal data is determined to be next in the queue by the buffer queue manager <b>910</b>, the controller <b>904</b> performs processing on the communication signal data and sends the communication signal data to appropriate destination below sub-networks or child devices.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0140">Communication signals, that are not assigned express frequencies/wavelengths, from user devices or from lower layer processing nodes are received through the input/output interface <b>520</b> and are stored in memory <b>905</b> in the same manner as described above. Alternatively, express communication signals are routed via communication links <b>532</b> and <b>534</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to and from the medium interface <b>510</b> and bypass the processing module <b>900</b> altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0141">The controller <b>904</b> performs processing on the address information of the communication signal data in the manner set forth above. Specifically, the controller <b>904</b> reads the appropriate address information ADD<b>1</b>, ADD<b>2</b>, ADD<b>3</b>, ADD<b>4</b> from the appropriate address fields <b>1101</b>-<b>1104</b>. The controller <b>904</b> compares this address information to information stored in database <b>906</b>. The database <b>906</b> stores information that identifies the processing nodes of the sub-network to which the present processing node belongs, processing nodes of the sub-network immediately below the present processing node, and the parent processing node in the sub-network immediately above the present processing node.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">Depending on the results of the comparison, the controller <b>904</b> instructs the transmitter <b>902</b> to transmit, through the medium interface <b>510</b>, the communication signal data to another processing node in the same sub-network, the parent processing node in the layer above the current layer, or a processing node in a layer below the current layer through the input/output interface <b>520</b>. The frequency/wavelength assignor <b>909</b> assigns a frequency/wavelength to the communication signals that are to be transmitted by the transmitter <b>902</b> based on which processing node is to receive the communication signals or whether the communication signals are to be sent to the parent processing node.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is an exemplary flowchart of the operation of the processing module <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.

The receiver <b>903</b> or input/output interface <b>520</b> receives the communication signal and extracts the communication signal data including the address information from the communication signal. Control proceeds to step <b>1602</b> where the communication signal data is forwarded to the buffer queue manager <b>910</b> which stores the communication signal data in memory <b>905</b> according to a prioritization scheme, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0144">Next, in step <b>1603</b>, the controller <b>904</b> reads the next signal data from the memory <b>905</b> and processes the address information to determine where the communication signal is to be routed.

If so, the controller <b>904</b> goes to step <b>1605</b>; otherwise, the controller <b>904</b> goes to step <b>1607</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0145">In step <b>1605</b>, the controller <b>904</b> instructs the frequency/wavelength assignor <b>909</b> to assign a frequency/wavelength for the communication signal based on the processing node to which the communication signal is to be sent.
