<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure is generally related to organizers for storage, and more particularly to an adjustable and reconfigurable organizer system for closets and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Storage organizers, shelving units, and other storage systems are known in the art. Some are adjustable and can be arranged and configured in various ways prior to or during installation, within a storage space such as a closet. However, such systems typically cannot be readjusted or easily rearranged after installation. Further, only portions of these systems and organizers are adjustable, such as with respect to the number of shelves and/or shelf location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many examples of shelving systems are known to have vertical risers with multiple perforations provided therein. Once the risers are installed on a wall surface, shelf mounting brackets are mounted on the risers where a shelf is desired. The brackets are provided with hooks shaped for being received in the perforations. The hooks are typically L-shaped such that when received in the perforations, the hooks hold the bracket in the installed position. The brackets are typically designed for a shelf to either merely rest directly on the bracket top surface, or be fastened to the bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Known storage organizers are not typically provided with different types of storage structures. A typical shelving unit comes with shelves and the hardware to mount shelves. Conventional storage organizers are not designed or configured to accommodate different types of storage structures and accessories in the same unit.</p>

The accessories can be mounted easily and directly to the basic system. The accessories can also be arranged in a wide variety of configurations as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The organizer system and features disclosed herein solve many known problems with existing storage systems in units. The disclosed organizer system can be arranged to accommodate virtually any storage need, to fit in virtually any storage space that is at least large enough to install the minimum basic components, and can be customized utilizing the disclosed or other accessories to store virtually any item. The organizer system disclosed herein can be utilized in closets where it would be particularly well suited. However, the storage system can be mounted in virtually any space that can be used for storage, such as a shed, a laundry room, a basement corner, a garage, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally illustrates a storage unit or organizer system <b>30</b> constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The organizer system <b>30</b> generally has a number of basic components including a length adjustable, horizontal top rail assembly <b>32</b>. As described below, the top rail assembly <b>32</b> can be expanded laterally from a minimum length of a single rail component to virtually any length desired utilizing two or more rail components. The system <b>30</b> also has a plurality of vertical uprights <b>34</b> mounted to and suspended from the top rail assembly <b>32</b>. Two or more of the uprights can be mounted laterally spaced apart and extending downward from the top rail assembly <b>32</b>. The uprights are adapted to support the various components of the system and can be adapted to extend over a variety of vertical heights or lengths as explained below. The disclosed organizer system <b>30</b> also includes a plurality of shelf mounting brackets <b>36</b> mounted to the uprights at desired locations. The system further has a plurality of wire shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> supportable by the mounting brackets <b>36</b>. The shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> provide for width adjustment from a minimum width of a single shelf to virtually any width desired utilizing two or more shelf components also as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition to the basic system components noted above, the disclosed organizer system <b>30</b> also can include a plurality of optional accessories. The basic system can be adapted for mounting one or more optional clothes hanging rods <b>42</b>. The system can be further adapted to accommodate one or more additional optional accessories such as storage baskets <b>44</b>, shoe racks <b>46</b>, shoe shelves <b>48</b>, vertically oriented side sliders <b>50</b>, or the like. Though not disclosed or described herein, any number of other accessories can be provided for use with and mounting directly on the basic system or indirectly via another optional accessory. Further, though the shelves are described as basic system components, the system can also be configured using only one or more storage accessories mounted to the uprights with no shelves installed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the top rail assembly <b>32</b> is formed, in this example, having a plurality of substantially rigid support rail segments <b>60</b> constructed for mounting to a wall or other mounting surface. The top rail assembly <b>32</b> also includes, in this example, a plurality of decorative covers <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>that attach to the support rail segments <b>60</b>. Aside from use as a decorative feature covering the support rail <b>60</b>, the covers <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>also are used in the disclosed example as spacers for assisting a consumer in assembling and installing the system. The covers come in at least two lengths including at least one initial cover <b>62</b><i>a </i>and plural intermediate covers <b>62</b><i>b</i>. The purpose and function of the different length initial and intermediate covers are discussed below in greater detail. Though the materials and construction of the support rail <b>60</b> and the covers <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>can vary, in one example, the support rail <b>60</b> is a metal structural component and the covers are plastic decorative components.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each support rail segment <b>60</b> has a mounting section <b>63</b> that is generally planar and extends the length of the support rail and defines its bottom edge and part of the rail height. The rail segments <b>60</b> are adapted to mount the top rail assembly <b>32</b> to a mounting surface. The mounting section of each segment <b>60</b> has a plurality of openings <b>64</b>, which in this example are spaced 1 inch apart over the length of each rail segment. Fasteners of any type can be used to mount the rail segments to a mounting surface. The invention is not to be limited to any particular type of mounting used for the rail segments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each rail segment also has a step <b>65</b> and a support leg <b>66</b> extending upward from the step. In this example, the support leg <b>66</b> is generally parallel to the mounting section <b>63</b> but spaced in a different plane. When mounted to a surface, the support leg is spaced forward from the mounting surface creating a gap G. This gap and the support leg <b>66</b> support the uprights <b>34</b> in this example. Other non-linear segmented configurations of the rail segments <b>60</b> can also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each cover <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>be in this example has a downwardly extending mounting flange <b>67</b> that is spaced rearward from a body <b>68</b> of the cover and extends over its length. The flange can be continuous or can be segmented into a number of discrete tabs if desired. The flange <b>67</b> is hooked over the mounting leg <b>66</b> of a rail segment <b>60</b> and received in the gap G when installed. The body <b>68</b> is sized in this example to cover the exposed rail segments and fasteners. As shown in one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cover body <b>68</b> can be define a flat front facing surface <b>69</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the body can define a curved surface. As will be evident to those having ordinary skill in the art, the cover can be of virtually any configuration or construction and perform the aesthetic purpose of hiding the rail segments <b>60</b> and fasteners. Decorative features can also be added to the front facing surface to achieve virtually any desired appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the top rail <b>32</b> is length adjustable by placing two adjacent rail segments <b>60</b> in an overlapping relationship. Depending upon the amount of overlap of the tow two segments, their combined length can be selected. Adding additional segments permits creating a longer top rail. Any top rail <b>32</b> length, from one segment length or longer, can be achieved as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the uprights <b>34</b>, in one example, are provided as a plurality of upright segments including upper segments <b>70</b>, adapted for attaching to the top rail segments <b>60</b>, and supplemental segments <b>72</b> adapted for connection to the upper segments <b>70</b> and to each other. Utilizing an upper segment <b>70</b> or a combination of one upper segment and one or more supplemental segments in series permits achieving a suitable upright length or height for a given storage application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each upper segment <b>70</b> in one example is shorter in length than the supplemental segments <b>72</b>. Each of the supplemental segments <b>72</b> is of the same length. However, different length variations can be utilized such as providing all segments of the same length, upper segment being longer than the supplemental segments, or a variety of different length segments.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each of the upright segments <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> is, in this example, a U-shaped channel with two side surfaces <b>74</b> and a forward facing or front surface <b>76</b>. Pairs of laterally spaced apart apertures <b>78</b> are provided in the front surface and oriented in a longitudinal direction and spaced apart over the length of the segments. The front surface <b>76</b> of each segment also includes a pair fastener openings <b>79</b>, one each space from an end of the segment in this example. The segments can be secured to or at least retained in position against a mounting surface utilizing fasteners received through these openings <b>79</b>. The upper segments may only have a single opening <b>79</b> near a lower end <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this example, each of the shorter upper segments <b>70</b> includes a cut out section <b>82</b> in the free edge <b>81</b> of each of the opposed the side surfaces <b>74</b> adjacent a top end <b>84</b> of the segments. The cut outs <b>82</b> mirror one another and have an upward portion with a downwardly extending tab <b>86</b> defining an upward extending notch <b>88</b>. The tab is hooked over the support leg <b>66</b> of a rail segment <b>60</b> for securing the segment to the top rail <b>32</b>. The remaining portion of the cutout can be configured to follow the contour of the top rail segments <b>60</b>. The notch can be sized to create a slight friction fit between the upright segment <b>70</b> and the rail segment <b>60</b> when assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lower end <b>80</b> of the upper segments and each end of the supplemental segments <b>72</b> also include similar but smaller cutouts <b>90</b> in the free edge of the side surfaces <b>74</b>. Each of these cut outs is an L-shaped opening also defining a notch <b>92</b> the extends in a direction toward its respective segment end. As shown, when two segments are abutted together, whether it be two segments <b>72</b> or one segment <b>72</b> with the bottom end of a segment <b>70</b>, the notches <b>92</b> extend toward one another.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Clips <b>93</b> are disclosed herein for securing two adjacent and end-to-end abutting upright segments together. Each clip <b>93</b> has an elongate body <b>94</b>, a pair of identically curved J-shaped hooks <b>95</b>, one at each end of the body, and a bearing plate <b>96</b>. The bearing plate <b>96</b> extends from one edge of the clip body <b>94</b> and is oriented perpendicular thereto. The hooks <b>95</b> are shaped to be received one each in one of the notches of the abutting segments. When fully installed, the bearing plate <b>96</b> will bear against a portion of the side surface <b>74</b> of each segment. The clip will loosely hold the two segments in end-to-end engagement until fasteners are used to secure the segments to the mounting surface. The side surface free edges at the ends of the abutting segments define recessed portions <b>91</b> recessed toward the front surface so that the clip <b>93</b> will rest flush with the free edges. Holes <b>97</b> in the clips <b>93</b> align with the corresponding openings <b>79</b> in each abutting segment to facilitate installation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> are essentially identical in construction, except that they are slightly different in relative size. Each of the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> is essentially identical in structure has a side-to-side length or width and a shelf depth from forward to rear end. Each shelf in the disclosed example has a pair of elongate wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b> that are the forward end wires. The wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b> are spaced vertically apart and parallel to one another and extend the length or width of the shelf. The spacing of these two wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b> define a shelf height. In the disclosed example, each shelf also includes an elongate single wire <b>102</b> that is the rear end wire. The rear end wire also extends along the shelf length, is generally parallel to the wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>, and defines a rear end of the shelf. The gap between the upper most wire <b>100</b> of the front wires and the rear wire <b>102</b> defines the depth of the shelf. The length of the wires <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, and <b>102</b> generally define a length or width of the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each shelf <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> also has a plurality of closely spaced apart transverse wires <b>104</b> positioned in this example generally perpendicular or normal to the elongate wires <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, and <b>102</b>. These wires <b>104</b> are at one end attached to the rear wire <b>102</b>, such as by welding, and extend forwardly from the rear wire. These wires <b>104</b> in this example are then bent at a forward end over the upper most front wire <b>100</b> downward toward and connect to the lower front wire <b>98</b>. The forward end of the wire <b>104</b> is attached to each of the wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>, also such as by welding. The wires <b>104</b> are described herein as being transverse to the longitudinal direction and are therefore identified as the transverse wires, though they extend front to back relative to the shelf orientation. These transverse wires <b>104</b> define a support surface <b>108</b> on which items can be stored on the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the smaller shelves <b>38</b> are sized to fit within the larger shelves <b>40</b>. Thus, portions of two adjacent shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> can overlap one another. The transverse wires <b>104</b> of overlapped shelves will sit side by side in the same plane. The rear wires <b>102</b> of overlapped shelves will sit horizontally adjacent one another, as will the front wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. With this construction, a shelf can be constructed using alternating shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> that has virtually any length or width from a minimum of one single shelf length or width to any longer length. For each shelf <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>, the bent portions of the wires <b>104</b> depend downward and, together with the wires <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>, provide structural rigidity to the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the majority of the construction of the shelf mounting brackets <b>36</b>. Each bracket <b>36</b> has a generally triangular configuration in side profile with a rear end <b>110</b> and a forward end <b>112</b>. The rear end <b>110</b> is taller than the forward end <b>112</b> to form a buttress-like shelf supporting structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bracket <b>36</b> in the disclosed example has a generally tall and thin U-shaped configuration with an open top and a closed bottom. A pair of spaced apart sides <b>114</b> of the bracket <b>36</b> are connected along an integral bottom surface <b>116</b>. Each side <b>114</b> has a back edge <b>118</b> defining part of the bracket back end <b>110</b>. A pair of vertically spaced apart and downwardly extending L-shaped hooks extend from each back edge <b>118</b>. Thus, as can be gleaned from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each bracket <b>36</b> includes a pair of laterally spaced upper hooks <b>120</b> and a pair of laterally spaced lower hooks <b>121</b> at the rear end <b>110</b> of the bracket. The placement of the hooks correspond in lateral spacing and in vertical spacing to the positioning of the apertures <b>78</b> in the vertical uprights <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each bracket <b>36</b> in the disclosed example includes a pair of forwardly extending fingers <b>122</b>, one each extending from a forward edge <b>124</b> of a respective side <b>114</b> of the bracket. A top surface <b>126</b> of the fingers <b>122</b> defines a shelf support for the shelves as described below. As will be evident to those having ordinary skill in the art, the material for forming the brackets <b>36</b> can vary and yet fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. In one example, the brackets <b>36</b> are formed from flat metal sheets, stamped to include optional structural ribs, ridges, or depressions (not shown) in the sides <b>114</b>, and then bent to form the bottom <b>116</b> and the spaced apart sides <b>114</b>. The brackets can then be suitably plated, painted, or otherwise coated as desired to achieve a particular surface finish and esthetic appearance. Alternatively, the brackets can be constructed as a solid piece, as a bent metal welded structure, as a plastic molded structure, or any other suitable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a locking clip <b>132</b> is installed in each bracket <b>36</b> in this example. Each locking clip <b>132</b> generally has a clip body in U-shaped configuration with a pair of upstanding sidewalls <b>134</b>, a bottom wall <b>136</b>, and a wire receiving, open ended channel <b>138</b> defined between the sidewalls. In this example, each sidewall <b>134</b> also has a laterally outward projecting elongate rib <b>140</b>. Each bracket side <b>114</b> has a corresponding elongate slot <b>142</b> that is greater in length than each of the ribs <b>140</b>. The clip is inserted through the open top between the sidewalls <b>114</b> in the bracket <b>36</b> with the open top of the channel <b>138</b> facing upward. Each rib <b>140</b> is received in a corresponding one of the slots <b>142</b>. Because the ribs are shorter in length than the slots, the clip can slide back and forth relative to the bracket. Each clip <b>132</b> also has a pair of rearward extending projections <b>144</b>, one from each sidewall <b>134</b>. When installed, the projections <b>144</b> face toward the rear end <b>110</b> of the bracket <b>36</b>. Each clip can further have a pair of detent ridges <b>146</b> that extend inwardly toward one another into the channel, one each from each sidewall <b>134</b> at the channel opening.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The previously described components of the system <b>30</b> are the basic components of the organizer system. In one example, to assemble a bare bones organizer system in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, one would require two upper upright segments <b>70</b>, one top rail segment <b>60</b>, two shelf brackets <b>36</b>, and one shelf <b>38</b> or <b>40</b>. The single top rail segment <b>60</b> can be mounted horizontally level to a mounting surface and secured by conventional fasteners through the openings <b>64</b> to that surface. The two upper segments <b>70</b> can then be suspended from the top rail by hooking the tabs <b>86</b> of the cutouts <b>82</b> over the rail support leg <b>63</b> and suspended therefrom. If desired, one or more fasteners can be utilized through the available fasteners openings <b>79</b> in the uprights <b>70</b> to further secure the uprights to the mounting surface in a vertical orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The L-shaped hooks <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> of a bracket <b>36</b> can be placed in selected apertures <b>78</b> in the upright segments <b>70</b>. First, a bracket <b>36</b> is held horizontally and moved toward an upright segment <b>70</b>. Once the L-shaped hooks <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> are passed into and through the selected apertures <b>78</b>, the mounting bracket <b>36</b> can be dropped or pushed downward into position such that the hooks <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>, and corresponding notches formed thereby, interlock with the material of the upright <b>70</b> beneath the selected apertures. The second bracket <b>36</b> can be similarly mounted to the second short segment <b>70</b> at the same elevation. A shelf is then positioned over the mounting brackets such that one of the transverse wires <b>104</b> is captured between the fingers <b>121</b> of each bracket <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the same transverse shelf wire <b>104</b> is also received in the channel <b>138</b> of the clip <b>132</b> near the rear wire <b>102</b>. The clip is in the unlocked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. The wire <b>104</b> in this example is snapped through the detent ridges <b>146</b> and into the channel <b>138</b>. When the shelf <b>38</b> is dropped into position, the bracket clip <b>132</b> is then slid rearwardly such that the tabs <b>144</b> pass into the adjacent apertures <b>78</b> in the respective upright <b>70</b>. The channel <b>138</b> depth and tab <b>144</b> length is such that, when the wire <b>104</b> is fully seated, the tabs will overlie the wire <b>102</b> when locked. The tabs <b>144</b> and slots <b>142</b> are of such a length that they will do so whether one shelf is present at the bracket or two overlapped shelves, and thus two rear wires, are present. The clip <b>132</b> and the fingers <b>122</b> at least loosely secure the shelf in place. The shelf can thus not be easily lifted from this installed position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example, to assemble a larger scale organizer system, two or more of the top rail segments <b>60</b> can be assembled overlapping one another over at least a portion of their respective lengths to achieve a desired length for a completed top rail <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a string or series of top rail segments <b>60</b> can be extended across a width of a storage space. One end of a first segment <b>60</b> can be horizontally oriented and abutted, if desired, against a wall adjacent the mounting surface. Additional segments <b>60</b> can then be horizontally overlapped to achieve the desired length. The top rail segments <b>60</b> can then be secured utilizing conventional fasteners through the openings <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this example, the covers <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are utilized. A first one of the covers <b>62</b><i>a </i>(i.e., the short cover) is then secured, as described above, to the first installed top rail segment <b>60</b> abutting the adjacent wall of the storage space. In one example, this cover <b>62</b><i>a </i>is about six (6) inches in length. A first one of the upper upright segments <b>70</b> is then installed over the top rail <b>32</b> abutting the distal or exposed end of the short cover <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and thus is positioned about 6 inches from the adjacent wall. To achieve proper spacing of the remaining uprights <b>34</b> in this example, the longer covers <b>62</b><i>b </i>are utilized as spacers. In one example, each of the covers <b>62</b><i>b </i>is about twenty-three (23) inches long to provide 24 inch spacing (including the width of adjacent one inch wide uprights <b>34</b>) between uprights. Thus, the sequence for installing a larger scale organizer is to mount the top rail <b>32</b>, attach the short cover <b>62</b><i>a</i>, attach one of the upper upright segments <b>70</b>, and then in sequence attach a longer cover <b>62</b><i>b</i>, another upright segment <b>70</b>, repeating the sequence as needed. Once all the desired upper segments <b>70</b> are hung, they can be secured with fasteners as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The covers, shelves, and rails can be sized to require any desired standard spacing, and are not limited to any particular dimensions. The two-foot spacing described herein is simply for illustration purposes. Further, as will be evident to those having ordinary skill in the art, not all storage spaces will permit the same two-foot spacing (as used in this example) between every adjacent upright. The disclosed invention is highly adjustable to accommodate this problem without requiring cutting of shelves, rail segments, uprights, or any other part. Where a smaller spacing is required (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, right hand side), the overlapping capability of the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> and the rail segments <b>60</b>, each described earlier, permits adjusting the components to fit virtually any space larger that a minimum one shelf width space.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">To complete installation of the larger scale organizer system <b>30</b>, additional supplemental upright segments <b>72</b> are then installed as described above to the previously mounted shorter upper segments <b>70</b> in order to provide a desired length for the vertical uprights <b>34</b>. Each upright <b>34</b> need not be the same length, depending upon the needs of a particular customized storage space. One or more of the interior or outer most uprights <b>34</b> can be shorter or longer in length to accommodate different storage space configurations as well as different configurations for the organizer unit.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A plurality of shelf mounting brackets <b>36</b> can then be attached where desired to the installed uprights <b>34</b>. Shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> can then be installed on the mounting brackets <b>36</b> as described above to complete the basic component installation. Where needed, a shelf <b>38</b> can be overlapped to any degree necessary by a shelf <b>40</b> to adjust shelf width or length to fit a given space. The construction of the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> permits any shelf width from a minimum width equal to a width of a single shelf <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> to any desired maximum width. The overlapping nature of the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> permits adjustment of a particular shelf to any length larger than the minimum and maximum. This is particularly useful where the maximum standard spacing of 23 inches between uprights can not be achieved in a given storage space. One or more of the uprights <b>34</b> may need to be installed closer to its adjacent upright, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, right hand side. A consumer need not cut any component of the system, other than a cover <b>62</b><i>b </i>to fit the smaller upright spacing. Instead, they can simply overlay a portion of one larger shelf <b>40</b> on top of an adjacent smaller shelf <b>38</b> to the degree necessary to provide the desired shelf width.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>10</b>, one example of an accessory that can be optionally added to the disclosed organizer system <b>30</b> is a clothes hanging rod <b>42</b>. In one example, the shelf mounting brackets <b>36</b> are provided with a pair of slots <b>150</b> in the bottom surface <b>116</b>. The slots <b>150</b> in this example are oriented in a longitudinal direction and spaced apart from one another in the bracket <b>36</b>. A rod mounting bracket <b>152</b> can be attached to each of the brackets <b>36</b> or to any one of the selected brackets as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, the rod support bracket <b>152</b> includes a bracket body having a J-shape with an elongate support arm <b>154</b> and a lower hook portion <b>156</b> that extends from a lower end of the support arm <b>154</b> and curves back upwardly in a direction toward the bracket <b>36</b> and in a forward direction relative to the bracket <b>36</b>. A distal end of the curved hook section <b>156</b> terminates at a curved, semi-cylindrical receiver <b>158</b> that, in the present example, is shaped to conform with a cylindrical clothes hanging rod configuration. The receiver can be integral to or attached, such as by welding, to the hook section <b>156</b> as needed. As will be evident to those having ordinary skill in the art, the receiver <b>158</b> can take on any number of configurations and constructions, and particularly, it is best to accommodate the particular shape of a clothes hanging rod. In this example, the rod <b>42</b> is a circular cylinder. Thus, the receiver provides a semi-cylindrical surface for supporting the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this example, each receiver is provided with a pair of through holes (not shown). A soft, flexible bearing insert <b>162</b> is provided having a shape that essentially mirrors that of the receiver <b>150</b> in this example. A bottom surface of the bearing insert <b>162</b> includes a pair of downwardly projecting plugs <b>164</b> that are sized to be forceably received through the holes <b>160</b> of the receiver to hold and retain the insert in the receiver. The receiver insert <b>162</b> is an optional component as well, but can be provided to permit flex in the system and to prevent wear of components bearing on one another. Further, the bearing insert <b>162</b> can help to eliminate scraping of surface to surface contact, such as between a metal rod and a metal receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">An upper end of the support arm has an upwardly projecting tab <b>166</b> positioned rearward of an upwardly projecting and forwardly extending L-shaped catch <b>168</b>. The catch <b>168</b> is configured to be received, with the bracket <b>152</b> positioned in a forward tilt, in a forward one of the slots <b>150</b> in the bottom of the shelf mounting bracket <b>36</b>. The bracket <b>152</b> is then rotated so that the tab <b>166</b> is received in the rearward slot <b>150</b> in the bracket <b>36</b>. The rod <b>42</b> weight and the geometry of the J-shaped bracket <b>152</b> causes the bracket to swing rearward and upward, which retains the rod bracket <b>152</b> in its installed orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, a plurality of the J-shaped brackets <b>152</b> can be installed from horizontally adjacent and spaced apart mounting brackets <b>36</b> in order to support a clothes hanging rod <b>42</b> in any location on the organizer system <b>30</b> desired. In the example disclosed herein, the clothes hanging rod <b>42</b> includes a pair of telescoping segments <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> so that the clothes rod can also be length adjustable between a length essentially equal to one of the two segments to a length of nearly the entirety of the two segments.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the disclosed example, the clothes hanging rod segments <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> are constructed from slightly different diameter hollow tubes that can telescope relative to one another. If needed, the open ends of the hollow tube segments <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> can be covered by decorative and/or safety caps <b>174</b>. The caps can be configured to secure in any known manner. For example, a circular ring can be provided on one end of each cap so that the caps fit snuggly over the exposed ends of the rod segments <b>170</b> and <b>172</b>. A clothes hanging rod <b>42</b> accessory can be installed spanning only a single shelf width or multiple shelf widths. Further, multiple rods <b>42</b> can be installed at more than one lateral position and/or more than one elevation in an organizer system disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b>, an example of another optional accessory is the storage basket accessory <b>44</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 11</figref> illustrate a pair of adjacent basket accessories <b>44</b>. Only one will be described herein. In this example, a pair of basket mounting brackets <b>180</b> are mounted to adjacent ones of the uprights <b>34</b>. Though not shown, the brackets <b>180</b> include a rear end <b>182</b> having vertically spaced apart pairs of attachment hooks constructed, in one example, identically to the hooks <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> of the shelf brackets <b>36</b>. The brackets <b>180</b> can thus be mounted at any location desired on the uprights.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As an option, each bracket <b>180</b> can have a roller-type sliding track <b>184</b> attached to an inner side facing the opposed bracket <b>180</b>. A basket support frame <b>186</b> in this example is suspended from or mounted to the slide track <b>184</b> of the bracket. In this example, the frame <b>186</b> is horizontally oriented and is a rectangular shaped tubular construction. Attachment tabs <b>188</b> are provided on the lateral sides of the support frame <b>186</b> for being received in slots <b>190</b> in the tracks <b>184</b>. When the frame <b>186</b> is pulled forward away from the mounting surface in the direction of the arrows, the tabs <b>188</b> stay in the slots <b>190</b> and draw the slide track forward making the basket accessory more accessible to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The storage basket accessory <b>44</b> also has a basket <b>192</b> suspended from the frame <b>186</b> in this example. The basket <b>192</b> has a perimeter side wall <b>194</b> and a bottom wall <b>196</b> defining a storage space with depth for storing items. The basket <b>192</b> can be made from woven fabric, mesh fabric, flexible plastic, substantially rigid plastic, or any other suitable material. A fabric or flexible basket <b>192</b> can include an optional rigid bottom panel (not shown) that sets on the bottom wall to conform and hold a desired shape of the storage space within the basket. No matter the construction, the frame <b>186</b> and/or the basket <b>192</b> must have a means for suspending the basket from the frame in this example. For a fabric basket, openable flaps can be formed on the upper edges of the basket <b>192</b> that can be received and secured over the tube frame. Any suitable means can be used to secure the flaps such as snaps, hook and loop fastener material, zippers, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As will be evident to those having ordinary skill in the art, the basket <b>192</b> and brackets <b>180</b> can alternatively be formed as a single integral component that mounts directly to one or more of the uprights. Alternatively, the basket can be formed as a simple structure, either rigid or flexible, that hooks onto or rests on a portion of the one or more simple mounting bars or rods that are suspended from one or more uprights <b>34</b>. The brackets <b>180</b> need not include a slide feature. As a further alterative, the mounting brackets can include a bearing surface over which a mating surface of a basket can slide. Such a basket can be slid along the brackets providing easier access to the storage space, and yet would be simple to manufacture, construct, and use because it would not include separate roller tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 13</figref>, an example of another optional accessory is the shoe tube or rack accessory <b>46</b>. The shoe rack <b>46</b> in this example is again illustrated as two adjacent, identical racks. Only one will be described. The shoe rack accessory <b>46</b> has a pair of laterally extending shoe supports <b>200</b>, one spaced rearward of the other. Each shoe support <b>200</b> has an upper heel stop bar <b>202</b> and a lower sole support bar <b>204</b> spaced rearward of and parallel to its corresponding upper heel stop bar. The distal ends of each bar <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are secured to opposed sub-frames <b>206</b>. Each sub-frame <b>206</b> is a rectangular shaped wire or tube having an upper rung <b>208</b> and a lower rung <b>210</b> spaced from the upper rung. The sub-frames are oriented in a vertical plane in this example with the longer dimension along a horizontal axis. The upper heel stop bars <b>202</b> are affixed to the upper rung <b>208</b> and the lower sole support bars <b>204</b> are affixed to the lower rung <b>210</b>. The bars can be welded to the sub-frames, or can have openings through which the sub-frame is received prior to closing the wire loop.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When a shoe is placed on the rack, the shoe heel should overhang the heel stop bar <b>202</b> and the shoe sole should rest on the support bar <b>204</b>. The position and height difference between the bars <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> tilt the shoe with the toe downward and toward the system mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each sub-frame <b>206</b> is affixed to a mounting bracket <b>212</b> which is in turn suspended from an upright <b>34</b>. The mounting brackets <b>212</b> can be any one of many different possible constructions. The brackets <b>212</b> illustrate another example of a suitable bracket construction adapted for use with the disclosed organizer system <b>30</b>. In this example, each bracket <b>212</b> has a frame <b>213</b> that is a larger rectangular wire tube than the sub-frames. The frames <b>213</b> are also oriented in a vertical plane with its long dimension horizontal. Each bracket frame <b>213</b> has a front vertical cross bar <b>214</b> to which one of the sub-frames is affixed, such as by welding. The cross bar <b>214</b> connects forward ends of upper and lower rungs <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> of the bracket frame <b>213</b>. A rear cross bar <b>220</b> connects rearward ends of the rungs <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to complete the frame <b>213</b> loop.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A bracket coupling has a sleeve <b>224</b> received over the rear cross bar <b>220</b>. A plate <b>226</b> extends rearward from the sleeve. Though not shown, the plate has a pair of vertically spaced hooks each identical to one of the hooks <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>. The hooks are attached as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to a single row pair of apertures <b>78</b> in an upright <b>34</b> for mounting the bracket <b>212</b>. Each bracket <b>212</b> and sub-frame <b>206</b> is identically mounted and constructed for each rack <b>46</b>. As with the basket accessory <b>44</b>, each rack <b>46</b> can be mounted to the uprights at any desired location along the uprights <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 14</figref>, an example of another optional accessory is the shoe shelf accessory <b>48</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 14</figref> illustrate that, in this example, the shoe shelf <b>46</b> includes one of each of the shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> utilized in an inverted and overlapped arrangement. The front ends and rear ends are in the same general position, but the shelf is inverted such that the forward wire <b>98</b> is positioned above the forward wire <b>100</b>. The bent portions of the transverse wires <b>104</b> now extend upward and in combination with the wire <b>98</b> define a shoe barrier <b>228</b> in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The shelf is supported in this example by a plurality of shoe shelf brackets <b>230</b>. Each bracket supports the rear end of the shelf at a higher elevation than the forward end. Thus, shoes stored on the shelf will be tilted toward a user and easily visible and accessible. However, the shoe barrier <b>228</b> prevents the shoes from sliding off of the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Each bracket <b>230</b> in this example has a wire formed support <b>232</b> with a forward end <b>234</b> that is upturned at an angle that corresponds to the tilt angle of the barrier <b>228</b>. A turned back tip <b>236</b> extends from the end of the upturned end <b>234</b> and captures the barrier portion of the shelf. The support <b>232</b> has a vertical wire connector <b>238</b> hung from or coupled to a bracket coupling <b>240</b> that is attached to an upright <b>34</b>. A shelf catch <b>242</b> extends upward from the coupling <b>240</b> and is spaced away from the front surface of the upright <b>34</b> creating a space. The rear shelf wire <b>102</b> is captured between the catch and the upright on top of the coupling to support the rear end of the shelf. Again, the coupling <b>240</b>, though not shown, has appropriate mounting hooks, such as the hooks <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> of the bracket, for mounting the coupling to an upright <b>34</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a pair of overlapped shelves <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> to illustrate that the shoe shelf accessory <b>46</b> is also adjustable in length or width as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, yet another example of an optional accessory is the vertical slider accessory <b>50</b>. In this example, the vertical slider <b>50</b> has a pair of elongate brackets <b>250</b> mounted and spaced vertically apart along the same upright <b>34</b>. Each bracket <b>250</b> again has hooks, though not shown, for suspending them from the upright. A vertical tubular frame <b>252</b> is configured in this example in a rectangle shape is suspended between the pair of brackets <b>250</b>. The frame <b>252</b> can be attached to the brackets <b>250</b> in any suitable manner. A fabric or mesh material <b>254</b> with storage receptacles <b>256</b> is suspended from the frame <b>252</b> within the frame interior space.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Though not shown herein, the brackets <b>250</b> can alternatively include slide tracks to permit the vertical accessory to be slid outward away from the mounting surface for easy access to the receptacles. Further, the storage receptacles can be replaced by a myriad of other storage options suspended from the accessory frame and/or brackets. The depicted accessory is only one of many possible arrangement. The vertical slider could be adapted to store books, magazines, ties, pants, tools, or many other types of objects as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-16B</figref> are provided to depict only a few of many different arrangements and configurations that can be achieved by the disclosed organizer system. The arrangement of shelves can be side by side or staggered. The clothes rod accessory <b>42</b> can be mounted to side by side shelves, staggered shelves, or only a single shelf. The organizer system and components are highly versatile, easily adjustable and re-adjustable before, during, or even after installation of the basic mounting components.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although certain organizer systems and methods have been disclosed and described herein in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure; the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all embodiments of the teachings of the disclosure that fairly fall within the scope of permissible equivalents.</p>
