<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a sheet processing apparatus aligning and stacking sheets and an image forming apparatus having this sheet processing apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In image forming apparatuses such as photocopiers and printers, conventionally, sheet S on which images are formed with an image forming apparatus body <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are temporarily stacked in a processing tray <b>140</b> in a sheet processing apparatus <b>100</b>, and the sheet S are then subject to a sheet post-processing such as alignment and stapling of the sheets. The sheet S on which the sheet post-processing is made are delivered in a bundled manner onto a stacking tray <b>400</b> having an inclined stacking surface by bundle delivering means <b>108</b>; the delivered sheet bundle S is moved by the self-weight over the inclined stacking surface of the stacking tray <b>400</b>; the rear ends of the sheet bundle is aligned at a rear end aligning wall. The stacking sheet number on the stacking tray <b>400</b> is depending on an up and down movable stroke of the stacking tray <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with the stacking tray <b>400</b> having the conventional inclined stacking surface, where sheet not so rigid or sheet having a strong downward curling in which the sheet end is bent toward the stacking surface side, are stacked, folding may occur due to the self-weight caused by the steep slope, so that there raises a problem that alignment property of stacking sheets may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the sheet bundle S on which the stapling processing is made are stacked on the stacking tray <b>400</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a staple H<b>1</b> of the sheet bundle S<b>1</b> already stacked on the stacking tray <b>400</b> may engage with a rear end of a sheet bundle S<b>2</b> delivered in a bundled manner, and therefore, the rear end of the sheet bundle S<b>2</b> may not slide down to the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, so that the stacked sheet bundles S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> are positionally shifted in the conveyance direction, thereby raising a problem on stacking alignment property.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus preventing stacked sheet bundles from positionally shifting in the conveyance direction and improving stacking alignment property of the sheet bundles.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to the drawings, hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the invention are described in detail in an exemplifying manner. The sizes, materials, and shapes of structural parts set forth in the following description, correlative positions of those, and the like can be modified properly according to the structure and the various conditions of the apparatus to which this invention applies, and are not intended to render the scope of the invention limited to those only.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The embodiment of the image forming apparatus having the sheet processing apparatus according to the invention are exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross section showing an image forming apparatus <b>30</b> mounting a sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross section showing the sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this embodiment, the sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is exemplified as the sheet processing apparatus. The sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b> is disposed at an upper portion of the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b> and at a lower portion of an original document reading apparatus <b>35</b>. With this sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b>, the sheet S, on which images are formed, delivered out of the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b> are stacked temporarily on a sheet tray <b>40</b>, and subject to a post-processing such as stapling and alignment. After the post-processing is made, the sheet (or sheet bundle) S after done with the post-processing are aligned at and stacked on a stacking tray <b>4</b> arranged as extending substantially horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This invention, however, is not limited to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That is, the sheet processing apparatus is not limited to the apparatus in which the sheet S delivered out of the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b>, on which images are formed, are aligned at and stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b>. For example, this invention is effective for an apparatus in which the sheet processing apparatus is directly connected to an image forming apparatus body <b>30</b> not through a processing means having a processing tray <b>40</b> or the like, or an apparatus in which the sheet processing apparatus is attached to the exterior of the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">[Brief Structure of the Image Forming Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, numeral <b>1</b> is a sheet processing apparatus mounted on the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b> according to this embodiment; an automatic original document reading apparatus <b>35</b> is mounted at an upper portion of the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b>. The sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b> can be not with any processing means constituted of the processing tray <b>40</b> or the like. The image forming apparatus body <b>30</b> is equipped with an image forming section constituted of such as a photosensitive drum <b>3</b>, a developing device <b>5</b>, a transfer belt <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b>, the original document by the automatic original document reading apparatus <b>35</b> is fed automatically to the reading position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and images are read at an image reading section <b>36</b>. Based on this image information, images are formed on the sheet with image forming section as described below. First, a signal is sent to a laser scanner unit <b>2</b> based on image information read with a controller, not shown, and laser beam is emitted according to the image information.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Subsequently, the laser beam reflects at a rotating polygon mirror, and is returned at a reflection mirror to be radiated onto a photosensitive drum <b>3</b> whose surface is uniformly charged, thereby forming electrostatic latent images. The electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b> is developed with a developing device <b>5</b>, and is then transferred onto a sheet S such as paper or OHP sheet as a toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The sheet S is properly selectively fed out of sheet cassettes <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> with a pickup roller <b>38</b> constituting the sheet feeding means. The sheet S is conveyed one by one upon separation by a separating means <b>37</b>, and after corrected with a pre-registration roller pair when fed obliquely, the sheet is fed to a transfer position in synchrony with the rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b>, so that the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b> is transferred to the sheet S via a transfer belt <b>11</b> as an intermediate transfer body.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Then, the sheet S is introduced to a fixing roller pair <b>6</b>, and the toner image transferred to the sheet S is permanently fixed upon application of heat and pressure from the fixing roller pair <b>6</b>. A fixing upper separation nail and a fixing lower separation nail are in contact with the fixing roller pair <b>6</b>, and this separates the sheet S from the fixing roller pair <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sheet S on which images are formed thus with the image forming section is further conveyed to the exterior of the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b> with a body side delivery roller pair <b>7</b>, so that the sheet S is introduced into the sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b> coupled to the image forming apparatus body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">[Brief Structure of the Sheet Processing Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b> includes the stacking tray <b>4</b> as a stacking means for stacking the sheet or sheet bundle, a rocking roller <b>50</b> serving as a conveying means for conveying the sheet or sheet bundle toward the stacking tray <b>4</b>, a sheet rear end aligning means made of such as a rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> for aligning the rear ends of the sheet or sheet bundle in pressing toward the stacking tray <b>40</b> the rear ends of the sheet or sheet bundle conveyed by the rocking roller <b>50</b>, and a finisher CPU <b>79</b> as controlling means for controlling the operation of the sheet rear end aligning means.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sheet bundle S stacked on the processing tray <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>)) renders the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> escape toward the upstream side in the sheet conveyance direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>)) as in a state that the rear end of the sheet bundle S conveyed by the bundle delivering means is in contact with a top end of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>)). Where the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is thus escaped, the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is inclined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), and the rear end of the sheet bundle S contacts to the inclined surface of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>. While the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> escaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) is returned to the home position (alignment reference position) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> around the rocking rotation shaft <b>73</b> as a center, the rear end of the sheet bundle S is pressed by the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, and the sheet bundles S are stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>)) as the rear ends of the sheet bundles S are aligned (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, while the escaped rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is returned to the home position by the rotation of the cam <b>72</b>, acceleration α of the sheet bundle (or sheet) from pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is required to be controlled. This is because the sheet bundle (or sheet) S may be kicked if the acceleration α is high, thereby reducing the alignment property on the stacking tray <b>4</b>. Conversely, if acceleration α is low, the productivity of the sheet processing apparatus is reduced. To prevent such problems from occurring, the acceleration α of the sheet bundle S due to pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, or namely, the acceleration α of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, is required to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, where acceleration of the sheet bundle S by pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> at a time that the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> presses the rear ends of the sheet bundle (or sheet) S to align the rear ends, is denoted as α, where gravitational acceleration is denoted as g, where coefficient of kinetic friction between the sheet bundle (or sheet) S pressed by the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> and the stacking tray <b>4</b> is denoted as μ<sub>1</sub>′, and where coefficient of kinetic friction between the sheet bundle (or sheet) S pressed by the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> and the sheet bundle (or sheet) S already stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b> is denoted as μ<sub>2</sub>′, the operation of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is controlled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by the finisher CPU <b>79</b> so that acceleration α of the sheet bundle (or sheet) S by pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> satisfies a relation:

<br/>
The sheet bundle (or sheet) S to be pressed moves upon receiving frictional resistance from the stacking tray <b>4</b> or the already stacked sheet bundle (or sheet). That is, where the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is operated with acceleration α satisfying the above relation, the rear end of the sheet bundle (or sheet) S does not become separated from the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> by the frictional resistance, and the sheets are stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b> as keeping a good alignment state. The relationship in amounts of coefficient of kinetic friction μ<sub>1</sub>′ between the sheet bundle S and the stacking tray <b>4</b> and the coefficient of kinetic friction μ<sub>2</sub>′ between the sheet bundle S and the sheet bundle already stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b> is determined with kinds of the stacked sheets, toner amounts carried on the stacked sheets, materials of the tray, etc.
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the abscissa denotes operation time of the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>; the ordinate is operation speed of the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>; the gradient indicates acceleration of the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>. In this embodiment, the above controlling formula defines the gradient going down as goes right, or namely the acceleration from the constant speed to the stop. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to compare the gradient (α≦−μ<sub>1</sub>′g and α≦−μ<sub>2</sub>′g) of the controlling formula with the acceleration of the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, it is denoted with reference to a time that the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is stopped. As described above, the range of the acceleration α is necessarily set in consideration of the acceleration α<sub>P </sub>of production limitation, because positional shifts in the conveyance direction at the front and rear ends of the sheet bundle (or sheet) may occur on the stacking tray <b>4</b> if the acceleration α of the sheet bundle S by pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is large when the sheet bundle (or sheet) S is pushed by the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> as described above, and because the productivity may be reduced if the acceleration α is small. It is to be noted that the acceleration α<sub>P </sub>of production limitation is an acceleration depending on the productivity of the image forming apparatus. To make sure good productivity, it is require to match the time for stacking the sheet bundle (or sheet) S on the stacking tray <b>4</b> by pressing the sheet bundle (or sheet) S by the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> with the time for aligning the sheet bundle (or sheet) S subsequently stacked on the processing tray <b>40</b>. That is, to transfer the sheet bundle (or sheet) S without delay from the processing tray <b>40</b> to the stacking tray <b>4</b>, the acceleration α of the sheet rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is determined by image forming force in the image forming apparatus body in which the sheets are sent onto the processing tray <b>40</b>. The acceleration α<sub>P </sub>of production limitation is the acceleration of the lower limitation not stagnating the sheet bundle (or sheet) S on the processing tray <b>40</b>. By setting the acceleration α of the sheet bundle (or sheet) S from pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> within a range shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rear end of the sheet bundle S is adequately aligned without kicking the rear ends of the sheet bundle S, thereby improving alignment property of the sheets in the stacking tray <b>4</b>, and thereby allowing the processing to be done without reducing the productivity of the sheet processing apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, the operation of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> is controlled so that the acceleration α of sheet bundle (or sheet) S from pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> satisfies the above conditions, and therefore, this apparatus can prevent the sheets from positionally shifting in the conveyance direction at the front and rear ends of the sheet bundle (or sheet) S on the stacking tray <b>4</b>, thereby allowing the sheet bundle (or sheet) S to be delivered and stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is to be noted that although in this embodiment, the sheet stacking surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the stacking tray <b>4</b> is set to extend substantially horizontally, the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> effectively operates even where the sheet stacking surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>is inclined, and where the sheet stacking surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>is extending substantially horizontally, the effects itself increase more. Where the sheet stacking surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>is set with an inclined angle of eighteen degrees or less inclined to the lower side toward the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, a smaller size of the apparatus can be realized as avoiding interference between the rear ends of the sheet bundles already stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b> and the subsequent sheet bundle delivered out of the processing tray <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The stacking tray <b>4</b> is structured to be movable up and down by a driving means not shown to keep the height of the top surface of the stacked sheet bundles S at a constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, according to this embodiment, the sheets are aligned in the conveyance direction of the sheet bundle (rear end alignment) while delivered and stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b>, by conveying the sheets until that the rear end of the sheet bundle (or sheet) reaches the top end of the rear end alignment wall, subsequently by rendering the sheet bundle rear end contact with the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> as escaping the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>, and by pressing the rear ends of the sheet bundle with the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b>. At that time, by controlling the operation of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> with the finisher CPU <b>79</b> so that the acceleration α of sheet bundle from pressing of the rear end alignment wall <b>70</b> satisfies the relation of α≦−μ<sub>1</sub>′g and α≦−μ<sub>2</sub>′g, the apparatus can prevent sheets from positionally shifting in the conveyance direction at the front or rear ends of the sheet bundles, and can improve the stacking alignment property of the sheet bundle on the stacking tray <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sheet alignment property on the stacking tray <b>4</b> can be improved even where the stacking tray <b>4</b> is placed as substantially horizontally extend, and because the space for inclined portion of the stacking tray <b>4</b> can be converted to an up and down moving stroke of the stacking tray <b>4</b>, the number of the sheets stacked on the stacking tray <b>4</b> can be made larger without rendering the apparatus body in a larger size.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, because the inclination of the stacking tray <b>4</b> can be made gentle, folding of the sheet due to the self-weight of the sheet bundle subjecting to lower curling or having low rigidity caused by steep inclination of the stacking tray <b>4</b>, can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Because the rear ends of the sheet bundle delivered on the basis of the bundles are aligned on an upstream side in the delivery direction with respect to the sheet bundles already stacked, this apparatus can prevent the sheets from positionally shifting in the conveyance direction upon engagement of the staple of the already stacked sheet bundles on which the stapling processing is made with the rear end of the sheet bundle delivered on the basis of the bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the embodiment described above, the photocopier is exemplified as an image forming apparatus. This invention is not limited to this, and this invention can be for other image forming apparatuses such as printers or facsimile machines or other image forming apparatuses such as combined machines combining those functions. Substantially the same effects can be obtained upon application of this invention to the sheet processing apparatus used in such an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment described above, exemplified is the sheet processing apparatus installed in the image forming apparatus body (space portion), but this invention is not limited to this. For example, the sheet processing apparatus can be arranged at the exterior of the image forming apparatus body and can be formed as detachably attached to the image forming apparatus body or formed unitedly with the image forming apparatus body. Substantially the same effects can be obtained upon application of this invention to such a sheet processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment described above, the exemplified recording method is an electrophotographic method, but this invention is not limited to this. This invention can use other recording method such as, e.g., inkjet method or the like.</p>
