<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention pertains to network cable management.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Communications networks are growing in number and complexity. Monitoring network connections, including the management of patch panel connections, is an important task in network management. There is a desire for a patch panel management architecture that is reliable and scalable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method and apparatus are provided for monitoring and reporting cable connectivity such as patch panel port-level connectivity on a real-time basis. For the patch panel systems example, the approach is based upon a distributed architecture that may be modularly scalable and may reduce, if not eliminate, the need for a centralized signal processor and complex cabling between patch panels and the centralized signal processor. Each patch panel may determine port-level connectivity independently. Polling delays and polling-related overhead processing may be reduced, if not eliminated, by supporting real-time monitoring of port connectivity at the port level. The approach provides improved real-time reporting of patch panel connectivity with reduced cabling complexity, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. In addition, the approach is compatible with (i.e., may communicate with and be controlled by) a multipurpose network management system (NMS).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method is disclosed for monitoring cable connections (e.g., a patch panel patch cord connection) that may include: transmitting a local patch panel identifier and a local port identifier upon an out-of-band patch cord channel; receiving a remote patch panel identifier and a remote port identifier upon the out-of-band patch cord channel; determining a status of the patch cord connection based upon the received remote patch panel identifier and the received remote port identifier; and transmitting a status update message to a network management system that includes the local patch panel identifier, the local port identifier, the remote patch panel identifier, the remote port identifier, and the status of the patch cord connection.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An apparatus is disclosed for monitoring cable connections (e.g., patch panel patch cord connections) that may include: a transmitter that transmits a local patch panel identifier and a local port identifier upon an out-of-band patch cable channel; a receiver that receives a remote patch panel identifier and a remote port identifier upon the out-of-band patch cable channel; a port controller that determines a status of the patch cord connection based upon the received remote patch panel identifier and the received remote port identifier and generates a port status update upon determining that a change in the status of the patch cord connection has occurred; and a patch panel controller that receives the port status update and transmits an update to a network management system that includes the local patch panel identifier, the local port identifier, the remote patch panel identifier, the remote port identifier, and the status of the patch cord connection.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A program product apparatus is disclosed, having a computer-readable medium with computer program logic recorded thereon for monitoring cable connections (e.g., a patch panel patch cord connection). The program product apparatus may include: a transmitter module that transmits a local patch panel identifier and a local port identifier upon an out-of-band patch cable channel; a receiver module that receives a remote patch panel identifier and a remote port identifier upon the out-of-band patch cable channel; a port controller module that determines a status of the patch cord connection based upon the received remote patch panel identifier and the received remote port identifier and generates a port status update upon determining that a change in the status of the patch cord connection has occurred; and a patch panel controller module that receives the port status update and transmits an update to a network management system that includes the local patch panel identifier, the local port identifier, the remote patch panel identifier, the remote port identifier, and the status of the patch cord connection.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The disclosed method and apparatus for monitoring and reporting cable connectivity may be applied to a variety of network devices. For example, as described below, the disclosed method and apparatus may be applied to monitoring and reporting cable connectivity between patch panel systems.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> presents an example of a prior art patch panel bank <b>100</b> in which individual patch panels <b>102</b>(<i>a</i>-<i>g</i>) have been adapted to support the automated compilation of patch cord connectivity information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each patch panel <b>102</b> has a plurality of patch panel ports <b>104</b> and is connected to a centralized signal processor <b>106</b> via a monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b>(<i>a</i>-<i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Patch cords <b>112</b>(<i>a</i>-<i>g</i>) used to establish connectivity between two patch panel ports <b>104</b> may include a plurality of network conductors that support network data connections and additional out-of-band conductors that support out-of-band signal connections used by patch panel bank <b>100</b> to monitor the connectivity status of the patch cords. For example, an exemplary RJ-45 style cable terminator may include 8 data conductors typically associated with an RJ-45 cable terminator and an additional out-of-band conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, upon insertion of a 9-wire RJ-45 style connector, as described above, into an RJ-45 patch panel port <b>104</b>, the out-of-band connector makes contact with an out-of-band connector conducting pad (not shown) that is integrated within, or behind, each RJ-45 patch panel port <b>104</b>. Each out-of-band conducting pad may be connected, internally within the patch panel, to one of the multiple conductors within monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b> that connects each patch panel <b>102</b> with centralized signal processor <b>106</b>. The present invention can make use of a connector having nine or more conductors, or it can use a probe on any type of connector, with the probe making electrical contact with the patch panel motherboard. Such connectors may be used with embodiments of the present invention, including the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In patch panel bank <b>100</b>, to determine connectivity between individual patch panel ports <b>104</b> established by patch cords <b>112</b>, centralized signal processor <b>106</b> polls each port <b>104</b> on each patch panel <b>102</b> via the respective monitoring ribbon cables <b>108</b>. For example, centralized signal processor <b>106</b> may sequentially place an electrical signal, such as a DC voltage, upon a selected conductor within a selected monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b> and detect whether the signal is received upon another monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b> conductor associated with the same patch panel or another patch panel connected to centralized signal processor <b>106</b>. If a signal is detected upon a monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b> conductor in response to a signal being placed upon another conductor within the same or a different monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b>, centralized signal processor <b>106</b> may determine that the two patch panel ports associated with the respective ribbon cable conductors are connected. Centralized signal processor <b>106</b> may generate and transmit a message to a Network Management System (NMS) via a management network connection <b>110</b> to report the determined port level connectivity. If no signal is detected upon a monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b> conductor in response to a signal being placed upon a conductor within the same or different monitoring ribbon cable <b>108</b> associated with a specific patch panel port, centralized signal processor <b>106</b> determines that the patch panel port upon which the signal is placed is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although a monitored patch panel bank <b>100</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is capable of providing a network management system with patch panel connectivity information, such monitored banks of patch panels have significant drawbacks. The approach is not modularly scalable in that the centralized signal processor <b>106</b> is limited in the number of physical patch panels to which it can connect and, therefore, is limited in the number of patch panel connections that can be monitored. Although additional centralized signal processors may be obtained to support different banks of patch panels, patch cords connected between patch panels supported by different centralized signal processors cannot be monitored. Further, the monitored patch panel bank <b>100</b> based approach makes the centralized signal processor a single point of failure with respect to monitoring the bank of patch panels. Loss of a single centralized signal processor <b>106</b> (e.g., due to a loss of power, loss of a network connection, or due to an internal centralized signal processor failure) results in a loss of patch panel monitoring capability for the entire bank of patch panels. Further, the need to connect to a centralized signal processor panel places restraints upon the placement of patch panels and increases cable complexity, thus decreasing reliability and increasing maintenance costs. Still further, increases in the number of panels supported by a single centralized signal processor increases the polling requirements placed upon the centralized signal processor, thus increasing polling cycle time (i.e., the time required to poll all ports on all patch panels) and decreasing responsiveness of the system to changes in patch panel patch cord connectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In view of the above, a patch panel capable of monitoring and reporting patch panel port-level connectivity that is based upon a modularly scalable, distributed architecture is desirable. Such an approach would preferably reduce, if not eliminate, the need for a centralized signal processor by allowing each patch panel to determine port level connectivity independently. Further, such an approach would preferably reduce, if not eliminate, polling delays and polling-related overhead processing by supporting real-time monitoring of port connectivity at the port level. In addition, such an approach would provide real-time reporting of patch panel connectivity with reduced cabling complexity, increased reliability and decreased maintenance costs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of seven exemplary modular, intelligent patch panels <b>202</b>(<i>a</i>-<i>g</i>). Each patch panel <b>202</b> is based upon a modularly scalable, distributed architecture. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each patch panel <b>202</b> may include a pair of network connection ports <b>220</b> that allow the respective patch panels to be interconnected in a daisy-chain configuration to a network connection <b>210</b> using daisy-chain network cables <b>208</b> (e.g., relatively short spans of 4-pair network cable terminated in conventional RJ-45 terminators). Network connection <b>210</b> may provide network connectivity to each patch panel in the daisy-chain and may thereby provide each patch panel in the daisy-chain with connectivity to a remote Network Management System (NMS). Further, each patch panel <b>202</b> may include a pair of power sharing ports <b>218</b> that allow the patch panels to be interconnected in a daisy-chain configuration to a single power supply <b>222</b> using daisy-chain power cables <b>216</b> (e.g., relatively short spans of DC or AC electrical power cabling with appropriate connectors).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each patch panel <b>202</b> is capable of monitoring and reporting patch panel port level connections formed by patch cords manually connected between ports on one or more patch panel devices without support from a centralized signal processor (e.g., as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> block <b>106</b>). Therefore, the patch panel may reduce or eliminate the need for status-monitoring ribbon cables (as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The ability to daisy-chain power to multiple patch panels from a single power supply <b>222</b> may reduce or eliminate the need for independent power supplies to each individual patch panel and further reduces the volume of power-related cables. The ability to daisy-chain network connectivity to multiple patch panels from a network connection <b>210</b> may reduce or eliminate the need for independent network cables for each individual patch panel and further reduces the volume of network-related cables.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The patch panel architecture allows network patch panel capabilities to be scaled in any manner by the introduction of any number of patch panel devices. The patch panel architecture allows patch cord connectivity between any two patch panel ports to be determined based upon out-of-band communication between the respective connected ports over an out-of-band patch cord connection. The patch panel may reduce or eliminate the need for a common centralized signal processor to determine connectivity between patch panel ports. Further, elimination of the need for a centralized signal processor may remove a single point of failure with respect to the ability to monitor a set of patch panels and may remove or eliminate multiple other potential points of failure via simplified cabling. Further, unlike the polling approach described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the patch panel architecture supports the monitoring and the reporting of changes in patch panel port-level connectivity on a real-time basis, regardless of the number of patch panels included in the network. Response time does not increase with the number of patch panels added to a network, as is the case with systems that rely upon a centralized signal processor to sequentially scan each port on each of the respective patch panels that the centralized signal processor supports. The patch panel architecture according to some embodiments of the present invention supports patch panel monitoring that may be modularly scaled to support any size network, provides real-time monitoring with reduced delay, and employs a simplified inter-patch-panel cabling scheme that increases reliability and reduces maintenance costs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram depicting an exchange of out-of-band messages between a patch panel <b>302</b>(<i>a</i>) labeled “patch panel X” and a patch panel <b>302</b>(<i>b</i>) labeled “patch panel Z.” As described in greater detail below, each patch panel port may repeatedly broadcast over the out-of-band channel a port message identifying the patch panel and port generating the message. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, patch panel port <b>304</b>(<i>a</i>) associated with panel X may generate an outbound message “patch panel X/Port <b>21</b>” to indicate that patch panel port <b>304</b>(<i>a</i>) is the twenty-first port on patch panel X. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, port <b>304</b>(<i>b</i>) associated with patch panel Z may generate an outbound message “patch panel Z/Port <b>17</b>” to indicate that patch panel port <b>304</b>(<i>b</i>) is the seventeenth port on patch panel Z.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each patch panel port may repeatedly broadcast an outbound message and listen for receipt of an outbound message generated from another patch panel port. Until a patch cord that supports the out-of-band communication channel is connected between two patch panel ports, neither port will receive an out-of-band message. However, upon connection of two patch panel ports with a patch cord that supports an out-of-band communication channel (e.g., a patch cord with a 9<sup>th </sup>wire) each patch panel port may receive the outbound message broadcast by the patch panel port with which it has established connectivity. The patch panel port controller associated with each of the respective ports may then generate, in real time, an update message to its respective patch panel controller. Upon receipt of an update message from a port controller, each respective patch panel controller may generate and transmit an update message over a network connection to a remote NMS that is configured to organize and present the received physical topology information in a manner useful to an end user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block level diagram of an exemplary patch panel configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, patch panel <b>400</b> includes a panel controller module <b>402</b> that communicates with a plurality of port controller modules <b>404</b>. Further, the patch panel controller module <b>402</b> may support communication with another patch panel and/or a network management system via daisy-chain network connection ports <b>420</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>420</b>(<i>b</i>), as described above. In addition, the patch panel may receive electrical power from a power supply or another patch panel and may transfer power to another patch panel via daisy-chain power connection ports <b>418</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>418</b>(<i>b</i>), as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary patch panel controller module <b>502</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, panel controller module <b>502</b> may include a panel processor module <b>510</b> in communication with a data storage module <b>508</b>, a network interface module <b>506</b> and a plurality of port controller modules <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Panel processor module <b>510</b> may communicate with each of the respective port controller modules <b>504</b> to receive port status updates. Upon receipt of an update message from a port controller module <b>504</b>, panel processor module <b>510</b> may update status information stored within data storage module <b>508</b>, generate an SNMP compliant update message that includes connection related information received from the port controller module, and transmit the generated SNMP compliant update message to a remote network-connected NMS via network interface module <b>506</b>. A ninth wire connection <b>509</b> or other probe connection is connected to the patch panel out-of-band channel physical interface and the port controller module <b>504</b>. The in-band communications, carried in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> through eight conductors <b>511</b>, proceed through the patch panel without modification.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Panel processor module <b>510</b> may receive and process SNMP messages from the remote network connected NMS via network interface module <b>506</b>. The SNMP message may contain updated configuration parameters for use in controlling the panel controller module <b>502</b> and/or one or more of port controller modules <b>504</b>. Upon receipt of an update message from a remote network-connected NMS, panel processor module <b>510</b> may update status information stored within data storage module <b>508</b> and generate/transmit an internal update message to each of the respective port controller modules <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although not indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, panel processor module <b>510</b> may include additional functionality or modules for use in controlling the behavior and operation of the patch panel. Such additional modules may store and/or update within data storage module <b>508</b> managed objects associated with the additional functions performed. Preferably, such objects are stored in a structure and format compatible with a defined SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) to facilitate SNMP-based reporting (e.g., via an SNMP get-response message and/or via an SNMP event trap message, etc.) of the stored values from the panel processor module <b>510</b> to the NMS and/or to support updates from the NMS to patch panel controller module <b>502</b> via SNMP based messages (e.g., via the SNMP set command). An additional function that may be included in panel processor module <b>510</b> supports the receipt and processing of command, control and reporting instructions from the NMS via protocols other than SNMP.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Different panel controller module <b>502</b> configurations may include a panel processor module <b>510</b> with capabilities that range from nominal functions to sophisticated monitoring and control functions. As such, the hardware/software modules required to implement panel controller module <b>502</b> may range from relatively simple modules with limited storage and processing capabilities to relatively complex modules with significant storage and processing capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary port controller module <b>604</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, port controller module <b>604</b> may include a port processor module <b>606</b> in communication with a data storage module <b>612</b>. Port processor module <b>606</b> communicates with an out-of-band channel physical interface <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Port processor module <b>606</b> may communicate with the patch panel controller module to send port update messages to the panel controller module and to receive configuration/control parameter updates from the panel controller module. Upon receipt of an update message from the panel controller module, port processor module <b>606</b> may update status information stored within data storage module <b>612</b>. Port processor module <b>606</b> may use parameters received from the patch panel controller module and stored in data storage module <b>612</b> to control operation of port controller module <b>604</b> and to control events reported via update messages to the panel controller module.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one exemplary port controller module, port processor module <b>606</b> may retrieve from data storage module <b>612</b> a local patch panel identifier, a local port identifier, and a local port connection status associated with the current, or local, port controller module (e.g., patch panel/port information related to the current, or local, patch panel port) and may provide the retrieved information to out-of-band channel physical interface <b>610</b>, generating an outbound port message that includes the retrieved local patch panel identifier and local port identifier information. The port processor module <b>606</b> may proceed to transmit the message upon the out-of-band channel via a transmitter, which in one embodiment is operated by out-of-band channel physical interface <b>610</b>. Further, the port processor module <b>606</b> may receive an inbound message from a remote port that includes a remote patch panel identifier and remote port identifier information, via a receiver which may be operated by out-of-band channel physical interface <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an exemplary configuration in which out-of-band channel physical interface <b>610</b> supports a single out-of-band conductor, the port processor module <b>606</b> may repeatedly alternate between transmitting an outbound port message and checking to see if an outbound message from a remote port may be received. In another exemplary configuration in which the out-of-band channel physical interface <b>610</b> supports two separate out-of-band conductors, the port processor module <b>606</b> may simultaneously transmit an out-of-band outbound port message and check for/receive an out-of-band message from a remote port, simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The terms “remote port” and “local port” are relative terms. For example, from the perspective of a patch panel port controller, the term “remote port” may be used to refer to any port other than the “local port” supported by that patch panel port controller. Given that a patch panel supports multiple ports, a “remote port” may be a port on the same, or local, patch panel as a “local port” or the “remote port” may be a port on another, or remote, patch panel. A remote port and a local port behave, and are, exactly the same except that each has a relative position with respect to the other. For example, each port, based upon the perspective of that port, transmits an out-of-band outbound port message that includes a local patch panel identifier and a local port identifier. Further, each port, based upon the perspective of that port, receives a remote patch panel identifier and a remote port identifier within a received message.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Upon determining, based upon the monitored out-of-band messages, that a change in port level connectivity has occurred, port processor module <b>606</b> may store the updated status information in data storage module <b>612</b> and send an update message to the panel controller module, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, different port controller module <b>604</b> configurations may include a port processor module <b>606</b> with capabilities that range from nominal functions to sophisticated functions. As such, the hardware/software modules required to implement port controller module <b>604</b> may range from relatively simple modules with relatively slight storage and processing capabilities to relatively complex modules with relatively significant storage and processing capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary workflow associated with the startup of an exemplary patch panel device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, upon powering up, at step S<b>702</b>, of a patch panel device, the patch panel panel controller may send, at step S<b>704</b>, a configuration request to a remote NMS. Upon receipt, at step S<b>706</b>, by the NMS of the configuration request, the NMS may retrieve, from a configuration controlled storage repository, configuration parameters for the patch panel device from which the configuration request was received and send the retrieved configuration parameters to the patch panel panel controller. Upon receipt, at step S<b>708</b>, of the requested configuration parameters, the patch panel panel controller may store the received parameters and send, at step S<b>710</b>, all or a portion of the received configuration parameters to each of the respective patch panel port controllers associated with each of the respective patch panel ports to which all or portions of the respective configuration parameters apply. Upon receipt, at step S<b>712</b>, of configuration data from the panel controller, each port controller may store the configuration parameters and may initiate, at step <b>714</b>, port connectivity monitoring in accordance with the received control parameters, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary workflow associated with monitoring patch panel port-level connectivity based the monitoring of communications upon an out-of-band communication channel, as described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, upon initiation of patch cord connectivity monitoring, a patch panel port controller may transmit, at step S<b>802</b>, an outbound message upon the out-of-band channel associated with the monitored port. Such an outbound message may contain patch panel/port information associated with the monitored patch panel port.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the port controller may check, at step S<b>804</b>, to determine whether an out-of-band message from another patch panel port controller is available for receipt. If the port controller determines, at step S<b>806</b>, that an out-of-band message is not available for receipt, the port controller checks, at step S<b>808</b>, the currently stored port status. If the port controller determines that the stored connection status indicates that the port is not connected, the process flow proceeds to S<b>802</b> to again transmit an out-of-band channel outbound message containing patch panel/port information associated with the monitored patch panel port. If the port controller determines, at step S<b>808</b>, that the stored connection status indicates that the port status is “connected,” the port controller may update, at step S<b>810</b>, a port-level data store to reflect the new port status as “disconnected” and may generate and send to the patch panel controller a message notifying the panel controller of the disconnect. Upon receipt of the message from the port controller containing a new port status, the panel controller may store the port status information in a panel level information store and generate/transmit a status update to the NMS via the network. The process flow may then proceed to step S<b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the port controller determines, at step S<b>806</b>, that an out-of-band message is available for receipt, the port controller receives, at step S<b>812</b>, the out-of-band message. If the port controller determines, at step S<b>814</b>, that the port status is “connected” and that the received patch panel/port information matches previously stored patch panel/port information, no update to the panel controller is generated and processing may proceed to step S<b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, if the port controller determines, at step S<b>814</b>, that the stored port status is “disconnected” and/or that the received patch panel/port information does not match previously stored patch panel/port information, the port controller may conclude that a change in port connectivity status has occurred. Therefore, at step S<b>816</b>, the port controller may update the port level data store to reflect a port status of “connected” and may send a message to the panel controller containing the new port status and the newly received patch panel/port connection information. The panel controller receives, at step S<b>818</b>, the update message and in response may update the panel-level information store to reflect the received connection status and port connectivity information and may generate and transmit an update message via the network to the NMS. The process flow may then proceed to step S<b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows one embodiment of the present invention which is used for cross-connect systems wherein all patch cords are connected between patch panels in group 1 (group 1 ports) and patch panels in group 2 (group 2 ports). In this embodiment, there is a MAC chip associated with each port of each patch panel. Each system transmission on a 9<sup>th </sup>wire is from a group 1 port to a group 2 port. Each group 1 port continuously sends its MAC ID over its 9<sup>th </sup>wire. If such a signal is received at a group 2 port, the IDs of both the group 1 port and the group 2 port are sent to the NMS by the group 2 port. When receipt by the NMS is acknowledged, the group 2 port stops sending the message. If a group 2 port stops receiving the MAC ID signal from the group 1 port, it transmits its ID continuously to the NMS until receipt is acknowledged by the NMS. The NMS is therefore continuously updated. This documentation system does not require a data storage module in each patch panel. A central revision system which is a subsystem of the NMS also controls an LED associated with each port. The transmissions to each patch panel to control the LED's are on the same Ethernet system used for the documentation system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a revision system is illustrated using a first patch panel <b>900</b> and a second patch panel <b>902</b> according to the present invention. A port <b>904</b> on the first patch panel <b>900</b> is connected upstream to a network switch <b>906</b>. The revision system is a sub-system in the network management system (NMS). The revision system can guide the removal or the addition of a patch cord. Each patch panel port is provided with an LED.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To guide the removal of a patch cord, the revision system causes a first LED <b>908</b> of the first port <b>904</b> and a second LED <b>910</b> of a second port <b>912</b>, to which the patch cord <b>914</b> is attached, to flash. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the patch cord <b>914</b> is a nine-wire patch cord. The revision system next causes MAC ID's of the first port <b>904</b> and the second port <b>912</b> to be sequentially and continuously sent to the revision system by port <b>912</b>. A reviser unplugs the patch cord <b>914</b> from the second port <b>912</b>, which is associated with the flashing LED <b>910</b>. The revision system next causes only the MAC ID of the second port <b>912</b> to be continuously sent to the revision system until it receives the message. The revision system then turns off the LED <b>910</b> of the second port <b>912</b> and, after a time delay, also turns off the LED <b>908</b> of the first port <b>904</b>.</p>
