<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of making a plurality of sealed assemblies is provided which includes a) assembling a first element to a second element so that a bottom surface of the first element faces downwardly toward a front surface of the second element and a top surface of the first element faces upwardly away from the second element; and (b) forming ring seals surrounding regions of the front surface of the second element by introducing flowable material between the first element and the second element from the top surface of the first element through openings in the first element. A chip is provided which includes: (a) a body defining a front surface and one or more circuit elements on or within the body; (b) one or more bond pads exposed at the front surface in a bond pad region; and (c) a metallic ring exposed at the front surface, the ring substantially surrounding the bond pad region. Sealed chip assemblies are formed by sealing an array of the chips, e.g., in wafer form, to a cap element.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to microelectronic packaging. Microelectronic chips typically are thin, flat bodies with oppositely facing, generally planar front and rear surfaces and with edges extending between these surfaces. Chips generally have contacts on the front surface, which are electrically connected to the circuits within the chip. Certain chips require a protective element, referred to herein as a cap or lid, over all or part of the front surface. For example, chips referred to as surface acoustic wave or “SAW” chips incorporate acoustically-active regions on their front surfaces, which must be protected from physical and chemical damage by a cap. Microelectromechanical or “MEMS” chips include microscopic electromechanical devices, e.g., acoustic transducers such as microphones, which must be covered by a cap. The caps used for MEMS and SAW chips must be spaced from the front surface of the chip to an open gas-filled or vacuum void beneath the cap in the active area, so that the cap does not touch the acoustical or mechanical elements. Certain electro-optical chips such as optical sensing chips and light-emitting chips have photosensitive elements which also must be protected by a lid. Voltage controlled oscillators</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Miniature SAW devices can be made in the form of a wafer formed from or incorporating an acoustically active material such as lithium niobate or lithium tantalate material. The wafer is treated to form a large number of SAW devices, and typically also is provided with electrically conductive contacts used to make electrical connections between the SAW device and other circuit elements. After such treatment, the wafer is severed to provide individual devices. SAW devices fabricated in wafer form can be provided with caps while still in wafer form, prior to severing. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,429,511 a cover wafer formed from a material such as silicon can be treated to form a large number of hollow projections and then bonded to the top surface of the active material wafer, with the hollow projections facing toward the active wafer. After bonding, the cover wafer is polished to remove the material of the cover wafer down to the projections. This leaves the projections in place as caps on the active material wafer, and thus forms a composite wafer with the active region of each SAW device covered by a cap.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a composite wafer can be severed to form individual units. The units obtained by severing such a wafer can be mounted on a substrate such as a chip carrier or circuit panel and electrically connected to conductors on the substrate by wire-bonding to the contacts on the active wafer after mounting, but this requires that the caps have holes of a size sufficient to accommodate the wire bonding process. This increases the area of the active wafer required to form each unit, requires additional operations and results in an assembly considerably larger than the unit itself.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another alternative disclosed by the '511 patent, terminals can be formed on the top surfaces of the caps and electrically connected to the contacts on the active wafer prior to severance as, for example, by metallic vias formed in the cover wafer prior to assembly. However, formation of terminals on the caps and vias for connecting the terminals to the contacts on the active wafer requires a relatively complex series of steps. Similar problems occur in providing terminals for MEMS devices. For these and other reasons, further improvements in processes and structures for packaging SAW, MEMS, electro-optical and other capped devices would be desirable.</p>

For many silicon semiconductor devices, a package is considered to be hermitic if it has a leak rate of helium below 1×10<sup>−8 </sup>Pa m<sup>3</sup>/sec. Other devices such as electro-optical devices do not require hermeticity, but nevertheless are best packaged under a protective lid, e.g., one that is optically transmissive, as a way of preventing particles from reaching a surface of the electro-optic device.</p>

For example, the cap element <b>100</b> may include or consist of one or more materials such as ceramics, metals, glasses and semiconductor materials. When the chips are provided on a silicon wafer or other such semiconductor wafer having a relatively low CTE, the cap element <b>100</b> can consist of a CTE-matched material such as silicon or other semiconductor, aluminum, nickel alloys, including those having especially low CTEs such as alloys of nickel and iron and alloys of nickel and cobalt. Other CTE-matched metals include molybdenum.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">When the device region <b>208</b> includes a SAW device, the cap element is desirably constructed of a material having a CTE which is matched to that of the SAW device, When such SAW devices are fabricated in lithium tantalate wafers, a preferred choice for the cap element is aluminum, because aluminum has a CTE which is similar to that of SAW devices, and a low modulus of elasticity, and aluminum can be oxidized to form aluminum oxide, which is an insulator, by processes such as “anodizing”. In such manner, insulating layers are formed on the top surface, bottom surface, and through holes with which to isolate respective ones of the subsequently formed electrical interconnects from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cap element <b>100</b> and each cap <b>102</b> thereof has a top surface <b>105</b> and a bottom surface <b>103</b>. In one embodiment as shown, the top and bottom surfaces define respective planes. Through holes <b>104</b> are provided in the cap element <b>100</b>, the cap element <b>100</b> generally having one or more through holes per chip. Through holes are provided by any technique suited for the particular material or materials of which the cap element is made. For example, when the cap element <b>100</b> is composed predominantly of silicon, metal, ceramics and glasses, the through holes can be provided by a subtractive process such as etching or drilling. Alternatively, when the cap element <b>100</b> includes a polymer, the through holes are more desirably provided through a molding process. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cap element <b>100</b> consists predominantly of a dielectric or semiconductor material such as a glass, ceramic or a silicon wafer. Typical etching methods applied to wafers of such materials result in through holes which are tapered as shown to grow smaller from one surface towards the other surface, such that they have a substantially frusto-conical shape. In this embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the through holes are tapered to become smaller in a direction from the top surface towards the bottom surface. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, bonding layers, e.g., regions <b>106</b> which are wettable, illustratively, by a fusible medium such as solder, tin, or a eutectic composition, are provided on the sidewalls <b>107</b> of the through holes <b>104</b>. The tapered profile of the through holes generally assists in permitting the wettable regions to be formed on the sidewalls <b>107</b> of the through holes <b>104</b> by deposition. Suitable bonding layers will vary with the material of the cap element and the fusible material which is used to form the bond. The particular fusible medium may affect the impedance characteristics of the bond that is formed. For use with a fusible medium such as a low-melting point tin-based solder and a semiconductor, ceramic or glass cap element <b>100</b>, one exemplary bonding layer includes a 0.1 μm thick layer of titanium overlying the sidewalls of the through holes <b>104</b>, an additional 0.1 μm thick layer of platinum overlying the titanium layer, and a 0.1 μm thick exposed layer of gold overlying the platinum layer.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the cap element <b>100</b> is aligned to a plurality of attached chips <b>202</b>, such as contained in a wafer <b>201</b> or portion of a wafer and is sealed to the water by a sealing medium <b>206</b>. The sealing medium <b>206</b> includes, illustratively, an adhesive, a glass, especially those which have a low-melting point, a fusible material such as solder, or another material which forms a diffusion bond to elements, e.g., the sealing medium may be such as to form a bond to a bonding ring, as will be shown and described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-36B</figref>. The sealing material preferably includes a material such as any one or more of the following: a thermoplastic, an adhesive, and a low melting point glass, which typically will bond the bottom surface <b>502</b> of the cap directly to the front surface <b>601</b> of the chip, without requiring intervening metallizations. Otherwise, bonding may be performed by solder, eutectic composition or one or more metals capable of forming a diffusion bond with a metallization provided on the front surface <b>601</b> of the chip, e.g., a sealing ring <b>802</b>, and a corresponding metallization <b>804</b> provided therefor on the bottom surface of the cap <b>500</b>. When the sealing material has an attach temperature that is coincident with the solder flow temperature, the seal forms as the abutting bottom surface of the cap and the front surface of the chip are drawn together by the decreasing height of the solder.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">The wafer <b>201</b> is also shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Illustratively, the wafer is one of many available types of wafers which include at least a layer of semiconductor material, including but not limited to silicon, alloys of silicon, other group IV semiconductors, III-V semiconductors and II-VI semiconductors. Each chip <b>202</b> includes a semiconductor device region <b>204</b> provided in the semiconductor device layer, which contains, for example, one or more active or passive devices formed integrally to the semiconductor material of the chip. Examples of such device include, but are not limited to a microelectronic or micro-electromechanical device such as a SAW device, MEMS device, VCO, etc., and an electro-optic device. When such device is present, the bottom surface <b>103</b> is spaced from the front surface <b>216</b> of the chip <b>202</b> so as to define a gas-filled void or vacuum void <b>214</b> between the cap element <b>100</b> and the chip <b>202</b>. The device region <b>204</b> of each chip <b>202</b> is conductively connected by wiring <b>210</b> to bond pads <b>208</b> disposed in a bond pad region at the front surface <b>216</b> of each chip. In some types of chips, the bond pads <b>208</b> include solder-wettable regions which are exposed at the front surface. In one embodiment, the device region <b>204</b> includes a SAW device, and the sealing medium is disposed in an annular or ring-like pattern in a way that surrounds the bond pads <b>208</b> and the device region <b>204</b> to hermetically seal each cap <b>102</b> to each chip <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> are further sectional views illustrating further stages in which electrically conductive interconnects <b>303</b> are formed which extend from the bond pads <b>208</b> of each chip <b>202</b> into through holes <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a mass, e.g. a ball of a flowable conductive medium <b>302</b> is provided at the through hole <b>104</b> at the top surface <b>105</b> of the cap element <b>100</b>. Illustratively, the ball <b>302</b> includes a fusible conductive material such as, solder, tin or a eutectic composition. The mass of fusible material <b>302</b> may be placed on the cap element <b>100</b> so as to rest somewhat inside the through hole <b>104</b>, as shown. When the fusible material <b>302</b> is a solder ball or ball of other fusible material, the balls can be placed at or in the through holes of the cap element by placing and aligning a screen containing holes over the cap element and allowing the balls to drop through the holes of the screen into the through holes <b>104</b> until one such ball rests in each through hole in which a conductive interconnect is to be formed. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the fusible material of the balls is caused to form bonds to the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chips <b>202</b> of the wafer. For example, when the conductive material is a fusible material such as solder, tin or eutectic composition, heat is applied to the balls directly or by heating the cap element and the chip to a point that causes the material to flow. As a result of this process, the fusible material flows onto and wets the metallizations <b>106</b>, and flows onto and wets the bond pads <b>208</b> to form a bond to the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b>. Another result of this process is that the fusible conductive material <b>304</b> forms a unified solid electrically conductive interconnect <b>303</b> which extends from the bond pad <b>208</b> into the through hole to form a solid mass of the fusible conductive material. The thus formed conductive mass extends across the full width of the through hole to seal the through hole and to thereby separate the void <b>214</b> underlying the cap from the ambient medium which is present above the through hole.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">Thereafter, the assembly formed by the cap element <b>100</b> and the wafer <b>201</b> is severed at dicing lanes defining their boundaries <b>101</b> into individual capped chips, one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">The plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> illustrates features on the surface of the chip <b>202</b> as completed, the features including the device area <b>204</b> of the chip <b>202</b>, the interconnects <b>303</b> which are joined to bond pads of the chip, and the seal <b>206</b> which is disposed as an annular or “ring” structure surrounding the bond pads and the device area <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0162">Note, with respect to the above processing, that various stages of processing can optionally be performed in different facilities, as the required cleanroom level, i.e., a level specifying the maximum concentration of contaminating particles in the air and on surfaces of the facility, varies during the stages of processing. Moreover, some of the stages of processing are best performed in facilities which are oriented to performing certain steps of processing. In addition, in a preferred embodiment, testing is performed as to intermediate results of processing to eliminate product and materials from the process stream which are determined to be defective at particular stages of processing.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0163">Thus, with respect to the processes described in the foregoing, a facility can fabricate cap elements, e.g. cap wafers having dimensions sized to fit the chip-containing wafers to be covered thereby. As an example, such cap elements are fabricated from blank wafers, which can be either new or possibly wafers recycled from previous processing. The cap elements are subjected to processing to form the through holes, which are then tested to assure conformance to standards of quality, e.g., placement, location, alignment, pitch, depth, sidewall angle, etc., and any of several other criteria for assuring quality. In either the same or in another facility, when the through holes include wettable regions, e.g., under bump metallizations (“UBM”) on the sidewalls thereof, processing is then performed to form the wettable regions. Because of the techniques used, and the increased sizes of features of the cap element, and tolerances therefor, these particular steps can be performed in facilities which need not be geared to the fabrication of semiconductor devices. However, such steps can be performed in a semiconductor fabrication facility, if such is desired. Again, at the conclusion of this processing, testing is optionally performed to assure that the wettable regions of the cap element meet quality standards.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0164">Thereafter, the cap element and the chip-containing wafer are joined together according to processing such as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, such joining process preferably being performed in a facility having a high cleanroom level. For example, such process is desirably performed in a semiconductor fabrication facility, such as the facility in which the chip wafer is made. When the chips include optically active elements such as imaging sensors, processing to complete the conductive interconnects <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) of each cap element can be deferred until later processing, if desired, since the primary concern is to mount the cap element as a cover over the chip wafer to avoid dust contamination. However, if the chip contains a SAW device, MEMs device or other such device requiring hermetic packaging, it is desirable to form the conductive interconnects <b>303</b> at this time as well, to form a seal which protects the SAW device during subsequent stages of processing. Again, some testing is then desirably performed to assure that quality standards are met prior to proceeding to subsequent stages of fabrication. Subsequent processing to form the electrical interconnects, if not formed already, and to provide any, further sealing, if necessary, is then performed. Such processing can be performed in another facility other than the semiconductor fabrication facility, and at a cleanroom level that is not required to be as high as that of a semiconductor fabrication facility.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0165">Similarly, subsequent processing to complete the packaging, as by adding other elements, e.g., optical lenses, interposer elements, thermally conductive elements and the like, and processing to mount the packaged chip to a circuit panel, such as the processes described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C-11B</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-17</figref>, for example, need not be performed in the same facility. Such subsequent processing can be performed in environments which do not have the same cleanroom level as that in which the cap element is mounted to the chip-containing wafer, that step preferably being performed in the semiconductor fabrication facility.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0166">The mounting of a cap element to a chip wafer, as described in the foregoing, is especially advantageous for the packaging of certain types of chips, especially those including SAW devices, MEMs devices, and optical devices, potentially resulting in increased yields, due to the ability of such processing to be performed efficiently in cleanroom environments of semiconductor fabrication facilities, where sources of contamination are kept to a minimum. In particular, it is especially desirable to protect chips which include imaging sensors such as charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays and the like from dust or other particle contamination by attaching a cap or lid to the front surface of the chip, as early in the packaging process as possible. Such imaging sensors include an imaging device array of a chip, over which a layer including an array of bubble-shaped microlenses is formed in contact with the device array. The array of microlenses typically includes one microlens per pixel unit of the device array, the pixel unit having dimensions of a few microns on each side. In addition, such microlenses are often made of a sticky material to which dust tends to adhere after manufacture. Particles and dust, if allowed to settle directly on an imaging sensor, can obscure a portion of the pixel area of the imaging sensor, causing the image captured by the sensor to exhibit a black spot or degraded image.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0167">However, owing to the shape of the microlenses and their number, and the sticky nature of the material used to make them, it is virtually impossible to remove dust or other particles that settle on the surface of a typical imaging sensor having such microlenses. Thus, any particles which settle on the imaging sensor at any time after the microlens array is formed, such as during the packaging process, render the imaging sensor defective, such that it must be discarded. This provides an explanation why such imaging sensor chips, when packaged according to conventional chip-on-board techniques, exhibit a yield rate in the final packaged chips, which is only 80% to 85% of the chips fabricated on each wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0168">On the other hand, particles and dust which settle on a transparent cap or cover above the outer surface of the chip do not obscure a portion of the image because the outer surface of the cap lies outside of the focal plane of the device. At worst, particles settling on the cover result in slightly decreased light intensity striking a portion of the imaging sensor. The slightly decreased light intensity rarely affects the quality of the image captured by the imaging sensor. Moreover, as described herein, the caps or covers can be mounted over the imaging sensors of the chips while the chips remain attached in wafer form, i.e., before the wafer is diced into individual chips. The mounting of the caps is preferably performed in substantially the same level of cleanroom environment as that used to fabricate the wafer, e.g., before the chip wafer leaves the semiconductor fabrication facility. In such manner, dust and particles are prevented from ever reaching the surface of imaging sensors of the chips. Moreover, once the chips are protected by such transparent caps, it becomes possible to clean the top surfaces of the covers if particles such as dust reach them. This is because the transparent caps can be made substantially planar, unlike the topography of the bubble-shaped microlenses of the imaging sensor, and are typically made of a material such as glass, which is readily cleaned by a solvent. Because the potential for direct dust contamination of the imaging sensor is virtually eliminated once the transparent cap wafer is mounted to the chip wafer, it is estimated that imaging sensor chips which are provided with transparent covers early in the packaging cycle have a yield rate of 97%-99%. In such case, the defect rate becomes no longer primarily due to contamination of the imaging sensors, but rather, for other reasons such as electrical functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0169">Desirably, wafer-level testing is performed on the chip-containing wafer <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) prior to the cap element <b>100</b> being joined to the wafer <b>201</b> and the conductive interconnects <b>304</b> formed thereto. “Wafer-level testing” refers to such testing as is generally performed on chips, prior to the chips being severed into individual chips. More extensive testing, commonly referred to as “chip-level testing,” is typically performed only after the chip has been severed from the wafer and packaged as an individual chip.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0170">Wafer-level testing typically tests for basic functionality, such as for electrical continuity, and basic functional operation of each chip. Such testing is desirably performed prior to individually packaging each chip, in order to eliminate the costs of packaging chips that are later determined to be defective. Thus, it is desirable to perform steps to complete the packaging of chips only with respect to chips which have passed initial wafer-level testing; i.e., “known good dies.” By completing the packaging only as to “known good dies,” unnecessary packaging operations and/or rework of packaging operations are avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0171">Wafer-level testing generally takes much less time, perhaps as much as 100 times smaller amount of time per chip tested than chip-level testing. However, the cost per chip of wafer-level testing performed by equipment capable of mechanically probing the surface of the wafer can equal or exceed that of the cost of chip-level testing, despite the greater amount of time per chip needed, to perform chip-level testing. The special equipment required to precisely, mechanically probe the contacts on the wafer surface is very expensive. For that reason, such special equipment is typically also subject to resource constraints within the manufacturing facility. Moreover, fewer contacts per chips are capable of being simultaneously contacted by such equipment than is generally the case for chip-level testing, for which chips are generally placed in sockets for testing. Another factor that affects the cost of wafer-level testing is that the special equipment used to probe the contacts of the wafer is limited to testing a single chip at a time, to at most a few chips at one time.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0172">On the other hand, chips that are processed into capped chips in wafer form or lidded chips in wafer form, as described herein, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, are capable of being tested at the wafer level, with test equipment that is potentially less expensive than the mechanical probing equipment described above, because interconnects of the chips are disposed on the top surface of the cap wafer and for that reason, are capable of being probed by equipment similar to that used to perform chip-level testing. For example, the top or outer surface of the cap wafer can be mechanically contacted by a contact-bearing dielectric element of test equipment, the contacts of the test equipment being held in contact with the conductive interconnects of multiple chips of the wafer, as by mechanical force. In such manner, testing is performed through voltages and/or currents applied through the interconnects <b>303</b> of each capped chip <b>300</b> to a plurality of the chips which remain attached in form of the wafer <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In that way, a plurality of chips of each wafer are simultaneously tested and determined to be good or defective, using equipment that can be less expensive than the, above-described test equipment, because the need to mechanically probe the wafer surface directly is eliminated. In a particular embodiment, a greater subset of tests than is generally performed as “wafer-level testing” is performed to the capped chips. This is possible because the wafer containing the capped chips is able to be tested by test equipment that is less expensive than the mechanical probing equipment discussed above. In addition, the ability to test a greater number of the chips at one time permits more testing to, be performed per chip for the same total amount of test time using the less expensive test equipment. In a highly preferred embodiment, the capped chips are tested in such equipment for all or nearly all of the same functions ordinarily performed during chip-level testing, prior to the chips being severed from the capped chip-containing wafer into individual capped chips.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 3F</figref> illustrate a variation of the above-described embodiment, in which a sealing material is disposed between the chip <b>202</b> and the cap <b>102</b> in such way that it separates electrical interconnects <b>350</b> of the capped chip from adjacent electrical interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 3F</figref> are a sectional view of such capped chip and a plan view corresponding thereto, through line <b>3</b>F-<b>3</b>F. In this embodiment, the capped chip <b>340</b> includes a sealing material <b>346</b> which surrounds the device area <b>204</b> of the chip <b>202</b>, as in the above embodiment, but also encompasses the area of the electrical interconnects <b>250</b>. Preferably, the sealing material is an insulating material, for example, a nonconductive polymer, e.g., adhesive such as epoxy or other adhesive, a thermoplastic, a glass, e.g., low-melting point glass, etc., such as described above, such that the sealing material provides an isolating medium between adjacent ones of the electrical interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0175">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, optionally, a seal ring layer <b>342</b> is disposed on the front surface of the chip <b>202</b>, such that the sealing material <b>346</b> adheres to the seal ring layer <b>342</b>. The seal ring layer presents a surface that is wettable by the sealing material <b>346</b> such that the sealing material preferentially wets the seal ring layer and forms a bond thereto. The capped chip optionally includes a guard ring <b>348</b> which is used to prevent the sealing material from flowing beyond the wettable seal ring layer towards the device area <b>204</b> of the chip <b>202</b>. The guard ring presents a surface which is not wettable by the sealing material. Certain materials present nonwettable surfaces to other materials. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) presents a surface to which most other materials will not adhere or wet. In one embodiment, the guard ring <b>348</b> includes PTFE as a material at the exposed surface thereof. A similar seal ring layer and guard ring are optionally provided on the facing surface <b>103</b> of the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0176">Herein, while processes and accompanying figures are generally described in relation to individual chips and individual caps, unless otherwise noted, they shall also be understood to apply to the simultaneous processing of multiple attached chips, e.g., a wafer, and multiple attached caps of a cap element, e.g., a cap wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3G through 3H</figref> illustrate one option for fabricating the capped chip shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E-3F</figref>. As in the above-described embodiment, this embodiment is preferably practiced as a way of simultaneously mounting a chip member including a plurality of chips to a cap member including a plurality of caps, after which the resulting joined article is severed to provide individual capped chips. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, the insulative sealing material <b>346</b> is placed on the surface of the chip <b>202</b> or the cap <b>102</b>. The cap, having pre-formed through holes therein, is then juxtaposed and aligned to the chip such that the sealing material <b>346</b> contacts and wets respective areas of the cap <b>102</b> and the chip <b>202</b>, including the seal ring layer <b>342</b>, but not wetting the guard ring <b>348</b>. As a result, the sealing material flows onto and is disposed on the contacts, e.g., the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0178">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>, a process is performed to remove unwanted sealing material <b>346</b> which is disposed on the bond pads <b>208</b>. Such process is preferably tailored to the specific sealing material that is used. For example, when the sealing material is a glass, the process is preferably performed by etching, which is preferably performed anisotropically, e.g., such as by reactive ion etching, sputter etching, or other process which includes removal of material primarily in the vertical direction. However, in another embodiment, the etching process need not be highly anisotropic. The etching process may even be a generally isotropic process, if the relative thickness <b>352</b> of the sealing material being removed is comparatively smaller than the dimensions <b>354</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>) between adjacent, ones of the bond pads <b>208</b>. In that way, the removal of the sealing material <b>346</b> from on top of the bond pads <b>208</b> does not result in areas wide enough for adjacent electrical interconnects to contact each other. In a particular embodiment when the sealing material is an organic material, e.g., a polymer such as an adhesive or thermoplastic, the removal is performed by a “plasma ashing” process, in which plasma etching results in the polymer being converted to an ash-like substance, leaving the surfaces of the bond pads <b>208</b> exposed. Thereafter, the electrically conductive interconnects <b>350</b> are formed by a process such as one of the above-described processes.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3I through 3N</figref> illustrate an alternative process for making capped chips similar to those described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E through 3H</figref>. Referring to the completed capped chip as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N</figref>, this embodiment differs from the embodiment described therein, in that the sealing material <b>356</b> is a self-fluxing underfill. A self-fluxing underfill is an insulative material that is frequently used to fill a space between the front surface of a chip and a packaging element to which it is mounted in a flip-chip arrangement. Typically, a self-fluxing underfill material is an epoxy-based material, which is viscous as applied at a normal ambient temperature, or at a slightly elevated temperature, but which hardens into a solid mass upon heating. The self-fluxing aspect of the material relates to components of the composition which cause it to function as a flux when articles are soldered in its presence. Stated another way, the self-fluxing underfill material carries away reaction products, e.g., oxidation products from the soldering process that is performed in contact with it. In a particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N</figref>, the self-fluxing underfill material is disposed in contact with a sealing ring layer <b>342</b> and is prevented from contacting the device area <b>204</b> of the chip by a guard ring. The sealing ring layer is similar to the sealing ring layer and the guard ring described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E-3F</figref>. A Similar sealing ring layer (not shown) and guard ring (not shown) may also be disposed on the underside <b>103</b> (bottom side) of the cap member <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0180">A process of forming capped chips using such self-fluxing material will now be described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3I through 3N</figref>. An initial stage in fabricating a capped chip is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>. In such stage, a cap member <b>100</b> including a plurality of caps <b>102</b> is aligned to and disposed overlying a chip member <b>200</b> which includes a plurality of attached chips <b>202</b>. For example, the cap member <b>100</b> and the chip member <b>200</b> can be held together in a fixture. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, the through vias of the cap are loaded with a fusible conductive medium, e.g. solder, tin, eutectic composition, or diffusion bondable medium, etc. In such case, the fusible conductive medium may adhere to the walls <b>107</b> of the through holes, the walls preferably presenting surfaces which are wettable by the fusible conductive medium. Alternatively, the walls are metallized to, provide surfaces wettable by the fusible medium, as described above. One method of applying the fusible medium shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref> is by paste screening. Another method includes application of molten solder to the cap <b>102</b> at the through hole, for example. The result of this step is to provide a solder mass held to the cap <b>102</b> at the through hole <b>358</b>, such as through a bond, adhesion, surface tension, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref> illustrates an alternative, in which the fusible medium is applied in form of a ball such as a solder ball <b>304</b>, in a manner such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Thereafter, the self-fluxing underfill material is applied between the cap member <b>200</b> and the chip member <b>100</b> to the space surrounding the device region <b>204</b> of each chip, resulting in the structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L and 3M</figref>. The self-fluxing underfill material can be provided to the sealing surfaces at the periphery of each chip of the chip member and each cap of the cap member through capillary action. For example, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the filling process is conducted by applying the sealing material onto the sealing surfaces of the chips and the caps that are disposed along rectilinear dicing channels, including the vertical dicing channels <b>211</b> of a chip member such as a wafer, and also along horizontal dicing channels <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0181">In a particular embodiment, if the above-described capillary action is not sufficient to achieve adequate fill quality, the process can be conducted as to a smaller number of attached chips and caps, for which such filling method is adequate. For example, in an embodiment, the cap member contains a one-cap wide strip of chips and the chip member contains a one-chip wide strip of chips. The underfill is applied to the interface between peripheral edges of each chip and each cap on the strip, and the self-fluxing material is then drawn onto the wettable sealing ring layers that are disposed adjacent to the peripheral edges of each chip.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0182">After the underfill is applied, the structure, as shown in either of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3L and 3M</figref> is heated, such that the fusible medium, e.g., solder, flows down the walls of the through holes to wet, contact and bond with the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chips <b>202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N</figref>. During such heating step, the self-fluxing underfill <b>356</b> is displaced by the molten medium. The self-fluxing underfill then preferably also provides flux to carry away oxides which may occur due to the bonding process, such that a good conductive bond is achieved between the resulting electrical interconnects <b>350</b>, as provided by the fusible medium <b>358</b>, and the bond pads <b>208</b>. Thereafter, as in the embodiment described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, the structure is severed into individual capped chips.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0183">In a variation of the above embodiment, the self-fluxing underfill material is provided to at least one of the opposing surfaces <b>103</b>, <b>216</b> of the chip member and the cap member prior to aligning and placing the cap member into a desired position relative to the chip member.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0184">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, masses of fusible conductive material are pre-bonded to wettable surfaces of the through holes <b>104</b> of the cap <b>102</b>, and the cap is then bonded by a conductive adhesive <b>316</b> provided on bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b>, to form electrically conductive interconnects extending from the bond pads <b>208</b> through the through holes to the top surface <b>105</b>, of the cap <b>102</b>. Again, this process is preferably performed simultaneously as to a plurality of attached chips, such as a chip-containing wafer and a plurality of caps, such as a cap wafer, and the joined structures then severed to form individual capped chips. This process permits the cap wafer and the chip-containing wafer to be joined at room temperature or at most, a minimally elevated temperature, i.e., without requiring heating to a temperature sufficient to cause the flowing of a fusible material such as solder. Such process is advantageous, in order to avoid problems of differential expansion between the chip-containing wafer and the cap wafer, e.g., when the two wafers are not CTE matched.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0185">The masses of fusible material are provided, for example, by screen printing a controlled amount of solder into each through hole of the cap wafer. Alternatively, the masses of fusible material can be provided by contacting a cap wafer having tapered through holes wettable by solder with a bath of solder, such that the solder is drawn onto the wettable surfaces of the through holes, to fill the through holes with the solder. The through holes are preferably tapered, either in the manner shown, i.e., growing smaller from the top surface <b>105</b> towards the bottom surface <b>103</b>, or alternatively, growing smaller from the bottom surface towards the, top surface. In another alternative, the through-holes are tapered from both the top and bottom sides, growing smaller towards a middle of the thickness of the through holes <b>104</b>. The application of the solder results in the mass <b>314</b> of solder having a protrusion <b>315</b> extending beyond the bottom surface <b>103</b> of the cap. The protrusion <b>315</b> can be a natural consequence of applying the solder in liquid, e.g., as a solder paste, or in a molten state. In either case, due to surface tension, a sessile drop forms which causes the protrusion <b>315</b> to appear. The protrusion <b>315</b> provides a surface which displaces some amount of the conductive adhesive upon bringing the cap together with the chip, such that the solder mass <b>314</b> fully contacts the conductive adhesive <b>316</b>. The conductive adhesive is preferably an anisotropically conductive adhesive, which conducts in a vertical direction by way of conductive elements in the adhesive that are pressed into contact with the solder mass <b>314</b> and the bond pad <b>208</b>. As also described and shown below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, an anisotropically conductive adhesive does not conduct in a lateral direction <b>317</b> due to lateral spacing between the conductive elements of the adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0186">In a variation of this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3P</figref>, a viscous, nonconductive adhesive <b>318</b> is applied to the vicinity of the bond pad used. In this case, the protrusion <b>315</b> of the pre-formed solder mass <b>314</b> displaces the nonconductive adhesive so as to contact the upper surface of the bond pad. The nonconductive adhesive functions to maintain the solder mass <b>314</b> in contact with the bond pad <b>208</b>. Application of a slightly elevated temperature may be performed to cure and/or shrink the nonconductive adhesive <b>318</b>, so as to better maintain the contact between the protrusion <b>315</b> and the bond pad <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3Q</figref> an <b>3</b>R illustrate further variations of this embodiment, in which additional protruding features are added to the cap wafer in each case, in registration with the through holes <b>104</b>, such protruding features provided to assure the quality of contact between the preformed conductive interconnect structures provided in the cap wafer <b>102</b> and the bond pads of the chips <b>102</b>. Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3Q</figref>, the protruding feature includes a stud bump <b>324</b> which is applied to the cap wafer <b>102</b> at the location of the through hole <b>104</b>. In a particular embodiment, the solder mass <b>314</b> is planarized, e.g., by polishing, after which the stud bump <b>324</b> is applied to make the structure shown. Embodiments including stud bumps are described in greater detail below throughout the present application. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3R</figref>, the solder mass <b>314</b> does not completely fill the through hole. In such case, the protruding feature <b>326</b>, e.g., a stud bump fills the remaining space within the through hole to project beyond the bottom surface <b>103</b> of the cap <b>102</b>. Although. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3Q and 3R</figref> illustrate structures in which a conductive adhesive is used, i.e., a preferably anisotropic conductive adhesive, a nonconductive adhesive can be used instead, in the manner as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3P</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3S through 3V</figref> illustrate a particular embodiment of a method by which a structure <b>360</b> including capped chips, in wafer form, are severed into individual capped chips.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0189">As noted above, a cap wafer and a chip-containing wafer need not consist of the same or similar materials. For example, a chip-containing wafer consisting essentially of silicon may be joined to a cap wafer which consists essentially of glass. In such case, a difficulty arises in the manner in which the structure including the cap wafer, as joined to the chip-containing wafer, can be severed into individual capped chips. Conventionally, a silicon wafer can be cut by sawing using a 25 μm wide blade, which saws through the thickness of the wafer at a rate of 70 mm per minute. On the other hand, a glass wafer, having an exemplary thickness of 325 μm, must be cut using a blade having a thickness of 75 μm, which also cuts at a comparable rate. The blade optimized for cutting a silicon wafer will cause chipping if used on the glass wafer. Conversely, a blade optimized for cutting a glass wafer produces unsatisfactory results when used to cut a silicon wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0190">In order to cut through a structure including both the silicon wafer and the glass wafer, a poor compromise is presented. A sawing process capable of cutting both silicon wafer and glass wafer together operates at a rate of only 5 mm per minute, which is unacceptable, given the thickness of the combined structure, which is in the hundreds of microns. In addition, typically, dozens of cuts are required to sever all chips of such wafers into individual units.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3S</figref> illustrates an improved method of severing the structure <b>360</b> into individual units according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a sealing material <b>206</b> is disposed between the chip-containing wafer and the cap wafer, the sealing material <b>206</b> being such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> or in other above-described embodiments. The cap wafer <b>100</b> and the chip-containing wafer <b>200</b> are spaced from each other by a distance. In one embodiment, the distance is controlled, for example, by features of the cap wafer or the chip wafer which protrude beyond the opposing surfaces <b>216</b>, <b>103</b> of the cap wafer or the chip wafer, respectively, as described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Alternatively, the sealing material can include spacing elements, e.g., spheres, for maintaining a minimum distance between the chip and the cap wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0192">The structure <b>360</b> is sawed, first by a saw optimized for cutting one of the wafers, and thereafter by a saw which is optimized for cutting the other one of the wafers. For example, a saw having a thick blade is used to produce the wide cut <b>362</b> first, cutting through the glass cap wafer <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3S</figref>. Such cut <b>362</b> may touch the sealing material <b>206</b>, but does not cut through the sealing material. This sawing operation is preferably then repeated to make all of the cuts through the glass across throughout the cap wafer. As stated above, this sawing operation, being optimized to the glass, proceeds quickly for that reason. Thereafter, a saw having a relatively narrow blade is applied to make the narrower but <b>364</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3S</figref>. In this case, the blade and the sawing operation are optimized to cutting the silicon wafer, Preferably, this cut is performed to cut all of the way through the silicon wafer and through the remaining sealing material. In such case, given the greater width of the cut <b>362</b> in the glass wafer <b>100</b>, the narrower cut <b>364</b> meets the wide cut <b>362</b> to complete the severing of the chip. Beneficial results are provided, in that the rate of sawing through each wafer separately is at about one order of magnitude or more greater than the rate of sawing through a combined structure <b>360</b> using a single saw. Thus, the rate of severing the chips is at least several times faster, for example, about 5 to 10 times faster, when the method according to this embodiment is utilized, as compared to using one blade capable of cutting through both wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3T</figref> illustrates an individual capped chip <b>300</b>, diced using this embodiment of the invention. As shown therein, the edges of the chip <b>366</b> and the cap <b>368</b> of the capped chip unit <b>300</b>, are not perfectly aligned. This is a consequence of the two separate sawing operations that are performed. Perfect alignment and orientation of the separately performed sawing operations is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3U and 3V</figref> are plan views illustrating the capped chips, after sawing them into individual units. Some displacement in one or more axes of the dicing lines <b>370</b>, <b>372</b> produced by the two sawing operations is likely to occur, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3U</figref>. Angular displacement of one sawing operation relative to another sawing operation, may also cause angular displacement of the dicing lines <b>370</b>, <b>372</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3V</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are a sectional view and a top-down view, respectively, illustrating a particular embodiment of a capped chip <b>430</b> in which the electrical interconnects <b>303</b> are conductively connected by a trace <b>434</b> formed on the top surface of the cap <b>102</b>, such as for the purpose of redistributing an electrical connection. In such embodiment, the trace <b>434</b> extends from a bonding layer <b>106</b> provided on the sidewall through a through hole at one electrical interconnect <b>303</b><i>a </i>to a bonding layer <b>106</b> provided at another electrical interconnect <b>303</b><i>a</i>. The trace <b>434</b> can be formed at a separate time as the bonding layer <b>106</b> or simultaneously with the bonding layer <b>106</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a sealing medium <b>432</b> is provided between the cap and the chip <b>202</b> in an area underlying the through hole <b>436</b>. When a fusible conductive material is placed in through hole <b>436</b>, as well as through hole <b>438</b> and heated, the material forms a solid bonded connection to the bonding layer <b>107</b> and forms an electrically conductive connection between the bond pad <b>208</b> and the electrical interconnect <b>303</b><i>b</i>. Note that during such process, the fusible material does not flow from the through hole <b>436</b> onto the chip because of the seal medium <b>432</b> which blocks the material from flowing lower than the bottom surface of the cap <b>102</b>. Alternatively, if the arrangement permits two bond pads of the chip to be at the same potential, e.g., such as for the distribution of power or ground connections, the chip may include a bond pad underlying the through hole <b>436</b>, and the sealing, medium <b>432</b> not be disposed under through hole <b>436</b>, such that the electrical interconnect <b>303</b><i>b </i>is also bonded to that bond pad.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C-4D</figref> are a sectional view, and a plan view, respectively, illustrating a variation of the capped chip structure <b>100</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>. With reference to both figures, in this structure, a redistribution trace <b>440</b>, which may function as a “fan-out” trace, is provided on the side <b>103</b> of the cap <b>102</b> which faces the chip <b>202</b>, that is, the underside of the cap, also referred to herein as the “bottom side” of the cap. The redistribution traces can function as a “fan-out” trace for the purpose of providing contacts on the cap which are disposed farther apart and at more convenient locations for higher level packaging than the locations of the bond pads of the chip. Such arrangement permits the size of the chip to be made smaller, which allows more cost-effective chip processing, because more chips are fabricated at a time on a single wafer. The cap <b>102</b> is provided of a material such as that described above, and is preferably mounted to the chip as a plurality of attached caps in wafer form to a plurality of attached chips of a chip-containing wafer, after which the joined structure is severed into individual units.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0196">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the redistribution traces <b>440</b> extend along the underside <b>103</b> of the cap from the locations of interconnecting masses <b>442</b> of conductive material which extends from the bottom side <b>103</b> to the top side <b>105</b> of the cap <b>102</b> by way of through holes <b>104</b>. The conductive material forming the masses <b>442</b> is a flowable conductive material such as a conductively loaded polymer, one or more metals or a fusible conductive medium. Most preferably, the masses <b>442</b> are formed of a fusible conductive medium such as solder, tin or eutectic composition, and are formed in contact with a bonding layer <b>107</b> disposed on walls of the through holes. At the other end of the conductive traces, protrusions <b>444</b>, such as stud bumps, are preferably provided. The protrusions <b>44</b> provide surfaces to which a bonding medium such as a conductive adhesive <b>446</b> adheres to form an electrically conductive path from the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b> to the traces <b>440</b>. Preferably, the adhesive is an anisotropic conductive adhesive, such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3O-3R</figref>. Alternatively, a nonconductive adhesive can be used in place of the conductive adhesive <b>446</b>, in a manner such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3P</figref>. Alternatively, a fusible conductive medium such as solder is used in place, of the conductive adhesive. In such case, a mass of fusible material such as solder is preferably applied as a bump to the protrusion <b>444</b> or the corresponding location of the trace <b>440</b>, if the protrusion is not present, before the cap wafer is bonded to the chip wafer. The cap wafer and the chip wafer are then heated to cause the solder to reflow, thus forming a solder mass bonding the two wafers in the place where the conductive adhesive <b>446</b> is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0197">In one embodiment, the cap wafer is formed by patterning a layer of metal on the cap wafer to form the redistribution traces <b>440</b>, after which the through holes are formed by an etching process or other removal process which is endpointed upon reaching the redistribution traces <b>440</b>. Bonding layers <b>107</b> are then formed on walls of the through holes, as needed, and the through holes are then are then filled with the conductive material, that material preferably being a fusible conductive material such as solder.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E</figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of a chip <b>202</b> which would benefit upon redesign, through use of the redistribution scheme illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C-4D</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the chip <b>202</b> is rectangular, such that the chip has a long edge <b>242</b>, and a short edge <b>244</b>. The rectangular shape is used because of the rectangular shape of a device area <b>204</b> of the chip, which may be, or may not be required to be rectangular. For example, a charge-coupled device (CCD) array is required to be rectangular for capturing images. In such chip <b>202</b>, interconnection wiring <b>246</b> carries signals from points <b>248</b> connected to the device area <b>204</b> to bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b>. However, the rectangular shape of the chip is not optimum, because a greater number of chips having the same amount of area could be fabricated on a single wafer, and thus, be fabricated more cost-effectively, if the chips had square shape. Moreover, it is more difficult to form interconnections to a package including the chip by way of wire-bonding when the contacts of the package are provided at positions which may vary in two degrees of freedom. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the positions of the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip vary vertically along the short edge <b>244</b> of the chip <b>202</b>. Other positions of the bond pads vary horizontally along the long edge <b>242</b>. These positions of the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip are reflected in corresponding positions of the contacts of a package (not shown), e.g., a capped chip which includes the chip, which are also disposed at different vertical positions along a short edge of the package, and at different horizontal positions along a long edge of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0199">Faster, more effective, and/or higher quality wire bonding can be achieved if the contacts of the package, and thus, the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip are disposed in lines which extend in either horizontal or vertical directions, but not both. In such way, when the wire-bonder forms a bond wire to each location, it is only required to move between respective horizontal locations along each line.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0200">Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, in an embodiment of the invention, wiring <b>252</b> extends from the connection points <b>248</b> to bond pads <b>254</b> which are disposed at different horizontal locations along one of the horizontal (long) edges <b>242</b> of the chip <b>256</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0201">The above-described embodiment, showing caps having redistribution traces disposed on the underside of the caps, is desirably employed with chips having a design such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, the caps providing any redistribution of signal way that is made necessary by the different layout of the bond pads on the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0202">The flowing on and bonding of a fusible conductive material such as solder in the manner discussed in the foregoing with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3N</figref> and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B applies to chips which have bond pads that include exposed regions which are wettable by solder or other fusible material. In some types of chips, particularly those having aluminum bond pads, and some types of SAW device chips, the bond pads are not wettable by solder or other such fusible material, in the form that the chips are available when packaged. Aluminum bond pads oxidize under ordinary atmospheric conditions to form a surface layer of alumina which is generally not wettable by a molten mass of solder. On the other hand, some types of wafers, especially III-V compound semiconductor wafers, include bond pads which are formed of or include an outer layer of gold. Here, a different problem exists in that the gold of the bond pad is subject to being dissolved by solder and other fusible materials, which potentially destroys the bond pad to cause an open circuit between the bond pad and the connecting trace.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0203">One way that these concerns is addressed is to specifically form a bonding layer on the bond pads <b>208</b> of the wafer prior to joining the cap element to the wafer, the bonding layer being wettable by solder (or other fusible material to be used). Such bonding layer can be formed by a process such as that used for forming an “under bump metallization” (“UBM”) on a chip. However, some types of chips, particularly SAW devices, are very sensitive to contamination and can be degraded by processing used to form bonding layers.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0204">Accordingly, in an embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, such concern is addressed by forming bonding layers on bond pads of a chip or wafer after the cap element has been joined to the wafer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in such embodiment, the joined assembly of the wafer containing the chip <b>202</b> and the cap <b>102</b> is placed in a chamber in which it is subjected to deposition of one or more materials to form a bonding layer <b>540</b>, e.g., a UBM on the surface of the bond pad <b>208</b>. A mask, e.g., a contact mask, may also be positioned over the cap <b>202</b> such that only the through holes <b>104</b> are exposed during the deposition. Otherwise, the deposited material can be removed from the top surface of the cap <b>202</b> after the chip has been joined to the cap and the electrical interconnects <b>303</b> have been formed. During such deposition, the cap <b>202</b> also functions as a shadow mask to prevent the deposition of the UBM on the device region <b>204</b> of the chip <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0205">As a result of the deposition, a bonding layer <b>106</b> may also be simultaneously formed on the sidewalls <b>107</b> of the through holes <b>104</b>. During such process, dielectric oxide present on the surface of the bond pad <b>208</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0206">A limiting factor of the embodiments described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref> is that it requires the solder ball <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) to melt during the reflow process in such way that the meniscus (not shown) of the molten solder ball hangs low enough to touch the UBM coated bond pad <b>208</b>, and thereby establish a solder bond with the bond pad <b>208</b>. Whether or not the solder bond is established depends on several factors, including the volume of the molten solder ball, the size of the opening of the through hole <b>104</b> which faces the chip, and the height <b>125</b> of the spacing between the chip <b>102</b> and the cap <b>101</b>, requiring tolerances on the process to be relatively tight. In addition, such, process allows little freedom to choose the height <b>125</b> of the spacing between the cap <b>102</b> and the chip <b>202</b>. Desirably, such height is determined by the functionality sought to be obtained by placing the cap over the device area of the chip, such as when the device area includes a SAW device or MEMS device which requires a cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0207">The embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> addresses this concern. In this embodiment, conductive stud bumps <b>662</b> are applied to the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip, which is best performed while the chip is in wafer form. Thereafter, the cap element is aligned to the wafer and sealed thereto. During the alignment step, the stud bumps, particularly if they contain relatively thick shafts, can assist in the process of properly aligning the cap element to the wafer, as the stud bumps <b>662</b>, when aligned, stick up at least partially through the through holes <b>106</b>. Stud bumps containing certain metals may be applied directly to bond pads without first applying a bonding layer such as a UBM, thus providing a further alternative way of forming conductive interconnects to bond pads which are not directly wettable by solder. For example stud bumps consisting essentially of one or more of copper, nickel, silver, platinum and gold can be applied this way. When wettable bonding layers are provided on bond pads, stud bumps of solder or other fusible conductive materials can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0208">A process such as that described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> is then used to form electrical interconnects <b>663</b> which include stud bumps and the fusible material so as to extend from the bond pads <b>208</b> through the through holes <b>665</b>. As in the embodiments described above, a sealing medium <b>664</b> is provided between the chip <b>202</b> and the cap <b>102</b>. One problem with some sealing media is that it is difficult to control the thickness T of the sealing medium, and thus the thickness of the void <b>214</b> between the chip and the cap, simply by controlling the amount of the sealing medium or the amount of pressure applied to locations of the chip after the sealing medium is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0209">This concern is addressed in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in which each conductive stud bump <b>662</b> has a shoulder <b>666</b>, on which the bottom surface <b>103</b> of the cap <b>102</b> rests, so as to space the bottom surface <b>103</b> a distance T from the front surface <b>216</b> of the chip. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, that distance T includes any thickness T<b>2</b> of the bond pad <b>208</b> which extends above the front surface <b>216</b> of the chip, as well as the thickness of the lower ‘ball’ portion of the stud bump from the bond pad <b>208</b> to the shoulder <b>666</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> illustrates a capped chip <b>748</b> according to another embodiment of the invention, in which conductive interconnects are provided which include bonding wires <b>752</b> which extend from bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b> through openings <b>754</b> in the cap <b>102</b> to contacts <b>750</b> disposed on the top surface <b>105</b> of the cap. The openings <b>754</b> can be such as the through holes <b>104</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, for example, which are sized to accommodate one interconnect per through hole, and to permit the bonding of bonding wires <b>752</b> to respective bond pads of the chip. Alternatively, the openings <b>754</b> can be bonding windows which are sized and shaped, e.g., extending primarily in one linear direction along the cap, so as to overlie a linearly extending row of bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip, and permitting the formation of wire-bonds to each of the bond pads <b>208</b> of that row through the opening. While the peripheral edges of the capped chip <b>748</b> are sealed by a sealing material <b>206</b>, in a manner such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, an additional sealing material <b>756</b> is deposited in contact with the openings <b>754</b> of the cap to seal the openings after the bonding wires have been formed. Such sealing material can include, for example, a polymer which hardens to form a nonconductive region for insulating respective bonding wires from each other, while also mechanically supporting the bonding wires. In a particular embodiment, the sealing material <b>756</b> is an encapsulant which is disposed as an insulating medium over the top surface <b>105</b> of the cap generally, except for the area in which the contacts <b>750</b> are located. Alternatively, another insulator such as a glass, e.g., preferably a low-melting point glass, is disposed in each through hole to insulate and support the bonding wire. In a particular embodiment, in which the wire bonds extend through individual through holes <b>104</b> which are aligned to the bond pads, a mass of a flowable conductive material such as a conductively loaded polymer or a fusible conductive material is disposed in each opening <b>754</b> to seal the opening in place of a polymer. In such manner, enlarged conductive interconnects <b>758</b> are formed at the top surface <b>105</b> of the cap <b>102</b>, the interconnects <b>758</b> extending across each opening to seal each opening including the area of the contacts <b>750</b>. In such case, higher level assemblies can be made by forming appropriate electrically conductive bonds to the thus formed interconnects <b>758</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates a variation of the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> in which bonding wires <b>762</b> that are joined to the bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip are not bonded to contacts on the cap. Instead, the chip is bonded by bonding wires in a face-up orientation to contacts <b>764</b> of a packaging element <b>760</b>, e.g., any of many types of dielectric elements and substrates which have conductive traces thereon. Advances in the capability of wire bonding machines now permit bonding wires to be formed which have relatively complex profiles, and to be formed reliably and repetitively. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates an example in which the bonding wire <b>762</b> is formed to extend directly between a bond pad of the chip and a secondary packaging element, e.g., a dielectric panel, or circuit board, which is farther away from the bond pad <b>208</b> than that shown and described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. In this embodiment, the cap <b>102</b> is preferably an at least partially optically transmissive element, that term denoting an element which is either somewhat translucent or transparent to light in a range of wavelengths of interest. More preferably, the cap <b>102</b> is transparent, consisting essentially of a material such as a glass or a polymer, which can be molded. In a particular embodiment, the cap <b>102</b>, is molded to contain an optical element, e.g., a lens, such as the caps and optical elements described in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0210" num="0212">In this embodiment, the formation of the bonding wires to bond the chip to the packaging element <b>760</b> is done after the cap <b>102</b> is affixed to the chip <b>202</b> by the sealing material <b>206</b>, and the chip is mounted to the packaging, element, such as by an adhesive <b>766</b>, e.g., an adhesive commonly known as a “die attach” adhesive. Alternatively, a thermal conductor can be mounted between the chip <b>202</b> and the cap <b>102</b> for conducting heat away from the chip and onto a thermal conductor mount provided in the packaging element, such as described in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

In a particular embodiment, the chip is bonded, in a “chip-on-board” configuration) to a circuit panel, e.g., a printed circuit board or flexible circuit panel, in place of the packaging element <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0213">The above-described embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> can be especially advantageous for the packaging of chips which include optically active elements, for example, image sensors. Such sensors are especially vulnerable to dust or other particle contamination which is most likely to occur after the chip has been fabricated. Dust or other particles which settle directly on the imaging are of the chip can obscure a portion of the pixels of the active imaging area, thus rendering the chip unusable. The method provided in this embodiment reduces the risk of such contamination by providing a protective optically transmissive cover over the chip prior to performing subsequent higher-level packaging operations.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0214">In another embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, bonding wires <b>774</b> extend from bond pads <b>208</b> of the chip to bonding shelves <b>772</b> of a gull-wing package <b>770</b>. This packaged chip preferably includes an optically active chip and an optically transmissive cover <b>202</b>, such as that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. An additional package lid <b>776</b> is mounted to vertical members <b>778</b> of the package, the package lid <b>776</b> desirably also being at least partially optically transmissive, and preferably being transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0215">In a particular embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a unit <b>700</b> includes a conductive interconnect <b>703</b> which include a stud bump <b>662</b> and a conductive material <b>704</b> that seals the stud bump to the cap <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the conductive material <b>704</b> is a conductive organic material such as a conductive adhesive or conductive sealant. A conductive organic material which is curable at room temperature or a slightly elevated temperature is advantageously used when the material of which the cap is formed is not CTE matched to the chip. In such manner, conductive interconnects <b>703</b> can be made to the unit <b>700</b> without inducing strains in the chip or cap due to CTE mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0216">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, and in the plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the unit <b>700</b> may further include a plurality of such conductive interconnects <b>703</b>, which are connected by redistribution or fan-out traces <b>706</b>, to respective conductive contacts <b>708</b>. In such manner, signals coming off of the chip <b>202</b> are redistributed through the conductive interconnects <b>703</b> and the traces <b>706</b> to the contacts <b>708</b> which lie at a farther distance away from the device region <b>710</b> and closer to the edges <b>712</b> of the capped chip <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0217">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, once a unit <b>300</b> including a capped chip has been formed, it may then be aligned to and surface mounted to a printed circuit, board (PCB) or other type of circuit panel <b>802</b> to form an assembly <b>800</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows the unit <b>300</b> having the fusible material <b>304</b> of the interconnect aligned to a terminal, e.g., a land <b>808</b> of the circuit panel <b>802</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates the resulting assembly <b>800</b> after heating to cause the fusible material to be bonded to the terminal <b>808</b> of the circuit panel <b>802</b>. While flux is generally utilized for the purpose of joining materials in an oxygen-containing environment, the joining process can be performed fluxlessly, under conditions which inhibit contamination, i.e., by joining the unit <b>300</b> to the circuit panel <b>802</b> in the presence of a non-oxygen containing environment such as nitrogen, argon, or a vacuum, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0218">In accordance with some surface mounting practices, extra solder can be applied to the circuit panel prior to mounting the unit to increase the volume of solder available to make the connection. Such pre-forms of solder can be applied to the terminals of the circuit panel with flux, if needed, prior-to mounting the unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> illustrate such technique. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, due to the process used to make the capped chip unit <b>300</b>, the fusible material <b>916</b> provided on the bonding layer <b>917</b> of the through hole of the unit <b>300</b> does not completely fill the through hole, but leaves a void <b>921</b> in a portion of the through hole above the circuit panel <b>802</b>. By providing a pre-form <b>922</b> of additional solder or other fusible material on the terminal <b>920</b> of the circuit panel <b>802</b>, sufficient solder is provided to provide a reliable connection between the unit <b>300</b> and the circuit panel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates the assembly <b>900</b> formed by the unit and the circuit after heating to cause the solder contained in the pre-form and in the through hole to melt and join, being drawn into the through hole to form connection <b>924</b> to terminal <b>920</b>. As a result of the added solder from the pre-form, a bulked up solder connection <b>924</b> is provided which is sufficient to establish a connection to the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0219">As an alternative to that described above, the solder pre-form can be provided for use in hierarchically soldering the unit to the circuit panel. Stated another way, the conductive interconnects of the unit <b>300</b> can be formed using a solder or other fusible material which melts at a higher temperature than the solder used to join the unit <b>300</b> to the circuit panel, such that the original higher temperature material does not melt and reflow during the subsequent joining operation.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate another method for joining the unit <b>300</b> to a circuit panel to form an assembly <b>1000</b>, in which a conductive adhesive <b>1622</b> is used to conductively join the unit <b>300</b> to a land <b>1020</b> of the circuit panel <b>1019</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates a stage after which the unit <b>300</b> has been placed in alignment with the circuit panel <b>1019</b>, such that the solder <b>1016</b> in the through hole is positioned over the land <b>1020</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates a subsequent stage after the unit has been pressed into contact with the land <b>1020</b>, causing the conductive adhesive to at least substantially fill the through hole to form a connection <b>1018</b>. However, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a certain amount of the conductive adhesive <b>1024</b> flows off the land <b>1020</b> onto other areas of the circuit panel. For this reason, in order to avoid the making of electrical connections in places where they are not desired, the conductive adhesive is desirably an anisotropic conductive adhesive <b>1024</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Such anisotropic conductive adhesive contains discrete conductive particles <b>1026</b>, such as conductive spheres that are normally spaced from each other by a fluid medium used to carry them. When pressed between two objects at a spacing equal to the width of the sphere, the conductive spheres provide an electrical connection between the two objects. However, due to the lateral spacing between the conductive spheres, no substantial electrical connection is provided in a lateral direction which runs between the surfaces of the two objects.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates a variation of the embodiment shown above in which the unit <b>300</b> includes a bonding layer <b>1124</b> which extends from inside the through hole <b>1104</b> to have an extension <b>1126</b> extending on the mounting face <b>1107</b> of the unit <b>300</b>. The extension <b>1126</b> is preferably provided as an annular ring surrounding the through hole <b>1104</b>. The extension <b>1126</b> provides additional surface area for retaining solder <b>1116</b>, prior to and after the unit <b>300</b> is bonded to the circuit panel <b>1119</b>. The extension <b>1126</b> and a larger amount of solder adhering thereto on the unit <b>300</b>, can mitigate against having to provide additional solder on the terminal <b>1120</b> of the circuit panel, as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0222"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates yet another variation in which unit <b>300</b> includes an extension <b>1128</b> of the bonding layer <b>1126</b> on the surface <b>1105</b> of the cap <b>1106</b> which faces the chip <b>1102</b>. During the joining process of the cap to the chip, the extension <b>1128</b> draws solder from inside the through hole <b>1104</b> onto itself to bring it closer to the bond pad <b>1114</b> of the chip <b>1102</b>. This, in turn, assists in forming the bond between the cap <b>1106</b> and the chip <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0223"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-17</figref> illustrate a particular variation of the process described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref> and <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B, or one of the alternatives shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-11B</figref> for making a unit and joining it to a circuit panel. A “lid”, like the “cap” described in the foregoing, refers to an article that is mounted as a cover over the front surface of a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0224">Some types of chips, particularly chips which include an electro-optic device, need to be packaged with a cap which is at least partially optically transmissive. The term “optically transmissive” is used to refer to a material that is either optically transparent or optically translucent in a range of wavelengths of interest, whether such wavelengths of interest are in a visible, infrared or ultraviolet range of the spectrum. For example, electro-optic imaging chips including charge-coupled device (“CCD”) arrays require a lid which includes an optically transmissive package window, in order to prevent dust or other particles from landing on the CCD array, which would optically impair and obscure pixels of the CCD array. Such lid can also be used to protect against damage due to corrosion by atmospheric contaminants, particularly water vapor. The lid can be of any suitable optically transmissive material, including but not limited to glass, polymer and semiconductors. After the chip is joined to the lid, a turret or train assembly containing a lens, and optionally infrared (IR) and/or ultraviolet (UV) filters is joined to the lid, e.g., as by welding, adhesive bonding or use of a fusible material such as solder.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0225">In this variation, a sacrificial coating is applied to a surface of a lid prior to joining the lid to a chip, in order to protect the lid against contamination. The sacrificial coating is then removed later, after steps are performed to join the lid to the chip to form a unit to join that unit to a circuit panel. As above, while the process is described here in terms of joining a lid to a chip, it should also be understood, with appropriate modifications, to apply to the joining of a lid element containing multiple attached lids to a wafer or other substrate which includes multiple attached chips, after which the joined lid element and wafer are severed along dicing lanes to form individually lidded chips.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0226">When a lid is joined to a chip by one of the above-described processes, steps to bond the lid to the chip can introduce contaminating material. Thereafter, steps to join the lidded chip to a circuit panel can introduce further contaminating material. Contamination can result from the environment in which the chip is packaged or, from the nature of the process itself that is used to perform the joining processes. For example, a joining process that involves solder with flux can produce residual material that is undesirable to leave on the surface of the cap. Other methods of bonding a lidded chips</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0227">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a sacrificial coating <b>1252</b> is applied to the surface of an optically transmissive lid <b>1250</b>. The sacrificial coating <b>1252</b> is a material which can be applied and remain through the steps of bonding the lid to the chip, but then be removed to leave the surface of the lid in a clean condition without degrading the condition of the joints of the assembly. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the sacrificial coating includes a photosensitive resist film, suitable for use in subsequent photolithographic patterning of the lid. Such resist film is best chosen with regard to the etchant which will be used to pattern the material of the lid, which can vary between inorganic materials such as glasses and organic materials such as polymers. For example, an etchant such as fluorosilicic acid is suitable for patterning a lid which is formed of glass, especially lids which are formed of a glass which has been doped to facilitate chemical etching such as borosilicate glass. In such case, a spin-on photoresist or hot roll laminate photoresist is suitable for use in etching of glass. Such photoresists are also not degraded by temperatures at which solders melt, nor by fluxes used in soldering processes. However, such photoresists are also readily dissolved and cleared from a surface through organic solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0228"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates the patterned photoresist film <b>1252</b>, after it has been exposed and developed to produce openings <b>1254</b> in the photoresist layer <b>1254</b>. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the lid is etched, using the patterned photoresist film as a mask to produce through holes <b>1256</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0229">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, further steps are performed to deposit bonding layers <b>1258</b> on the sidewalls <b>1260</b> of the through holes. The bonding layers <b>1258</b> are provided for the purpose of permitting a fusible material such as solder, tin, etc. to be bonded to the through holes of the lid <b>1256</b>, in a manner as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>. During the deposition, a contact mask may be placed over the photoresist film <b>1252</b> as needed, to prevent the photoresist film from being sealed within the bonding material, which might interfere with its later removal depending on the type of resist. Such bonding layer is provided, for example, by deposition including electroless plating or electroless plating followed by electroplating. Alternatively, the bonding layer is provided through vapor phase deposition, i.e., any one of many deposition processes such as physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0230">A subsequent stage of fabrication is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, after the lid <b>1250</b> has been joined to a chip <b>1264</b> by a set of electrically conductive interconnects <b>1262</b>, and after the interconnects of the lidded chip have been joined to a circuit panel <b>1264</b>. The circuit panel <b>1264</b> includes an opening <b>1266</b> or, alternatively, a window consisting of an optically transmissive material, disposed in alignment with the electro-optic device <b>1268</b> of the chip <b>1264</b> to provide an optically transmissive path to and from the electro-optic device <b>1268</b>. The circuit panel <b>1264</b> can be of any type, being either rigid, semi-rigid, or-flexible. In one embodiment, the circuit panel <b>1264</b> is flexible and has a flexible dielectric element on which conductive traces are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0231">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, one result of the prior joining processes is unwanted residual matter <b>1270</b>, e.g., particles, flux or adhesive residue, etc., that remains on the surface of the photoresist film <b>1252</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the residual matter is then removed in steps used to remove the photoresist film, such as through washing of the assembled circuit panel and the lidded chip in an organic solvent in which the film is soluble. This results in an assembly <b>1272</b> in which the contaminating material has been removed, and which is now ready for steps to provide a higher order assembly. Thereafter, a turret, train or other optical element, may be mounted above the opening <b>1266</b> in the circuit panel <b>1264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0232">The process shown and described above can be modified in several alternative ways. In one alternative process, the lid is patterned by laser drilling rather than chemical etching. The laser drilling is performed after the sacrificial coating is applied, at which time material ejected from the drilled openings collects on the sacrificial coating. Thereafter, the ejected material is prevented from contaminating the lid when the sacrificial coating is removed from the surface of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0233">In another embodiment, the sacrificial coating need not be a photoresist film and the coating need not patterned to provide a mask for etching through holes in the lid. Rather, in such embodiment, the sacrificial coating is provided on a face of the lid, and thereafter, the lid is mounted to the chip, such as through a sealing medium or fusible conductive medium as described above. The lidded chip is then mounted to an additional element such as a circuit panel, or alternatively, a turret, or ‘train’, as described above. Thereafter, the sacrificial coating is removed, removing with it residual matter remaining from the prior steps used to mount the lid to the chip and the lidded chip to the additional element.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0234">In a particular form of such embodiment, the sacrificial coating is one that is mechanically releasable from the surface of the lid, such as by peeling. For example, such film can be provided of an adhesively backed plastic, polymeric film capable of withstanding the processes used to join the lid to the chip and that which joins the combined unit to another element. For example, materials such as those used in the adhesive of removable self-stick notepaper and in food-wrap film appear suited for this purpose. Alternatively, the peelable film can be a metal such as molybdenum or other metal or other rigid or semi-rigid polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0235">A limiting factor of the embodiments described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, for example, is that the lateral spacing between adjacent through holes might not be optimal. Increasing integration density of chips and corresponding decreases in the spacing between adjacent bond pads of a chip demand that a cap to be mounted to the chip have correspondingly decreased spacing between interconnects. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the through holes <b>104</b>, of the cap <b>102</b> are shown tapered only from the top surface <b>105</b> of the cap, such that a sidewall <b>107</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is oriented at an angle typically ranging from about 5 degrees to 70 degrees from the vertical (the vertical being the direction which is normal to the top surface <b>105</b>). More preferably, the angle of the sidewall (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the vertical is between 20 degrees to 60 degrees and, most preferably at an angle between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, such that the diameter of the through holes <b>104</b> varies between a smaller diameter <b>330</b> at the bottom surface <b>103</b> and a larger diameter <b>335</b> at the top surface <b>105</b>. Typically, a wet chemical etching process applied to the cap wafer <b>100</b> which consists essentially of silicon results in the sidewall <b>107</b> making an angle to the vertical of between 20 and 60 degrees. However, laser drilling is another process used to form through holes in a cap wafer which is provided, for example, of silicon, glass, ceramic or other similar material, typically results in an angle of 7 degrees relative to the normal. The angle that the sidewall makes with the top surface <b>105</b> is desirably made small, in order to reduce the amount of area occupied by each interconnect, due to the increased pitch of through holes that have a larger angle, as is described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The variation in diameters between the through hole at the top surface <b>105</b> with respect to the bottom surface <b>103</b> assists the fabrication method as a way of initially holding the solder ball <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) (which is larger than the smaller diameter <b>330</b>) in place inside the through hole <b>104</b>. Depending upon the thickness of the cap <b>102</b>, which, illustratively, ranges between 100 and 300 μm, and the smaller diameter <b>330</b> of the through holes, which is typically on the order of 70 to 100 μm, the larger diameter <b>335</b> of the through holes may range from twice as large to many times larger than the smaller diameter <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0236">When considered in terms of forming interconnects to closely spaced bond pads <b>208</b> of a chip <b>202</b>, it is seen that the larger diameters <b>335</b> of the through holes at the top surface <b>305</b> of the cap may well limit the spacing at which such interconnects <b>303</b> can be made. This concept is best illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates three individual caps <b>400</b>, <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, respectively, in which through holes <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, and <b>414</b>, respectively, have been patterned differently, and in which the pitch between adjacent through holes varies significantly according to the method used to pattern the caps. Thus, cap <b>400</b>, having through holes <b>410</b> which are tapered from only one surface, i.e., the top surface <b>405</b>, has the largest pitch <b>407</b>, because of the large diameter <b>403</b> of the through holes <b>410</b> that exist at the top surface <b>405</b>. Through holes are ordinarily tapered from one surface of the cap by isotropic etching from that one surface. On the other hand, cap <b>402</b> has smaller pitch <b>409</b> because its through holes are tapered from both the top surface <b>415</b> and the bottom surface <b>417</b> of the cap <b>402</b>, such that the profile of the through holes includes an internal edge <b>413</b>. Such taper is typically achieved by etching the through holes <b>412</b> simultaneously and isotropically from both the top and bottom surfaces of the cap <b>402</b>. In some cases, depending upon the degree to which the through hole is etched in a lateral direction (being the direction parallel to the diameter <b>409</b>) the internal edge <b>413</b> can acquire the appearance of a “knife edge”. Cap <b>404</b> illustrates a case in which through holes <b>414</b> are patterned without tapering, having straight, vertical sidewalls. The pitch <b>419</b> of through holes <b>414</b> of the cap <b>404</b> is the smallest of the pitches <b>407</b>, <b>409</b>, <b>419</b>, because of the straight, vertical profile of the through holes <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0237">However, the profiles of the through holes of cap <b>402</b> and cap <b>404</b> are such that they do not permit the same techniques to be used as described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3D</figref> when joining the cap <b>402</b> or <b>404</b> to a chip. Solderable metallizations cannot be easily provided on sidewalls of the through holes <b>412</b> of cap <b>404</b> by the patterning processes described above, which are conventionally used in conjunction with vapor phase deposition and wet electrochemical processes to make the tapered through holes as described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3D</figref>. These patterning processes cannot be performed from just the top surface <b>415</b> or the bottom surface <b>417</b> of the cap, because patterning will be achieved only on surfaces that face up, i.e. only the surface of the through hole above the internal edge <b>413</b> and upward, including the top surface <b>415</b> of the cap <b>402</b>. This precludes the portion of the through hole below the internal edge <b>413</b>, i.e., facing towards the bottom surface <b>417</b> from being properly metallized. In the case of cap <b>404</b>, the vertical, straight profile of the sidewall <b>418</b> of the through hole <b>414</b> makes it difficult to achieve a suitable metallization. However, in the case of cap <b>402</b>, the knife-edge through hole profile can still be used to form a capped chip having electrical interconnects which include stud bumps extending from the bond pads, similar to that described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In such case, only the portion of the through hole <b>412</b> that is tapered towards the top surface <b>415</b> need be metallized. This requires the stud bump (<b>662</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) to protrude upwardly through the through hole <b>412</b> past the knife-edge <b>413</b> in the cap <b>402</b>. On the other hand, the necessity for the through hole <b>412</b> to have a bonding layer <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) on the sidewall thereof is diminished if another flowable conductive medium such as an organic medium is used in place of the solder.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0238"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 through 22</figref> illustrate stages in a method of joining a cap to a chip according to one embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a cap <b>500</b> in an inverted position during fabrication, the cap <b>500</b> having a bottom or inner surface <b>502</b>, a top or outer surface <b>504</b>, and through holes <b>510</b>. These designations of the bottom (inner) and top (outer) surfaces refer to the orientation in which the cap will be mounted to the chip, when steps to complete the bonding of the cap to the chip are performed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-22</figref>. In this embodiment, the through holes are preferably tapered so as to become progressively smaller from the bottom surface toward the top surface. As such, the tapered through holes are substantially frusto-conical in shape. The tapering of the through holes <b>510</b> is not absolutely necessary. Tapered through holes assist in achieving some of the potential benefits available by the joining process, as will be apparent from the description below.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0239">In this inverted position, solderable metallizations <b>515</b> are formed on the sidewalls <b>520</b> of the through holes <b>510</b>, as by conventional vapor-phase or wet electrochemical processing directed towards the bottom surface of the cap <b>500</b>, as described above. In one embodiment, the solderable metallizations optionally extend onto a portion <b>525</b> of the bottom surface of the cap <b>500</b> surrounding each through hole.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates processing performed to a chip <b>600</b> to which cap <b>500</b> is to be mounted, the chip having solder-wettable bond pads <b>606</b>, a device region <b>602</b> and wiring <b>604</b> interconnecting the device region <b>602</b> to the bond pads. A conductive ball <b>610</b> is placed on each metallized bond pad, preferably by a fluxless process, in order to avoid flux vapor and residue therefrom from potentially contaminating features at the surface of the chip <b>600</b>, e.g. the device area <b>602</b>. A process is then conducted to bond the conductive ball <b>610</b> to the chip <b>600</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the conductive ball is a solder ball, consisting essentially of a solder or other fusible conductive material, e.g., one or more of tin, lead, or eutectic composition or layered arrangement of such metals or other metals, which is adapted to generally soften or liquefy upon being heated to a reflowing temperature, which is relatively low. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the chip after a solder ball <b>610</b> has been placed on each bond pad <b>606</b> and bonded thereto by a process which is characterizable as “reflowing”. After reflowing, the solder balls typically retain a shape that is essentially spherical. The temperature of the solder balls is then lowered again for the performance of a subsequent step in which the cap <b>500</b> is aligned to the chip <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0241"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates such further stage in the process. In this stage, the chip <b>600</b> is placed such that the front surface <b>601</b> faces up. The cap <b>500</b> is turned over, such that the bottom surface <b>502</b> of the cap now faces down, toward the front surface <b>601</b> of the chip <b>600</b>. At this stage, the metallized substantially frusto-conical through holes <b>510</b> of the cap <b>500</b> assist in aligning the cap <b>500</b> to the chip <b>600</b> in a self-locating manner. This occurs as follows. Rough alignment is achieved between the cap <b>500</b> and the chip <b>600</b>, such that any misalignment is less than the spacing between the centerlines of the through holes. If the cap <b>500</b> is then allowed to rest on, the chip <b>600</b>, the through holes <b>510</b> will align themselves to the solder balls <b>610</b>, causing the through holes of the cap <b>500</b> to drop down onto the solder balls <b>610</b>, thus self-locating the through holes <b>510</b> to the solder balls <b>610</b>. Misalignment between the cap <b>500</b> and the chip <b>600</b> is subject to variation in two horizontal degrees of freedom (X) and (Y), in three rotational degrees of freedom: turning in the horizontal plane (yaw), forward or backward tilt (pitch) and side-to-side tilt (roll), and in a vertical degree of freedom, i.e. vertical displacement (Z). The self-locating mechanism described herein aligns the cap to the chip with respect to all of these degrees of freedom at the time that the cap <b>500</b> is placed on the chip <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0242">In the stage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a process is conducted to bond the conductive balls <b>610</b> to the metallizations provided in the cap <b>500</b>. When the conductive balls are solder balls <b>610</b>, this is preferably conducted as a reflowing process, which causes the material of the solder balls <b>610</b> to be drawn further into the through holes <b>510</b>. As a result of this reflowing process, the solder balls <b>610</b> preferably extend somewhat above the top surface <b>504</b> of the cap <b>500</b>. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the cap <b>500</b> is desirably sealed to the chip <b>600</b> by a sealing material <b>810</b> which surrounds the device region and the region which includes the bond pads of the chip <b>600</b>. The sealing material preferably includes a material such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0243">During such reflowing process, due to the fluid nature of the solder balls <b>610</b>, means preferably are provided for maintaining a desirable vertical spacing between the opposed surfaces <b>502</b>, <b>601</b> of the cap and the chip. In one embodiment, one or more spacer elements are incorporated into the sealing material. For example, an adhesive sealing material can include spherical or fibrous elements which deform little, thus maintaining a predetermined spacing between the opposed surfaces. In a particular embodiment, a spacer structure is incorporated into one or the other of the cap and the chip. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a spacer may take the form of a ridge <b>900</b> formed as part of the cap <b>500</b>, the ridge <b>900</b> having a knife-edge <b>902</b>, which is allowed to rest on the front surface <b>601</b> of the chip <b>600</b>. A sealing material <b>910</b>, such as an adhesive, can be disposed in contact with the ridge <b>900</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Otherwise, the sealing material can be displaced from the location of the ridge <b>900</b>. The ridge <b>900</b> allows the cap <b>500</b> to be pressed to the chip, e.g., pressure clamped, during the joining process for any of the above-listed sealing materials, while the ridge maintains a desired spacing between the cap <b>500</b> and the chip <b>600</b>. When the above processing is performed simultaneously on an array of attached chips and attached caps, the packaged chips are thereafter diced, i.e., severed into individual packaged chips.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0244"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a variation of the embodiment described above, in which the metallization of the cap to provide a bonding layer extends as an annular structure <b>1004</b> disposed on the bottom surface <b>1002</b> of a cap <b>1000</b>. In one embodiment, an annular structure <b>1004</b> is formed by deposition through widened openings of a masking layer (not shown) on the cap through which material is deposited in an additive process to form the metallization, in comparison to those used to form the metallizations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the annular structure <b>1004</b> can be formed by decreasing the size of mask patterns disposed between the annular structures, when metallization patterns are formed by a subtractive process following the formation of a metallization layer over the cap. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates a packaged chip <b>1150</b> showing a further variation in which the conductive balls <b>1144</b> are of a type which remain substantially rigid upon heating to a bonding temperature, or have a core which remains substantially rigid. In such embodiment, the conductive balls <b>1144</b> are used to maintain a desirable vertical spacing between the cap <b>1000</b> and the chip <b>1142</b>. A solder bond or diffusion bond can be provided between a metal disposed at an exterior of the conductive ball and the metallization layer <b>1001</b> of the cap <b>1000</b> and also between such metal and the metallization <b>1141</b> of the chip, for example. Joining at this location may also be accomplished using an electrically conductive organic material.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0245">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, solder or other conductive material <b>1145</b> is provided to fill the space between the conductive ball and the top surface <b>1006</b> of the cap <b>1000</b>. In a particular embodiment, an additional seal <b>1130</b> can be provided over the peripheral edges <b>1042</b>, <b>1140</b> of the cap and the chip, respectively, by depositing an additional sealing material. The additional seal <b>1130</b>, which desirably also covers the already provided sealing material <b>910</b>, may be provided for the purpose of achieving hermeticity, electrical isolation, or other such purpose. The additional seal also preferably extends onto the top surface <b>1006</b> of the cap and the rear surface <b>1146</b> of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a further embodiment in which the packaged chip <b>1150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is mounted to a circuit panel <b>1202</b> having one or more terminals <b>1204</b> and traces <b>1206</b> disposed thereon. The mounting shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is through a solder bond between the solder or other conductive material <b>1145</b> present at the top surface <b>1006</b> of the cap <b>1000</b> and masses <b>1205</b> of solder disposed on the terminals <b>1204</b> of the circuit panel <b>1202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0247">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, another embodiment of a method of making a capped chip having vertical interconnects is shown in which the through holes <b>1310</b> of a cap <b>1300</b> are not required to have solderable metallizations prior to the cap <b>1300</b> being joined to the chip <b>1302</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates a case in which the through holes <b>1310</b> of the cap <b>1300</b> are tapered from both the top surface <b>1303</b> and the bottom surface <b>1305</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In this embodiment, the chip <b>1302</b> has stud bumps <b>1320</b> disposed on bond pads <b>1330</b>. The stud bumps <b>1320</b> provide a surface for bonding of solder or other conductive material to form a vertical interconnect extending upwardly from a chip <b>1302</b>. As described in relation to other embodiments above, a “picture frame” ring-seal <b>1340</b> seals the gap between the chip and the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0248">The stud bumps <b>1320</b> are desirably tapered, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, as can be provided according to several processes known to those skilled in the art. In this embodiment, the stud bump desirably has a shaft diameter <b>1315</b> which is close to the mashed ball diameter obtained during the application of the stud bump, and a length <b>1325</b> that exceeds the thickness of a sealing material <b>1340</b> that seals the cap <b>1300</b> to the chip <b>1302</b>. For example, the stud bumps can be such as those shown and made according to the process described in U.S. patent Publication No. US 2003/0159276 A1, published Aug. 28, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Tapered stud bumps are more capable of retaining their upwardly extending shape when the cap <b>1300</b> is placed over the chip <b>1302</b>, such that the stud bumps <b>1320</b> are more likely to maintain registration with the through holes <b>1310</b>, than if the stud bumps had a narrow, much more deformable profile. As such, the stud bumps assist the cap <b>1300</b> in becoming aligned to the chip <b>1302</b> in a self-locating manner, at least on a side-to-side basis, i.e., in at least the X and Y degrees of freedom. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, when a through hole <b>1310</b><i>a </i>is not in perfect alignment with a stud bump <b>1320</b><i>a</i>, the taper of the through hole <b>1310</b><i>a </i>allows the stud bump <b>1320</b><i>a </i>to deform somewhat, thus allowing it to at least enter the through hole <b>1310</b><i>a</i>. Desirably, stud bumps <b>1320</b> protrude through the through hole to extend above the top surface <b>1303</b> of the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref> illustrates a variation of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, in which the through holes have a straight, vertical profile, rather than being tapered from both sides, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, the top surface <b>1403</b> of the cap is optionally provided with a solderable metallization <b>1410</b>. The solderable metallization is preferably provided as an annular structure surrounding each through hole. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref> illustrate two stages of processing. In an earlier stage of processing, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, a solder ball <b>1420</b> is disposed on the metallization <b>1410</b>, as placed thereon by a prior solder ball stenciling process. A subsequent stage of processing, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>, illustrates the reflowed solder ball <b>1430</b> as joined to the stud bump <b>1320</b> by a subsequent reflowing process. During such reflowing process, the solder ball <b>1430</b> is drawn onto the surface of the stud bump <b>1320</b> by a solder-wettable metal present at the surface of the stud bump such as gold, tin or platinum. As a result, the solder forms a continuous solid electrically conductive mass connecting the stud bump to the bonding layer <b>1410</b> of the cap and sealing the cap at the through hole <b>1430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0250">In a variation of the above process, the solder ball <b>1420</b> is placed on the metallization <b>1410</b> of the cap <b>1400</b> and bonded thereto to form a solder bump, prior to the through holes <b>1405</b> of the cap being aligned to the stud bumps <b>1420</b> provided on a chip <b>1402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0251"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref> illustrates a further embodiment; in which external interconnects above the cap <b>1500</b> are not soldered to the top surface <b>1502</b> of the cap. In this case, a sealing material <b>1505</b> such as an organic material which can either be conductive, or nonconductive, e.g. an adhesive material, is applied to the cap <b>1500</b> to cover the through holes <b>1506</b> at the top surface <b>1502</b>. After the cap <b>1500</b> is placed over the chip <b>1501</b> and aligned thereto, the cap <b>1500</b> and the chip <b>1501</b> are pressed together, causing the peaks <b>1510</b> of the stud bumps <b>1516</b> to penetrate through the sealing material. In yet another alternative embodiment, the sealing material <b>1505</b> can be deposited onto the top surface <b>1502</b> of the cap <b>1500</b> after the through holes <b>1506</b> have been aligned to the stud bumps <b>1516</b> and then the sealing material is etched back, leaving the peaks <b>1510</b> of the stud bumps substantially free of the sealing material. In still another alternative, the sealing material <b>1502</b> may be applied around the circumference of the stud bump <b>1516</b>. Thereafter, further steps are taken to complete the interconnections. For example, a solder ball <b>1530</b> can be bonded to the stud bump <b>1516</b> to provide a surface to form a further interconnection, such as to a circuit panel, e.g., such as shown and described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 11B</figref>. Alternatively, the stud bump can be contacted by a sliding or deformable mechanical contact <b>1540</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates yet another variation, in which the stud bumps <b>1516</b>, which may further include a solder or other joining material applied thereto, are planarized to the top surface <b>1502</b> of the cap <b>1500</b>, after the cap <b>1500</b> is aligned and joined thereto. The planarized surfaces of the stud bumps <b>1516</b> thus form a land grid array for interconnection of the cap <b>1500</b> to further elements such as a circuit panel (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0253"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref> illustrate yet another alternative embodiment in which a cap <b>1602</b>, is aligned to and placed over a chip <b>1600</b> having a stud bump provided on bond pad <b>1604</b>, and thereafter deformed under pressure until the stud bump engages the sidewall <b>1607</b> of the through hole <b>1606</b>. In such way, the stud bump is ‘coined’ into engagement with the through hole <b>1606</b> in a metal forming operation similar to riveting. In this embodiment, the cap <b>1602</b> need not have a solder-wettable metallization in the through hole <b>1606</b> or on the top surface <b>1605</b> of the cap <b>1602</b> surrounding the through hole. The stud bump is desirably provided of a highly malleable metal such as gold or alloy thereof, which tends to retain the same shape after being worked in a cold-pressed manner. When such malleable metal is used, the resulting coined stud bump may provide a seal of sufficient integrity to the through hole of the cap. Alternatively, an additional fusible material such as solder or tin can thereafter be deposited and reflowed to seal top surface <b>1605</b> of the cap at the through hole, such as when hermeticity is needed. When the stud bump is formed of gold, a fusible material such as solder or tin forms a permanent solid bond.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0254"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-34B</figref> illustrate a particular method of simultaneously forming peripheral “picture frame” ring seals between multiple caps of a cap element, e.g., cap wafer, and multiple chips, such as are still attached in wafer form. In this method, the ring seal is formed by aligning the multiple cap element above a wafer containing the chips and providing a flowable sealing material through an opening in a top surface of the cap element. The sealing material is then allowed or caused to flow down onto the surface of the chips below, at which time the sealing material then seals the individual chips to the caps of the cap element. Thereafter, the cap element and the wafer joined thereto are separated into individually capped chips by severing chips along dicing lanes between each chip.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a top-down view illustrating a plurality of chips <b>1700</b> each having a device region <b>1702</b> provided thereon. Chips having sensitive device regions require caps such as those described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>. Picture frame ring seals <b>1704</b> are provided in order to seal the chips to the caps, preferably when the chips are still in wafer form, as one way of protecting against the possibility of degradation to the devices thereon. A method of simultaneously forming seals surrounding a device region of the chips will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A-B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref> is a top-down view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the structure of a cap <b>1710</b>, such as may be provided as part of a multiple cap element used in this embodiment. The cap <b>1710</b> includes ring-like troughs <b>1712</b> which are shown overlying a bonding layer <b>1714</b> provided on a front surface of a chip which is disposed below the cap <b>1710</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>, the troughs <b>1712</b> extend all the way through the cap <b>1710</b> from the top surface <b>1716</b> to the bottom surface <b>1718</b> of the cap, and is tapered to become smaller in the direction from the top surface towards the bottom surface. A bonding layer <b>1726</b>, e.g., a solder-wettable metallization, is provided on sidewalls of the trough <b>1712</b> as a surface to which a fusible material such as solder wets and fuses to provide a solid bond.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0257">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>, the troughs <b>1712</b> extend to almost completely surround a central portion <b>1720</b> of the cap which overlies a device region of the chip, the trough being connected to the central portion <b>1720</b> by bridges <b>1722</b>. In a method similar to that described above for making interconnects with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, a fusible material is provided in the trough and then caused to flow along the sidewalls of the trough down onto the bonding layer <b>1714</b> of the chip <b>1700</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0258">In an alternative embodiment, a low-melting point glass or other suitable material may be placed and flowed downward through the trough to make the seal, in a manner similar to a fusible conductive material. In yet another alternative embodiment, a fluid organic adhesive may be utilized as the sealing material instead of a fusible conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates a variation of the above-described embodiment in which asset of discrete through holes <b>1812</b> are provided in caps <b>1810</b> of a cap element <b>1800</b>, rather than a trough as described above. As shown therein, the cap <b>1810</b> is disposed overlying a chip having a central device region <b>1802</b>, bond pads <b>1806</b> and wiring <b>1806</b> connecting the device region <b>1802</b> to the bond pads <b>1806</b>, as shown in dotted outline form. The chip includes a bonding layer <b>1814</b> disposed in an annular pattern surrounding the bond pads <b>1806</b> and device region <b>1802</b> of the chip. In this embodiment, the discrete through holes <b>1812</b> facilitate the delivery of a more precisely controlled amount of solder to the bonding layer <b>1814</b> of the chip, by way of solder balls which are sized to be placed at or within the through holes, in a manner such as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. To achieve a good ring seal between the chip and the cap, neither too little solder nor too much solder should be provided to the bonding layer. Too little solder can cause the seal between the chip and the cap to have voids and possible gaps which would permit air or other fluids, e.g., water vapor to reach the device region <b>1802</b> of the chip. On the other hand, too much solder could cause the solder to spread beyond the boundaries of the bonding layer to cause a short circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0260">Accordingly, in this embodiment, solder balls are placed in the through holes and heated to cause the fusible material to flow laterally along the bonding layer <b>1814</b> of the chip and a corresponding bonding layer (not shown) of the cap to form a seal which at least substantially surrounds the bond pads <b>1804</b> and the device region <b>1802</b> of the chip. By judicious choice of the dimensions of the bonding layer and the size of the solder balls, a precisely metered amount of solder can be distributed to the bonding surfaces. The steps used to form the seal are similar to those described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref> or <b>6</b>A-B for forming electrical interconnects through holes in a chip. Thus, in one embodiment, the solder balls used to form the ring seal are placed in the through holes <b>1812</b> at or near the time that solder balls used to form the interconnects are placed in the through holes overlying the bond pads <b>1802</b>, and then all of the solder balls are melted together by one heating operation to form the ring seal at the same time as conductive interconnects are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0261"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A-B</figref> illustrate yet another alternative in which fewer through holes <b>1912</b> are provided in caps <b>1902</b> of a multiple cap element <b>1900</b>. The through holes <b>1912</b> are also provided at boundaries between respective chips, thereby greatly decreasing the number of through holes <b>1912</b> necessary to form the seal of each chip covered by the cap element. The bonding ring layer <b>1914</b> of each chip is provided on the front surface along the periphery of the chip <b>1902</b> so as to permit the flow of solder from within a given through hole <b>1912</b> onto the bonding layer <b>1914</b> to seal the respective chip, thus forming a structure as shown in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>. Note, that as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, a bonding ring layer <b>1920</b> is disposed on the bottom surface <b>1922</b> of the cap, as a corresponding wettable metallization onto which the molten solder spreads during the process of reflowing the solder from the solder balls to form the seal. The bond pads <b>1802</b> and the conductive interconnects <b>1924</b> joined thereto are desirably formed simultaneously with the formation of the ring seal by placing the solder balls in the through holes <b>1912</b> at or near the same time that solder balls are placed in through holes <b>1932</b> used to form the interconnects. Thereafter, a simultaneous heating step can be used to form the electrical interconnects and the ring seal.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0262">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, a packaged microelectronic device according to another embodiment of the invention incorporates a package structure including a dielectric interposer <b>30</b> having electrically conductive traces <b>32</b> extending along the bottom surface <b>31</b> of the dielectric element. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the dielectric element incorporates an aperture or window <b>36</b>. Terminals in the form of electrically conductive posts <b>38</b> project downwardly from the bottom surface <b>31</b> of the dielectric element, and are electrically connected to traces <b>32</b>. A dielectric element with posts thereon can be formed, for example, by assembling a metallic sheet or plate having projecting posts thereon with a dielectric layer, and etching the sheet or plate to form the traces. The traces may be disposed on either the bottom surface <b>31</b> or the top surface <b>33</b> of the dielectric element, or within the dielectric element.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0263">A unit <b>10</b> as discussed above is assembled with the package structure so that the top surface <b>24</b> of the cover faces upwardly toward the bottom surface <b>31</b> of the interposer <b>30</b>. The unit connections <b>18</b> are electrically connected to the traces <b>31</b>, and hence to terminals or posts <b>38</b>. The active area <b>21</b> of the chip is aligned with the window <b>36</b> in the interposer. For example, where active area <b>21</b> is an optical detector or emitter, the active area can accept or send light through window <b>36</b>. In other embodiments, as, for example, where the active area is a MEMS structure, window <b>36</b> may be omitted. The bottom surface <b>13</b> of the chip incorporated in unit <b>10</b> faces downwardly, and defines a theoretical horizontal bottom plane <b>40</b> at the level of such bottom surface. The height of posts <b>38</b> desirably is greater than the thickness or vertical extent of unit <b>10</b>, so that posts <b>38</b> project downwardly beyond bottom plane <b>40</b>. Thus, the unit connections <b>18</b>, and hence the electrical connections to chip <b>11</b>, are effectively routed to a plane below unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0264">The package can be mounted on a circuit panel <b>50</b> having contact pads <b>52</b> thereon, as, for example, by soldering the tips of the posts <b>38</b> to the contact pads using conventional surface-mounting soldering techniques. In the completed assembly, unit <b>10</b> is positioned with its top surface (the top surface <b>24</b> of lid <b>12</b>) facing upwardly away from circuit panel <b>50</b>. Because the interposer <b>30</b> is larger in plan area than the package, this affords the possibility of the metal posts having a diameter and pitch that is suited for attachment of the structure to a PCB (printed circuit board). Preferably, the interposer <b>30</b> or the posts <b>38</b> have some degree of mechanical compliance, so that the structure is able to accommodate differences in the height of individual pins or nonplanarity of the circuit panel during assembly and/or testing. The mechanical compliance desirably accommodates thermal expansion mismatch between the circuit panel and the unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0265">A packaged device according to a further embodiment of the invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) includes a unit <b>10</b> as discussed above, together with a package structure including a dielectric element having a bottom run <b>102</b> extending beneath the rear surface <b>13</b> of the chip incorporated in the unit and hence extending beneath the bottom plane <b>40</b> defined by the unit. The dielectric element further includes a fold region <b>104</b> projecting upwardly from the bottom run and a top run <b>106</b> extending from the fold region. The dielectric element preferably is a flexible dielectric film having one or more layers of electrically conductive traces <b>105</b> extending along the film. The traces extend from the bottom run, along the fold region to the top run. Unit <b>10</b> is disposed between the top run <b>106</b> and bottom run <b>102</b> of the folded dielectric element. Bottom run <b>102</b> has terminals <b>108</b> connected to traces <b>105</b>. Terminals <b>108</b> are exposed through holes <b>109</b> at the bottom surface <b>110</b> of the bottom run, which defines the bottom surface of the packaged device. The unit connections <b>18</b> of the unit <b>10</b> are bonded to traces <b>105</b> on the top run <b>106</b>, and hence are electrically connected to terminals <b>108</b>. The bond between the unit connections and the traces mechanically secures unit <b>10</b> to the top run. Additional elements such as an adhesive between the top surface of the unit and top run <b>106</b> may be provided for further securement. Alternatively or additionally, the bottom surface of the unit may be secured to the bottom run. An encapsulant (not shown) may be provided in the space between the runs of the dielectric element, around the unit. Folded package elements for conventional semiconductor chips are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,688 and in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/077,388, filed Feb. 15, 2002; Ser. No. 10/640,177, filed Aug. 13, 2003; Ser. No. 60/515,313, filed Oct. 29, 2003; and Ser. No. 10/654,375, filed Sep. 3, 2003 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Similar structures and techniques can be used in the folded package for a chip and lid unit. Here again, package terminals <b>108</b> may have a different layout in plan than the unit connections <b>18</b>, and the package terminals may have a larger pitch than the unit connections. The packaged device may be secured to a printed circuit panel as, for example, by solder-bonding the terminals <b>108</b> to the contact pads of the circuit panel. The terminals <b>108</b> may be arranged in a layout which facilitates surface mounting, with adequate terminal size and pitch. A wide range of dimensions and pitches may be used to suit any desired application as, for example, to fit a standard pad layout. Furthermore the package structure desirably provides mechanical compliance such that it is able to safely absorb the differential strain mismatch between the circuit panel and the unit arising from the differential thermal expansion during manufacture and during service. Here again, the unit can be mounted readily with the top surface <b>24</b> of the unit facing upwardly away from the circuit panel. A window <b>116</b> optionally may be provided in the top run <b>106</b> of the dielectric element to permit reception of light or other energy through the top run and through the lid of the unit. As described in the aforementioned incorporated applications, a folded package structure may also define top package terminals (not shown) exposed at the upwardly-facing surface of top run <b>106</b>. Some or all of the top package terminals are connected to some or all of the traces <b>105</b> and, hence, to some or all of the unit connections <b>18</b>, to some or all of the bottom package terminals <b>108</b>, or both. The top package terminals can be used for testing or for attaching a further microelectronic element as further discussed below, as for example, to stack several packaged devices. The packages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, discussed above, and of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 and 40</figref> can also be provided with top package terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0266">The packaged device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is generally similar to that discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, except that the package terminals <b>138</b> exposed at the bottom surface <b>132</b> of the interposer <b>130</b> are in the form of flat pads rather than downwardly-projecting posts. Thus, the terminals themselves do not project downwardly beyond the bottom plane <b>40</b> of unit <b>10</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, additional elements in the form of masses <b>150</b> of a bonding material such as, for example, conventional solder balls are provided in contact with the terminals. These additional elements or masses <b>105</b> project downwardly beyond the bottom plane. The additional elements or masses <b>150</b> can be provided as part of the packaged device, or may be added during assembly to a circuit panel as, for example, by providing the masses on the contact pads of the circuit panel prior to mounting the packaged device. The additional elements or masses desirably have a height or vertical extent greater than the thickness of unit <b>10</b>. The additional elements or masses <b>150</b> desirably provide substantial mechanical compliance. Elements other than solder conventional solder spheres may be used. For example, elements commonly referred to as solid-core solder balls, having a core formed from a high-melting metal such as copper covered by a layer of solder may be used. In a further variant, the core of such a ball may be hollow or may include a polymeric or other non-metallic material covered by a thin layer of metal, which in turn may be covered by a solder. In yet another variant, the additional elements or masses <b>150</b> may be masses of a polymer-based conductive material as, for example, a metal-filled solder. In yet another variant, the additional elements may be provided as pins (not shown) projecting upwardly from the circuit panel or as contacts on a socket which, in turn, is surface-mounted to the circuit panel.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0267">The interposer <b>130</b> may be rigid, in the case of a direct-bonded copper (DBC) ceramic substrate, semi flexible, for example a PCB, or fully flexible, as typified by a dielectric film. The choice of material for the planar interposer will depend on the application. For example, a flexible dielectric film will help absorb thermal expansion mismatch between the PCB and the wafer scale package, while a DBC substrate will be mechanically robust and facilitate the removal of heat from the package. The planar interposer is larger in plan area than the unit <b>10</b>, and hence trace <b>132</b> routes unit connections <b>18</b> to a layout which is different from, and larger than, the layout of the unit connections. Traces <b>132</b> may be provided on either or both sides of interposer <b>130</b>, or within the thickness of the interposer. Where the terminals are disposed above plane of the interposer bottom surface <b>132</b>, the terminals are exposed at the bottom surface of the interposer through holes (not shown) extending partially or fully through the interposer. Here again, the interposer may have an aperture in the region of the unit to facilitate assembly of the structure or provide a passageway for radiation between the unit and the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0268">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the package structure includes a planar interposer <b>230</b> similar to those used in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 39</figref>, discussed above, and also includes a spacer <b>202</b> disposed beneath a peripheral region of the interposer, outside of the area occupied by unit <b>10</b>. The spacer projects downwardly from the interposer, and downwardly beyond the bottom plane <b>40</b> defined by unit <b>10</b>. The bottom surface <b>204</b> of the spacer defines a part of the bottom surface of the packaged device. Spacer <b>202</b> is formed from a dielectric material, and has package terminals <b>206</b> disposed on spacer bottom surface <b>204</b>. Package terminals <b>206</b> are electrically connected by vertical conductors <b>208</b> carried on spacer <b>202</b> to traces <b>232</b> on the interposer. Thus, the package terminals <b>206</b> are electrically connected to unit connections <b>18</b>. For example, spacer <b>202</b> may include one or more layers of a dielectric material such as a ceramic or polymeric circuit board having through vias formed therein and partially or completely filled by a conductive material forming the vertical conductors <b>208</b>. In this arrangement, the package structure including interposer <b>230</b> and spacer <b>202</b> defines a cavity to accommodate unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0269">In another arrangement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), the package structure incorporates a lead frame having generally ‘S’-shaped leads <b>302</b>. Leads <b>302</b> have portions <b>304</b> overlying the top surface <b>24</b> of the unit, these portions being connected to unit connections. <b>18</b>. The leads <b>302</b> also have downwardly-extending portions <b>306</b>, and terminal portions <b>308</b>. The terminal portions have exposed surfaces <b>310</b> forming the package terminals. These package terminals are disposed below the bottom plane <b>40</b> of unit <b>10</b>, and are exposed at the bottom surface of the package defined by the bottom surface of the unit. In the embodiment illustrated, the terminal portions project outwardly in horizontal directions. The downwardly-extending portions <b>306</b> also may slope outwardly. The package structure optionally may include an overmold or encapsulant <b>320</b> surrounding the leads and unit and further securing the leads in place. The overmold or encapsulant <b>320</b> should not cover the surfaces <b>310</b> of the terminal portions, so that these surfaces remain exposed for mounting. The overmold may terminate at or above the bottom plane <b>40</b> of the unit, or may extend below the unit. In a further variant, the downwardly-extending portions <b>306</b> of the leads can be attached to the sides of unit <b>10</b> as, for example, by a dielectric adhesive, where additional mechanical support is required. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the lead portions <b>304</b> are shown as directly connected to unit connections <b>18</b> so that these connections physically attach the lead frame to the unit. However, the lead portions <b>304</b> may be connected to the unit connections by intermediate elements as, for example, by wire bonds. The techniques commonly employed to join a lead frame with a chip may be used to join the lead frame with unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0270">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the leads route and fan out the electrical connections to or below the bottom plane of the unit, provided the lead frame height exceeds the package thickness. The lead frame can be made to possess a certain degree of compliancy and thereby accommodate thermal expansion mismatch between the wafer scale package and the circuit panel. Also, it is possible to extend the lead frame in plan area to provide fan out and achieve connection to the circuit panel at a coarser pitch than the interconnects to the wafer scale package.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0271">The embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is generally similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, except that the terminal portions <b>428</b> of the leads constituting lead frame <b>422</b> extend inwardly from the downwardly-extending portions <b>426</b>, so that the terminal portions <b>428</b>, and hence the exposed portions <b>421</b> constituting the package terminals, are disposed within the area occupied by unit <b>10</b>. Thus, the packaged device as a whole may occupy an area which is approximately the same as, or only slightly larger than, that occupied by unit <b>10</b>. The leads of lead frame <b>422</b> may be resilient, and may be held in place on unit <b>10</b> in whole or in part by resilient engagement with the unit. The unit is resiliently engaged between the terminal portions <b>428</b> and the top portions <b>424</b> of the leads. Alternatively or additionally, the leads can be affixed by solder, glass or an organic adhesive on any or all of the faces of the package that they touch. A similar structure can be made using a flexible tape with traces thereon wrapped around the edges of the unit. A structure with a flexible tape wrapped around edges of a chip is disclosed in certain embodiments of U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,159, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. For applications where fan-out is required, the metal leads or tape can be provided with extensions than protrude outside of the plan area of the package. In a further variant, an overmold or encapsulant (not shown) may cover the leads and the unit, but desirably does not cover the exposed surfaces <b>421</b> of terminal portions <b>428</b> of the leads. In a further variant, the terminal portions <b>428</b>, at the innermost extremities <b>423</b>, may be free of the overmold or encapsulant, to increase flexibility and hence mechanical compliance of the leads. In yet another variant, whether or not an overmold is employed, upwardly facing surfaces <b>424</b> on the upper portions <b>424</b> of the leads may remain exposed, so as to provide exposed package terminals at the top of the packaged device as well as at the bottom. As explained further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50-52</figref>, the terminals at the top of the packaged device can be used as test terminals, or for the mounting of additional microelectronic devices. An additional microelectronic device mounted on the top package terminals may be connected to the unit <b>10</b>, to the circuit panel upon which the bottom package terminals <b>428</b> are mounted, or both by leads <b>422</b>. Packages of this type may be mounted in a stacked arrangement, with the top terminals of one device connected to the bottom package terminals of the next higher device in the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0272">In the structure depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the bottom surface of <b>13</b> unit <b>10</b> (defined by the rear surface of chip <b>11</b>) is mechanically attached to a planar interposer <b>530</b> by a mounting structure <b>502</b> which may include a layer of a die attach material. As discussed above, a wide variety of materials can be used for the interposer. Preferably, the interposer <b>530</b> is flexible and the mounting structure <b>502</b> has appreciable mechanical compliance. For example, mounting structure <b>502</b> may include a layer of a compliant material. In this embodiment, the bottom surface <b>531</b> of interposer <b>530</b> defines the bottom surface of the packaged device. Terminals <b>538</b> are exposed at this bottom surface. Electrical connection between the terminals <b>538</b> and the unit connections <b>18</b> on the top surface of unit <b>10</b> are made by leads <b>506</b> which may be wire bonds, metallic ribbons or the like. The connections between the unit connections <b>18</b> and terminals <b>538</b> may include other conductive elements such as traces (not shown) extending along the interposer and vias extending through the interposer. The connections, such as wire bonds <b>506</b>, desirably are flexible, so that terminals <b>538</b> remain movable with respect to unit <b>10</b> as permitted by the compliance of mounting structure <b>502</b>. Interposer <b>530</b> can carry a relatively compact array of terminals <b>538</b>, at any desired pitch. Some or all of these terminals may be disposed in the region of interposer <b>530</b> disposed below unit <b>10</b>. Arrangements of this type can provide a high density and space efficient interconnect to the circuit panel.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0273">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref>, units can be provided with additional unit connections. In a process according to one embodiment of the invention, a lid element <b>611</b> is united with a unitary wafer element <b>620</b>, such as an entire wafer or a portion of a wafer, incorporating a plurality of semiconductor chips <b>622</b>, so that a bottom surface <b>612</b> of the lid element faces toward a front surface <b>624</b> of the wafer element. A top surface <b>614</b> of the lid element faces upwardly away from the wafer element. Vertical interconnect structures <b>626</b> are formed so that the vertical interconnect structures extend upwardly through lid <b>611</b> from contacts <b>628</b> on the chip so as to provide unit connections exposed at the top surface <b>614</b> of the lid element <b>611</b>. As described in the aforementioned commonly owned incorporated applications 60/506,600; 60/515,615; 60/532,341; and 60/568,041, the lid element may have through vias lined with a thin layer <b>630</b> of a metal. The metallic via liners <b>630</b> can be provided, for example, by depositing the metal on the lid element and selectively etching the metal prior to assembly with the wafer element. A solder or other electrically conductive bonding material is provided on the lid element, on the wafer element or both and reflowed so that the bonding material wets the metal lining in the vias and wets contacts <b>628</b> on the wafer element to form the vertical interconnect structures. In the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the lid element is provided with additional rows of vias <b>632</b> at locations corresponding to the boundaries between chips in the wafer element. These additional vias may extend partially through the lid or entirely through the lid element as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. Additional vias <b>632</b> are lined with metal or other conductive material <b>634</b>, and electrically conductive redistribution traces <b>636</b> are provided on a surface of the lid so that the traces interconnect the liners in some or all of the additional vias <b>632</b> with the via liners <b>630</b> in some or all of the other vias used to form the vertical interconnect structures. The additional liners <b>634</b> and traces <b>636</b> may be formed during the same process steps used to make the via liners <b>630</b>. Thus, the conductive liners <b>634</b> in the additional vias will be electrically connected to at least some of the vertical interconnect structures <b>626</b> when the vertical interconnect structures are formed. As described in the co-pending applications, a sealant <b>640</b> is provided between the lid element and the wafer element at boundaries between adjacent chips, so that the sealant extends around the periphery of each chip.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0274">After assembly of the lid element, wafer element and sealant, and desirably after formation of the vertical interconnect structures, the lid element, wafer element and sealant are severed along lines of severance <b>642</b>, also referred to as dicing lanes, one of which is visible in FIG. <b>44</b>. The severing step forms individual units, each including one or more chips and a lid with vertical interconnect elements extending through it. As best seen in the elevational view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, each such unit has vertically-extensive edge surfaces <b>649</b> extending between the top surface <b>614</b> of the lid and the bottom surface <b>625</b> of the chip. The severing process cuts the additional vias <b>632</b>, leaving partial vias exposed at the edge surfaces, of the units. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, an elevational view, showing one such edge surface <b>649</b>, the conductive liners <b>634</b> within the severed vias form edge connections exposed at the edge surfaces of the units. At least some of these edge connections are electrically connected to at least some of the vertical interconnect structures <b>626</b> and hence to at least some of the contacts <b>628</b> on the chip. Edge connections can be provided in this manner on one, some or all of the edge surfaces of the unit. In a variant of this process, the redistribution traces <b>636</b> may be formed of the bottom surface <b>612</b> of the lid element, rather than on the top surface of such element.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0275">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the edge connections <b>634</b> may be bonded to contact pads <b>650</b> of a circuit panel <b>652</b> or other substrate so that the unit can be mounted with the top surface <b>614</b> and bottom surface <b>625</b> of the unit extending transverse to the plane of the substrate, and with an edge surface <b>649</b> bearing the edge connections facing downwardly toward the substrate. Alternatively, the unit can be mounted in a socket <b>656</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>) with elements of the socket such as resilient fingers <b>658</b> engaging the edge connections <b>634</b> on the edge surfaces <b>649</b>. The unit also can be mounted as discussed above, with connections made through top unit connections made by vertical interconnect structures <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0276">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A-48B</figref> is generally similar to the embodiment discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44-47</figref>. However, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</figref>, the sealant <b>740</b> extends inwardly from the boundaries of the chips beyond at least some of the vertical interconnect structures <b>726</b>. The severance operation is conducted so as to cut through these interconnect structures and thus form these vertical interconnect structures <b>726</b> into edge contacts <b>734</b> at edge surfaces <b>749</b>. The inwardly-extending sealant <b>740</b> remains as a continuous seal between the chip and lid in each unit. The severing operation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</figref> uses two cuts, along two parallel lines of severance, at each boundary between adjacent chips. In a variant, some or all of the contacts <b>728</b> and the associated vertical interconnect structures <b>726</b> may lie at the boundary between adjacent chips, so that a single cut will form a single row of vertical interconnect structures into edge contacts on two units. Some or all of the vertical interconnect structures in each unit may be converted to edge contacts. A unit formed in this manner can be mounted as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</figref>. In a further variant (not shown) a unit having unit connections on the top surface of the lid can be provided with edge connections by affixing the edge connections onto the unit as, for example, by adhesively bonding a dielectric carrier with conductive connections thereon to the edge surfaces of the unit, or by affixing discrete edge connection elements to the edge surfaces of the unit. The affixed edge connections can be electrically connected to the unit connections on the top surface of the lid by any suitable connection technique. For example, if the dielectric carrier is a flexible dielectric element with traces thereon, the same can be folded over the edge of the lid so that portions of the traces extend along the lid top surface to the unit, connections. Alternatively, the edge connections can be connected to the unit connections by wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0277">A variation of the capped chip structure described above is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49A-49B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49A</figref> is a sectional view of the capped chip structure <b>730</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49B</figref> through line <b>49</b>A-<b>49</b>A.

Providing the interconnect structures along the peripheral edges <b>731</b>, <b>733</b> of the chip, and/or the corners <b>732</b> may permit further improvements to reduce the area of the wafer occupied by the chip, because fewer interconnect structures <b>726</b> are needed, which consequently occupy less of the chip area. In some cases, the interconnect structures <b>726</b> are placed as far apart or farther from the device area <b>204</b> of the chip, as they are in the embodiments described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3D</figref>, for example. This assists in the manufacturability of the structure and the ability to interconnect the structure <b>730</b> in the next higher level assembly. Interconnects that are spaced at intervals farther apart assist in manufacturability of the higher level assembly, because the tolerances for making such connections of the assembly are not as tight as they tend to be when fabricating the chip. Interconnection of the structure <b>730</b> to the higher level assembly, e.g., a circuit panel, is preferably by way of mechanical attachment, e.g., socketing, or electrical connection, such as shown and described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44-47</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0278">A unit <b>812</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) according to a further embodiment of the invention incorporates a chip <b>820</b> which, like the chips discussed above, has a front face <b>822</b> and a rear face <b>824</b>. Chip <b>820</b> has contacts <b>826</b> exposed at the front face <b>822</b>. Here again, the chip has an active element <b>827</b> such as a microelectromechanical element, an electroacoustic element such as a SAW element, or an optoelectronic element such as an array of sensing pixels, the active element being disposed at or adjacent to the front face <b>822</b>. However, in this embodiment, the chip has rear contacts <b>830</b> exposed at the rear face of the chip. Some or all of the rear-face contacts <b>830</b> are electrically connected to the front-face contacts <b>826</b> and to the circuit elements of the chip, including the active element <b>827</b>. The electrical connections to the rear-face contacts <b>830</b> include electrically conductive structures extending partially or completely through the thickness of the chip. These conductive structures should not compromise the physical integrity of the unit, and thus should not provide leakage paths extending between the front and rear surfaces of the chip. These connections typically are formed while the chip is being processed as a part of a wafer. One method of forming conductive structures through the thickness of semiconductor wafers is by ion implantation, or other techniques, to create a highly doped column <b>844</b> of semiconductor material in the chip that is sufficiently low resistivity for the application. Alternatively, a hollow via or “pipe” <b>846</b> may be carved through the thickness of the semiconductor, so that the pipe extends from the rear face <b>824</b> to the contact <b>826</b> on the front face. The pipe is sealed at the front surface by the metallic material of the front-face contact. The walls of the pipe may be made conductive by coating with a metal film <b>847</b>. In a variant, the pipe can be completely filled with metal (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0279">A wafer element incorporating numerous chips <b>820</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is assembled with a lid element including lids <b>860</b>, one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, and with a sealant <b>862</b> at the boundaries between adjacent chips in the wafer element, and provided with vertical interconnect structures <b>864</b> extending from at least some of the top face contacts <b>826</b> on the chip through lid <b>860</b> to form top unit connections <b>866</b> exposed at the top surface <b>868</b> of the lid. The units are severed from the wafer element, leaving the individual units in the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. In this configuration, the rear face contacts <b>830</b> of the chip form bottom unit connections exposed on the bottom surface <b>824</b> of the chip, which constitutes the bottom surface of the unit, whereas top unit connections <b>866</b> are exposed at the top surface <b>868</b> of the lid, which constitutes the top surface of the unit. At least some of the top unit connections <b>866</b> are electrically connected to at least some of the bottom unit connections <b>830</b>, to the internal circuitry of the chip or both. The unit provides continuous electrical paths, between at least some, and preferably all, of the top unit connections <b>866</b> and at least some, and preferably all, of the bottom unit connections <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0280">The completed unit <b>812</b> can be directly mounted on a circuit panel by bonding the bottom unit connections <b>830</b> to contact pads on the circuit panel using techniques similar to those used in flip-chip direct chip mounting. This leaves the unit in a face-up orientation, with the lid and unit top surface <b>868</b> facing upwardly away from the circuit panel. Alternatively, the unit <b>802</b> can be packaged on an intermediate substrate or interposer <b>870</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) with the top surface <b>868</b> facing away from the interposer, and then the interposer be bonded to a circuit panel <b>880</b>. The interposer has package terminals <b>872</b> exposed at its bottom surface, and traces <b>874</b> electrically connecting the bottom unit connections <b>830</b> to the terminals. The interposer typically provides redistribution so that the terminals <b>872</b> are disposed at a larger pitch than the bottom terminals <b>830</b>. The interposer may also provide mechanical compliance between the unit and the circuit panel <b>880</b>. The interposer may be generally similar to those used in manufacture of chip-scale packages.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0281">The top unit connections <b>866</b> can be used as test connections to allow engagement of a test probe either before or after mounting the unit to a circuit panel. The top unit connections provide probe points advantageously situated on the top surface of the unit. Moreover, the probing process will not damage the bottom unit connections that will be connected to the circuit panel. An additional microelectronic element may be connected to the top unit connections <b>866</b> to form part of the circuit in the completed assembly. The additional microelectronic element may be another unit <b>812</b> of similar configuration, so that the units are stacked vertically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. Top unit connections <b>866</b> of one unit are connected to the bottom unit connections <b>830</b> of the next higher unit in the stack. The units thus form common vertical busses disposed inside of the plan area of the units.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0282">In a further embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53-55</figref>), bottom unit connections are provided by forming conductive traces along the edge surfaces of the chip, rather than by providing connections through the chip. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the wafer element has top surface traces <b>902</b> extending from at least some of the top surface contacts <b>926</b> on the chips to the boundaries between chips. A lid element <b>960</b> and vertical interconnect structures <b>964</b> forming top unit connections <b>966</b> are provided, as discussed above. Here again, the wafer element and lid element are severed by cutting along the boundaries between chips to form individual units. Thus, after severance, the top surface traces <b>902</b> extend to the edge surfaces <b>904</b> of the unit. The severing process may be conducted so as to form a trench with sloping edges at the boundaries between units, before severance of the lid element. The sloping trench surfaces provide sloping edge surfaces <b>906</b> on the chips, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>. A further trace <b>910</b> is formed along this sloping edge surface, typically before severance of the lid element. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, further conductive traces are formed along the bottom surface <b>924</b> of the chip, so as to provide bottom unit connections <b>930</b>. Here again, some or all of the bottom unit connections <b>930</b> are connected to the circuitry of the chip and to the top unit connections <b>966</b>. A unit made in this manner can be used as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0283">In a further embodiment of the invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>), traces <b>1002</b> are provided on the bottom surface <b>1061</b> of the lid element <b>1060</b> prior to assembly of the lid element with the wafer element. The traces extend from the vias used to form the vertical interconnect structures <b>1064</b> to the areas corresponding to the boundaries between chips. During formation of vertical interconnect structures <b>1064</b>, the solder used to form the vertical interconnect structures makes contact with the interior ends of traces <b>1002</b>. After severance of the wafer element <b>1020</b> and lid element <b>1060</b>, the ends <b>1008</b> of traces <b>1002</b> are exposed at the edge surfaces <b>1049</b> of the unit. Traces <b>1010</b> extending along the edge surfaces connect traces <b>1002</b> with bottom unit contacts <b>1030</b> provided on the bottom surface <b>1024</b> of the chip. This arrangement avoids the need for special processing of the wafer element to form traces <b>902</b> as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53-55</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0284">Numerous variations and combinations of the features discussed above can be used. For example, units having bottom unit connections in addition to top unit, connections can be used with package structures connected to the top unit, connections as discussed above, for example, those discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 39</figref>. In such an arrangement, both the terminals of the package structure and the bottom unit connections are exposed at the bottom of the packaged device for connection to a circuit panel. In a further variant, units can be provided with both edge unit connections as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44-49</figref> and bottom unit connections as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50-56</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57-60</figref> illustrate an embodiment of the invention in which an additional seal is formed to seal peripheral edges of units, i.e., capped or lidded chips, that are produced by one or the various embodiments of wafer-scale processes such as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-28B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> illustrates the structure of two such units <b>2030</b> that are provided according to this embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0286">Among many alternatives discussed in the foregoing, an organic material is a preferred material for use in forming a “picture frame” seal <b>2002</b> to enclose the active region of a chip, due to the ability of at least some such materials to be applied and form bonds at an ambient temperature to only slightly elevated temperatures. Use of such materials helps to avoid the above-described CTE mismatch problems, particularly when the chip-containing wafer and the lid-containing wafer are of different materials. The use of such organic sealing material is particularly advantageous in conjunction with the low-temperature processes described above for forming interconnects, such as those in which stud bumps are mounted to the chips which remain in wafer form, and a lid or cap-containing wafer is then aligned and sealed with a conductive or nonconductive organic material to form interconnects (e.g., as shown and described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 30</figref>). Certain types of chips, particularly those containing SAW devices, are especially sensitive to strain. SAW devices typically operate to provide a narrow bandpass filter function in which the center frequency of the passband is subject to change due to a strain in the device. The low modulus of elasticity of organic materials helps the organic material to mitigate the effects of differential strain which occurs between the chip-containing wafer and the lid wafer due to CTE mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0287">However, despite the foregoing benefits, an organic material may not provide a sufficiently hermetic seal for some devices. A tighter seal is generally achieved through inorganic materials such as a metal or glass rather than organic materials, but is subject to the above-described difficulties.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0288">Hence, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, an additional layer <b>2004</b> is deposited and patterned to overlie peripheral edges <b>2020</b> of the unit, as an impermeable medium to seal edges <b>2006</b> of the chip <b>2001</b>, the edges <b>2008</b> of the lid, as well as the organic seal material <b>2002</b>. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, the same layer <b>2004</b>, when provided of a conductive material, is also desirably patterned to form metal contacts <b>2010</b> connected to respective ones of the conductive interconnects <b>2012</b> on each chip <b>2001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0289"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57-59</figref> show stages in an illustrative method of fabricating the units <b>2030</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, a pair of units <b>2030</b> are shown, each remaining attached at boundary <b>2034</b> as portions of a wafer. For ease of reference, only two such units are shown. However, a substantial number of such units can be simultaneously processed in wafer form according to the method described herein. Each chip includes a device <b>2011</b>, e.g., illustratively, a SAW or MEMs device, a void <b>2013</b> disposed above the device and conductive interconnects <b>2012</b> extending upwardly from the chips <b>2001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0290">A photosensitive resist film is patterned by photolithography to form resist patterns <b>2032</b> on the surface <b>2022</b> of the lid portion of the units. Illustratively, the resist film is a lift-off film, in that any material coating applied onto the resist film will also be removed when the resist film is subsequently removed. The resist patterns <b>2032</b> are formed as islands surrounding each of the pre-existing interconnects <b>2012</b>, so as to maintain the interconnects isolated from each other upon the subsequent removal of the resist patterns with metal coating applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0291">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, the individual units <b>2030</b> are partially severed along boundary <b>2034</b>, which preferably coincides with the dicing lane of the chips, to produce the structure shown. In a further step illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, one or more metals is deposited to produce the structure shown in which both the peripheral edges <b>2020</b> and the top surfaces <b>2022</b> of the units are covered by metal. The metal is preferably chosen for its qualities in functioning as a barrier to contaminants including moisture, and its ability to conduct electricity. Metals which do not corrode easily are preferred for this purpose. The metal layer <b>2004</b> should preferably be selected so as to form a coating which adheres strongly to the surfaces of the unit, as well as adhering to the sealing material <b>2002</b> and to provide good conductivity in both a direction across the major surface of the layer and the direction through its thickness. For these reasons, the metal layer <b>2004</b> is preferably formed of a stack of deposited metals, such as are used in the semiconductor and MEMs fabrication industries. Common examples of metals which may be used to form such stacks include combinations of titanium, platinum and gold, as well as combinations of chromium, copper and gold, combinations of zinc, nickel and palladium, as well as various permutations and combinations of the above-listed metals. Nickel can be included in the metal layer stack to increase the ability of the patterned metal to provide magnetic screening. The thickness of each patterned metal layer of the stack is illustratively on the order of about 0.1 μm when the metal layer is applied by vapor phase deposition and up to about 1 μm when the metal layer is applied by aqueous processing. A conductive non-metal, for example, a conductive nitride such as titanium nitride or other nitride of a metal, can be utilized as a portion or all of a coating in place of a metal, provided that the material provides a requisite barrier function to moisture or contamination and has sufficient conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0292">Thereafter, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, steps are performed to remove the resist patterns <b>2032</b> together with the unwanted portions of the metal layer, to produce the structure shown as described above. The units <b>2030</b> are also severed at this time into individual units along dicing lanes at the boundary <b>2034</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0293">In addition to the foregoing described embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, the above-described process can be modified to provide several alternative structures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates one such alternative structure. As shown therein, an electrical connection can be established between respective ones of the interconnects <b>2012</b> and a peripheral metal sealing layer <b>2004</b>, to maintain the sealing layer and one interconnect of the chip at the same potential, such as to provide a ground contact. Other ones <b>2014</b> of the interconnects can connect to contacts <b>2010</b> patterned from the metal layer as described above. In such embodiment, the peripheral metal sealing layer <b>2004</b> preferably extends over most of the exterior peripheral <b>2020</b> and top surfaces <b>2022</b> of the unit <b>2030</b>. In such case, the sealing layer <b>2004</b> can be used to provide an electromagnetic shielding function for the unit <b>2030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0294">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, in a variation of the above embodiment, the metal layer <b>2004</b> is patterned to provide conductive traces which extend laterally over the top surface <b>2022</b> of the lid. Such conductive trace can be used for redistribution of contacts, e.g., in a manner similar to that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> and <b>7</b>B, to convert, for example, between the pitch and lateral dimensions of the interconnects <b>2012</b> of the unit and those of an industry standard land grid array.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0295">In a particular embodiment, the patterned metal layer <b>2004</b> can be used for additional functions, such as the provision of conductive elements on the surface <b>2022</b> of the unit for use as resistive, inductive or capacitive devices, e.g., for the purpose of providing impedance matching between the device of the chip <b>2001</b> and an external network to which the unit is attached in later assembly steps. To form certain ones of such conductive elements, prior to the final step of severing the chips, a dielectric layer can be deposited and patterned to overlie the patterned metal layer <b>2004</b>, followed by the deposition and patterning of one or more additional patterned metal layers, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57-59</figref>.</p>
