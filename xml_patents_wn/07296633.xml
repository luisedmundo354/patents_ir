<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the control of fluid flow into a wellbore. More particularly, the invention relates to a flow control apparatus that is self adjusting to meter production and choke the flow of gas into the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In hydrocarbon wells, horizontal wellbores are formed at a predetermined depth to more completely and effectively reach formations bearing oil or other hydrocarbons in the earth. Typically, a vertical wellbore is formed from the surface of a well and thereafter, using some means of directional drilling like a diverter, the wellbore is extended along a horizontal path. Because the hydrocarbon bearing formations can be hundreds of feet across, these horizontal wellbores are sometimes equipped with long sections of screened tubing which consists of tubing having apertures therethough and covered with screened walls, leaving the interior of the tubing open to the inflow of filtered oil.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Horizontal wellbores are often formed to intersect narrow oil bearing formations that might have water and gas bearing formations nearby. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates two such nearby formations, one of water and one of gas. Even with exact drilling techniques, the migration of gas and water towards the oil formation and the wellbore is inevitable due to pressure drops caused by the collection and travel of fluid in the wellbore. Typically, operators do not want to collect gas or water along with oil from the same horizontal wellbore. The gas and water must be separated at the surface and once the flow of gas begins it typically increases to a point where further production of oil is not cost effective. Devices have been developed that self adjust to control the flow of fluid into a horizontal wellbore. One such device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,371,210 owned by the same assignee as the present invention and that patent is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The '210 patent teaches a self-adjusting device that chokes the flow of fluid into a horizontal wellbore as the flow of fluid increases relative to a preset value determined by a spring member. Multiple devices can be placed along the length of a wellbore to help balance the inflow of production throughout the length of the wellbore. The device includes a piston that is depressed by a force generated by fluid flow. The device is especially useful when several are used in series along the length of a horizontal wellbore. However, the devices are not designed to meter production while choking unwanted production components due to its lack of a constantly sized orifice though which to meter the flow of production and determine the relative amounts of gas or water.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need therefore, for a self-adjusting flow control apparatus for downhole use in a wellbore that operates to limit the inflow of gas or water into the wellbore when that component in a production stream reaches a predetermined percentage relative to the oil. There is a further need, for a flow control apparatus for use in a wellbore that is self-regulating and self-adjusts for changes in the amount of fluid and gas in a production stream. There is yet a further need for a flow control apparatus that meters the flow of production into a horizontal wellbore.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides an apparatus for use in a hydrocarbon producing wellbore to prevent the introduction into the wellbore of gas and/or water when the gas or water is of a given percentage relative to the overall fluid content of the production. In one aspect of the invention, a perforated inner tube is surrounded by at least one axially movable member that moves in relation to a pressure differential between sides of a piston having at least one sized orifice through which the production flows to enter the wellbore. The movable member selectively exposes and covers the perforations of the inner tube to pass or choke production. In another embodiment, a method is disclosed to choke the flow of production into a wellbore when a predetermined component of the production is made up of gas or water.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is intended to effectively monitor and self adjust the flow of production into a wellbore depending upon the components in the production. To facilitate the description of the invention, the device will typically be described as it would function in the presence of gas and oil in a production stream. However, it will be understood that the invention operates primarily due to differences in densities between oil and another component of production in a wellbore and could operate in the presence of oil and water or any other component having a density distinct from oil. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of a well <b>200</b> having a flow control apparatus <b>212</b> of the present invention located therein. Specifically, an apparatus <b>212</b> for controlling the flow of oil or some other hydrocarbon from an underground reservoir <b>203</b> through the well <b>200</b> is depicted. The well <b>200</b> includes a cased, vertical wellbore <b>202</b> and an uncased, horizontal wellbore <b>204</b>. Production tubing <b>209</b> for transporting oil to the surface of the well is disposed within the vertical wellbore <b>202</b> and extends from the surface of the well <b>200</b> through a packing member <b>205</b> that seals an annular area <b>211</b> around the tubing and isolates the wellbore therebelow. The horizontal wellbore <b>204</b> includes a section of screened tubing <b>206</b>. The screened tubing <b>206</b> continues along the horizontal wellbore <b>204</b> to a toe <b>208</b> thereof. The apparatus <b>212</b> is attached to the screened tubing <b>206</b> near the heel <b>210</b> of the horizontal wellbore <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a more detailed view of the apparatus <b>212</b> of the present invention. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flow control apparatus <b>212</b> is a two-position apparatus with a first position preventing the flow of production and a second position permitting the inflow of production into the production tubing <b>209</b>. The apparatus <b>212</b> is shown in the second, open position. The apparatus <b>212</b> is additionally designed to assume any number of positions between the first and second positions, thereby providing an infinitely adjustable restriction to the inflow of production into the interior of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The apparatus <b>212</b> includes an inner tubular body <b>307</b> and an outer tubular body <b>324</b> disposed therearound. Disposed in an annular area <b>305</b> between the inner <b>307</b> and outer <b>324</b> bodies is an axially slidable sleeve member <b>311</b> which is biased in a first position relative to the inner body <b>307</b> by a spring <b>320</b> or other biasing member. In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, apertures <b>317</b> formed in the sleeve <b>311</b> are substantially aligned with mating apertures <b>308</b> formed in the inner body <b>307</b> to permit the passage of production fluid from the wellbore into the inner tube <b>307</b>. The production fluid flow into the apparatus is illustrated by arrows <b>313</b>. A piston surface <b>318</b> is formed on the sleeve <b>311</b> and is constructed and arranged to cause the sleeve <b>311</b> to become deflected and to move axially in relation to the inner body when acted upon by production fluid with sufficient momentum, mass and density to overcome the resistive force of the spring <b>320</b> and a pressure differential across the sleeve <b>311</b>. Specifically, the spring <b>320</b> is selected whereby a mass flow rate created by a pressure differential will result in a fluid momentum adequate to deflect the sleeve <b>311</b>, thereby shifting the apparatus <b>212</b> from the first fully closed position to the second, open position as it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Formed in the piston surface <b>318</b> are at least one orifice <b>321</b> that meters the flow of production into the apparatus <b>212</b> and defines the pressure differential across the sleeve <b>311</b> based on flow rate and density of the fluids passing through the orifice <b>321</b>. In the design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the only fluid path to the inner tube <b>307</b> is through the orifice <b>321</b> which is sized to permit flow but also to meter the production fluid as it travels through the sleeve <b>311</b>. In a preferred embodiment, when a certain percentage of the production fluid is made up of oil, its density will be adequate to cause a sufficient pressure differential as it flows through the orifice <b>321</b> to depress the sleeve <b>311</b> while an adequate amount flows through the orifice <b>321</b> sized to permit the flow of oil. If however, a substantial amount of gas is a component of the production fluid (or any other substance with a lower density than oil), the gas will not have adequate density to cause a sufficient pressure differential as it flows through the orifice <b>321</b> to depress the sleeve <b>311</b>, and any gas traveling through the orifice will be prevented from flowing into the wellbore. For some embodiments, the orifice <b>321</b> may not be formed in the sleeve <b>311</b> as long as the orifice <b>321</b> meters flow across the sleeve <b>311</b>. For example, the orifice <b>321</b> can be an insert that is locked (threaded, brazed, etc.) in place.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is another section view of the apparatus <b>212</b> in the first or closed position. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the position of the sleeve <b>311</b> when there is not an adequate amount of force to depress the piston surface <b>318</b> due possibly to a lack of density in some component of the production.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a section view illustrating the radially spaced orifices <b>321</b> formed in the sleeve <b>311</b>. In the embodiment shown, there are six orifices that serve to meter the inflow of production. The piston surface <b>318</b> which must be acted upon and depressed by pressure developed by the production fluid is the surface area of the face of the sleeve <b>311</b> less the area of the orifices <b>321</b>. The orifices are sized to meter the flow of production permitting an adequate amount to flow through while the surface area of the piston and the spring member <b>320</b> against which it must act are designed to require that the production be made up of some predetermined, minimum amount of higher density oil than some other lower density material, like water or gas.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the invention has been described as being fully self adjusting, it will be understood that in some instances the device might be remotely adjusted from the surface using a hydraulic control line to artificially influence movement of the sleeve or a solenoid that is battery powered and can be signaled from the surface of the well. At least one pressure sensor (not shown) can sense a pressure value and communicate the pressure value to the solenoid.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p>
