<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is a hooded garment with built-in skull cap, lower face covering with mouth opening, and built-in gloves.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of previously introduced hooded garments have been geared primarily toward either functionality or fashionability. The singular aspect of the current invention is the dual focus on both functionality and casual fashionability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, various types of hoods, skull caps, and gloves have been previously introduced separately for either functionality or fashionability. The hood, skull cap, and gloves of the current invention combine to form one functional and casually fashionable garment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One object of the current invention is to provide a casual garment that also doubles as a functional, inclement weather-friendly garment. Three main options are available: 1) a built-in skull cap, 2) lower face covering with mouth opening, and 3) built-in gloves. The garment can be worn without employing any of the three main options. It can also be worn while employing all three options simultaneously. Additionally, any one or two of the three options may be employed at any given time without employing the other(s).</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the current invention to allow for the use of a unique lower face covering for protection from inclement weather while maintaining comfort. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, two sets of corresponding snaps, buttons, hook-and-loop fasteners (e.g. Velcro brand fasteners—Velcro being a trademark) or other securing devices <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are provided near the ends of two pairs of projections located at each of the front, lower portions <b>16</b> of the hood <b>10</b> near the user's cheeks <b>18</b>, which when pulled together and secured, cover the lower face and chin while leaving an opening <b>20</b> for the user's mouth. Opening <b>20</b> is formed by a pair of recesses <b>15</b> provided on each lower, front hood portion <b>16</b>, between the upper and lower projections with their securing devices <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> on each lower, front hood portion <b>16</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The usual discomfort around the mouth area usually associated with masks and face coverings is not present in the current invention because of the created mouth opening <b>20</b>, which allows the wearer to breathe freely without coping with any covering material. Contingent upon the material and size of the garment, the area of the garment or hood portions where the securing devices <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are located may need to include a certain percentage of elastic-type material so as to allow the securing devices to attach to one another, thereby stretching the material across the user's lower face and chin. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the garment <b>24</b> includes a body covering portion connected to the hood <b>10</b> for covering the shoulders and the chest of a user using the garment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is still another object of the current invention to allow for the use of a skull cap <b>22</b> which is permanently fixed near its lower rear edge <b>26</b>, via stitching or other fixing method to the inside front of the base <b>28</b> of the hood <b>10</b> of the garment <b>24</b>, thus positioning the skull cap <b>22</b> in front of the hood <b>10</b> so as to allow A) the skull cap <b>22</b> to be worn alone as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, B) the hood <b>10</b> to be worn alone, or C) both the skull cap <b>22</b> and hood <b>10</b> to be worn in conjunction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>A. The inside front base <b>28</b> of the hood is behind the user's neck when the garment is being used. When the skull cap is not in use, it can be stored in various ways. One such storage option is using opposite pieces of Velcro brand hook-and-loop fastener, one adhered to the back of the skullcap and one adhered to the inside lining of the hood so as to allow the skullcap to be temporarily attached to the inside lining of the hood. Another such storage option is tucking the skullcap downward into a pocket on the inside and back of a permanently attached garment, thereby completely clearing the skullcap from the head area.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is yet another object of the current invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 3B</figref> to allow for the use of gloves <b>30</b> permanently attached at an outer edge <b>32</b> to the sleeve cuffs <b>34</b> of the sleeve <b>36</b> of the garment <b>24</b>, whereby the gloves can either be A) worn as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> or B) not worn as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The attached gloves can be stored in a number of ways when not being worn. One such storage option is to tuck each glove into a pocket on the inside or outside of the corresponding sleeve.
