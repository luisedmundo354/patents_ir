<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cooking device, such as a convection oven or a hot-air-impact oven, for cooking a cooking target with heat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(2) Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A cooking device <b>100</b> known as a convection oven for cooking a cooking target with heat is typically constructed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a diagram showing an outline of the construction of such a conventional cooking device <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the cooking device <b>100</b> is composed of: a box-shaped member <b>2</b> that is thermally insulated; a heating chamber <b>3</b> that is formed inside the box-shaped member <b>2</b> to permit a cooking target to be placed therein; heating means <b>4</b> that heats the cooking target placed in the heating chamber <b>3</b>; and blowing means <b>5</b>. The blowing means <b>5</b> is provided with a blowing machine <b>54</b>, which is composed of: a centrifugal fan <b>51</b>; a drive motor <b>52</b> that drives the centrifugal fan <b>51</b>; and a fan casing <b>53</b> that communicates with the heating chamber <b>3</b> through a suction port <b>6</b> and a blowoff port <b>7</b> and on which the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is pivoted. The hot air heated by the heating means <b>4</b> is introduced into the heating chamber <b>3</b> by the blowing means <b>5</b> so that the air inside the heating chamber <b>3</b> is heated and circuited in such a way as to make the temperature inside the heating chamber <b>3</b> uniform and thereby cook the cooking target with heat.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional cooking devices of this type are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Published No. H6-23841 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-329351. The cooking devices disclosed in these publications both adopt a cooking method whereby the air inside a heating chamber is heated and circulated in such a way as to make the temperature inside the heating chamber uniform and thereby cook a cooking target with heat (hereinafter, this method will be referred to as the hot-wind-circulation method).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This cooking method, however, has the disadvantage of requiring rather a long time for cooking. The time required for cooking can be shortened by increasing the rotation rate of the centrifugal fan so as to increase the wind volume, and by increasing the amount of heat generated by the heater. This, however, results in not only greatly increased power consumption but also greatly increased noise, which constitutes a critical drawback.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H9-503334 discloses a cooking device that adopts, instead of the hot-wind-circulation method mentioned above, a cooking method whereby the air heated by heating means is blown directly at a cooking target so as to cook the cooking target with heat (hereinafter, this method will be referred to as the hot-air-impact method).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The hot-wind-circulation method and the hot-air-impact method differ from each other in that, whereas the former operates blowing means for the purpose of making the temperature inside a heating chamber uniform and, by using the thus uniformized heat, applies heat uniformly to a cooking target, the latter blows hot air at a cooking target from a predetermined direction and, by using the hot air, cooks the cooking target with heat.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the hot-air-impact method, cooking is achieved by making the hot air heated by a heater hit a cooking target at a high speed by the action of a blowing machine. This helps greatly reduce the time required for cooking without unduly increasing the power consumption by the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Indeed, the hot-air-impact method is very suitable for the cooking of a chunk of meat is not interfered with by the wind pressure of a hot air impact. However, the hot-air-impact method is unsuitable for the cooking of sponge cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air. The reason is that, inconveniently, the wind pressure of a hot air impact causes such a cooking target to become unacceptably deformed, unduly hard, or charred at the surface, and thereby interferes with the cooking thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a cooking device that, alone, permits the use of a plurality of cooking methods so as to be capable of cooking any type of cooking target.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, a cooking device is provided with a box-shaped member, a heating chamber that is formed inside the box-shaped member to permit a cooking target to be placed therein, a first and a second heating device for heating the cooking target placed in the heating chamber, reversibly rotatable fan for introducing the hot air heated by the first and second heating devices into the heating chamber, a controller for controlling the first and second heating devices and the fan, a suction port formed in a wall surface of the heating chamber, a first and a second blowoff port formed respectively in different wall surfaces of the heating chamber, and a branch air-blow passage that branches air that has been sucked in via the suction port by rotation of the fan in a first blowoff port direction and a second blowoff port direction. Here, cooking is performed by a plurality of cooking methods based on the fan, by being rotated in a forward or reverse direction, adjusting individually a wind volume of the air heated by the first heating device and introduced via the first blowoff port into the heating chamber and a wind volume of the air heated by the second heating device and introduced via the second blowoff port into the heating chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this construction, a single cooking device is permitted to perform cooking by a plurality of different types of cooking method. The plurality of different types of cooking method are, for example, the hot-air-impact method and the hot-wind-circulation method. The former is a cooking method whereby, for example, with the fan rotated in a forward direction at a high speed, hot air is blown out via the first blowoff port at a speed of 65 km/h or more and hot air is blown out via the second blowoff port at a speed of 30 km/h or less, and the latter is a cooking method whereby, with the fan rotated in a reverse direction at a low speed, hot air is blown out via the first blowoff port at a speed of 30 km/h or less and hot air is blown out via the second blowoff port at a speed of 40 km/h or less.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, by appropriately devising a control method by which to cook a particular cooking target, it is possible to realize, on a single cooking device, both a cooking method that is suitable for the cooking of a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like, i.e., a cooking target of which the cooking is not interfered with by the wind pressure of a hot air impact and a cooking method that is suitable for the cooking of sponge cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air. Moreover, since a plurality of cooking methods can be realized with a single blowing machine, it is possible to reduce the cost of the cooking machine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Here, the wind volume of the air heated by the first heating device and introduced via the first blowoff port into the heating chamber and the wind volume of the air heated by the second heating device and introduced via the second blowoff port into the heating chamber are adjusted individually in one of the following manners. The branch air-blow passage is built with a two-way branch duct that branches in the first blowoff port direction and the second blowoff port direction, and at the branch point of the two-way branch duct is provided wind volume adjusting means for adjusting the wind volumes branched in two directions. Alternatively, the branch air-blow passage is built with a two-way branch fan casing that branches in the first blowoff port direction and the second blowoff port direction, and the wind volumes branched in two directions are adjusted by the controller controlling the fan rotation rate and/or the fan rotation direction of the fan.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the first blowoff port is formed in the surface that faces the surface on which the cooking target is placed, the second blowoff port is formed in another surface, and the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port and the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the second blowoff port branch from the fan in two directions so as to each describe an L-like or otherwise angled shape.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this construction, as a result of the fan driving means adjusting the rotation rate and switching the rotation direction, it is possible to change not only the wind volumes blown out via the two blowoff ports but also the ratio of the wind speeds at the two blowoff ports. Specifically, when the fan is rotating in one direction, the wind volume and/or the wind speed at one blowoff port is higher than the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the other blowoff port; when the fan is rotating in the opposite direction, the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the former blowoff port is lower than the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the latter blowoff port.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A cooking device that permits air to be blown in the manner described above can be realized without the use of a special device. Thus, it is possible to very inexpensively manufacture a cooking device that, alone, realizes a plurality of cooking methods having utterly different effects from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port is formed so as to run from the fan in the direction in which is located the surface that faces the surface on which the cooking target is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this construction, when the fan is rotating in one direction, the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the first blowoff port is higher than the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the second blowoff port; when the fan is rotating in the opposite direction, the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the first blowoff port is lower than the wind volume and/or the wind speed at the second blowoff port.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, by using the former blowing method, it is possible to perform cooking chiefly by the hot-air-impact method. For example, it is possible to blow hot air at high speed at a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like so as to perform cooking by a cooking method suitable for a cooking target of which the cooking is promoted by a hot air impact. On the other hand, by using the latter blowing method, it is possible to perform cooking by a cooking method suitable for sponge cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air from the beginning, that is, collectively, a cooking target of which the cooking is interfered with by a hot air impact. In this way, it is possible to easily realize, on a single cooking device, different cooking methods suitable respectively for different types of cooking target having utterly different properties from one another as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port becomes increasingly large along the air-blow direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this construction, when the wind volume and/or the wind speed of the air that flows through the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port is higher than the wind volume and/or the wind speed of the air that flows through the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the second blowoff port, since the former air-blow passage becomes increasingly large along the air-blow direction, this air-blow passage functions as a so-called diffuser by converting the kinetic energy of the wind flowing therethrough into a static pressure. This augments the wind that is guided to the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port. On the other hand, when the wind volumes and/or the wind speeds have the opposite relationship, since the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port becomes increasingly large along the air-blow direction, the wind is separated from the wall surface of this air-blow passage, and thus a so-called choking phenomenon occurs. This diminishes the wind that is guided to the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port. That is, the former state helps augment the impact of the hot air that is blown at the cooking target at a high speed from the direction in which is located the surface that faces the surface on which the cooking target is placed, and the latter state helps diminish the speed of the wind that is blown at the cooking target from the direction in which is located the surface that faces the surface on which the cooking target is placed. This makes it possible, in a case where a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like, i.e., a cooking target of which the cooking is promoted by a hot air impact when hot air is blown at a high speed at it, is cooked, to further shorten the time needed for cooking and, in a case where sponge cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air from the beginning, that is, collectively, a cooking target of which the cooking is interfered with by a hot air impact, is cooked, to perform cooking by a more suitable method.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the air-blow passage that connects the suction port to the first blowoff port has a larger cross-sectional area than the other air-blow passage.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this construction, when the fan is rotating in one direction, the air volume and/or the wind speed of the air blown out via the first blowoff port is much higher than the air volume and/or the wind speed of the air blown out via the second blowoff port; when the fan is rotating in the opposite direction, the air volume and/or the wind speed of the air blown out via the first blowoff port is slightly lower than the air volume and/or the wind speed of the air blown out via the second blowoff port. Thus, with almost no degradation in the cooking performance with which cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air from the beginning, that is, collectively, a cooking target of which the cooking is interfered with by a hot air impact, is cooked, it is possible to greatly enhance the cooking performance with which a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like, i.e., a cooking target of which the cooking is promoted by a hot air impact when hot air is blown at a high speed at it, is cooked. Thus, it is possible either to further shorten the time needed for cooking, or to greatly reduce the noise produced during cooking.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. It should be noted that such components as are identical or equivalent between different embodiments are identified with the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First, a first embodiment of the invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a partially see-through perspective view showing the construction of the cooking device <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, with the thermally insulated door <b>21</b> opened, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of the same cooking device <b>1</b>. The cooking device <b>1</b> is composed of: a box-shaped member <b>2</b> that is thermally insulated and that has an opening formed in the front surface thereof; a heating chamber <b>3</b> that is formed inside the box-shaped member <b>2</b> to permit a cooking target to be placed therein; heating means <b>4</b> that heats the cooking target; blowing means <b>5</b> that sends the hot air heated by the heating means <b>4</b> into the heating chamber <b>3</b>; controlling means <b>8</b> that controls the heating means and/or the blowing means <b>5</b>; and rotating means <b>9</b> that rotates the cooking target.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the front surface of the box-shaped member <b>2</b>, there are provided a thermally insulated door <b>21</b> that openably closes the opening formed in that surface, and an operation panel <b>81</b> that accepts instructions from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">On the floor surface of the heating chamber <b>3</b>, there is provided, as the rotating means <b>9</b> for rotating the cooking target, a turntable <b>95</b>. The turntable <b>95</b> is rotated by a drive motor <b>91</b>, permits a rotary dish, meshed rack, or double-stage rack to be placed interchangeably thereon, and can rotate along therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The blowing means <b>5</b> is built with a blowing machine <b>54</b>, which is composed of: a centrifugal fan <b>51</b>; a reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>that drives the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> and that can rotate in the forward and reverse directions; a two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>c </i>on which the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is pivoted and that branches in the direction of a ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> and in the direction of a side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b>. The hot air heated by a first heater <b>411</b> provided as the heating means <b>4</b> is introduced into the heating chamber <b>3</b> via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b>, and the hot air heated by a second heater <b>412</b> is introduced into the heating chamber <b>3</b> via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b>. The reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>rotates at a high rate in the direction indicated as “A” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and rotates at a low rate in the direction indicated as “B” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A suction port <b>6</b> and the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> each consist of a plurality of punched holes each 5 mm across. The ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> consists of a plurality of nozzles each 11 mm across.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As the heating means, there is provided, in addition to the first an second heaters <b>411</b> and <b>412</b>, an induction heating device <b>42</b> for assisting cooking.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the cooking device <b>1</b> constructed as described above, when the user puts a cooking target on a meshed rack (not illustrated) placed on the turntable <b>95</b> and enters instructions via the operation panel <b>81</b>, according to the instructions entered via the operation panel <b>81</b>, a controller <b>82</b> provided as the controlling means <b>8</b> selects a suitable cooking method from a plurality of preprogrammed cooking methods, and controls the operation of the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the blowing machine <b>54</b>, the first and second heaters <b>411</b> and <b>412</b>, the induction heating device <b>42</b>, and the turntable drive motor <b>91</b> to perform the cooking of the cooking target.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, in a case where roasted chicken is prepared on the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, a meshed rack (not illustrated) is placed on the turntable <b>95</b> inside the heating chamber <b>3</b>, then a chunk of chicken is put on the meshed rack, and then, from the menu items displayed on the operation panel <b>81</b>, the one for roasted chicken is selected. In response to this instruction, the controller <b>82</b> operates the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the blowing machine <b>54</b>, the first and second heaters <b>411</b> and <b>412</b>, the induction heating device <b>42</b>, and the turntable drive motor <b>91</b>. Specifically, in this case, the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is rotated by the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>at a high rate in the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that hot air is blown out via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> at a speed of 65 km/h or more, and that hot air is blown out via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> at a speed of 30 km/h or less. This control permits a hot-air-impact cooking method, and thus permits quick preparation of roasted chicken. The induction heating device <b>42</b> may be energized to assist cooking.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the other hand, in a case where sponge cake is prepared on the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, a double-stage rack (not illustrated) is placed on the turntable <b>95</b> inside the heating chamber <b>3</b>, then a lump of dough is put on each stage of the double-stage rack, and then, from the menu items displayed on the operation panel <b>81</b>, the one for sponge cake is selected. In response to this instruction, the controller <b>82</b> operates the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the blowing machine <b>54</b>, the second heater <b>412</b>, the induction heating device <b>42</b>, and the turntable drive motor <b>91</b>, and, as necessary, operates the first heater <b>411</b>. Specifically, in this case, the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is rotated by the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>at a low rate in the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that hot air is blown out via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> at a speed of 30 km/h or less, and that hot air is blown out via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> at a speed of 40 km/h or less. This control permits a double-stage hot-wind-circulation cooking method, and thus permits preparation of fluffy sponge cake on each stage of the double-stage rack.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above-described two cooking methods having utterly different effects are realized by individually controlling and appropriately selecting from or combining together the wind speeds at the plurality of blowoff ports formed in different wall surfaces of the heating chamber. That is, the two blowoff ports may be arranged in a different manner than illustrated in the figure; for example, they may be arranged in the ceiling and rear surfaces, in the ceiling and front surfaces, in the floor and side surfaces, in the floor and rear surfaces, or in the floor and front surfaces. It is possible even to arrange at least one of two or more blowoff ports in a wall surface different from the wall surface in which the other blowoff ports are formed. With any of these arrangements, it is possible to obtain almost the same effects. Accordingly, although the two blowoff ports are arranged in the ceiling and side surfaces in the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, this is not meant to limit in any way how many blowoff ports should be formed and where they should be arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The rotation rate of the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the blowing machine <b>54</b> is variable, and therefore cooking can be performed at a wind speed other than those specifically given above. The first and second heaters <b>411</b> and <b>412</b> and the induction heating device <b>42</b> can be turned on and off, and the amounts of heat generated by them can be adjusted. This make it possible to realize different cooking methods suitable for the cooking of various cooking targets.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The blowing machine <b>54</b> may use, as the centrifugal fan <b>51</b>, a sirocco fan, radial fan, or turbo fan, or, to make the best of a limited space or out of other consideration, an axial-flow fan, inclined-flow fan, or through-flow fan. The blowing machine <b>54</b> may be replaced with a blower. The shape of the fan casing <b>53</b> may be rectangular, spiral, or arc-shaped, so long as it can branch an air flow in two directions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The punched holes of the suction port <b>6</b> and the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> may be given any other diameter than 5 mm to obtain the same effects. Those holes do not have to be formed as punched holes, but may be formed as slits or a net. The same is true with the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b>; that is, the holes there may be given any other diameter than 11 mm to obtain the same effects.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, a second embodiment of the invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partially see-through perspective view showing the construction of the cooking device <b>1</b> of the second embodiment, with the thermally insulated door <b>21</b> opened, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of the same cooking device <b>1</b>.

Moreover, behind the operation panel <b>81</b>, in the space between the surface of the heating chamber <b>3</b> opposite to the surface thereof in which the side-surface blowoff port <b>27</b> is formed and the side surface of the box-shaped member <b>2</b>, there is provided controlling means <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Here, the wind sucked in via the suction port <b>6</b> is branched by the two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>c </i>into a part that is sent to the upper air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>and a part that is sent to the side air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The wind that passes through the upper air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>absorbs heat from and is thereby heated by an upper heater <b>411</b> that is heated by being energized, and is then blown out at a speed of 65 km/h or more via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> at the cooking target. The wind that passes through the side air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>b </i>absorbs heat from and is thereby heated by a side heater <b>412</b> that is heated by being energized, and is then blown out at a speed of 30 km/h or less via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> at the cooking target.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">This control permits a hot-air-impact cooking method, and thus permits quick preparation of roasted chicken. The induction heating device <b>42</b> may be energized to assist cooking.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">On the other hand, in a case where sponge cake is prepared on the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, a placement rack (not illustrated) is placed in an upper and a lower part inside the heating chamber <b>3</b>, then a lump of dough is put on each rack of the placement rack, and then, from the menu items displayed on the operation panel <b>81</b>, the one for sponge cake is selected. In response to this instruction, the controller <b>82</b> operates the drive motor <b>52</b> of the blowing machine <b>54</b>, the side heater <b>412</b>, the induction heating device <b>42</b>, and the turntable drive motor <b>91</b>, and, as necessary, operates the upper heater <b>411</b>. Specifically, in this case, the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is rotated by the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>in the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at a lower rate than when rotated in the direction indicated by arrow A as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>is rotated in this way, the wind volume and wind speed blown out via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> are lower than the wind volume and wind speed blown out via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b>. Thus, hot air is blown out via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> at a speed of 30 km/h or less, and hot air is blown out via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> at a speed of 40 km/h or less. This control permits preparation of fluffy sponge cake on both of the upper and lower stages. That is, in a case where a placement rack having a plurality of stages is used, cooking can be performed uniformly irrespective of on which stage a cooking target is put.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The above-described two cooking methods having utterly different effects are realized by individually controlling and appropriately selecting from or combining together the wind speeds at the plurality of blowoff ports formed in different wall surfaces of the heating chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">That is, the two blowoff ports may be arranged in a different manner than in the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment; for example, they may be arranged in the ceiling and rear surfaces, in the ceiling and front surfaces, in the floor and side surfaces, in the floor and rear surfaces, or in the floor and front surfaces. It is possible even to arrange at least one of two or more blowoff ports in a wall surface different from the wall surface in which the other blowoff ports are formed. With any of these arrangements, it is possible to obtain almost the same effects. Accordingly, although the two blowoff ports are arranged in the ceiling and side surfaces in the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, this is not meant to limit in any way how many blowoff ports should be formed and where they should be arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It is preferable, however, that the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> and the controlling means <b>8</b> and/or the operation panel <b>81</b> be arranged so as to face each other as described above. This prevents the controlling means <b>8</b> and/or operation panel <b>81</b> from being influenced by the hot wind passing through the side air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>b</i>, and thus eliminates the need to use highly heat-resistant components in the controlling means <b>8</b> and/or the operation panel <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The rotation rate of the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the blowing machine <b>54</b> may be made variable. This makes it possible to perform cooking at a wind speed other than those specifically given above. The upper and side heaters <b>411</b> and <b>412</b> and the induction heating device <b>42</b> may be so designed that they can be turned on and off and the amounts of heat generated by them can be adjusted. This make it possible to realize different cooking methods suitable for the cooking of various cooking targets.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The blowing machine <b>54</b> may use, as the centrifugal fan <b>51</b>, a sirocco fan, radial fan, or turbo fan, or, to make the best of a limited space or out of other consideration, an axial-flow fan, oblique-flow fan, or through-flow fan. The blowing machine <b>54</b> may be replaced with a blower.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The shape of the part of the two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b> diagonal to the branch point <b>57</b> may be rectangular as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, spiral, or arc-shaped (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The punched holes of the suction port <b>6</b> and the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> may be given any other diameter than 5 mm to obtain the same effects. Those holes do not have to be formed as punched holes, but may be formed as slits or a net. The same is true with the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b>; that is, the holes there may be given any other diameter than 11 mm to obtain the same effects.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, an eighth embodiment of the invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective view showing an outline of the construction of the cooking device <b>1</b> of the eighth embodiment as seen from the surface (front surface) in which the opening of the heating chamber <b>3</b> is formed, with the thermally insulated door opened <b>21</b>. This figure is partially made see-through to show the air-blow passages, for easy understanding of how air flows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an outline sectional view showing an up-down-direction section of the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment taken substantially at the center thereof in the front-rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment differs from the cooking device <b>1</b> of the seventh embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> in the following respects. The cross-sectional area of the upper air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>near the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is larger than the cross-sectional area of the side air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>b </i>near the <b>51</b>. Moreover, the upper air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>becomes increasingly large along the air-blow direction. In other respects, the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiment is constructed in the same manner as the cooking device <b>1</b> of the seventh embodiment, and therefore such components as are common to the two embodiments are identified with the same reference numerals, and their explanations will not be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Constructed as described above, the cooking device <b>1</b> of this embodiments offers, in addition to the effects offered by the cooking device <b>1</b> of the seventh embodiment, the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is rotated by the reversible motor <b>52</b>B at a high rate in the direction indicated by arrow A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the wind volume that passes through the air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>becomes far higher than the wind volume that passes through the air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>b</i>. Moreover, since the air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>becomes increasingly large along the air-blow direction, it functions as a so-called diffuser by converting the kinetic energy of the flowing wind into a static pressure. This greatly augments the wind guided upward from the heater <b>41</b> as compared with the same wind in the cooking device <b>1</b> of the seventh embodiment. This enhances the performance of the centrifugal fan <b>51</b>, and thus, even if the rotation rate of the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is made lower than in the cooking device <b>1</b> of the seventh embodiment, it is possible to blow out hot air via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> at a speed of 65 km/h or more and simultaneously blow out hot air via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> at a speed of 30 km/h or less.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">This helps greatly reduce the noise that is produced during the cooking of a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like. Alternatively, by setting the rotation rate of the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> at a rate equivalent to that at which it is set in the cooking device <b>1</b> of the fist embodiment, it is possible to blow out hot air via the ceiling-surface blowoff port <b>71</b> at a speed of 80 km/h or more and simultaneously blow out hot air via the side-surface blowoff port <b>72</b> at a speed of about 40 km/h. This helps greatly reduce the time required for the cooking of a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">On the other hand, when the centrifugal fan <b>51</b> is rotated by the reversible motor <b>52</b><i>b </i>at a low rate in the direction indicated by arrow B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, although the wind volume that passes through the air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>is low, since the air-blow passage <b>56</b><i>a </i>becomes increasingly large along the air-blow direction, the wind is separated from the wall surface, and thus a so-called choking phenomenon occurs. This diminishes the wind guided upward from the heater <b>41</b> as compared with the same wind in the cooking device <b>1</b> of the seventh embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Thus, even when hot air is blown out via the side blowoff port <b>72</b> at a speed of 40 km/h or less, it is possible to reduce the wind speed via the ceiling blowoff port <b>71</b> to about 20 km/h or less. This makes it possible to more appropriately cook sponge cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Next, a ninth embodiment of the invention will be described. The seventh and eighth embodiments described above can be further modified. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows such a modified example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is an outline sectional view showing an up-down-direction section of the cooking device <b>1</b> of the eighth embodiment as seen from the front surface and taken substantially at the center thereof in the front-rear direction, and is partially made see-through to show the air-blow passages.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>c </i>may be shaped like the two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>d </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Specifically, the lower right-hand part <b>53</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> of the two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>d </i>may be cornered, and the lower left-hand part <b>53</b><i>d</i><b>2</b> of the two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>d </i>may bulge in a direction away from the centrifugal fan <b>51</b>, or may cave in.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The upper left-hand part <b>53</b><i>d</i><b>3</b> of the two-way branch fan casing <b>53</b><i>d</i>, i.e., the part thereof (the so-called tongue-shaped part) at the edge of the branch point <b>57</b> at which the air-blow passage branches in two directions, may be round where it faces the centrifugal fan <b>51</b>. This helps further reduce cooking noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to realize, on a single cooking device, a cooking method suitable for the cooking of a chunk of meat such as chicken to be roasted, or pizza, or the like, i.e., a cooking target of which the cooking is not interfered with by the wind pressure of a hot air impact and a cooking method suitable for the cooking of sponge cake or the like, i.e., a cooking target that is cooked by producing bubbles therein, or a cooking target that contains much air.</p>
