<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to moisture detection and, more particularly, to moisture detection on a vehicle windshield.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, the detection of moisture on a windshield of a vehicle was accomplished in four basic manners: capacitive sensor systems, resistive sensor systems, ultrasonic sensor systems and optical sensor systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A capacitive sensor system includes a capacitor formed on the windshield. In response to moisture on the windshield, the capacitance of the capacitor changes. A sensing circuit is connected to detect the changing capacitance and to control the operation of a windshield wiper as a function of the changing capacitance. Examples of capacitive moisture sensors include U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,478 to Buschur; U.S. Pat. No. 5,682,788 to Netzer; U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,307 to Netzer; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,094,981 to Hochstein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A resistive measurement system includes two conductive elements disposed in spaced relation on the windshield, or another part of the vehicle, such as a conventional whip antenna. Circuitry coupled to the conductive elements measures a change in resistance thereof in response to water bridging the resistive elements and controls the operation of the windshield wiper as a function of the change in resistance. Examples of resistive measurement systems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,294 to Schroder; U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,146 to Schroder; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,718 to Weber; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,719 to VanDam; U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,743 to Weber; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,821 to Petzold.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An ultrasonic sensor system includes a transducer that emits an ultrasonic signal toward a first face of a sheet and receives a reflected ultrasonic signal on a second face of the sheet. The variation in the reflected signal is utilized to determine the presence or absence of foreign bodies on the second face of the sheet. Examples of ultrasonic sensor systems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,818,341 to Saurer et al. and European Publication No. EP0638822.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An optical sensor system includes a light detector positioned to detect light reflected off a windshield from a light source. In response to the presence of moisture on the windshield, the amount of light detected by the light sensor will change due to changing reflection of the light from the light source, thus causing a change in the output of the light sensor. Detecting circuitry detects the change in output from the light detector in response to the change in light impinging thereon and operates the windshield wiper as a function of the change. Examples of light detecting systems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,012 to Pientka et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,647 to Zettler; U.S. Pat. No. 6,052,196 to Pientka et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,933 to Ponziana; U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,519 to Coulling et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,967 to Hochstein; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,303 to Teder; U.S. Pat. No. 6,250,148 to Lynam; U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,741 to Braun et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,603 to Nelson.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A problem with a capacitive sensor system includes the need to form a capacitor having sufficient capacitance whereupon the change in capacitance in response to the presence of rain on the windshield can be detected by suitable detection circuitry. Another problem with a capacitive sensor system is the change in capacitance due to heating or cooling of the metal films forming the capacitor thereby resulting in a change in the capacitance of the capacitor during use.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A problem with a resistive sensor system includes the need to have the resistive elements formed on the outer surface of the windshield whereupon the resistive elements are exposed to weather and possible deterioration. In addition, the resistive elements of a resistive sensor system are also subject to changes in resistance due to changes in the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A problem with an ultrasonic sensor system and an optical sensor system includes the need to position the transducer of the ultrasonic sensor system and the light transmitter and light receiver of the optical sensor system inside the vehicle to detect the presence of moisture at a suitable location on the windshield. However, positioning the ultrasonic sensor system or the optical sensor system at a suitable location on the windshield often results in partially blocking a driver's view through the windshield or in the positioning of such sensor system at less than an optimal location for detecting the presence of moisture on the windshield. Moreover, the sensitivity of an optical sensor to detect moisture can be compromised by the color or shade of the windshield in the path of the light propagating from the light transmitter to the light receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would, therefore, be desirable to provide a small, nearly invisible, moisture detector disposed on either a flexible substrate that is coupled to a sheet, such as a windshield, or on the sheet itself. The moisture detector can be coupled to circuitry for stimulating the moisture detector and circuitry for detecting a change in a characteristic of the moisture detector due to the presence of moisture on the sheet. It would also be desirable to provide a method for detecting the change of the characteristic of the moisture detector as a function of the temperature of the sheet.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention is a moisture detection system that includes an electrical conductor disposed on a surface of a substrate.

The vehicle windshield can have a plurality of transparent sheets laminated together with the flexible substrate sandwiched between the transparent sheets. An electrically conductive coating can be disposed on a surface of at least one transparent sheet. Said surface can be a side of the flexible substrate opposite the electrical conductor. The flexible substrate can further include (i) a ground conductor disposed on the flexible substrate at least partially surrounding the electrical conductor or (ii) a conductive material, in the form of a faraday shield, disposed on a surface of the flexible substrate opposite the electrical conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The resonator circuit can include a capacitor connected between the electrical conductor and a reference voltage and a resistor connected between the oscillator and the electrical conductor side of the capacitor. The filter circuit can include a diode connected to conduct current from the resonator toward the analog-to-digital converter and a capacitor connected between an end of the diode adjacent the analog-to-digital converter and the reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention is also a moisture detector system that includes means disposed on a substrate for conducting electrical current, the conducting means having a resonant frequency that changes as a function of moisture adjacent the conducting means; an oscillator for outputting to the conducting means an oscillator signal having a predetermined frequency and a first amplitude; means responsive to the oscillator signal for outputting a resonator signal having a second amplitude related to the resonant frequency of the conducting means, wherein the second amplitude is different than the first amplitude; means having a property whose value varies as a function of a temperature at or adjacent the conducting means; and means responsive to the resonator signal and the value of the property for outputting a control signal having a value related to the second amplitude of the resonator signal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The moisture detector can further include a wiper system responsive to the control signal for wiping moisture from adjacent the conducting means based on an amount of moisture adjacent the conducting means and/or a rate moisture accumulates adjacent the conducting means.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The conducting means can include (i) one or more lines of conductive material, (ii) one or more sheets of conductive material, and/or (iii) a dispersion of conductive particles in the form of one or more lines and/or sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The substrate can be a windshield that includes plural sheets of glass laminated together. The conducting means can be sandwiched between the sheets of glass.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The substrate can be a flexible substrate that is coupled to a sheet and the conducting means can have a resonant frequency that changes as a function of moisture on the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The moisture detector can further include a wiper system disposed in operative relation to the sheet and responsive to the control signal for wiping the sheet based on an amount of moisture on the sheet and/or a rate moisture accumulates on the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The conducting means can include one or more lines of electrically conductive material disposed on the flexible substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sheet can be a windshield that includes plural sheets of glass laminated together.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The flexible substrate can be sandwiched between the sheets of glass.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The flexible substrate can further include (i) a ground conductor disposed on the flexible substrate at least partially surrounding the conducting means or (ii) a conductive material disposed on a surface of the flexible substrate opposite the conducting means, said conductive material having a form that defines a faraday shield.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The moisture detector can further include an electrically conductive coating disposed on a surface of at least one sheet. The surface can be positioned on a side of the flexible substrate opposite the conducting means.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention is also a method of moisture detection comprising (a) providing a substrate having an electrical conductor disposed thereon; (b) stimulating the electrical conductor with an oscillator signal in the absence of moisture adjacent the electrical conductor; (c) detecting a value of a temperature dependent property acquired from a location at or adjacent the electrical conductor on or about the time step (b) is performed; (d) determining a first amplitude of the electrical conductor to the stimulation in step (b) as a function of the value of the temperature dependent property detected in step (c); (e) stimulating the electrical conductor with the oscillator signal when moisture is present adjacent the electrical conductor; (f) detecting the value of the temperature dependent property on or about the time step (e) is performed; (g) determining a second amplitude of the electrical conductor to the stimulation in step (e) as a function of the value of the temperature dependent property detected in step (f), wherein the second amplitude is different than the first amplitude due to a change in resonant frequency of the electrical conductor in response to the presence of moisture adjacent the electrical conductor; and (h) determining a difference between the first amplitude and the second amplitude, wherein the difference is related to the amount of moisture present adjacent the electrical conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The detected temperature dependent property can be physically or optically detected. The physically detected property can be voltage, current or resistance. More specifically, the detected temperature dependent property can be</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying figures where like reference numbers correspond to like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As used herein, spatial or directional terms, such as “inner”, “outer”, “left”, “right”, “up”, “down”, “horizontal”, “vertical”, and the like, relate to the invention as it is shown in the drawing figures. However, it is to be understood that the invention can assume various alternative orientations and, accordingly, such terms are not to be considered as limiting. Further, all numbers expressing dimensions, physical characteristics, and so forth, used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about”. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical values set forth in the following specification and claims can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein. For example, a stated range of “1 to 10” should be considered to include any and all subranges between (and inclusive of) the minimum value of 1 and the maximum value of 10; that is, all subranges beginning with a minimum value of 1 or more and ending with a maximum value of 10 or less, and all subranges in between. Also, as used herein, terms such as “positioned on” or “supported on” mean positioned or supported on but not necessarily in direct surface contact with. For example, a substrate “positioned on” a glass sheet does not preclude the presence of one or more other materials located between the substrate and the surface of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sheet or panel of optically transparent material, such as a sheet of glass or a vehicle windshield <b>2</b>, includes a moisture detector <b>4</b> disposed thereon or incorporated therein. In a first nonlimiting embodiment of the present invention, moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> includes one or more electrical conductors <b>6</b> connected to a connector, e.g. conductive foil <b>8</b>, which is utilized for connecting electronic circuitry to electrical conductor <b>6</b>. In the nonlimiting embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, foil <b>8</b> is shown extending outside the periphery of windshield <b>2</b>. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention since foil <b>8</b> may be disposed entirely within the periphery of windshield <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and with continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, windshield <b>2</b> is desirably formed by outer and inner glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> bonded together by a plastic interlayer <b>14</b>, such as polyvinylbutyral, to form windshield <b>2</b> as a unitary structure. Plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, however, may be other transparent rigid material, such as, but not limited to, polycarbonate. Each electrical conductor <b>6</b> can be disposed on an inward or an outward facing surface of glass ply <b>10</b> or glass ply <b>12</b>. Each electrical conductor <b>6</b> can be a conductive wire or sheet, or a conductive coating applied to one of the surfaces of glass ply <b>10</b> or glass ply <b>12</b> in the form of a line or a sheet, or a dispersion of electrically conductive particles applied to one of the surfaces of glass ply <b>10</b> or glass ply <b>12</b> in the form of a line or a sheet. Although not required, each electrical conductor <b>6</b> has a width and/or thickness that renders it not easily discernable to the naked eye. In one nonlimiting embodiment of the invention, the width of the electrical conductors <b>6</b> is no greater than 0.35 mm, for example no greater than 0.30 mm or no greater than 0.25 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, in a second nonlimiting embodiment, moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> includes one or more electrical conductors <b>6</b> disposed on a flexible substrate <b>16</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, part of flexible substrate <b>16</b> including electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> disposed thereon extends outside the periphery of windshield <b>2</b> to facilitate connection of electronic circuitry to electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b>. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention since flexible substrate <b>16</b> having electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> disposed thereon may be disposed entirely within the periphery of windshield <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, flexible substrate <b>16</b> can be sandwiched between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> with electrical conductor <b>6</b> facing an inward facing surface of glass ply <b>10</b> or glass ply <b>12</b>, or one of the outward facing surfaces of plastic interlayer <b>14</b>. Alternatively, flexible substrate <b>16</b> can be disposed on an outward facing surface of glass ply <b>10</b> or glass ply <b>12</b> with electrical conductor <b>6</b> facing toward or away from said outward facing surface. As another alternative, the flexible substrate <b>16</b> can be incorporated within the interlayer <b>14</b>. Although not required, to avoid undesirable exposure of flexible substrate <b>16</b> and/or electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> to, among other things, moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s), it is desirable to position flexible substrate <b>16</b> between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> versus positioning flexible substrate <b>16</b> on an outward facing surface of glass ply <b>10</b> or glass ply <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Flexible substrate <b>16</b> can be formed from any suitable flexible and insulative material, such as, but not limited to, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polyvinylbutyral (PVB), ultra-thin glass, etc. In one nonlimiting embodiment, substrate <b>16</b> is 2 mil thick PET. A desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> can be formed from a sheet of any suitable electrically conductive material adhered to flexible substrate <b>16</b> utilizing conventional photolithographic processing techniques. The desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> can also be formed on flexible substrate <b>16</b> by screen printing a suitable conductive material in the desired pattern on flexible substrate <b>16</b> or by ink jetting a suitable conductive material in the desired pattern on flexible substrate <b>16</b>. The desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> can also be formed on flexible substrate <b>16</b> by a wire, such as, but not limited to, copper wire, secured to or embedded within the substrate <b>16</b>. Although not required, in one nonlimiting embodiment, the wire has a small diameter so that the wire is less visible in the windshield <b>2</b>. In one nonlimiting embodiment, the wire is 36 AWG tin plated copper wire. As discussed above, it should be appreciated that rather than using a flexible substrate, the conductors <b>6</b> can be applied directly to a surface of the glass plies or interlayer. For example, and without limiting the present invention, rather than combining the wire with the substrate <b>16</b>, the wire can be secured to or embedded within the interlayer <b>14</b>. The foregoing methods of forming the pattern of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> on flexible substrate <b>16</b> are not to be construed as limiting the invention since the use of any suitable means for forming the desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> on flexible substrate <b>16</b> is envisioned.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, and with continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the portion of flexible substrate <b>16</b> extending outside the periphery of windshield <b>2</b> can have electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> sandwiched between flexible substrate <b>16</b> and an insulative material <b>17</b> adhered to electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b>. Insulative material <b>17</b> can be formed from a sheet of suitable insulative material, such as, without limitation, Kapton® polyimide film (Kapton® is a registered trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemoirs and Company Corporation, Wilmington, Del.), or any other suitable solid or flowable insulative material that acts to protect electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b>. Since the portions of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> and substrate <b>16</b> sandwiched between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> are protected thereby from moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s), an end of insulative material <b>17</b> can terminate between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">To avoid exposure of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> sandwiched between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> to moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s), an adhesive <b>18</b>, e.g., a thermoset adhesive, can be disposed on the electrical conductor <b>6</b> side of flexible substrate <b>16</b> positioned between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>. This adhesive <b>18</b> covers the end of insulative material <b>17</b> sandwiched between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> and extends between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> a sufficient distance so that when it is cured, adhesive <b>18</b> forms with glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> and plastic interlayer <b>14</b> a hermetic seal that inhibits moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s) from contacting the portion of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> sandwiched between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another adhesive <b>19</b>, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive, can be disposed between flexible substrate <b>16</b> and plastic interlayer <b>14</b> for securing the position of flexible substrate <b>16</b> between glass plies <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> prior to exposing adhesive <b>18</b> and plastic interlayer <b>14</b> to a curing heat.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, flexible substrate <b>16</b> can include a ground conductor <b>7</b> that at least partially surrounds electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b>. Connecting ground conductor <b>7</b> to an external reference voltage <b>34</b>, such as ground, forms a ground loop around electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b>. This ground loop avoids undesirable electromagnetic interference from affecting the operation of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> acting as a resonating element of moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a side of flexible substrate <b>16</b> opposite electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> can also or alternatively include a conductive material <b>46</b> disposed thereon that can be connected to external reference voltage <b>34</b>. Conductive material <b>46</b> can be in the form of a sheet, one or more lines, a mesh, or any other suitable form that defines a faraday shield that avoids undesirable electromagnetic interference from affecting the operation of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> acting as the resonating element of moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and with continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, an electrically conductive coating <b>48</b> can also or alternatively be formed on a surface, e.g., inner surface, of glass ply <b>12</b> and connected to reference voltage <b>34</b> for avoiding undesirable electromagnetic interference from affecting the operation of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> acting as the resonating element of moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>. Electrically conductive coating <b>48</b> can be transparent or colored. When colored, electrically conductive coating <b>48</b> can serve the dual purpose of a ground plane or faraday shield for moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> and a sun shade of windshield <b>2</b>. While described in connection with the second embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>, it is to be appreciated that electrically conductive coating <b>48</b> can also be disposed on a surface, e.g., inner surface, of glass ply <b>12</b> when utilized with the first embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As can be seen, any one or a combination of ground conductor <b>7</b>, conductive material <b>46</b> and/or electrically conductive coating <b>48</b> can be utilized for avoiding undesirable electromagnetic interference from affecting the operation of electrical conductor(s) <b>6</b> acting as the resonating element of moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, substrate <b>16</b> can be omitted and one or more of conductor(s) <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> comprising the second embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> can be disposed directly on one or more surfaces of glass ply <b>10</b>, glass ply <b>12</b> and/or interlayer <b>14</b> in any desired arrangement deemed suitable by one of ordinary skill in the art. Electrically conductive coating <b>48</b> can also be utilized in combination with conductor(s) <b>6</b> and/or <b>7</b> of the second embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> when conductor(s) <b>6</b> and/or <b>7</b> are disposed directly on one or more surfaces of glass ply <b>10</b>, glass ply <b>12</b> and/or interlayer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and with continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, in a third nonlimiting embodiment of the present invention, moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> includes a first elongated electrical conductor <b>100</b> and a second elongated electrical conductor <b>102</b> disposed on a flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Second conductor <b>102</b> can at least partially surround first conductor <b>100</b> defining a gap <b>103</b> between the ends of second conductor <b>102</b>. A power conductor <b>106</b> can also be disposed on substrate <b>104</b>. Power conductor <b>106</b> is electrically connected to first conductor <b>100</b> via gap <b>103</b> between the ends of second conductor <b>102</b>. In the particular nonlimiting embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, conductor <b>106</b> is electrically connected to conductor <b>100</b> intermediate the ends of conductor <b>100</b>. A ground conductor <b>108</b> can also be disposed on substrate <b>104</b>. Ground conductor <b>108</b> is electrically connected to one end of second conductor <b>102</b>. Another ground conductor <b>110</b> can be disposed on substrate <b>104</b> and can be electrically connected to the other end of second conductor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">First conductor <b>100</b> defines a longitudinal axis <b>112</b> and at least the portion of second conductor <b>102</b> disposed on a side of first conductor <b>100</b> opposite gap <b>103</b> defines a longitudinal axis <b>114</b> that is positioned in spaced relation with longitudinal axis <b>112</b> of first conductor <b>100</b>. The portions of second conductor <b>102</b> on opposite sides of gap <b>103</b> also define longitudinal axes <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> that are positioned in spaced relation with longitudinal axis <b>112</b> of first conductor <b>100</b>. Longitudinal axes <b>112</b>-<b>118</b> are shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In the particular nonlimiting embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, first conductor <b>100</b> and second conductor <b>102</b> define zigzag paths along their longitudinal axes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>-<b>118</b>. As used herein, “zigzag” means a series of short, sharp turns or angles resulting in a plurality of distinct points along the path of the conductor. Although not required, these zigzag paths can track each other in substantially spaced relation along their longitudinal axes. Although not required, in the particular embodiment of the moisture detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, longitudinal axes <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are substantially parallel to longitudinal axis <b>112</b> and the zigzag paths track each other in substantially parallel spaced relation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is believed that the zigzag path of the conductors as discussed above increases the sensitivity of the moisture detector by providing multiple electric field emitting points along its length. More specifically, it has been observed that a straight conductor element used as a moisture detecting element in one embodiment of the moisture detector of the present invention will have a higher electric field strength at the ends of the element as compared to the electric field strength along its length. By forming the conductors in a zigzag pattern, additional distinct points or tips are formed along its length. At each of these points, the element will have a higher electric field strength as compared to a straight portion of the element, thus creating more sensitive transmitting points in the same overall distance as the straight element. As a result of the more sensitive transmitting points with higher field strength, water drops deposited along the length of the zigzag pattern will cause relatively larger changes in impedance of the moisture detector element and hence would be more detectable in comparison to deposition on the straight line pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Portions <b>150</b> and <b>151</b> of second conductor <b>102</b> spaced from opposite ends of first conductor <b>100</b> define longitudinal axes <b>119</b> and <b>120</b> (shown in phantom), which in the nonlimiting embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, are positioned substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis <b>112</b> of first conductor <b>100</b>. As shown, portions <b>150</b> and <b>151</b> of second conductor <b>102</b> define zigzag paths spaced from the opposite ends of first conductor <b>100</b>. Although not required, in this particular embodiment portions <b>119</b> and <b>120</b> are mirror images of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one nonlimiting embodiment, ground conductor <b>108</b> defines a straight line connection to second conductor <b>102</b>, as shown by the phantom line adjacent ground conductor <b>108</b>. Optionally, ground conductor <b>108</b> at least partially surrounds second conductor <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In the illustrated nonlimiting embodiment of moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>3</b>, the optional configuration of ground conductor <b>108</b> has a generally rectangular form <b>152</b> surrounding second conductor <b>102</b>. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention. The optional configuration of ground conductor <b>108</b> defines a gap <b>121</b> for passage of power conductor <b>106</b> for electrical connection to first conductor <b>100</b>. Gap <b>121</b> can also be used for the passage of ground conductor <b>110</b> for electrical connection to second conductor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Optionally, a temperature sensor <b>122</b> is disposed at or adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>3</b>, or any other moisture detector <b>4</b>, e.g., on substrate <b>104</b> in close proximity to first and second conductors <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, respectively. One or more conductors <b>124</b> are connected to temperature sensor <b>122</b> to facilitate connection of sensor <b>122</b> to suitable sensing circuitry, such as a microprocessor <b>20</b> or an analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> (the latter connection shown in phantom), both described hereinafter, as required.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the following description, moisture detector <b>4</b> will be utilized. It is to be understood, however, that any one of moisture detectors <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>44</b> can be substituted for moisture detector <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In order to detect the presence of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>, microprocessor <b>20</b> causes frequency generator <b>22</b> to generate the oscillator signal when no moisture is present on an outward facing surface of windshield <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, when moisture, e.g., condensed or diffused liquid such as water, is present on the outward facing surface of windshield <b>2</b>, microprocessor <b>20</b> samples a second digital signal output by analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> when moisture detector <b>4</b> is receiving the oscillator signal.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Alternatively, microprocessor <b>20</b> can sample the first digital signal when moisture e.g., condensed or diffused liquid such as water, is present on the outward facing surface of windshield <b>2</b> and can sample the second digital signal when no moisture is present on the outward facing surface of windshield <b>2</b>. To this end, the first digital signal, corresponding to the presence or absence of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>, can be utilized as the basis for determining from the second digital signal when moisture is present on or absent from windshield <b>2</b>. The use of the first and second digital signals to determine the presence or absence of moisture on windshield <b>2</b> will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It has been observed that, for a given temperature, the rectified and filtered signal output by filter circuit <b>26</b> has a different amplitude when moisture is present on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>. More specifically, the rectified and filtered signal output by filter circuit <b>26</b> has an amplitude that increases or decreases to a limit with increasing moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>. For example, in the absence of moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, the rectified and filtered signal has a first amplitude. However, when moisture in the form of droplets of water is present on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, the rectified and filtered signal output by filter circuit <b>26</b> has a second amplitude different than the first amplitude. Furthermore, when moisture in the form of diffused water is present on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, the rectified and filtered signal output by filter circuit <b>26</b> has a third amplitude different than the first and second amplitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">This changing amplitude is caused by the impedance of moisture detector <b>4</b>, changing due to increasing or decreasing amounts of moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>. More specifically, the impedance of moisture detector <b>4</b> decreases in response to increasing amounts of moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, whereupon the amplitude of the rectified and filtered signal output by filter circuit <b>26</b> decreases. Similarly, the impedance of moisture detector <b>4</b> increases in response to decreasing amounts of moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, whereupon the amplitude of the rectified and filtered signal output by filter circuit <b>26</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The electronic circuitry coupled to moisture detector <b>4</b> can detect changes in the impedance thereof due to changes in the moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b> between no moisture and diffused liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, microprocessor <b>20</b> compares the first digital signal to the second digital signal to determine the amount of moisture that is present on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>. More specifically, microprocessor <b>20</b> takes the difference between the first and second digital signals and determines therefrom the presence of moisture, and in one nonlimiting embodiment, an amount of moisture that is present on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>. Based on this determination, microprocessor <b>20</b> outputs a control signal to windshield wiper system <b>30</b> for controlling the operation thereof based on the presence and/or amount of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and with continuing reference to all previous figures, windshield wiper system <b>30</b> includes a windshield wiper motor control <b>36</b> which receives the control signal from microprocessor <b>20</b>, and a windshield wiper motor <b>38</b> which is coupled to a windshield wiper blade <b>40</b> disposed on windshield <b>2</b>. As discussed above, the control signal supplied by microprocessor <b>20</b> to windshield wiper motor control <b>36</b> is related to the difference between the first and second digital signals sampled by microprocessor <b>20</b>. In order to control windshield wiper system <b>30</b> in accordance with the amount of moisture on windshield <b>2</b> adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, the numerical range of digital difference values that can be processed by microprocessor <b>20</b> is divided into sections based on the desired control of windshield wiper system <b>30</b>. For example, if the range of digital difference values is divided into two sections, the section corresponding to the upper numerical range of difference values corresponds to operating windshield wiper system <b>30</b> at a high speed while the lower numerical range of difference values corresponds to operating windshield wiper system <b>30</b> at a low speed. Thus, if a difference value between a current sample of the second digital signal and the first digital signal is within the upper numerical range of difference values, microprocessor <b>20</b> outputs the control signal which causes windshield wiper motor control <b>36</b> to control windshield wiper motor <b>38</b> to operate windshield wiper blade <b>40</b> at a high speed. Similarly, if the difference value between the current sample of the second digital signal and the first digital signal is within the lower numerical range of difference values, microprocessor <b>20</b> outputs the control signal which causes windshield wiper motor control <b>36</b> to control windshield wiper motor <b>38</b> to operate windshield wiper blade <b>40</b> at a low speed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Various other modes of operation of windshield wiper system <b>30</b> can also be enabled by microprocessor <b>20</b> and windshield wiper motor control <b>36</b> as a function of the difference value between a current sample of the second digital signal and the first digital signal. These modes can include: a single pulse mode where windshield wiper blade <b>40</b> is caused to wipe windshield <b>2</b> once, e.g., to remove dew or mist from windshield <b>2</b>; a continuous duty cycle pulse mode, e.g., where there is a steady accumulation of water droplets on windshield <b>2</b>, but the accumulation is not sufficient enough to warrant continuous operation of windshield wiper system <b>30</b> at low speed; and a variable duty cycle pulse mode where wiping of windshield <b>2</b> by windshield wiper blade <b>40</b> varies as a function of the amount and/or rate of moisture accumulation on windshield <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Microprocessor <b>20</b> can be configured to output two or more different control signals which cause windshield wiper system <b>30</b> to implement two or more of the above modes of operation in response to varying amounts of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>. In the absence of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>, microprocessor <b>20</b> can cause windshield wiper system <b>30</b> to either discontinue or not initiate the wiping of windshield <b>2</b> with windshield wiper blade <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">It has been observed that the temperature of windshield <b>2</b> can affect the sensitivity of each embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b> discussed above. Accordingly, a temperature sensor, like temperature sensor <b>122</b> described above, can be disposed at or adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, e.g., in operative relation to the corresponding moisture detector <b>4</b> on flexible substrate <b>16</b> or <b>104</b> disposed on windshield <b>2</b>, e.g. on one of the surfaces of glass ply <b>10</b>, glass ply <b>12</b>, plastic interlayer <b>14</b> or flexible substrates <b>16</b> or <b>104</b>, in order to detect the temperature of windshield <b>2</b> at or adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In operation, microprocessor <b>20</b> determines the response of moisture detector <b>4</b> to the oscillator signal output by frequency generator <b>22</b> by sampling one or more digital signals output by analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> when moisture detector <b>4</b> is receiving the oscillator signal. On or about the time microprocessor <b>20</b> samples each digital signal output by analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b>, microprocessor <b>20</b> measures a property of temperature sensor <b>122</b> that varies in response to changes in temperature at or adjacent temperature sensor <b>122</b>. As a function of this measured property, microprocessor <b>20</b> applies a correction factor to each digital signal received by microprocessor <b>20</b> from analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b>. The correction factor applied to each digital signal received by microprocessor <b>20</b> adjusts the value of the digital signal based on the measured temperature at or adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b>, whereupon the control signal output by microprocessor <b>20</b> to windshield wiper system <b>30</b> is adjusted for temperature, thereby avoiding inadvertent operation or non-operation of windshield wiper system <b>30</b>. Thus, windshield wiper system <b>30</b> is operated as a function of the measured properties of moisture detector <b>4</b> and temperature sensor <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one nonlimiting embodiment, temperature sensor <b>122</b> is a thermistor that has a resistance that changes as a function of the temperature.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a </i>shows that a temperature sensor, like temperature sensor <b>122</b> can be positioned on rear window <b>202</b> thereby enabling microprocessor <b>20</b> determine a property of said temperature sensor that varies in response to changes in temperature at or adjacent heating grid <b>204</b>. As a function of this measured property, microprocessor <b>20</b> can apply a correction factor to each digital signal received by microprocessor <b>20</b> from analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b>. This correction factor adjusts the value of the digital signal based on the measured temperature at or adjacent moisture detector <b>4</b> whereupon the control signal output by microprocessor <b>20</b> to the windshield wiper system controlling the movement of the wiper blade on rear window <b>202</b> is adjusted for temperature, thereby avoiding inadvertent operation or non-operation of the windshield wiper system that is operative for controlling the motion of the wiper blade on rear window <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">While the temperature sensor in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a </i>is illustrated as being outside of the wiping area of wiper blade <b>40</b>, it is desirable that the temperature sensor be positioned in the path of the wiper blade to detect a temperature in said path. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Typically, the accumulation of fine mist and the response time of having moisture cleared off of rear window <b>202</b> by the wiper blade is not as important on rear window <b>202</b> as it would be on the front windshield of vehicle <b>200</b>. Accordingly, the control signal output by microprocessor <b>20</b> that causes the wiper blade to wipe moisture from rear window <b>202</b> can be set to be related to a larger difference between the first and second digital signals sampled by microprocessor <b>20</b> from the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> acting as the fifth embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If desired, microprocessor <b>20</b> can be operative for detecting when the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> is being utilized for heating rear window <b>202</b>. For example, microprocessor <b>20</b> can be operative for detecting the open and closed states of switch <b>210</b> via a line <b>220</b> coupled between microprocessor <b>20</b> and switch <b>210</b>. In response to detecting that switch <b>210</b> is in its open state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), microprocessor <b>20</b> can utilize the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> as the fifth embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> under the assumption that the one or more resistive wires are not being utilized for heating rear window <b>202</b>. In contrast, in response to detecting switch <b>210</b> is in its closed state, microprocessor <b>20</b> does not utilize the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> as the fifth embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> under the assumption that the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> are already being utilized to heat rear window <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Also or alternatively, microprocessor <b>20</b> can be operative for utilizing the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> as the fifth embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> regardless of whether switch <b>210</b> is in its open or closed state. Specifically, at suitable times, microprocessor <b>20</b> can cause poles <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> of switch <b>212</b> to switch to their respective second positions for a time sufficient for microprocessor <b>20</b> to sample the output of analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> when said one or more resistive wires <b>206</b>, acting as the fifth embodiment moisture detector <b>4</b>-<b>5</b>, are receiving the oscillator signal. Thereafter, microprocessor <b>20</b> can cause poles <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> to return to their respective first positions whereupon said one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> can be utilized (or nor utilized) as heating element(s) when switch <b>210</b> is in its closed (or open) state.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The illustration of the simplified circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, especially switch <b>212</b>, for switching one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> of heating grid <b>204</b> between use as heating element(s) for heating rear window <b>202</b> and the fifth embodiment moisture sensor <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> is not to be construed as limiting the invention since it is envisioned at any suitable and/or desirable means for switching the functions of the one or more resistive wires <b>206</b> is envisioned. Moreover, the illustration of switch <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref><i>b </i>and <b>13</b> is not to be construed as limiting the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d</i>, various different embodiments of electrical conductor <b>6</b> of the first and second embodiments of moisture detectors <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> are illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> show electrical conductor <b>6</b> formed in a serpentine pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>b </i>and <b>14</b><i>c </i>show three parallel electrical conductors <b>6</b> extending in spaced relation from a common node.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The present invention has several advantages over prior art systems for detecting moisture. These advantages include moisture detector <b>4</b> being essentially invisible to the naked eye from about one meter; moisture detector <b>4</b> can be disposed in a clear or non-transparent part of windshield <b>2</b>; moisture detector <b>4</b> is not sensitive to dirt; moisture detector <b>4</b> can detect the presence of moisture over a larger area than prior art sensors of comparable size; moisture detector <b>4</b> is useful with substrates of various thickness and composition; moisture detector <b>4</b> is more uniformly responsive than prior art sensors; and the present invention can more readily detect the presence of moisture droplets of smaller size, e.g., dew or mist, on windshield <b>2</b> than the prior art systems for detecting moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and with reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the present invention can also be utilized to detect a level of one or more fluids, such as the level of a fluid in a vehicle. Specifically, moisture detector <b>4</b> can be mounted on an electrically and magnetically nonconductive fluid reservoir <b>42</b>. Preferably, moisture detector <b>4</b> is mounted on an exterior of fluid reservoir <b>42</b> adjacent a lower end thereof. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Fluid reservoir <b>42</b> can be configured to receive windshield washer fluid, radiator fluid, or any other fluid utilized by a vehicle, the level of which fluid can be measured utilizing moisture detector <b>4</b> and the electronic circuitry shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In order to detect the level of fluid in fluid reservoir <b>42</b>, the oscillator signal is supplied to electrical conductor <b>6</b> or <b>106</b> of moisture detector <b>4</b> when no fluid is received in fluid reservoir <b>42</b>. A first response of moisture detector <b>4</b> is sampled and stored for later use. At suitable times when fluid is received in the fluid reservoir, plural second responses of moisture detector <b>4</b> to the oscillator signal are sampled. Each second response is compared to the first response. When a second response has a predetermined relation to the first response, the electronic circuitry outputs a corresponding control signal which activates a suitable indicator, e.g., “check washer fluid”, “check radiator fluid”, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">It is to be appreciated that decreasing the fluid level in fluid reservoir <b>42</b> decreases the difference between the first response and the second response of moisture detector <b>4</b>. Thus, when the second response has the predetermined relation to the first response indicative of the fluid level decreasing to a predetermined level, the electronic circuitry outputs the control signal. To facilitate detecting the change in the resonant frequency of moisture detector <b>4</b>, the predetermined frequency of the oscillator signal can be selected to optimize the change in impedance of moisture detector <b>4</b> in response to the presence of fluid in fluid reservoir <b>42</b>. Similar comments apply in respect of the change in resonant frequency of moisture detector <b>4</b> due to the presence of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When a vehicle includes multiple moisture detectors <b>4</b>, a multiplexer (not shown) can be connected between each moisture detector <b>4</b> and the electronic circuitry shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Under the control of microprocessor <b>20</b>, the multiplexer can selectively connect the electronic circuitry to each moisture detector <b>4</b> for supplying the oscillator signal at an appropriate frequency to each moisture detector <b>4</b> and for detecting the response of each moisture detector <b>4</b> to the supplied oscillator signal. Preferably, under the control of the software program, microprocessor <b>20</b> can adjust the frequency of the oscillator signal output by frequency generator <b>22</b> to optimize the change in the resonant frequency of each moisture detector <b>4</b> to detect the presence or absence of a particular fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The invention has been described with reference to several nonlimiting embodiments. Obvious modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. For example, while described in connection with the detection of moisture on windshield <b>2</b>, the present invention can also be utilized to detect moisture on surfaces of rigid or flexible substrates utilized in connection with other applications. Similarly, while described in connection with detection of fluid levels in a fluid reservoir <b>42</b> mounted on a vehicle, the present invention can also be utilized to detect the level of a fluid received in a fluid reservoir utilized in other applications. Moreover, while described in connection with the control of windshield wiper system <b>30</b>, microprocessor <b>20</b> can also be utilized to control a vehicle headlamp system, a vehicle windshield dehumidification system and/or any other vehicle or non-vehicle based system that it is desired to control as a function of the presence of moisture on a substrate. Still further, while the various components of the electronic circuitry are preferably connected by conductors, it should be appreciated that suitable signals can be conveyed between two or more of these components via suitable radio frequency (RF) and/or optical signal means. Microprocessor <b>20</b> can also be configured to record for subsequent retrieval and display, the days when moisture is detected on a substrate and/or the extent of operation of windshield wiper system <b>30</b>. This information can then be used for information purposes, e.g., to determine the number of days in a month it rains, and/or to estimate when blades of the windshield wiper system <b>30</b> may require replacement. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that the description of analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> as being operative for converting analog signals from filter circuit <b>26</b>, temperature sensor <b>122</b> and switch <b>210</b> into corresponding digital signals is not to be construed as limiting the invention since it is envisioned that the conversion of each analog signal into a corresponding digital signal for processing by microprocessor <b>20</b> can occur in any suitable and/or desirable manner, such as, without limitation, a separate analog-to-digital converter under the control of microprocessor <b>20</b>, the combination of a multiplexer (not shown) under the control of microprocessor <b>20</b> for switching each analog signal to the input of analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b>, or some combination of at least one multiplexer and two or more analog-to-digital converters. Lastly, the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> of microprocessor <b>20</b> and analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> being separate components is not to be construed as limiting the invention since it is envisioned that the functions of microprocessor <b>20</b> and one or more analog-to-digital converter <b>28</b> can be incorporated into a single component, e.g., a single integrated circuit. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
