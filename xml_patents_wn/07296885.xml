<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004-220204 and 2004-228152, the disclosures of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid composition for ink jet printing, an ink set for ink jet printing, an ink jet recording method, and an ink jet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ink jet systems for ejecting ink from an ink ejection port formed of a nozzle, a slit or a porous film have been used in many printers due to their being small-sized and inexpensive. Of these ink jet systems, a piezo ink jet system for ejecting ink by utilizing the deformation of a piezoelectric unit and a thermal ink jet system for ejecting ink by utilizing the boiling phenomenon of an ink by way of thermal energy are excellent in a high resolution and a high-speed printing property.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present, increased speed and enhancement of picture quality on plain paper are taken as one of the important objective of an ink jet printer. In order to attaining this objectives, there has been proposed an image forming method of adhering a liquid containing a compound having a cationic group onto a recording medium and then adhering an ink containing an anion dye immediately after the liquid has permeated into the recording medium and is thus present in the medium, and has left the surface of the medium, thereby forming an amage (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,667,401, for example). In this method, in some cases in which the time required for drying of an ink is shortened, the density of an image is insufficient. In some cases in which printing is carried out with a small amount of drops, moreover, the long term ejecting property is insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to obtain a high-speed drying property, a high optical density and enhancement of picture quality, moreover, there has been proposed a color ink set characterized by a black ink containing water and a water-soluble solvent, a drying time on a piece of plain paper being equal to or less than five seconds, a color ink containing a coloring agent, water, a water-soluble solvent and a flocculant for flocculating the components of the black ink, and the time required for permeation in the plain paper being equal to or less than five seconds (for example, see JP-A No. 2001-294788). In some cases in which this system is used and a pigment is used for the coloring agent of a color ink, there is excellent optical density, blur and intercolor blur, but long-term storage stability is insufficient due to a flocculant. An electrolyte or a polyvalent metallic salt is usually used for the flocculant, and there is also a problem in that their effect as the flocculant are excessively great.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to improve jetting property of an inkjet sustem, moreover, there has been proposed an ink containing a nitrogen-containing five-membered ring keto acid such as pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a salt thereof (see JP-A No. 63-265681; U.S. Pat. No. 2,711,888 and JP-A No. 2000-109735, for example). This system utilizes the effect of a moisturizing property provided by the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring keto acid salt and has an objective of improving the jetting property. In some cases in which a liquid containing the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring keto acid is used together with a liquid containing a coloring material as in the invention, however, it is impossible to achieve compatibility of picture quality and long-term storage stability.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The invention will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Ink Set for Ink Jet and Liquid Composition for Ink Jet)</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An ink set for ink jet according to the invention is constituted to include a first liquid and a second liquid which is caused to have the function of flocculating the first liquid. As the second liquid, there is used a liquid composition for ink jet containing an organic acid having an acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less (a liquid composition for ink jet according to the invention), preferably, a liquid composition for ink jet further containing an organic amine compound or a polyvalent metallic salt in a specific ratio with respect to the organic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">By carrying out printing in such a manner that the first liquid and the second liquid come in contact with each other, it is possible to improve an optical density, a blur and an intercolor blur. Although a mechanism is not apparent, it is supposed that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less has the function of flocculating the first liquid, and the printing is carried out to cause the two kinds of liquids to come in contact with each other over a recording medium and a coloring material can be thus caused to stay on the surface of the recording medium at a high density.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to the reason why the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less is suitable for a material to flocculate the first liquid, it is guessed that there are three following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">&lt;1&gt; The organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less has a high degree of dissociation of an acidic group and is acidic. In the case in which a coloring material having an anionic surface functional group is used for the first liquid, accordingly, the function of inhibiting the dissociation of the surface functional group of the coloring material of the first liquid is fulfilled when the two liquids come in contact with each other, and the coloring material is thus flocculated.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">&lt;2&gt; It can be supposed that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less has the function of a pH buffer. For this reason, there is a feature that a pH fluctuation caused by the concentration of a hydrogen ion is small within the specific pH range of an acidity. As a result, it can be supposed that pH is maintained on an acid side and the coloring material of the first liquid can be flocculated effectively when the first liquid and the second liquid are mixed with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">&lt;3&gt; There is also a function of the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less and an electrolyte. Accordingly, it can be supposed that an electrostatic repulsive force between pigments is reduced to promote a flocculation in the case in which the pigments are used for the coloring material of the first liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to the reason why the polyvalent metallic salt is suitable for a material to flocculate the first liquid, next, it is mainly guessed that there are two following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">&lt;1&gt; In a system using a pigment as a coloring material, it is supposed that the polyvalent metallic salt attenuates an electrostatic repulsive force between-pigments and produces an advantage to promote the flocculation of the pigments.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">&lt;2&gt; It can be supposed that a polyvalent metal forms an ionomer structure with a carboxylic acid in the case in which a pigment having a carboxylic acid group on a surface thereof or a liquid containing an organic compound having the carboxylic acid group is mixed. Accordingly, the size of a molecular structure is increased, and at the same time, the amount of a hydrophilic group on the surface of a pigment or the amount of a hydrophilic group of an organic compound is decreased. For this reason, it can be supposed that the pigment or the organic compound can be flocculated. Furthermore, it is supposed that the organic compound is flocculated while taking another coloring material therein. Therefore, the flocculation of the coloring material is accelerated in the case in which a dye is used for the coloring material in addition to the case in which the pigment is used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">On the other hand, it was also found that the organic acid and the polyvalent metallic salt cause the following drawbacks, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is desirable that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less should be used in a partial neutralizing state in order to enhance a flocculation efficiency and to improve picture quality. However, there is the case in which it is hard to cause the picture quality to be compatible with a long-term storage stability. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it can be supposed that the organic acid is deposited when an addition is carried out in a high concentration because the organic acid does not have a sufficient solubility to water.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to the polyvalent metallic salt, it is desirable that the amount of addition should be increased in order to enhance a flocculation efficiency and to improve picture quality. However, it was found that a directional defect is generated in some cases in which the amount of the addition of the polyvalent metallic salt is increased. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it can be supposed that the polyvalent metallic salt is deposited and stuck onto the tip of a nozzle, resulting in a variation in the water repellency of the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In consideration of the results, therefore, vigorous investigations were made. As a result, it was found that picture quality, and a long-term storage stability and a long-term jet reliability are compatible with each other by using the organic acid and the polyvalent metallic salt in a proper ratio. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it can be supposed that an intermolecular interaction such as a chelate action is caused between a polyvalent metal and an organic acid and both of them can be present stably. Furthermore, it has been known that the polyvalent metallic salt generates a slightly water-soluble hydroxide ion under an alkali condition. It is guessed that there is an advantage that the generation of the hydroxide salt of a polyvalent metal can be suppressed and a stabilization can be thus obtained by the addition of the polyvalent metallic salt together with the organic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">By using an organic amine compound as an alkali agent for dissolving an organic acid together with the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less, it is possible to enhance a solubility into the water of the organic acid also in a low neutralizing state and to thereby cause the reliability of a liquid composition and the picture quality to be compatible with each other. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it is supposed that both the organic acid and the organic amine compound have a hydrocarbon type skeleton and an affinity is enhanced by a hydrophobic interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First of all, the first liquid will be described. The first liquid contains at least a coloring material, a water-soluble solvent and water.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The coloring material to be used for the first liquid may be a dye or a pigment, and the pigment is particularly preferable. The reason is as follows. It is supposed that the pigment is flocculated more easily in a mixture with the second liquid than the dye. Above all, a pigment dispersed by a polymer dispersing agent, a self-dispersable pigment and a pigment covered with a resin are preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Both an organic pigment and an inorganic pigment can be used for the pigment to be utilized in the invention, and examples of a black pigment include a carbon black pigment such as furnace black, lamp black, acetylene black or channel black. It is also possible to use pigments having a black color and three primary colors of cyan, magenta and yellow, and furthermore, a pigment having a specific color such as red, green, blue, brown or white, a metallic luster pigment having a gold or silver color, an extender having no color or a light color, or a plastic pigment. Moreover, it is also possible to use, as the pigment, a particle having a dye or a pigment stuck to a surface thereof, the insoluble laked substance of a dye, colored emulsion or colored latex by setting silica, alumina or a polymer bead to be a core. For the invention, furthermore, it is also possible to use a pigment synthesized newly.</p>

However, the pigments are not restricted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">While examples of the cyan color include C.I. Pigment Blue-1, -2, -3, -15, -15:1, -15:2, -15:3, -15:4, -16, -22 and -60, the pigments are not restricted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While examples of the magenta color include C.I. Pigment Red-5, -7, -12, -48, -48:1, -57, -112, -122, -123, -146, -168, -184 and -202, the pigments are not restricted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">While examples of the yellow color include Pigment Yellow-1, -2, -3, -12, -13, -14, -16, -17, -73, -74, -75, -83, 93, -95, -97, -98, -114, 128, -129, -138, -151, -154 and -180, the pigments are not restricted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The self-dispersible pigment in water used in the present invention refers to the pigment having many water-solubilizing groups on the surface of the pigment that is able to be stably dispersed in water without adding any polymer dispersant. The self-dispersible pigment in water is practically obtained by applying surface modification treatments such as an acid or a base treatment, a coupling agent treatment, a polymer graft treatment, a plasma treatment or a redox treatment on so-called usual pigments.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition to the surface-modified pigments described above, commercially available pigments such as Cab-o-jet-200, Cab-o-jet-300, IJX-253, IJX-266, IJX-273, IJX-444 and IJX-55 (manufactured by Cabot Corporation), and Microjet Black CW-1 and CW-2 (manufactured by Orient Chemical Industries, Ltd.) may also be used as the self-dispersible pigment in water.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For the coloring material to be used in the first liquid which is the self-dispersing pigment, a coloring material containing a carboxylic acid group in a functional group on a surface thereof is preferable. It is guessed that the dissociation of a carboxylic acid can be suppressed by the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less and the flocculation can be thus promoted because the carboxylic acid has a low degree of dissociation.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the case in which the coloring material to be used in the first liquid has a sulfonic acid group on the surface thereof, it is preferable that a polymer compound having the carboxylic acid group (a resin having the carboxylic acid group) should be added in addition to the coloring material. The coloring material having the sulfonic acid group on the surface thereof is hard to flocculate. For this reason, an optical density, a blur and an intercolor blur tend to be unimproved. On the other hand, in the case in which the polymer compound having the carboxylic acid group is added, the insolubility of a polymer compound is generated when the two liquids are mixed. In this case, the pigment is taken into the polymer compound and is thus flocculated. Therefore, it is guessed that the optical density, the blur and the intercolor blur can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The pigment coated with a resin may be used as the colorant. Such pigment is called as microcapsule pigments, which include commercially available microcapsule pigments manufactured by Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, Inc. and Toyo Ink MFG Co., Ltd. as well as microcapsule pigments prepared for use in the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The colorant is used in a proportion in the range of not less than 0.1% by mass and not more than 20% by mass, preferably not less than 1% by mass and not more than 10% by mass relative to the total mass of the first liquid in the present invention. Sufficient optical density maybe not able to be obtained when the proportion of the colorant in the liquid is less than 0.1% by mass, while ejection characteristics may become unstable when the proportion of the colorant is larger than 20% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the invention, a polymer dispersing agent can also be used for the first liquid in order to disperse a pigment. On the other hand, also in the case in which a pigment which is self-dispersable into water is used, the polymer dispersing agent can be used together. For the polymer dispersing agent, it is possible to use a nonionic compound, anionic compound, a cationic compound and an amphoteric compound.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, copolymers of monomers having an α,β-ethylene unsaturated group can be taken. Examples of the monomer having the α,β-ethylene unsaturated group include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, itaconic acid, itaconic acid monoester, maleic acid, maleic acid monoester, fumaric acid, fumaric acid monoester, vinyl sulfonic acid, styrene sulfonic acid, vinyl naphthalene sulfonate, vinyl alcohol, acrylamide, methacryloxyethyl phosphate, bismethacryloxyethyl phosphate, methacryloxyethyl phenyl acid phosphate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, a styrene derivative such as styrene, α-methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl cyclohexane, vinyl naphthalene, a vinyl naphthalene derivative, acrylic acid alkylester, phenyl acrylate, alkyl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate, cycloalkyl methacrylate, alkyl crotonate, dialkyl itaconate, and dialkyl maleinate.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The polymers obtained by homopolymerization of the monomer having the ethylenic α,β-unsaturated group, or copolymers obtained by copolymerization of a plurality of the monomers having the ethylenic α,β-unsaturated groups can be used as the polymer dispersant. Specific examples thereof include styrene-styrene sulfonate copolymer, styrene-maleic acid copolymer, styrene-methacrylic acid copolymer, styrene-acrylic acid copolymer, vinylnaphthalene-maleic acid copolymer, vinylnaphthalene-methacrylic acid copolymer, vinylnaphthalene-acrylic acid copolymer, alkyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, alkyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer, styrene-alkyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer, styrene-alkyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, styrene-phenyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer, and styrene-cyclohexyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is preferable that the polymer dispersing agent to be used in the first liquid should have a weight-average molecular weight of 2,000 to 50,000. In some cases in which the molecular weight of the polymer dispersing agent is less than 2,000, the pigment is not dispersed stably. On the other hand, in some cases in which the molecular weight is more than 50,000, the viscosity of the liquid is increased so that a discharging property is deteriorated. A more preferable weight-average molecular weight is 3,500 to 20,000.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The polymer dispersing agent to be added into the first liquid is used within a range of 0.01 to 3% by mass. In some cases in which the amount of addition is more than 3% by mass, the viscosity of the liquid is increased so that the jet characteristic of the liquid becomes unstable. On the other hand, in some cases in which the amount of addition is less than 0.01% by mass, the dispersing stability of the pigment is deteriorated. For the amount of addition of the polymer dispersing agent is more preferably equal to or more than 0.05% by mass and equal to or less than 2.5% by mass, and is further preferably equal to or more than 0.1% by mass and equal to or less than 2% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It is preferable that the volume-average particle size of the particle of a coloring material in the first liquid should be equal to or more than 30 nm and be equal to or less than 250 nm. The volume-average particle size of the particle of the coloring material indicates the particle size of the coloring material itself or the size of the particle of the coloring material to which an additive such as a dispersing agent is stuck if any. In the invention, a microtrack UPA grading analyzer 9340 (manufactured by Leeds &amp; Northrup Co., Ltd.) was used as an apparatus for measuring the volume-average particle size. The measurement was carried out by putting 4 ml of ink in a measuring cell in accordance with a predetermined measuring method. For a parameter to be input in the measurement, the viscosity of ink was used for a viscosity and the density of a pigment was used for the density of a dispersed particle. The volume-average particle size is more preferably equal to or more than 50 nm and equal to or less than 200 nm and is further preferably equal to or more than 75 nm and equal to or less than 175 nm. In some cases in which the volume-average particle size of the particle in the liquid is less than 30 nm, an optical density is reduced. On the other hand, in some cases in which the same volume-average particle size is more than 250 nm, a storage stability cannot be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For a water-soluble organic solvent to be used in the first liquid, polyhydric alcohols, a polyhydric alcohol derivative, a nitrogen-containing solvent, alcohols and a sulfur-containing solvent are used. Specific examples of the polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,5-pentane diol, 1,2,6-hexane triol and glycerin. Specific examples of the polyhydric alcohol derivative include ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether, and the ethylene oxide adduct of diglycerin. Specific examples of the nitrogen-containing solvent include pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, cyclohexyl pyrrolidone, triethanol amine. Specific examples of the alcohols include ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, and benzyl alcohol. Specific examples of the sulfur-containing solvent include thiodiethanol, thiodiglycerol, sulfolane, and dimethyl sulfoxide. In addition, it is also possible to use propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A single water-soluble organic solvent may be used in the first liquid or single or at least two types of water-soluble organic solvents may be mixed together. The content of the water-soluble organic solvent to be used is equal to or more than 1% by mass and is equal to or less than 60% by mass, and is preferably equal to or more than 5% by mass and equal to or less than 40% by mass. In some cases in which the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent in the liquid is less than 1% by mass, a sufficient optical density cannot be obtained. To the contrary, in some cases in which the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent is more than 60% by mass, the viscosity of the liquid is increased so that the jet characteristic of the liquid becomes unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is preferable that a water-soluble resin or a water-insoluble resin should be contained in the first liquid. The reason is that it is possible to produce such an advantage that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less flocculates the water-soluble resin or the water insoluble resin. It can be supposed that a coloring material is simultaneously taken in when the resin is flocculated. Accordingly, there is a tendency that the flocculating effect of the coloring material is enhanced and an optical density, a blur and an intercolor blur are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It is preferable that a compound containing a carboxylic acid group should be used as the water-soluble resin or the water-insoluble resin. The reason is as follows. It is guessed that the degree of dissociation of the carboxylic acid group is low and the flocculation is thus promoted by the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less. In the case in which a compound containing a sulfonic acid group is used for the coloring material, particularly, it is preferable that the water-soluble resin or the water-insoluble resin which contains the carboxylic acid group should be added. Preferably, examples of the compound include a styrene-acrylic acid copolymer, a styrene-methacrylic acid copolymer, a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, and a polyacrylic acid alkyl ester copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The amount of addition of the water-soluble resin or the water-insoluble resin is preferably equal to or more than 0.01% by mass and equal to or less than 10% by mass with respect to the whole first liquid, and is more preferably equal to or more than 0.1% by mass and equal to or less than 3% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It is preferable that the surface tension of the first liquid should be equal to or more than 20 mN/m and be equal to or less than 60 mN/m.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The surface tension is more preferably equal to or more than 20 mN/m and equal to or less than 45 mN/m, and is further preferably equal to or more than 20 mN/m and equal to or less than 35 mN/m. In some cases in which the surface tension is less than 20 mN/m, the liquid overflows into a nozzle surface and printing cannot be carried out normally. On the other hand, in some cases in which the surface tension is more than 60 mN/m, a permeability is obtained slowly so that a drying time is prolonged.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The viscosity of the first liquid is preferably equal to or more than 1.2 mPa·s and equal to or less than 25.0 mPa·s, is more preferably equal to or more than 1.5 mPa·s and less than 10.0 mPa·s, and is further preferably equal to or more than 1.8 mPa·s and less than 5.0 mPa·s. In some cases in which the viscosity of the first liquid is more than 25.0 mPa·s, an ejecting property is deteriorated. On the other hand, in some cases in which the viscosity is less than 1.2 mPa·s, a jet property is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Water is added within such a range as to obtain the surface tension and the viscosity as described above. The amount of addition of the water is not particularly restricted but is preferably equal to or more than 10% by mass and equal to or less than 99% by mass and is more preferably equal to or more than 30% by mass and equal to or less than 80% by mass with respect to the whole first liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, description will be given to the second liquid (a liquid composition for ink jet). It is preferable that the second liquid should contain an organic acid having an acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less, a water-soluble solvent and water and should further contain a polyvalent metallic salt or an organic amine compound.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">According to the invention, the smallest value of the pKa is used in a compound having a plurality of acidic groups.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It is preferable that the amount of addition of the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less should be equal to or more than 0.01% by mass and be equal to or less than 30% by mass with respect to the whole amount of the liquid. The amount of addition is more preferably equal to or more than 0.1% by mass and equal to or less than 15% by mass and is further preferably equal to or more than 0.25% by mass and equal to or less than 10% by mass. In the case in which the amount of addition of the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa in the second liquid of 4.5 or less is less than 0.01% by mass, the aggregation of a coloring material becomes insufficient in a contact with the first liquid so that an optical density, a blur and an intercolor blur are deteriorated. On the other hand, in some cases in which the amount of addition is more than 30% by mass, a jet characteristic is deteriorated so that the liquid is not jetted normally.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">It is preferable that the pH of the second liquid containing the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa or 4.5 or less should be equal to or more than 2.5 and be equal to or less than 7.0. The pH is further preferably equal to or more than 2.75 and equal to or less than 6.0 and is more preferably equal to or more than 3.0 and equal to or less than 4.5. In some cases in which the pH of the second liquid is less than 2.5, the ink passage component of a print head is dissolved so that the print head is broken down. On the other hand, in the case in which the pH of the second liquid is more than 7.0, the flocculation of the coloring material becomes insufficient in the contact with the first liquid so that the optical density, the blur and the intercolor blur are deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The polyvalent metallic salt to be used in the invention includes a polyvalent metal ion such as an aluminum ion, a barium ion, a calcium ion, a copper ion, an iron ion, a magnesium ion, a manganese ion, a nickel ion, a tin ion, a titanium ion and a zinc ion, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, thiocyanic acid, and organic carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, salicylic acid and benzoic acid, and organic sulfonic acid salts.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The polyvalent metallic salt produces a great effect of flocculating the component in the first liquid and a great effect of improving an optical density, a blur and an intercolor blur.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The polyvalent metallic salt may be used singly or at least two types may be mixed for use. Moreover, the content of the polyvalent metallic salt in the second liquid to be used is 0.01 to 15% by mass, preferably 0.1 to 10% by mass with respect to the whole amount of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the second liquid, the amount of addition of the polyvalent metallic salt to the organic acid is to be equal to or more than 0.01 and less than 1 in a mole ratio (the polyvalent metallic salt/organic acid). The mole ratio of the amount of addition of the polyvalent metallic salt to the amount of addition of the organic acid is more preferably equal to or more than 0.05 and equal to or less than 0.9 and is further preferably equal to or more than 0.05 and equal to or less than 0.75. In the case in which the mole ratio of the amount of addition of the polyvalent metallic salt to the amount of addition of the organic acid is equal to or higher than 1, a long-term jet property and a long-term storage stability become insufficient. In the case in which the mole ratio of the amount of addition of the polyvalent metallic salt to the amount of addition of the organic acid is lower than 0.01, moreover, the long-term storage stability becomes insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">An organic amine compound to be used in the second liquid maybe any of class 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th amines and their salts. Specific examples include tetraalkyl ammonium, alkylamine, benzaconium, alkylpyridium, imidazolium, polyamine and their derivatives or salts. Specific examples include amyl amine, butyl amine, propanol amine, propyl amine, ethanol amine, ethyl ethanol amine, 2-ethyl hexyl amine, ethyl methyl amine, ethyl benzyl amine, ethylene diamine, octyl amine, oleyl amine, cyclooctyl amine, cyclobutyl amine, cyclopropyl amine, cyclohexyl amine, diisopropanol amine, diethanol amine, diethyl amine, di-2-etyl hexyl amine, diethylene triamine, diphenyl amine, dibutyl amine, dipropyl amine, dihexyl amine, dipentyl amine, 3-(dimethyl amino)propyl amine, dimethyl ethyl amine, dimethyl ethylene diamine, dimethyl octyl amine, 1,3-dimethyl butyl amine, dimethyl-1,3-propane diamine, dimethyl hexyl amine, amino butanol, amino propanol, amino propanediol, N-acetyl amino ethanol, 2-(2-amino ethyl amino)-ethanol, 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol, 2-(2-amino ethoxy)ethanol, 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl amine, cetyl amine, triisopropanol amine, triisopentyl amine, triethanol amine, trioctyl amine, trityl amine, bis(2-aminoethyl) 1,3-propane diamine, bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylene diamine, bis(3-aminopropyl) 1,3-propane diamine, bis(3-amino propyl)methyl amine, bis(2-ethyl hexyl)amine, bis(trimethyl cylyl)amine, butyl amine, butyl isopropyl amine, propane diamine, propyl diamine, hexyl amine, pentyl amine, 2-methyl-cyclohexyl amine, methyl-propyl amine, methyl benzyl amine, monoethanol amine, lauryl amine, nonyl amine, trimethyl amine, triethyl amine, dimethyl propyl amine, propylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, tetraethylene pentamine, diethyl ethanol amine, tetramethyl ammonium chloride, tetraethyl ammonium bromide, dihydroxy ethyl stearyl amine, 2-heptadecenyl-hydroxyethyl imidazoline, lauryl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, stearamid methyl pyridium chloride, a diaryl dimethyl ammonium chloride polymer, a diaryl amine polymer, and a monoaryl amine polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">More preferably, there are used triethanol amine, triisopropanol amine, 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol, ethanol amine, propane diamine, and propyl amine.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">It is preferable that the organic amine compound should have a weight-average molecular weight of 1000 or less. The weight-average molecular weight is more preferably equal to or less than 500 and is further preferably equal to or less than 250. In some cases in which the molecular weight of the organic amine compound is more than 1000, a solubility to water is reduced so that the solubility of the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less cannot be maintained sufficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It is preferable that the amount of addition of the organic amine compound should be equal to or more than 0.01% by mass and be equal to or less than 30% by mass with respect to the whole amount of the liquid. The amount of addition is more preferably equal to or more than 0.1% by mass and equal to or less than 15% by mass and is further preferably equal to or more than 0.25% by mass and equal to or less than 10% by mass. In some cases in which the organic amine compound in the second liquid is less than 0.01% by mass, the solubility of the organic acid becomes insufficient so that a long-term storage stability is deteriorated. On the other hand, in the case in which the amount of addition is more than 30% by mass, a flocculating property is deteriorated in a mixture with an ink so that quality of an image is not sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the second liquid, it is necessary to set the mole ratio of the amount of addition of the organic amine compound to the organic acid (organic acid:organic amine compound) to be 1:0.1 to 1:0.9. The mole ratio is more preferably 1:0.15 to 1:0.75 and is further preferably 1:0.2 to 1:0.5. In the case in which the mole ratio of the amount of addition of the organic amine compound to the organic acid is less than 1:0.1 (that is, the amount of the organic amine compound is too small), the organic acid is not dissolved. On the other hand, in the case in which the mole radio of the amount of addition of the organic amine compound to the organic acid is more than 1:0.9 (that is, the amount of the organic amine compound is too large), the flocculation of a coloring material becomes insufficient in a mixture with the first liquid so that the quality of an image is not enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">It is also possible to cause the second liquid to contain the coloring material. A dye, a pigment having sulfonic acid or sulfonate on a surface, and a self-dispersing pigment are -preferable for the coloring material to be contained in the second liquid. The reason is follows. It can be supposed that these coloring materials tend to be flocculated in an acidic region with difficulty and the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less and the polyvalent metallic salt can be prevented from being flocculated. By using such a coloring material, the storage stability of the second liquid can be enhanced. It is possible to use the dye, the pigment having the sulfonic acid or the sulfonate on the surface and the self-dispersing pigment which are the same as those described as the coloring materials of the first liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the case in which the pigment is used for the second liquid, it is preferable that the volume-average particle size of the particle of the pigment should be equal to or more than 30 nm and be equal to or less than 250 nm. The volume-average particle size is more preferably equal to or more than 50 nm and equal to or less than 200 nm and is further preferably equal to or more than 75 nm and equal to or less than 175 nm. In some cases in which the volume-average particle size of the particle in the liquid is less than 30 nm, an optical density is reduced. On the other hand, in some cases in which the same volume-average particle size is more than 250 nm, a storage stability cannot be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">For the second liquid, it is possible to use the same water-soluble organic solvent as that in the first liquid. The content of the water-soluble organic solvent to be used is equal to or more than 1% by mass and is equal to or less than 60% by mass, and is preferably equal to or more than 5% by mass and equal to or less than 40% by mass. In some cases in which the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent in the liquid is less than 1% by mass, a sufficient optical density cannot be obtained. To the contrary, in some cases in which the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent is more than 60% by mass, the viscosity of the liquid is increased so that the jet characteristic of the liquid becomes unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In addition, it is also possible to add the polymer dispersing agent used in the first liquid to the second liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It is preferable that the surface tension of the second liquid should be equal to or more than 20 mN/m and be equal to or less than 45 mN/m. The surface tension is more preferably equal to or more than 20 mN/m and equal to or less than 39 mN/m, and is further preferably equal to or more than 20 mN/m and equal to or less than 35 mN/m. In some cases in which the surface tension is less than 20 mN/m, the liquid overflows into a nozzle surface and printing cannot be carried out normally. On the other hand, in some cases in which the surface tension is more than 45 mN/m, a permeability is obtained slowly so that a drying time is prolonged.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The viscosity of the second liquid is preferably equal to or more than 1.2 mPa·s and equal to or less than 25.0 mPa·s, is more preferably equal to or more than 1.5 mPa·s and equal to or less than 10.0 mPa·s, and is further preferably equal to or more than 1.8 mPa·s and equal to or less than 5.0 mPa·s. In some cases in which the viscosities of the first and second liquids are more than 25.0 mPa·s, an ejecting property is deteriorated. On the other hand, in some cases in which the viscosity is less than 1.2 mPa·s, a long-term storage stability is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Water is added within such a range as to obtain the surface tension and the viscosity as described above. The amount of addition of the water is not particularly restricted but is preferably equal to or more than 10% by mass and equal to or less than 99% by mass and is more preferably equal to or more than 30% by mass and equal to or less than 80% by mass with respect to the liquid composition for ink jet or the whole second liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">It is also possible to add, into the second liquid, a flocculating agent for flocculating the component of the first liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">For example, examples of the flocculating agent include alkali metal ions such as a lithium ion, a sodium ion and a potassium ion.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Specific examples include alkali metallic salts such as lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium acetate, potassium oxalate, sodium citrate and potassium benzoate.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The compound may be used singly or at least two types may be mixed for use. Moreover, the content of the flocculating agent in the liquid according to the invention is 0.01 to 15% by mass, preferably 0.1 to 10% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">It is preferable that the number of coarse particles having a size of 5 μm or more in a mixed solution of the first liquid and the second liquid should be equal to or more than 1,000/μL. The same number is more preferably equal to or more than 2,500/μL and is further preferably equal to or more than 5,000/μL. In some cases in which the number of the coarse particles having the size of 5 μm or more in the mixed solution of the first liquid and the second liquid is less than 1,000/μL, an optical density is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The number of the coarse particles having the size of 5 μm or more in the mixed solution of the first liquid and the second liquid was measured by mixing the two liquids in a mass ratio of 1:1 and taking 2 μL while stirring them by means of Accusizer TM770 Optical Particle Sizer (manufactured by Particle Sizing Systems Co., Ltd.). The density of a pigment was input to be the density of a dispersed particle as a parameter in the measurement. Pigment powder acquired by heating and drying a pigment dispersing solution is measured by means of a specific gravity meter or a specific gravity bottle so that the density of the pigment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Description will be given to an additive which can be properly used in the first liquid and the second liquid (the liquid compositions for ink jet according to the invention).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A surfactant may be used in the first and the second liquids. Compounds having both a hydrophilic portion and a hydrophobic portion in the molecule may be effectively used as the surfactant in the present invention. Any of the anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant and nonionic surfactant may be used. The polymer dispersant may be used too.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Ink Jet Recording Method and Ink Jet Recording Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">An ink jet recording method according to the invention serves to carry out printing so as to cause a first liquid and a second liquid to come in contact with each other by using an ink set for ink jet according to the invention. Moreover, an ink jet recording apparatus according to the invention comprises recording heads for ejecting, to a recording medium, liquids in the ink set for ink jet according to the invention. These can apply a recording apparatus provided with a heater for controlling the drying of an ink or a recording apparatus provided with an intermediate transfer mechanism and serving to print a recording material on an intermediate member and then carrying out a transfer onto a recording medium such as a paper in addition to an ordinary ink jet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the ink jet recording method (apparatus) according to the invention, it is preferable that both the first liquid and the second liquid should have a mass per drop of 25 ng or less. The mass is more preferably equal to or more than 0.5 ng and equal to or less than 20 ng and is further preferably equal to or more than 2 ng and equal to or less than 8 ng. In some cases in which the mass per drop is more than 25 ng, a blur is caused more seriously. The reason is as follows. It can be supposed that the contact angles of the first liquid and the second liquid with the recording medium are changed depending on the amount of a drop and the drop tends to spread in the direction of the surface of the paper when the amount of the drop is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In an ink jet apparatus capable of jetting drops having a plurality of volumes from one nozzle, the amount of the drop indicates the amount of a minimum drop capable of carrying out printing.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Moreover, the first liquid and the second liquid are applied onto the recording medium in order to come in contact with each other. When the first liquid and the second liquid come in contact with each other, an ink is flocculated by the action of a flocculating agent. Thus, it is possible to obtain a recording method which is excellent in an optical density, a blur, an intercolor blur and a drying time. If they come in contact with each other, they may be applied adjacently to each other or may be covered with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">For the order of application onto the recording medium, furthermore, the second liquid is applied and the first liquid is then applied. By applying the second liquid earlier, it is possible to effectively flocculate the component in the first liquid. The first liquid may be applied at any time after the second liquid is applied. It is preferable that the first liquid may be applied after 0.1 second or less after the application of the second liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In the ink jet recording method (apparatus) according to the invention, it is preferable that a mass ratio of the amount of application of the first liquid to the amount of application of the second liquid which is required for forming one pixel should be 1:20 to 20:1. The mass ratio is more preferably 1:10 to 10:1 and is further preferably 1:5 to 5:1. In some cases in which the amount of application of the first liquid is much smaller or larger than the amount of application of the second ink, the flocculation becomes insufficient so that the optical density is reduced, the blur is caused more seriously and the intercolor blur is deteriorated. The pixel implies a lattice point constituted when a desirable image is divided at a minimum distance where the ink can be applied in a scanning direction and a sub-scanning direction. By giving a proper ink set to each pixel, a color and an image density can be regulated and an image is thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">It is preferable that the ink jet recording method (apparatus) according to the invention should employ a thermal ink jet recording system or a piezo ink jet recording system in respect of an effect of improving a blur and an intercolor blur. The cause is not apparent. Although an ink is heated during an ejection so that a viscosity is reduced in case of the thermal ink jet recording system, the temperature of the ink is dropped over a recording medium so that the viscosity is suddenly increased. Therefore, it can be supposed that there is an effect of improving a blur and an intercolor blur. On the other hand, in case of the piezo ink jet system, a liquid having a high viscosity can be ejected. It is possible to suppress the spread of the liquid having a high viscosity over the recording medium in the direction of the surface of the paper. Consequently, it is guessed that there is an effect of improving the blur and the intercolor blur.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A preferred embodiment of the ink jet recording apparatus according to the invention will be described below in detail with reference to the drawings.

An image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to the embodiment has such a structure as to be operated to form an image based on the ink jet recording method according to the invention. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is mainly constituted by an external cover <b>6</b>, a tray <b>7</b> capable of mounting a recording medium <b>1</b> such as a plain paper in a predetermined amount, a delivery roller (delivery means) <b>2</b> for delivering the recording medium <b>1</b> every sheet into the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> and an image forming portion <b>8</b> (image forming means) for ejecting an ink and a liquid composition to the surface of the recording medium <b>1</b>, thereby forming an image.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The delivery roller <b>2</b> is a paper feeding mechanism constituted by a pair of rollers provided rotatably in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, and serves to interpose the recording medium <b>1</b> set to the tray <b>7</b> and to deliver the recording medium <b>1</b> in a predetermined amount into the apparatus <b>100</b> every sheet in a predetermined timing.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The image forming portion <b>8</b> forms an image with an ink over the surface of the recording medium <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The ink tank <b>5</b> has ink tanks <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> which store inks or liquid compositions having different colors from each other so as to be ejected. These accommodate a black ink (K), a yellow ink (Y), a magenta ink (M) and a cyan ink (C) as a first liquid and a treating solution as a second liquid, for example. Of course, it is not necessary to provide an ink tank for the treating solution separately when the second liquid contains a coloring material.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, furthermore, the feeding signal cable <b>9</b> and the ink tank <b>5</b> are connected to the recording head <b>3</b>. When external image recording information is input from the feeding signal cable <b>9</b> to the recording head <b>3</b>, the recording head <b>3</b> sucks an ink in a predetermined amount from each of the ink tanks and ejects the same ink onto the surface of the recording medium based on the image recording information. The feeding signal cable <b>9</b> also plays a part in the supply of a necessary power for driving the recording head <b>3</b> to the recording head <b>3</b> in addition to the image recording information.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Moreover, the recording head <b>3</b> is provided and held on the carriage <b>10</b>, and the guide rod <b>11</b> and the timing belt <b>12</b> connected to the driving pulley <b>13</b> are connected to the carriage <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> comprises control means (not shown) for regulating the driving timing of the recording head <b>3</b> and the driving timing of the carriage <b>10</b> based on image recording information.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The maintenance unit <b>14</b> is connected to a pressure reducing device (not shown) through a tube.

The recording head <b>3</b> sequentially arranges ink tanks <b>51</b> to <b>55</b> in the sub-scanning direction (the delivery direction of the recording medium <b>1</b>: the direction of the arrow X) and similarly arranges a nozzle group for ejecting each color (including a treating solution) in the sub-scanning direction, which is not shown.

<p id="p-0210" num="0286">By using an ink set in accordance with Tables 1 and 2, printing is carried out. The printing is performed by a method of ejecting a second liquid (a liquid composition for ink jet) to an FX-P paper (manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.) and ejecting a first liquid (liquids 1 to 4 in accordance with the Tables) from thereabove by using a 800 dpi and 256-nozzle trial print head (an amount of drop of 14 ng). The printing is carried out in a general environment (a temperature of 23±0.5° C. and a humidity of 55±5% R. H), and a mass ratio of the amounts of application of the first and second liquids for forming one pixel is set to be 1:0.2.
