<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to imaging and treatment systems, such as but not limited to, an x-ray or fluoroscope imaging system combined with a linear accelerator, wherein a spatial relationship is maintained between the imaging system and the treatment system such that beams from both systems intersect at a common isocenter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A CT (computerized tomography) scanner has a large hollow bore into which a patient is inserted longitudinally for imaging. The patient moves generally longitudinally with respect to the scanner (which is typically stationary), and the scanning may be done for a full revolution about the longitudinal axis. No rotation is available for other axes. If need be, the patient can be moved afterwards to a treatment area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical prior art C-arm is a device with an imaging source (e.g., x-ray generator) mounted on one end of the C-arm and an image detector on the other end of the C-arm. The C-arm is a mobile device, and is therefore heavily used in treatment rooms. The construction does not typically allow full axial rotations but provides some limited rotations about a longitudinal axis through the patient (i.e., partial roll) and a vertical axis not through the patient (i.e., partial azimuth).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Imaging devices are also used to assist in target localization in conjunction with treatment equipment having its own rotating gantry, e.g., a linear accelerator (LINAC). However, the imaging device typically moves independently of the gantry of the treatment device. In other words, the coordinate system of the imaging device is separate and independent of the coordinate system of the treatment device. Since localization is required in the treatment device coordinate system, the respective coordinate systems of the imaging and the treatment devices have to be aligned or registered with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An isocentric treatment device, e.g., a linear accelerator, is operable to rotate a treatment head (e.g., a gantry arm with a radiation source disposed therein) having a treatment direction (e.g., the direction of a radiation beam) about a generally horizontal treatment axis (e.g., the longitudinal axis along a patient couch), wherein said treatment direction intersects with said treatment axis at an isocenter. Such an isocentric treatment device may be coupled to a couch operable to rotate (e.g., in azimuth) about a generally vertical couch axis intersecting said isocenter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An imaging device having an imaging direction (that is, a direction along which an imaging beam is directed) may be added to such an isocentric treatment device for target localization. The imaging device rotates about a generally horizontal imaging axis intersecting with the isocenter. Usually, the treatment axis and the imaging axis coincide, e.g., the imaging device is mounted on the treatment head and rotates with it. However, the prior art has the disadvantage of the imaging axis not being parallel to the couch longitudinal direction for all couch angles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention seeks to provide a novel system for imaging and for coupling an imaging system to a treatment device, as is described more in detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention combines advantages of a CT scanner and a C-arm device. The system of the invention may incorporate a large hollow bore rotator allowing full axial rotations. The system is mobile and allows transversal rotation about a patient while maintaining a fixed mechanical relationship with the rotator to avoid collision. In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the imaging system may be coupled to a rotating gantry, and a known geometrical relationship is maintained such that target localization by the imaging system (which may resemble a c-arm) is directly coupled to the gantry. A spatial relationship is maintained between the imaging system and the treatment system such that beams from both systems intersect at a common isocenter, as described in detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, in one non-limiting embodiment of the invention, the imaging system is coupled to an isocentric treatment device such that the imaging axis of the imaging system intersects the isocenter while staying parallel to the longitudinal direction of a patient support (couch) for all couch angles. The coupler that connects the imaging device to the treatment device maintains a fixed angle between the treatment direction and the imaging direction throughout a range of treatment, imaging and couch angles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention an imaging device including a rotator having a hollow bore for a patient to move therein and thereout, the rotator being rotatable about a longitudinal axis, at least one linkage arm extending outwards from the rotator, and imaging apparatus mounted on the at least one linkage arm, the imaging apparatus including an imaging source that emits an imaging beam to an imaging detector aligned therewith along an imaging direction, the at least one linkage arm capable of full axial rotation about an imaging isocenter along an entire length of the patient, the isocenter lying along a longitudinal axis, and wherein the imaging apparatus is operative to rotate and to capture images of the patient along the imaging direction as the patient is positioned at an angle in a range of about 0-90Â° inclusive with respect to the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A patient support member may be provided which is movable to cause relative motion between the patient and the imaging isocenter. The rotator may be rotatingly mounted to a stationary ring fixed to a portable frame. Coupling arms may be pivotally attached to the linkage arms at pivots. The coupling arms may be rotatingly attachable to a treatment device, such as by means of an interface member formed with an aperture for a treatment beam to pass therethrough. The treatment device may be rotatable about a treatment isocenter lying on a rotation axis and may emit a treatment beam along a treatment direction, wherein the treatment isocenter is located at an intersection of the rotation axis and the treatment direction. The treatment isocenter generally coincides with the imaging isocenter at a common isocenter. The patient support member may be rotatable about an axis intersecting the common isocenter. The coupling arms may maintain a fixed angle between the treatment direction and the imaging direction for a range of treatment device angles and imaging angles.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a coupler <b>10</b> for an imaging system, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The coupler <b>10</b> may include a rotator <b>12</b> having a hollow bore <b>50</b> for a patient to move therein and thereout. Although rotator <b>12</b> is shown as a ring, it does not necessarily have to be a ring, but rather any structure with hollow bore <b>50</b>. Rotator <b>12</b> is rotatable about a longitudinal axis <b>14</b>. For example, rotator <b>12</b> may be rotatingly mounted (e.g., by ball bearing races) to a stationary ring <b>16</b> that is fixed to a frame <b>18</b>. Frame <b>18</b> may be portable, such as by being mounted on wheels or castors <b>20</b>. One or more linkage arms <b>22</b> may extend from rotator <b>12</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, linkage arms <b>22</b> may be attached to different mounting provisions <b>24</b> (e.g., mounting holes on rotator <b>12</b>) spaced about axis <b>14</b>. For example, linkage arms <b>22</b> may be mounted 180Â° part on rotator <b>12</b>, or at any other angular separation. One or more coupling arms <b>26</b> may be pivotally attached to linkage arms <b>22</b> at pivots <b>28</b>. Coupling arms <b>26</b> may be rotatingly mounted on a turret of a treatment device by means of an interface member <b>30</b>, as shown and described further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The interface member <b>30</b> may be a bar or similar structure that connects coupling arms <b>26</b> together. The interface member <b>30</b> may have an aperture <b>32</b> formed therein for a treatment beam to pass therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which illustrates the coupler <b>10</b> with imaging apparatus <b>40</b> mounted thereon, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The imaging systems <b>40</b> may include an imaging source <b>42</b> (e.g., x-ray source) that emits an imaging beam <b>44</b> (e.g., x-ray beam) along an imaging direction to an imaging detector <b>46</b> (e.g., x-ray detector) aligned therewith. The imaging apparatus <b>40</b> may include image processing equipment (not shown) for processing images captured by the imaging detector <b>46</b>.

Although the invention may be carried out with any number of imaging sources <b>42</b> and imaging detectors <b>46</b>, in the non-limiting illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pair of imaging sources <b>42</b> and imaging detectors <b>46</b> is mounted on pads <b>43</b> at the end of arms <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Rotator <b>12</b> defines a hollow bore <b>50</b> for a patient to move therein and thereout. It is noted that in a prior art C-arm, a patient cannot be moved longitudinally past the pivot point of the C-arm. In contrast, in the present invention, the patient may be moved unrestricted in and out of the hollow bore <b>50</b> along axis <b>14</b>, and at the same time, the linkage arms <b>22</b> are capable of full axial rotation about the imaging isocenter <b>48</b> along the entire length of the patient. Moreover, in the present invention, the patient may be at least partially rotated about another axis <b>52</b>, transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>14</b> (such as a vertical (azimuth) axis <b>52</b> that passes through isocenter <b>48</b>), and imaging apparatus <b>40</b> may still capture images of the patient as he/she is rotated about axis <b>52</b>. In general, the imaging apparatus <b>40</b> may rotate and may capture images of the patient along the imaging direction of imaging beam <b>44</b> as the patient is positioned at an angle in a range of about 0-90Â° inclusive with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>14</b>. The patient may be moved out of hollow bore <b>50</b> and positioned perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis <b>14</b>, wherein the coupler <b>10</b> and imaging apparatus <b>40</b> may be operated similarly to a C-arm.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, which illustrate an imaging and treatment system <b>60</b>, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For the sake of simplicity, imaging apparatus <b>40</b> is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The imaging and treatment system <b>60</b> may include a treatment device <b>62</b> (e.g., a LINAC) operative to emit a treatment beam <b>64</b> (e.g., an electromagnetic wave or radiation beam) along a treatment axis <b>66</b> from a treatment source <b>68</b> (e.g., a radioactive source) mounted in treatment device <b>62</b>. Treatment device <b>62</b> may be rotatable about a gantry axis <b>70</b>. The treatment axis <b>66</b> and the gantry axis <b>70</b> may intersect at isocenter <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As mentioned above, the coupling arms <b>26</b> of coupler <b>10</b> may be rotatingly mounted on a turret <b>72</b> of treatment device <b>62</b> by means of interface member <b>30</b>. The interface member <b>30</b> may be a bar or similar structure that connects coupling arms <b>26</b> together. The treatment beam <b>64</b> may pass through aperture <b>32</b>. The coupling arms <b>26</b> are thus rotatable about the treatment axis <b>66</b>. When imaging apparatus <b>40</b> is mounted on coupler <b>10</b> (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the coupling arms <b>26</b> maintain a spatial relationship between imaging apparatus <b>40</b> and treatment device <b>62</b> such that the imaging beam <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the treatment axis <b>66</b> intersect at an isocenter <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the imaging and treatment system <b>60</b> may further include a patient support member <b>74</b> (e.g., a patient couch or table) rotatable about a turning axis, which in the non-limiting illustrated embodiment is the (azimuth) axis <b>52</b>. Frame <b>18</b> may be secured to patient support member <b>74</b> so that coupler <b>10</b> (and imaging apparatus <b>40</b> mounted on coupler <b>10</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be rotated about axis <b>52</b>. The patient support member <b>74</b> may be moved to cause relative motion between the patient and the imaging and treatment isocenter <b>48</b>. For example, the patient may be moved longitudinally along patient support member <b>74</b>. Additionally or alternatively, patient support member <b>74</b> may be longitudinally movable along axis <b>14</b> to bring the patient in and out of the hollow bore <b>50</b>. As the patient support member <b>74</b> is rotated about axis <b>52</b>, coupler <b>10</b> may maintain the intersection of the imaging beam <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the turning axis <b>52</b> at isocenter <b>48</b>. As mentioned above, the patient may be at least partially rotated about axis <b>52</b>, and imaging apparatus <b>40</b> may still capture images of the patient as he/she is rotated about axis <b>52</b>. Additionally, the coupler <b>10</b> may maintain a fixed angle between the imaging beam <b>44</b> and the treatment axis <b>66</b> during rotation of the imaging apparatus <b>40</b> (and of treatment device <b>62</b> about gantry axis <b>70</b>), as is now explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which illustrates rotator <b>12</b> of coupler <b>10</b> arranged at an angle Î¸ about turning (azimuth or vertical) axis <b>38</b>. The angle Î¸ is measured between the central axis <b>14</b> of rotator <b>12</b> and gantry axis <b>70</b>. The treatment device <b>62</b> is slightly rotated at an angle Ï about gantry axis <b>70</b>. The angle Ï is measured between treatment axis <b>66</b> and turning axis <b>52</b>. As mentioned above, the coupling arms <b>26</b> of coupler <b>10</b> that attach imaging apparatus <b>40</b> to turret <b>72</b> of treatment device <b>62</b> can rotate freely about treatment axis <b>66</b>, and the imaging beam <b>44</b> and the treatment axis <b>66</b> intersect at isocenter <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The rotator <b>12</b> of coupler <b>10</b> has been maintained at angle Î¸ about the turning axis <b>52</b>. The imaging beam <b>44</b> and the treatment axis <b>66</b> still intersect at isocenter <b>48</b>, even though the gantry of treatment device <b>62</b> has been rotated about gantry axis <b>70</b> through a new angle Î±. Thus, coupler <b>10</b> maintains the intersection of imaging beam <b>44</b> and turning axis <b>52</b> at isocenter <b>48</b>. Additionally, coupler <b>10</b> maintains a fixed angle (in this case 90Â°) between the imaging beam <b>44</b> and the treatment axis <b>66</b> during rotation of the gantry of treatment device <b>62</b> about gantry axis <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The rotator <b>12</b> of coupler <b>10</b> has now been rotated through a further angle Î² about turning axis <b>52</b>. The gantry of treatment device <b>62</b> has been rotated about gantry axis <b>70</b> through an angle Î³. Even with these rotations, the imaging beam <b>44</b> and the treatment axis <b>66</b> still intersect at isocenter <b>48</b>. Thus again, coupler <b>10</b> maintains the intersection of imaging beam <b>44</b> and turning axis <b>52</b> at isocenter <b>48</b>. Additionally, coupler <b>10</b> maintains a fixed angle (in this case 90Â°) between the imaging beam <b>44</b> and the treatment axis <b>66</b> during rotation of the imaging apparatus <b>40</b> about turning axis <b>52</b> and of the gantry of treatment device <b>62</b> about gantry axis <b>70</b>.</p>
