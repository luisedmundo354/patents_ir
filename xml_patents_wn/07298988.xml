<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an image forming apparatus provided with an openable and closable cover.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Image forming apparatus include a multi-function printer (hereinafter referred to as the “MFP”), a copying machine, a printer, a facsimile apparatus and a compound machine of these. Some of the image forming apparatus are provided with an interchanging cover for opening and closing an apparatus main body to interchange a process cartridge provided with a photosensitive drum on which a toner image is formed, and a developing device for developing the photosensitive drum (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-356548).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, some image forming apparatuses are provided with an openable and closable cover for interchanging a developing device for developing an image forming member unit (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-171327). Also, an openable and closable cover is described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-66472.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the image forming apparatus of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-356548, the interchanging cover is used in common as an entire side of the apparatus, and this leads to the problem that there is required a wide space for opening and closing the interchanging cover.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The image forming apparatus of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-171327 is designed such that an apparatus main body is upwardly opened in such a manner as to upwardly bend the openable and closable cover and therefore, there is required a wide space for opening and closing the openable and closable cover.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In Japanese Patent Application. Laid-open No. 2000-66472, there is described a construction in which an image reading device for reading the image of an original is pivotally moved. Also, as another embodiment, there is disclosed an openable and closable cover which is inwardly bent.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the embodiment wherein the image reading device is pivotally moved, if an attempt is made to make large an opening in which the openable and closable cover is opened and closed, the openable and closable cover becomes large and therefore, an area required for the pivotal movement of the openable and closable cover becomes large. Accordingly, the image reading device must be greatly pivotally moved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, in the embodiment of the inwardly bent openable and closable cover disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-66472, even if the openable and closable cover is pivotally moved, maintenance for an image forming apparatus main body must be done below the fixed image reading device and therefore, the working property for the maintenance is poor. To improve this working property, the cover can be greatly separated upwardly from the image forming apparatus main body. Consequently, if an attempt is made to improve the working property, the vertical size of the apparatus will become large.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has as its object to provide an image forming apparatus in which downsizing is achieved by reducing the space for opening and closing an openable and closable cover and yet, in which the working property for maintenance or the like is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above object, the image forming apparatus of the present invention has an apparatus main body provided with an image forming portion for forming an image, an opening formed in the apparatus main body, an openable and closable cover for opening and closing the opening and provided with a first cover pivotally provided in the apparatus main body, and a second cover pivotally provided on the first cover, and an image reading device provided above the opening for reading the image of an original, and when the first cover is pivotally moved in a direction to open the opening relative to the apparatus main body, the second cover is pivotally moved to the opening side relative to the first cover, and when the openable and closable cover has opened the opening, the openable and closable cover maintains a state in which it has opened the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, the image forming apparatus has an apparatus main body provided with an image forming portion for forming an image, an opening formed in the apparatus main body and communicating with the interior of the apparatus main body, an openable and closable cover for opening and closing the opening and provided with a first cover pivotally provided in the apparatus main body and a second cover pivotably provided on the first cover, and an image reading apparatus provided above the opening for reading the image of an original, and the image reading device is rotatably provided in the apparatus main body so as to be capable of opening the upper part of the opening, the rotation direction of the image reading device and the direction of pivotal movement of the first cover being the same, and when the first cover is pivotally moved in a direction to open the opening relative to the apparatus main body, the second cover is pivotally moved to the apparatus main body side relative to the first cover.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(Color MFP Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The color MFP as an image forming apparatus will hereinafter be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>. The color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> is adapted to be used from the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by a user. The color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> is provided with an image forming apparatus main body (hereinafter referred to as the apparatus main body) <b>104</b>, an automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and an image reading device <b>103</b> for reading the image of an original. The apparatus main body <b>104</b> is a laser beam printer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> is adapted to automatically successively feed originals S stacked on an original stacking plate <b>102</b> to the image reading device <b>103</b>, and discharge the originals from which original information has been read by the image reading device <b>103</b> to the upper surface (back) of a pressure plate <b>109</b>. The pressure plate <b>109</b> is adapted to urge a sheet original or a book original placed on an original plate <b>119</b> against the original plate <b>119</b>. The pressure plate <b>109</b> is provided in the image reading device <b>103</b> for pivotal movement about a pressure plate shaft <b>109</b><i>a</i>. The supporting portion <b>109</b><i>b </i>of the pressure plate <b>109</b> is fitted in a hole in the image reading device <b>103</b>. The pressure plate <b>109</b> is detachably mountable on the image reading device <b>103</b>. That is, the supporting portion <b>109</b><i>b </i>of the pressure plate <b>109</b> can be taken out from and put into the hole in the image reading device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The automatic original feeder <b>161</b> has a U-turn conveying roller <b>106</b><i>d </i>which will be described later. The automatic original feeder <b>161</b> is adapted to be rearwardly rotated relative to the image reading device <b>103</b> (in a direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) to thereby open the original plate <b>119</b>. When the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> is rotated, the pressure plate <b>109</b> exposes the upper surface of the original plate <b>119</b> to thereby enable the sheet original or the book original to be placed on the original plate <b>119</b>. When the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> is returned to its original position, the pressure plate <b>109</b> urges the sheet original or the book original placed on the original plate <b>119</b> against the original plate <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image reading device <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can lead an original fed in by the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> by the reduction optical system reading portion <b>108</b> of a scanner <b>107</b>. Also, the image reading device <b>103</b> can read the sheet original or the book original placed on the original plate <b>119</b> by the movement of the scanner <b>107</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow B. The scanner <b>107</b> is reciprocally moved with a guide shaft <b>114</b> as a guide. The image reading device <b>103</b> has an operating portion <b>105</b>. The operating portion <b>105</b> is provided with a display portion for controlling the entire color MFP apparatus <b>100</b>, an input key, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The image reading device <b>103</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow A about a reading device shaft <b>103</b><i>a</i>, integrally with the automatic original feeder <b>161</b>, by the user. The purpose of rotating the image reading device <b>103</b> is to effect the maintenance of the apparatus main body <b>104</b> such as interchanging, for example, a process cartridge <b>131</b> or a developing cartridge <b>133</b> containing a toner therein as a toner cartridge with a new cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The apparatus main body <b>104</b> is provided with a laser scanner <b>110</b>, an image forming portion <b>111</b>, a cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b>, an upper sheet discharging portion <b>113</b>, a cartridge cover <b>1</b> as an openable and closable cover, a multi-paper (MP) feeding portion <b>125</b>, etc. The laser scanner <b>110</b> is adapted to apply a laser beam to an image bearing member <b>131</b><i>a </i>corresponding to each color, on the basis of image information read by the image reading device <b>103</b>, or image information sent from the outside. The image bearing member <b>131</b><i>a </i>is provided in the process cartridge <b>131</b> and is detachably mountable with respect to the apparatus main body.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The image forming portion <b>111</b> forms an image on a sheet fed from the cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b>. The image forming portion <b>111</b> is constituted by a developing cartridge <b>133</b>, a process cartridge <b>131</b>, a secondary transferring portion <b>134</b>, etc. The image bearing member <b>131</b><i>a </i>is developed with a toner of each color contained in the developing cartridge <b>133</b> on the basis of the laser beam from the laser scanner <b>110</b>. The cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b> is adapted to feed the sheets contained therein one by one to a pair of ante-transfer rollers <b>124</b><i>e</i>. The upper sheet discharging portion <b>113</b> is used in common with the upper cover of the apparatus main body <b>104</b> and the cartridge cover <b>1</b>, and is adapted to stack a plurality of sheets P thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the original conveying portion <b>106</b> of the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> separates the originals S stacked on the original stacking plate <b>102</b> one by one by a separating pad <b>106</b><i>a </i>and a separating roller <b>106</b><i>b </i>with which this separating pad <b>106</b><i>a </i>is brought into pressure contact. Then, the separated original is conveyed to a U-turn sheet path constituted by a portion of an outer original guide <b>116</b> and a portion of an inner original guide <b>118</b>, by conveying runner <b>106</b><i>c </i>pressed by a pressure spring (not shown), and a U-turn conveying roller <b>106</b><i>d </i>with which the conveying roller <b>106</b><i>c </i>is brought into pressure contact. Further, the original conveying portion <b>106</b> conveys the original to the reduction optical system reading portion <b>108</b> of the image reading device <b>103</b> by a sheet feeding runner <b>106</b><i>e </i>pressed by a pressure spring (not shown), and a U-turn conveying roller <b>106</b><i>d </i>with which this sheet feeding runner <b>106</b><i>e </i>is brought into pressure contact.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The original S is pressed against the reading position of the reduction optical system reading portion <b>108</b> by the resilient force of the original pressing plate of an original pressing portion (not shown), and the image information of the original S is read by the image reading device <b>103</b>. Thereafter, the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> discharges the original S onto the pressure plate <b>109</b> by a sheet discharging runner <b>106</b><i>g </i>pressed by a pressure spring, and a sheet discharging roller <b>106</b><i>h </i>with which this sheet discharging runner <b>106</b><i>g </i>is brought into pressure contact. In the meantime, the original S is guided by the outer original guide <b>116</b> and the inner original guide <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the original stacking plate <b>102</b>, there are provided a pair of sliders <b>102</b><i>a </i>(in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, looking like one by overlapping) slidable in a direction (the width direction of the original S) perpendicular to the conveying direction of the original S. The pair of sliders <b>102</b><i>a </i>are moved toward and away from each other by the user, and can be moved toward each other to thereby true up the opposite side edges of the originals S stacked on the original stacking plate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the image reading device <b>103</b>, the reduction optical system reading portion <b>108</b> is a portion which applies irradiating light from an LED array as a light source provided in the scanner <b>107</b> to the image information surface of the original S. The image reading device <b>103</b> reduces reflected light reflected from the image information surface by a mirror and a lens and images it on a CCD, and reads the image information of the original.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The scanner <b>107</b> of the image reading device <b>103</b> can also be moved under the original plate <b>119</b> by a driving motor (not shown) with the guide shaft <b>114</b> as a guide to thereby read the original S placed on the original plate <b>119</b>. The original placed on the original plate <b>119</b> is urged against the original plate <b>119</b> by the pressure plate <b>109</b>, whereby it is prevented from floating.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b> is disposed on the bottom of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. Sheets are stacked on the inner plate <b>112</b><i>e </i>of a sheet supplying cassette <b>112</b><i>a</i>. The inner plate <b>112</b><i>e </i>is upwardly pushed by a inner plate spring <b>112</b><i>f</i>. Accordingly, the sheets are brought into pressure contact with a semicircular sheet feeding roller <b>112</b><i>b </i>by the inner plate <b>112</b><i>e, </i>and are separated one by one by the rotation of the sheet feeding roller <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the friction of a separating pad <b>112</b><i>c </i>(a frictional piece separating process), and is fed out from the sheet supplying cassette <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The thus separated sheet P has its leading edge detected by a top sensor <b>124</b><i>f </i>after a predetermined time. If the top sensor <b>124</b><i>f </i>does not detect the leading edge of the sheet P within a predetermined time after the supply of the sheet has been started, a controlling portion (not shown) judges it as jam, and causes the operating portion <b>105</b> to display an indication that sheet jam has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A latent image is formed on an image bearing member (photosensitive drum) <b>131</b><i>a </i>which is a drum-shaped photosensitive member provided in the process cartridge <b>131</b> by the laser scanner <b>110</b>. This latent image is toner-developed by the developing cartridge <b>133</b> rotatively moved to a developing position opposed to the image bearing member <b>131</b><i>a </i>by the rotation of a revolving drum <b>132</b> which is a rotation type developing cartridge changeover mechanism, and becomes a toner image. The toner image on the image bearing member <b>131</b><i>a </i>is transferred onto an intermediate transfer belt <b>131</b><i>b </i>in a primary transferring portion <b>131</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The intermediate transfer belt <b>131</b><i>b </i>is circulated by a driving roller <b>131</b><i>d </i>in the process cartridge <b>131</b>. The driving roller <b>131</b><i>d </i>is rotated by the drive source of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. The latent image forming step, the latent image developing step and the primary transferring step are subsequently repeated with respect to respective developing cartridges <b>133</b>Y, <b>133</b>M, <b>133</b>C and <b>133</b>Bk. Thereby, multicolor images are formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>131</b><i>b</i>. Thus, in a secondary transferring portion <b>134</b>, the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt <b>131</b><i>b </i>are transferred to the sheet P sent from the cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b>. At this time, the sheet is fed into the secondary transferring portion <b>134</b> at a timing conforming to the position of the toner images by the pair of ante-transfer rollers <b>124</b><i>e </i>so that the toner images may be transferred to a predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The yellow, magenta, cyan and black developing cartridges <b>133</b>Y, <b>133</b>M, <b>133</b>C and <b>133</b>Bk will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>. The constructions of the developing cartridges of the respective colors are the same and therefore, the reference numeral “<b>133</b>” is used for them.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The developing cartridge <b>133</b> is constituted by a developing sleeve <b>133</b><i>a </i>which is a developer carrying member, a developing blade <b>133</b><i>b</i>, a developer containing portion <b>133</b><i>d</i>, a cartridge frame <b>133</b><i>g</i>, etc. The developing sleeve <b>133</b><i>a </i>is rotated by the drive source of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. The opposite end portions of the developing cartridge <b>133</b> are fixed to a revolving drum <b>132</b> by projections <b>133</b><i>f</i>. The projections <b>133</b><i>f </i>are provided so as to outwardly protrude from the cartridge frame <b>133</b><i>g </i>of the developing cartridge <b>133</b>. Also, a drive connecting member (not shown) detachably engaged with the drive connecting member of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>, and a contact portion (not shown) for applying a developing bias from the high voltage source of the apparatus main body <b>104</b> to the developing sleeve <b>133</b><i>a </i>are provided on the longitudinal end surfaces of the cartridge frame <b>133</b><i>g </i>of the developing cartridge <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The revolving drum <b>132</b> is rotated while holding the developing cartridge <b>133</b>. The revolving drum <b>132</b> has the side plates <b>132</b><i>a </i>of a disk, a driving side side plate (not shown), and mounting portions <b>132</b><i>c </i>for the developing cartridge <b>133</b> at four locations at equal intervals circumferentially of the two side plates <b>132</b><i>a</i>, and is rotatably provided in the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. Also, flags (not shown) corresponding to the colors of the respective toners contained in the containing portion of the developing cartridge <b>133</b> are provided on the sides of the side plates <b>132</b><i>a </i>of the developing cartridge <b>133</b>. These flags (not shown) are adapted to cross a photosensor (not shown) provided in the apparatus main body by the revolution of the revolving drum <b>132</b>. This photosensor is a revolutions sensor for detecting the revolved position of the revolving drum <b>132</b>. A gear is formed on the outer periphery of the revolving drum <b>132</b>. The revolving drum <b>132</b> is rotated by a developing motor (not shown), and the developing sleeve <b>133</b><i>a </i>of each of the developing cartridges <b>133</b>Y, <b>133</b>M, <b>133</b>C and <b>133</b>Bk is stopped at a developing position opposed to the image bearing member <b>131</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the sheet P has its image information fixed by a fixing portion <b>141</b>, and is discharged to the upper sheet discharging portion <b>113</b> by sheet discharging rollers <b>151</b>. The sheet P has its side edge regulated by a sheet regulating plate (not shown) movably mounted in accordance with the sheet size so that a skew feed or a misfeed may not occur. The image is recorded on the underside of the sheets P stacked on the sheet supplying cassette <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, the presence or absence of the sheet P is detected by a cassette sensor (not shown). The number of sheets stackable on the cassette <b>112</b><i>a </i>is about 250 sheets. The cassette <b>112</b><i>a </i>is adapted to be drawn out in a forward direction (the direction indicated by the arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) relative to the apparatus main body <b>104</b> (a front loading type). Also, the stackable sheet sizes are five kinds, i.e., A4, A5, B5, letter and legal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, the present color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> has a multi-paper (MP) feeding portion <b>125</b> on the front face of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. The MP feeding portion <b>125</b> has an openable and closable MP tray <b>125</b><i>f</i>. The MP tray <b>125</b><i>f </i>serves also as a front cover. The MP tray <b>125</b><i>f </i>is provided with an MP extension tray <b>125</b><i>e </i>for supporting a sheet whose trailing edge protrudes from the MP tray <b>125</b><i>f </i>so as to be drawn out. An MP inner plate (not shown) is upwardly biased by an MP inner plate spring (not shown), but is adapted to be depressed into a standby state by a cam (not shown) so that the sheets P may be stacked thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When a signal for starting the MP feeding is produced from the controlling portion (not shown) of the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b>, the cam (not shown) is pivotally moved and the depressed state of the MP inner plate (not shown) is released. The sheets P stacked on the MP inner plate are fed out from the MP inner plate by a semicircular MP feeding roller <b>125</b><i>a </i>and also, are separated one by one while being sandwiched between the MP feeding roller <b>125</b><i>a </i>and an MP separating pad <b>125</b><i>b </i>(a friction piece separating type) and are conveyed. The thus separated sheet P continues to be pressure-conveyed by the MP feeding roller <b>125</b><i>a </i>and the MP separating pad <b>125</b><i>b</i>, and is delivered to the pair of ante-transfer rollers <b>124</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the top sensor <b>124</b><i>f </i>does not detect the leading edge of the sheet P within a predetermined time after the sheet supply has been started, the controlling portion (not shown) determines that jam has occurred to the sheet. The controlling portion which has thus determined that a jam has occurred stops the sheet conveying operation of the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b>, and also displays an indication of the occurrence of a sheet jam on the operating portion <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the sheet P continues to be conveyed still after it has arrived at the pair of ante-transfer rollers <b>124</b><i>e</i>, and has its leading edge position detected by the top sensor <b>124</b><i>f</i>. The sheet P having had its leading edge position thus detected is timed and conveyed to the secondary transferring portion <b>134</b> so that the toner images formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>131</b><i>b </i>can be transferred to a predetermined position on the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The MP feeding portion <b>125</b> is not provided with a registration mechanism. Therefore, the sheet P has its side edge regulated by a sheet regulating plate (not shown) movably mounted in accordance with the sheet size so that skew feed or misfeed may not occur. The image is recorded on the upper surface of the sheets being stacked on the MP tray <b>125</b><i>f </i>or the sheets P stacked thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The presence or absence of the sheets P is detected by an MP sensor (not shown) The number of sheets stackable on the MP feeding portion <b>125</b> is about <b>100</b> sheets. The present color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> is provided with the MP feeding portion <b>125</b>, whereby it is possible to add postcards and business cards to the suppliable sheet sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also, the cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b> and a second stage cassette sheet supplying portion (not shown) similar in structure to the cassette sheet supplying portion <b>112</b> are adapted to be capable of being separated from or coupled to each other as an option. The number of sheets stackable on the entire apparatus can be changed from about 250 sheets to about 600 sheets.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Cartridge Cover of the Color MFP Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the process cartridge <b>131</b> and the developing cartridge <b>133</b> are adapted to be capable of being taken out from the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> of the apparatus main body <b>104</b> when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is opened. The mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> is the opening of the present invention formed in the apparatus main body <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> with the cartridge cover <b>1</b> closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref> are cross-sectional views of the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is opened. The cartridge cover <b>1</b> as an openable and closable cover has a first cover <b>2</b> and a second cover <b>3</b> as cover members. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> in a state in which the cartridge cover <b>1</b> has closed the mounting and dismounting port. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> in a state in which the cartridge cover <b>1</b> has opened the mounting and dismounting port.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first cover <b>2</b> is provided so as to be pivotally movable by about 90 degrees or greater relative to the apparatus main body <b>104</b>, by a shaft <b>2</b><i>a </i>provided on one end side of the first cover <b>2</b>, and a bearing portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>provided on a top cover <b>4</b> which is the upper cover of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. The mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> can be opened by the first cover <b>2</b> being pivotally moved. Also, a bearing portion <b>2</b><i>b </i>is provided on the other end of the first cover <b>2</b>. The second cover <b>3</b> has a shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>on the first cover <b>2</b> side. The bearing portion <b>2</b><i>b </i>provided on the first cover <b>2</b> pivotally holds the shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>provided on the second cover <b>3</b>. That is, the second cover <b>3</b> is supported for pivotal movement about the shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>relative to the first cover <b>2</b>. When the first cover <b>2</b> is pivotally moved relative to the apparatus main body <b>104</b> in a direction to open the mounting and dismounting port, the second cover <b>3</b> is pivotally moved to the apparatus main body <b>104</b> side relative to the first cover <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The joint portions <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the first cover <b>2</b> and the second cover <b>3</b> overlap each other. The joint portions <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>are joined together, whereby the first and second covers become incapable of being pivotally moved in an opening direction. That is, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is adapted to bend only inwardly. The joint portions <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>are stoppers for preventing the second cover <b>3</b> from being pivotally moved to the opposite side from the apparatus main body <b>104</b> relative to the first cover <b>2</b>. That is, the joint portions <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>serve as stoppers for preventing the cartridge cover <b>1</b> from assuming a shape along the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> has closed the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b>, and bending in a direction away from the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, the joint portions <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the first cover <b>2</b> and the second cover <b>3</b> are made to overlap each other, whereby even when the laser beam is reflected by a foreign substance or the like and travels toward the outside of the apparatus, the laser beam does not leak to the outside of the apparatus. Also, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is adapted to close the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> while assuming a shape along the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> and therefore, the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> can be easily closed by the gravity of the cartridge cover <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Also, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> has its range of pivotal movement regulated by the second cover stopper <b>3</b><i>d </i>of the second cover <b>3</b> abutting against the first cover <b>2</b> in a closing direction as well (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). When the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is opening the mounting and dismounting port (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), the angle of the second cover <b>3</b> with respect to the first cover <b>2</b> is kept at a predetermined angle. When the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is closed from its opened state, the angle of the second cover <b>3</b> with respect to the first cover <b>2</b> does not become smaller than the predetermined angle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the image reading device <b>103</b> is rotatably provided in the apparatus main body <b>104</b> so that the upper part of the mounting and dismounting port can be opened. The direction of rotation of the image reading device <b>103</b> and the direction of pivotal movement of the first cover <b>2</b> are the same. A stopper receiver <b>103</b><i>a </i>is provided in the lower portion of the image reading device <b>103</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the design is such that when an attempt is made to close the image reading device <b>103</b> in a state in which the cartridge cover <b>1</b> opens the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b>, the stopper receiver <b>103</b><i>a </i>is engaged by the stopper (engaging portion) <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the first cover <b>2</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> cannot be singly closed. Therefore, a hand or a thing can be prevented from being nipped between the second cover <b>3</b> and the top cover <b>4</b>. The stopper <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the first cover <b>2</b> is a stopper which hinders the image reading device <b>103</b> from being closed in a state in which the image reading device <b>103</b> and the cartridge cover <b>1</b> are opened. The stopper <b>2</b><i>c </i>restrains a rotation of the image reading device <b>103</b> in a direction to be closed in a state that the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The upper surface of the top cover <b>4</b>, particularly the surroundings of the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b>, and particularly the distal end of the second cover <b>3</b> are smoothly formed with respect to the closing direction of the second cover <b>3</b>. When the distal ends of the top cover <b>4</b> and the second cover <b>3</b> are made smooth, even if the hand is released while the cartridge cover <b>1</b>, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is brought down to the right side and closed in a state in which it is bent into a dog-legged shape, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> slides on the top cover <b>4</b> by its own weight. Consequently, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> slides on the upper surface of the top cover <b>4</b>, whereby the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> can be closed easily and reliably. At this time, the locking of the second cover <b>3</b> relative to the apparatus main body <b>104</b> is set to such intensity as to be closed by the weight of the cartridge cover <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Near the shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>provided in the second cover <b>3</b>, abutting portions <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are provided on the first cover <b>2</b> and the second cover <b>3</b>, respectively. The abutting portions <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are designed to contact with an opposed portion <b>4</b><i>b </i>on the top cover <b>4</b> in a state in which the cartridge cover <b>1</b> has closed the top cover <b>4</b>. The joint portions <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the first cover <b>2</b> and the second cover <b>3</b>, even if pressed from above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, are adapted to be received by the opposed portion <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, a force does not concentrate only on the second cover bearing portion <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the first cover <b>2</b> and the first cover side shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the second cover <b>3</b>. By such a construction, the damaging of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is adapted to be prevented. Here, the covers are made to overlap each other so that the laser beam may not leak to the outside of the apparatus even if the laser beam happens to be reflected by a foreign substance or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, it becomes unnecessary to provide each cover with an interlock switch <b>136</b> as a stop switch for preventing the malfunctioning when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is opened. That is, the number of the interlock switches can be one, and it is possible to realize a cost equal to that when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is constructed of a single member.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">That is, only one interlock switch as a detecting sensor for detecting the opening and closing of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is provided for all of the divided cover members. Thereby, it is possible to prevent an increase in cost which would otherwise be caused by dividing the cartridge cover <b>1</b> into a plurality of parts. In this case, the interlock switch is provided on the foremost one of the plurality of cover members, and the opening and closing of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is detected on the basis of the position of the foremost cover member. When intermediate one of the plurality of cover members deviates from a normal operating position, it causes a deviation of a detecting position and therefore, the interlock switch does not detect the opened state of the cover. Such malfunctioning can be prevented. Also, the interlock switch is provided in the root portion of the first cover <b>2</b>, whereby it can be disposed at a place most difficult to touch, and therefore, erroneous detection can be prevented. When the interlock switch is provided in the root portion of the first cover <b>2</b>, the first cover cannot be outwardly bent and therefore the second cover <b>3</b> cannot be singly opened and thus, safety can be secured. Further, in order to secure the user's safety when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is opened, the strength of the divided portion of the second cover <b>3</b>, and the strength of a supporting portion journalled to make the pivotal movement of the second cover <b>3</b> possible are increased to thereby prevent the cartridge cover from being damaged during the ordinary use thereof. The interlock switch <b>136</b> produces a signal for detecting the opened state of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> when it is opened, and stopping the operation of the image forming portion <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cartridge cover <b>1</b> is divided into a plurality of covers, i.e., the first cover <b>2</b> and the second cover <b>3</b>, and the portion between the covers <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> is made inwardly bendable, whereby an opening and closing space above the apparatus main body <b>104</b> necessary for the opening and closing of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> can be made small. Particularly, the height of the opening and closing space can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As a result, when the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> is used simply in the apparatus main body <b>104</b>, the space necessary for the apparatus main body <b>104</b> can be made narrower than in the conventional art, and when the apparatus main body <b>104</b> is to be installed on a shelf, the shelf itself can be made low or the spacing between shelves can be made narrow.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, in a case where the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> are provided above the apparatus main body <b>104</b>, the image reading device <b>103</b> can be disposed in proximity to the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> can be made compact in the height direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> are provided for pivotal movement relative to the apparatus main body <b>104</b>. As described above, the opening and closing space for the cartridge cover <b>1</b> may be narrow and therefore, the opening angles of the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> can be made small. Accordingly, the opening and closing of the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> can be done easily.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, the opening angles of the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> can be made small. Consequently, it never happens that when the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> are rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to thereby separate the pressure plate <b>109</b> from the original plate <b>119</b> and the original plate <b>119</b> is opened, the hand does not reach the pressure plate <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, in order to simplify the mounting structure of the pressure plate <b>109</b> with respect to the automatic original feeder <b>161</b>, the present embodiment is a form in which the pressure plate <b>109</b> is taken out from and put into the automatic original feeder <b>161</b>. Here, as described above, the opening angles of the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> can be made small and therefore, the pressure plate <b>109</b> can be prevented from falling off the automatic original feeder <b>161</b>. That is, the design is made such that even when the image reading device has been pivotally moved with the pressure plate <b>109</b> opened, the image reading device <b>103</b> is not pivotally moved by a predetermined angle or greater so that the pressure plate <b>109</b> may not fall.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Also, the cartridge cover <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is held in a state in which it is bent into a dog-legged shape when the mounting and dismounting port <b>135</b> has been opened. The center of gravity G of the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is set at a position at which a projected piece <b>2</b><i>g </i>provided on the first cover <b>2</b> is received by a receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a </i>as a regulating member provided in the apparatus main body <b>104</b>, and can maintain a bent state. When the cartridge cover <b>1</b> has opened the mounting and dismounting port, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is maintained in the state in which it has opened the mounting and dismounting port by its own weight. Thereby, the work of interchanging the process cartridge <b>131</b> and the developing cartridge <b>133</b> can be effected easily while the cartridge cover <b>1</b> remains opened.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The second cover <b>3</b> is held so that the angle of pivotal movement of the second cover <b>3</b> relative to the first cover <b>2</b> in a state in which the first cover <b>2</b> has its pivotal movement regulated by the receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a </i>may be a predetermined angle. The predetermined angle is such an angle that the second cover <b>3</b> is not pivotally moved to the apparatus main body side relative to the first cover <b>2</b> when the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is closed from a state in which the pivotal movement of the first cover <b>2</b> is regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A wire <b>160</b> as coupling means for opening the cartridge cover <b>1</b> in operative association with the image reading device <b>103</b> when the automatic original feeder <b>161</b> and the image reading device <b>103</b> have been opened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be provided between the image reading device <b>103</b> and the cartridge cover <b>1</b>. Owing to the wire <b>60</b>, when the image reading device <b>103</b> has been opened, the cartridge cover <b>1</b> is also opened in operative association therewith and therefore, the interchange of the process cartridge <b>131</b> and the developing cartridge <b>133</b> can be effected easily. The coupling means for the cartridge cover <b>1</b> to be operatively associated with the pivotal movement of the image reading device <b>103</b> in a direction to open the upper part of the mounting and dismounting port is not restricted to the wire <b>160</b>, but use may be made of a chain or a link mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a state in which the cartridge cover <b>1</b> of the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> according to the present embodiment is closed. The cartridge cover <b>1</b> is adapted to stack the sheets thereon. Also, if two ribs <b>2</b><i>f </i>formed into two stages only on the first cover <b>2</b> are provided inside a fixed size sheet width, when fixed size sheet (in the present embodiment, A4 and LTR) has been discharged, the fixed size sheet can be formed into a trough curl shape between the two ribs <b>2</b><i>f </i>to thereby enhance the stackability of the sheets. Also, in a case where a sheet having its leading edge, downwardly curled has been discharged, when it has passed the first stage projection, the leading edge can be held down by the second stage projection, and good stacking becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Another embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a state in which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> of a color MFP apparatus according to the present embodiment is closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a state in which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> of the color MFP apparatus according to the present embodiment is opened. The color MFP apparatus according to the present embodiment differs only in the construction of the cartridge cover from the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> described above. The construction differing from that of the above-described color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> will hereinafter be described in detail, and the same construction need not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the cartridge cover <b>701</b> as an openable and closable cover is constituted by a first cover <b>702</b> and a second cover <b>703</b>. The first cover <b>702</b> has a shaft <b>702</b><i>a </i>provided on the image forming apparatus main body <b>104</b> side. A top cover <b>704</b> which is the upper cover of the image forming apparatus main body <b>104</b> is provided with a bearing portion <b>704</b><i>a </i>rotatably holding the shaft <b>702</b><i>a</i>. The first cover <b>702</b> is provided for pivotal movement relative to the image forming apparatus main body <b>104</b> by the bearing portion <b>704</b><i>a</i>. The first cover <b>702</b> can be opened by 90 degrees or greater. The first cover <b>702</b> has a bearing portion <b>702</b><i>b</i>. The second cover <b>703</b> has a shaft <b>703</b><i>a </i>on the first cover <b>702</b> side thereof. The second cover <b>703</b> is supported for pivotal movement about the shaft <b>703</b><i>a </i>relative to the first cover <b>702</b> by the bearing portion <b>702</b><i>b </i>of the first cover <b>702</b>. That is, the first cover <b>702</b> pivotably holds the second cover <b>703</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The joint portions <b>702</b><i>e </i>and <b>703</b><i>c </i>of the first cover <b>702</b> and the second cover <b>703</b> overlap each other. The opening angle of the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is set to an angle at which the opened state thereof can be maintained by the weight of the first cover <b>702</b> and the second cover <b>703</b> when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> has been left in its opened state. A projected piece <b>702</b><i>g </i>provided on the first cover <b>702</b> is received by a receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a </i>as the regulating member of the apparatus main body <b>104</b>, and the pivotal movement of the first cover <b>702</b> in the opening direction thereof is regulated by the receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a</i>. With the projected piece <b>702</b><i>g </i>of the first cover <b>702</b> abutting against the receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a</i>, the cartridge cover <b>701</b> maintains its opened state. With the projected piece <b>702</b><i>g </i>abutting against the receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a</i>, the center of gravity of the cartridge cover <b>701</b> (the center of gravity of a combination of the first cover <b>702</b> and the second cover <b>703</b>) is set at such a position that the cartridge cover <b>701</b> maintains its opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Even when an attempt is made to close only the image reading device <b>103</b> from a state in which the image reading device <b>103</b> and the cartridge cover <b>701</b> are opened, the force is transmitted in a direction in which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed, by the image reading device <b>103</b>. That is, when the image reading device <b>103</b> is closed from a state in which the image reading device <b>103</b> and the openable and closable cover are opened, the cartridge cover <b>701</b> contacts with the image reading device <b>103</b>, whereby it is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When an attempt is made to close the image reading device <b>103</b> from the state in which the image reading device <b>103</b> and the cartridge cover <b>701</b> are opened, a cover guide <b>705</b> provided in the image reading device <b>103</b> abuts against an end portion of the first cover <b>702</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). When the image reading device <b>103</b> is pivotally moved in a direction to be closed, the rotational force P of the image reading device <b>103</b> is divided into a component force P<b>1</b> in the direction of the cover guide <b>705</b> orthogonal to the first cover <b>702</b>. The first cover <b>702</b> is supported by the shaft <b>702</b><i>a</i>. The component force P<b>1</b> is divided into a component force P<b>2</b> in a direction orthogonal to a line linking the acting point of the component force P<b>1</b> and the shaft <b>702</b><i>a </i>which provides the fulcrum of pivotal movement of the first cover <b>702</b> together. Accordingly, when the image reading device <b>103</b> abuts against the end portion of the first cover <b>702</b>, a force in a direction to close the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is applied to the cartridge cover <b>701</b>. The cover guide <b>705</b> is of a shape in which the rotational force P of the image reading device <b>103</b> provides a force for closing the cartridge cover <b>701</b>. In the course of the pivotal movement of the image reading device <b>103</b> in a direction to be closed, the end portions of the cover guide <b>705</b> and the first cover <b>702</b> frictionally contact with each other. With the pivotal movement of the cover guide <b>705</b> in a direction to be closed, the first cover <b>702</b> (cartridge cover <b>701</b>) is moved in a direction to be closed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). It is also possible to constitute the cover guide <b>705</b> by the frame member of the image reading device <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the position of the center of gravity of the cartridge cover <b>701</b> crosses over the pivot shaft <b>702</b><i>a </i>of the first cover <b>702</b>, the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed by its own weight (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the present embodiment, the length of the second cover <b>703</b> is made greater than the length of the first cover <b>702</b>. Even in a state in which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is opened, the distal end of the second cover <b>703</b> is in contact with the top cover <b>704</b>. When a force for closing the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is applied to the cartridge cover <b>701</b>, the distal end of the second cover <b>703</b> slides on the upper surface of the top cover <b>704</b> and therefore, the first cover <b>702</b> and the second cover <b>703</b> are prevented from being closed in a twice-folded state.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In a state in which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is opened, the distal end of the first cover <b>702</b> is always in contact with the top cover <b>704</b>. Consequently, even when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> has been closed without an operator being conscious of it, a thing is prevented from being nipped between the cartridge cover <b>701</b> and the apparatus main body <b>104</b> and being damaged thereby. A sound produced when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A damper D is provided between the first cover <b>702</b> and the second cover <b>703</b>. The damper D produces the pivotal movement resistance of the cartridge cover <b>701</b> when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed. The damper D suppresses a fall by gravity when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed, and improves the sense of quality with which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed. Also, the sound when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> has been unintentionally closed can be made very small.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A one-way damper may be provided between the first cover <b>702</b> and the second cover <b>703</b>. In this case, it is possible to suppress the fall by gravity and improve the texture and make the sound small when the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed, and further to lightly open the cartridge cover <b>701</b> when it is to be opened. At this time, as compared with a case where the one-way damper is attached to an integral type cover, the moment to the gravity of the cartridge cover <b>701</b> may be small and therefore, an improvement in the texture and the effect of silencing can be obtained by a more inexpensive damper.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The upper surface of the top cover <b>704</b> and the distal end of the second cover <b>703</b> are smoothly formed with respect to the closing direction of the second cover <b>703</b>. The design of the apparatus is made such that the level difference between the joint portions <b>702</b><i>e </i>and <b>703</b><i>c </i>is made concave on the downstream side with respect to the closing direction, whereby even if the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is released in the process of closing it, the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed by its own weight. Also, the cartridge cover <b>701</b> can be prevented from failing to be closed. At this time, the locking of the second cover <b>703</b> relative to the image forming apparatus main body <b>104</b> is set to the intensity with which the cartridge cover <b>701</b> is closed by its own weight.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The image reading device <b>103</b> is made pivotally movable relative to the image forming apparatus main body <b>104</b>, whereby it can be disposed in further proximity to the image forming apparatus main body <b>104</b>. Consequently, the color MFP apparatus can be made smaller. The opening angle of the image reading device <b>103</b> can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">While in the above-described two embodiments, a description has been provided of the embodiment in which the number of the cartridge covers is two, a similar effect can also be obtained in the case of three or more cartridge covers by adjusting the opening angle. In a case where there are a plurality of second covers, the plurality of second covers are continuously foldably connected to the first cover so as to be folded and overlap that surface of the first cover which is adjacent to the apparatus main body. Accordingly, even in the case of an image forming apparatus in which the image reading device is not in the upper portion, when for example, the image forming apparatus is to be installed on a shelf, the interval between shelves can be made narrow and the space therebetween can be used effectively. Also, even in the case of an image forming apparatus in which the image forming apparatus in which the image reading device is provided in the upper portion, the mounting and dismounting port for mounting and dismounting a cartridge or the like therethrough is widely opened to thereby improve operability and yet, the height of the apparatus main body can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the above-described two embodiments, there has been shown a construction in which both a process cartridge provided with an image bearing member and a developing cartridge, which is a toner cartridge, can be taken out through a mounting and dismounting port. However, the present invention can be applied to even a construction in which one of the process cartridge and the toner cartridge can be mounted and dismounted with respect to the apparatus main body through the mounting and dismounting port.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, the color MFP apparatus <b>101</b> according to the present embodiment has been shown as a construction having four developing cartridges for a single drum provided in a process cartridge. The present invention, however, can also be applied, for example, to a color electrophotographic recording apparatus of a construction provided with four process cartridges, or a construction provided with a plurality of developing cartridges, or a construction provided with a process cartridge having an intermediate transfer belt. Further, the present invention can be applied to even an image forming apparatus in which a process cartridge holding a photosensitive member therein and also containing a toner therein is detachably mountable with respect to an image forming apparatus main body. In such a color electrophotographic recording apparatus, all or some of the cartridges are interchanged from the upper part of the apparatus. Also, the present invention is effective for all apparatuses in which the upper cover of a recording portion is opened, including a monochrome electrophotographic recording apparatus in which, in order to make the height of the apparatus small, a process cartridge is flatly disposed to thereby make the process cartridge interchangeable from the upper part of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the above-described embodiments, the cartridge cover has a plurality of cover members continuously connected together. On the apparatus main body side of one of the plurality of cover members which is rotatably provided in the apparatus main body, the remaining cover members are pivotably movable and therefore, the opening and closing area, particularly the height of the opening and closing area, of the cartridge cover can be made low to thereby narrow this area.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-261616 filed Sep. 8, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
