<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation application of PCT/JP2004/008228 filed on Jun. 11, 2004, which claims priority from a Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2003-175436 filed on Jun. 19, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a test apparatus for judging whether an electronic device has a defect or not. More specifically, the invention relates to a test apparatus for testing an electronic device that outputs an output signal in which bits of output data to be outputted are inverted or non-inverted per cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a test of an electronic device (DUT) such as DRAM and SRAM for storing electronic data for example is carried out by comparing an output signal outputted out of the DUT in which preset electronic data is stored with an expected value pattern identical with the electronic data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The implementation of multi-bit electronic device is also remarkably advancing lately. Therefore, a number of output pins of the DUT in which logic values of the signal to be outputted are inverted in the same time increases, causing noise in the output signals as a result. In order to reduce such noise, there is an electronic device that outputs the signal by inverting output data per cycle of the output signal. That is, when there are many output pins in which output data is inverted from the preceding cycle, the number of output pins is reduced by inverting and outputting the output data of the respective output pins. In this case, the DUT also outputs an inversion cycle signal indicating that the output signal of that cycle is inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the DUT inverts and outputs the data of the output signal as described above, an expected value pattern to be compared with that output signal must be also inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the conventional test apparatus is unable to recognize whether or not the DUT has inverted the output signal. Therefore, in order to carry out the test, it has been necessary for a user who conducts the test to judge whether or not the output signal of the DUT is inverted corresponding to electronic data given to the DUT in advance and to prepare an expected value pattern corresponding to the judgment result. Accordingly, it has been difficult to carry out the test of the DUT efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still more, in storing H fail data for a H-level expected value and L fail data for a L-level expected value in a fail memory as a result of the test of the DUT, the test apparatus ends up storing the fail data to be originally stored as the H fail data and L fail data as the L fail data and H fail data, respectively, when the output signal of the DUT and the expected value pattern are inverted. Therefore, it has been difficult to analyze the DUT in detail.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a pattern generator and a test apparatus that are capable of solving the above-mentioned problems. This object may be achieved through the combination of features described in independent claims of the invention. Dependent claims thereof specify preferable embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a test apparatus for testing an electronic device that outputs an output signal in which bits of output data to be outputted are inverted or non-inverted per cycle, having a pattern generating section for generating a test pattern for testing the DUT, an expected value generating section for generating an expected value pattern of the output data to be outputted out of the DUT based on the test pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inversion cycle generating section may decide bit of which cycle of the expected value pattern are to be inverted based on the test pattern. Still more, the DUT may be a memory having an inversion area into which given data is written by inverting it and the test apparatus may further include an area inverting section for inverting bits to be written into the inversion area in advance among bits of the test pattern generated by the pattern generating section to feed to the DUT and the expected value generating section.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The selecting section may switch the logic value of the H fail data, corresponding to the bit inverted by the inversion cycle generating section in the expected value pattern and not inverted by the area inverting section in the test pattern or to the bit not inverted by the inversion cycle generating section in the expected value pattern and inverted by the area inverting section in the test pattern, with the logic value of the L fail data to store in the fail memory.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The area inverting section may generate an area inverting signal that indicates level H corresponding to the bit of the test pattern to be inverted, the pattern generating section may feed exclusive OR of the area inverting signal and the test pattern to the DUT and the expected value generating section, the inversion cycle generating section may output an inversion cycle signal indicating level H corresponding to the cycle of the test pattern in which the bit is to be inverted, the expected value generating section may feed exclusive OR of the test pattern fed to the DUT by the area inverting section and the inversion cycle signal to the H-level judging section and the L-level judging section as the expected value pattern, the test apparatus may further include a selection control section for outputting a control signal for controlling the selecting sections based on the exclusive OR of the area inverting signal and the inversion cycle signal and the selecting sections may switch the logic value of the H fail data with the logic value of the L fail data when the control signal indicates the level H in storing in the fail memory.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a test apparatus for testing an electronic device that outputs an output signal in which bits of output data to be outputted are inverted or non-inverted per cycle, having a pattern generating section for generating a test pattern for testing the DUT, an expected value generating section for generating an expected value pattern of the output data to be outputted out of the DUT based on the test pattern, a logic comparator for comparing the output signal outputted out of the DUT corresponding to the test pattern with the expected value pattern to judge whether or not the DUT has a defect, a comparator for calculating a number of bits in each cycle of the test pattern whose logic value has changed from the logic value of respective bits of the expected value pattern in the cycle preceding to that cycle to judge if the calculated number of bits is greater than a preset number of bits and an inversion cycle generating section for causing the expected value generating section to output a pattern in which the test pattern of the pertinent cycle is inverted as the expected value pattern for that cycle of the test pattern when the comparator judges that the number of bits is greater than the preset number of bits and causes the expected value generating section to output the test pattern of that cycle as the expected value pattern for the cycle of the test pattern when the comparator judges that the number of bits is smaller than the preset number of bits.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The electronic device may also output an inversion cycle signal indicating whether or not bits of the output signal are inverted per cycle of the output signal, the comparator may output an inversion cycle expected value indicating whether or not the calculated number of bits is greater than the preset number of bits and the logic comparator may judge whether or not the DUT is defect-free based also a result of comparison of the inversion cycle expected value with the inversion cycle signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The comparator may calculate the number of changing bits based also on whether or not the inversion cycle expected value to be outputted corresponding to the pertinent cycle has changed from the inversion cycle expected value of the cycle preceding to the pertinent cycle. The preset number of bits may be a value obtained by adding 1 to a half of a number of bits in one cycle of the test pattern and the comparator may output the inversion cycle expected value equal to the inversion cycle expected value corresponding to the preceding cycle of the pertinent cycle when the number of changing bits in the pertinent cycle is equal to the half of the number of bits in one cycle of the test pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The test apparatus may further include a preceding cycle data holding section for holding the test pattern in the preceding cycle of the pertinent cycle, a preceding cycle inversion expected value holding section for holding the inversion cycle expected value corresponding to the preceding cycle and a preceding cycle expected value pattern generating section for generating the expected value pattern in the preceding cycle based on the test pattern in the preceding cycle held by the preceding cycle data holding section and the inversion cycle expected value corresponding to the preceding cycle held by the preceding cycle inversion expected value holding section, wherein the comparator may calculate the number of changing bits based on the expected value pattern of the preceding cycle and the test pattern of the pertinent cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that the summary of the invention described above does not necessarily describe all necessary features of the invention. The invention may also be a sub-combination of the features described above.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention will now be described based on preferred embodiments, which do not intend to limit the scope of the invention, but exemplify the invention. All of the features and the combinations thereof described in the embodiments are not necessarily essential to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic configuration of a test apparatus <b>100</b> according one embodiment of the invention. The test apparatus <b>100</b> performs a test of an electronic device <b>110</b>. Here, the DUT <b>110</b> is a semiconductor memory such as a DRAM and SRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The test apparatus <b>100</b> has a pattern generating section <b>10</b>, a comparator <b>30</b>, a logic comparator <b>40</b> and a fail memory <b>50</b>. The pattern generating section <b>10</b> generates a test pattern to be fed to the DUT <b>110</b> to test the DUT <b>110</b>. The pattern generating section <b>10</b> also feeds a signal for selecting a mode for writing electronic data to the DUT <b>110</b> and a mode for reading electronic data stored in the DUT <b>110</b> to the DUT <b>110</b>. In writing electronic data to the DUT <b>110</b>, the pattern generating section <b>10</b> generates a signal for designating an address in the DUT <b>110</b> and data to be written to the designated address and feeds them to the DUT <b>110</b>. In reading electronic data out of the DUT <b>110</b>, the pattern generating section <b>10</b> feeds a signal designating an address in the DUT <b>110</b> to the DUT <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The comparator <b>30</b> receives the data read out of the DUT <b>110</b> as an output signal and converts the output signal into a digital signal indicating logic H or L based on whether or not level of each data of the output signal is greater than level set in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The logic comparator <b>40</b> compares the output signal with an expected value pattern generated by the pattern generating section <b>10</b> to judge whether or not the DUT <b>110</b> is defect-free. The pattern generating section <b>10</b> generates an expected value pattern having an identical pattern with the test pattern given to the DUT <b>110</b> for example.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fail memory <b>50</b> stores the result of comparison of the output signal and the expected value pattern per address in the DUT <b>110</b>. It becomes possible to judge an address in the DUT <b>110</b> where an error occurs by analyzing the comparison result stored in the fail memory <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>show one exemplary operation of the DUT <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the DUT <b>110</b> has a plurality of input/output pins. The plurality of output pins output data in synchronism per cycle of the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>shows one example of the output signal outputted out of the output pins of the DUT <b>110</b>. In this example, the DUT <b>110</b> outputs 8 bit data per one cycle of the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When a preset test pattern is inputted through the input pin, the DUT <b>110</b> stores data corresponding to the test pattern in the designated address as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. Then, the DUT <b>110</b> generates memory internal output (output data) corresponding to the test pattern within it. Although the respective output pins of the DUT <b>110</b> should output memory internal output (output data) at this time, the DUT <b>110</b> outputs an output signal in which the internal output data of the respective output pins is inverted when a number of output pins in which the internal output data is inverted is greater than a preset number of pins from the preceding cycle in the respective cycles of the internal output data.</p>

In such a case, the DUT <b>110</b> outputs an output signal in which the memory internal output of the second cycle is inverted and an inversion cycle signal indicating whether or not bits of the memory internal output are inverted.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The pattern generating section <b>10</b> has a control signal generating section <b>12</b>, an address generating section <b>14</b>, a pattern generating section <b>20</b>, an area inverting section (ARIRAM) <b>22</b>, an inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b>, an expected value generating section <b>26</b> and a selection control section <b>28</b>. The control signal generating section <b>12</b> generates a signal for controlling the DUT <b>110</b> and feeds it to the DUT <b>110</b>. For example, the control signal generating section <b>12</b> feeds a signal for setting the DUT <b>110</b> in the writing mode or the reading mode to the DUT <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The address generating section <b>14</b> generates the address in the DUT <b>110</b> to which data is to be written or the address in the DUT <b>110</b> from which the data is to be read and feeds it to the DUT <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The pattern generating section <b>20</b> generates the test pattern to be fed to the DUT <b>110</b>. The pattern generating section <b>20</b> has a data generating section <b>16</b> and an exclusive OR circuit <b>18</b>. The data generating section <b>16</b> generates test data indicating whether or not an internal cell of the DUT <b>110</b> is to be charged and the exclusive OR circuit <b>18</b> outputs exclusive OR of the test data generated by the data generating section <b>16</b> and an area inverting signal outputted by the area inverting section <b>22</b> as the test pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The area inverting section <b>22</b> receives the address in the DUT <b>110</b> to which data is to be written from the address generating section <b>14</b> and based on that address, controls whether or not each bit of the test data generated by the data generating section <b>16</b> is to be inverted. In this example, the DUT <b>110</b> is a memory having an inversion area into which given data is inverted and written, and the area inverting section <b>22</b> feeds the test pattern in which bits to be written into the inversion area of the DUT <b>110</b> are inverted in advance, among bits of the test pattern generated by the pattern generating section <b>20</b>, to the DUT <b>110</b> and the expected value generating section <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the data generating section <b>16</b> generates 1111 . . . 1 as the test data in performing a test of charging all of the internal cells of the DUT <b>110</b>. At this time, the area inverting section <b>22</b> controls whether or not the respective bits of the test data are to be inverted based on the address in the DUT <b>110</b> to which the respective bits of the test data are written. That is, when the DUT <b>110</b> inverts data and writes it to the address where the data is to be written, the area inverting section <b>22</b> causes the pattern generating section <b>20</b> to generate a test pattern in which bits of test data corresponding to that address are inverted. Such control allows the test of charging all of the internal cells of the DUT <b>110</b> to be carried out efficiently. In the present embodiment, the area inverting section <b>22</b> outputs an area inverting signal indicating logic H corresponding to timing of bit to be inverted in the test data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The expected value generating section <b>26</b> generates the expected value pattern of the output data to be outputted out of the DUT <b>110</b> based on the test pattern generated by the pattern generating section <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> feeds an inversion cycle expected value to the expected value generating section <b>26</b> so as to generate the expected value pattern in which bits in the cycle of the expected value pattern corresponding to the cycle in which the DUT <b>110</b> inverts and outputs the bits of the output data are inverted. The inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> decides bits in which cycle are to be inverted in the expected value pattern based on the test pattern. The inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> generates the inversion cycle expected value indicating logic H at timing corresponding to the cycle to be inverted in the expected value pattern based on the test pattern generated by the pattern generating section <b>20</b> as described later in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, the expected value generating section <b>26</b> feeds the exclusive OR of the test pattern and the inversion cycle expected value to the logic comparator <b>40</b> as the expected value pattern. Such operation allows the expected value generating section <b>26</b> to generate the correct expected value pattern efficiently. The selection control section <b>28</b> outputs the exclusive OR of the area inverting signal and the inversion cycle signal as a control signal for controlling selecting sections <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>described later.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The comparator <b>30</b> receives the output signal outputted out of the DUT <b>110</b> and converts the output signal into a digital signal. The comparator <b>30</b> has an H-level comparator <b>32</b> and an L-level comparator <b>34</b>. The H-level comparator <b>32</b> compares a preset H-level voltage value (VOH) with a voltage value of the output signal. It then outputs 1 when the voltage value of the output signal is greater than VOH and outputs 0 when the voltage value of the output signal is smaller than VOH. The L-level comparator <b>34</b> compares a preset L-level voltage value (VOL) with the voltage value of the output signal. It then outputs 1 when the voltage value of the output signal is smaller than VOL and outputs 0 when the voltage value of the output signal is greater than VOL.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The logic comparator <b>40</b> compares the output signal converted into the digital signal with the expected value pattern and outputs fail data based on the comparison result. The logic comparator <b>40</b> has an H-level judging section <b>36</b>, an L-level judging section <b>38</b>, the selecting sections <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>and an OR circuit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The H-level judging section <b>36</b> outputs H fail data indicating whether or not a bit of the output signal corresponding to a bit of the expected value pattern of the output signal indicating H level is H level per bit of the expected value pattern of the output signal. The H-level judging section <b>36</b> may be an AND circuit for example and outputs AND of the inversion signal of the output signal which has been converted into the digital signal by the H-level comparator <b>32</b> and the expected value pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The L-level judging section <b>38</b> outputs L fail data indicating whether or not a bit of the output signal corresponding to a bit of the expected value pattern of the output signal indicating L level is L level per bit of the expected value pattern of the output signal. The L-level judging section <b>38</b> may be an AND circuit for example and outputs AND of the output signal converted into the digital signal by the L-level comparator <b>34</b> and the expected value pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The selecting sections <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>receive the H fail data and L fail data, select and output either the H fail data or L fail data based on the control signal outputted out of the selection control section <b>28</b>. In the present embodiment, when the control signal indicates logic L, the selecting section <b>44</b><i>a </i>outputs H fail data and the selecting section <b>44</b><i>b </i>outputs L fail data. When the control signal indicates logic H, the selecting section <b>44</b><i>a </i>outputs L fail data and the selecting section <b>44</b><i>b </i>outputs H fail data.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The fail memory <b>50</b> stores the fail data outputted out of the selecting section <b>44</b><i>a </i>as H fail data when the output data indicates H level and stores the fail data outputted out of the selecting section <b>44</b><i>b </i>as L fail data when the output data indicates L level.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">That is, the selecting sections <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>store them in the fail memory <b>50</b> by switching the logic value of the H fail data, corresponding to the bit inverted by the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> in the expected value pattern and not inverted by the area inverting section <b>22</b> in the test pattern (and in the expected value pattern) or to the bit not inverted by the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> in the expected value pattern and inverted by the area inverting section <b>22</b> in the test pattern, with the logic value of the L fail data. That is, the selecting sections <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>store them by switching the logic value of the H fail data with the logic value of the L fail data when the expected value pattern is inverted only by the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> or the area inverting section <b>22</b> and without switching the logic value of the H fail data and the logic value of the L fail data when the both of the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> and the area inverting section <b>22</b> have inverted the expected value pattern and when neither of them have inverted the expected value pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Such control allows the H fail data and L fail data to be correctly stored in the fail memory <b>50</b>. When the output signal and the expected value pattern are inverted and outputted for example, the H-level judging section <b>36</b> judges L level data, i.e., the discharge stage, as internal data of the DUT <b>110</b>. In such a case, although the fail memory <b>50</b> should store the judgment result of the H-level judging section <b>36</b> as L fail data, there has been a case in the conventional test apparatus that the fail memory stores fail data to be stored as L fail data as H fail data or stores fail data to be stored as H fail data as L fail data because the conventional test apparatus does not take such control. Therefore, it has been difficult to analyze the DUT <b>110</b> accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">However, the test apparatus <b>100</b> of the present embodiment allows the DUT <b>110</b> to be accurately analyzed because it can store the H fail data and L fail data correctly in the fail memory <b>50</b>. Still more, the OR circuit <b>42</b> outputs OR of the fail data outputted out of the selecting section <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the fail data outputted out of the selecting section <b>44</b><i>b</i>. That is, when a fail occurs at least in either one of the L fail data and H fail data, the OR circuit <b>42</b> stores fail data FT indicating the fail in the fail memory <b>50</b>. The use of the fail data FT allows the simple analysis of the DUT <b>110</b> to be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing one exemplary configuration of the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b>. The inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> has a preceding cycle data holding section <b>52</b>, a preceding cycle inversion expected value holding section <b>54</b>, a preceding cycle expected value pattern generating section <b>56</b> and a comparator <b>58</b>. The operation of the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> will be explained by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a chart showing one exemplary operation of the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b>. As the test pattern is fed to the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> from the pattern generating section <b>20</b>, the preceding cycle data holding section <b>52</b> outputs a signal in which the test pattern is delayed by one cycle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as a test pattern of the preceding cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The preceding cycle inversion expected value holding section <b>54</b> receives an inversion cycle expected value generated by the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> and outputs a signal in which the inversion cycle expected value is delayed by one cycle as an inversion cycle expected value of the preceding cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The preceding cycle expected value pattern generating section <b>56</b> outputs exclusive OR of the test pattern of the preceding cycle generated by the preceding cycle data holding section <b>52</b> and the inversion cycle expected value of the preceding cycle as an expected value pattern of the preceding cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The comparator <b>58</b> calculates a number of bits, in each cycle of the test pattern received from the pattern generating section <b>20</b>, whose logic value has changed from the logic value of each bit of the expected value pattern in the preceding cycle of that cycle to judge if the calculated number of bits is greater than a preset number of bits. The comparator <b>58</b> also feeds the inversion cycle expected value indicating logic H to the expected value generating section <b>26</b> and the selection control section <b>28</b> when it judges that the number of changing bits exceeds the preset number of bits.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present embodiment, the comparator <b>58</b> judges if the calculated number of bits exceeds the preset number of bits under the same condition with the condition of judging if the DUT <b>110</b> inverts each output data per cycle and outputs it.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For instance, when the DUT <b>110</b> outputs 8 bits data in one cycle and data of 5 bits or more is inverted and when it outputs data by inverting all data in that cycle, the comparator <b>58</b> judges if the number of changing bits is 5 or more. Since the judging condition in the DUT <b>110</b> is set in advance by the specification of the DUT <b>110</b>, the condition may be readily given to the comparator <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Then, when the comparator <b>58</b> outputs the inversion cycle expected value indicating the logic H, i.e., when it judges that the number of changing bits exceeds the preset number of bits, the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> causes the expected value generating section <b>26</b> to output a pattern in which the test pattern of that cycle is inverted as an expected value pattern for that cycle of the test pattern. When the comparator <b>58</b> outputs the inversion cycle expected value indicating the logic L, i.e., when it judges that the number of changing bits is smaller than the preset number of bits, the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> causes the expected value generating section <b>26</b> to output the test pattern of that cycle as an expected value pattern for that cycle of the test pattern. Such operation allows the correct expected value pattern to be generated readily even if the DUT <b>110</b> outputs output data by inverting or non-inverting per cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Still more, in judging whether or not the DUT <b>110</b> outputs by inverting the output data based on that if the inversion cycle signal inverts or not, the comparator <b>58</b> calculates the number of changing bits based further on that if the inversion cycle expected value to be outputted corresponding to that cycle has changed from the inversion cycle expected value of the preceding cycle of that cycle. That is, the comparator <b>58</b> selects if the expected value pattern of that cycle is to be inverted based on that if the inversion cycle expected value to be outputted corresponding to that cycle has changed from the inversion cycle expected value of the preceding cycle of that cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For instance, when the preset number of bits in the comparator <b>58</b> is a value obtained by adding 1 to a half of the number of bits in one cycle of the test pattern and the number of changing bits in that cycle is equal to a half of the number of bits in one cycle of the test pattern, the comparator <b>58</b> outputs an inversion cycle expected value equal to the inversion cycle expected value corresponding to the preceding cycle of that cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the DUT <b>110</b> outputs an inversion cycle signal of a plurality of bits, preferably the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> outputs an inversion cycle expected value of a plurality of bits corresponding to the inversion cycle signal of the plurality of bits. For instance, when the DUT <b>110</b> is a device that outputs an inversion cycle signal of 1 bit per 8 bits of the output signal, whose output signal is <b>72</b> bits and which outputs the inversion cycle signal of 9 bits, preferably the inversion cycle generating section <b>24</b> outputs an inversion cycle expected value of 9 bits. In this case, when the number of changing bits in that cycle is equal to the half of number of bits in one cycle of the test pattern, the comparator <b>58</b> outputs the inversion cycle expected value of plural bits equal to the inversion cycle expected value of plural bits corresponding to the preceding cycle of that cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The test apparatus <b>100</b> of the present embodiment allows the correct expected value pattern to be efficiently generated even when the DOT <b>110</b> outputs the output signal by inverting or non-inverting per cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The logic comparator <b>40</b> may further compare the inversion cycle signal outputted out of the DUT <b>110</b> with the inversion cycle expected value and may store the comparison result in the fail memory <b>50</b>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing another exemplary configuration of the test apparatus <b>100</b>. The test apparatus <b>100</b> of the present embodiment judges whether or not the DUT <b>110</b> is defect-free based further on the inversion cycle signal outputted out of the DUT <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this example, the comparator <b>58</b> of the pattern generating section <b>10</b> feeds the inversion cycle expected value to the logic comparator <b>40</b> and the logic comparator <b>40</b> compares the inversion cycle signal outputted out of the DUT <b>110</b> with the inversion cycle expected value and stores the comparison result in the fail memory <b>50</b> as described above.

<claim-text>an inversion cycle generating section for causing said expected value generating section to output a pattern in which the test pattern of that cycle is inverted as said expected value pattern for that cycle of said test pattern when said comparator judges that said number of bits is greater than the preset number of bits and for causing said expected value generating section to output the test pattern of that cycle as said expected value pattern for the cycle of said test pattern when said comparator judges that said number of bits is smaller than said preset number of bits,</claim-text>
<claim-text>a preceding cycle data holding section for holding said test pattern in the previous cycle of the cycle; a preceding cycle inversion expected value holding section for holding said inversion cycle expected value corresponding to the previous cycle; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>a preceding cycle expected value pattern generating section for generating said expected value pattern in the previous cycle based on said test pattern in the previous cycle held by said previous cycle data holding section and said inversion cycle expected value corresponding to the previous cycle held by said previous cycle inversion expected value holding section;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein said comparator calculates said number of changing bits based on said expected value pattern of the previous cycle and the test pattern of the cycle.</claim-text>
