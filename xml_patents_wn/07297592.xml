<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor technology and data retention in semiconductor memories.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various types of memories have been developed in the past as electronic memory media for computers and similar systems. Such memories include electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) and electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM). Each type of memory had advantages and disadvantages. EEPROM can be easily erased without extra exterior equipment but with reduced data storage density, lower speed, and higher cost. EPROM, in contrast, is less expensive and has greater density but lack erasability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A newer type of memory called “Flash” EEPROM, or Flash memory, has become extremely popular because it combines the advantages of the high density and low cost of EPROM with the electrical erasability of EEPROM. Flash memory can be rewritten and can hold its contents without power. It is used in many portable electronic products, such as cell phone, portable computers, voice recorders, etc. as well as in many larger electronic systems, such as cars, planes, industrial control systems, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Flash memory, bits of information are programmed individually as in the older types of memory, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM) memory chips. However, in DRAMs and SRAMs where individual bits can be erased one at a time, Flash memory must currently be erased in fixed multi-bit blocks or sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventionally, Flash memory is constructed of many Flash memory cells where a single bit is stored in each memory cell and the cells are programmed by hot electron injection and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. However, increased market demand has driven the development of Flash memory cells to increase both the speed and the density. Newer Flash memory cells have been developed that allow more than a single bit to be stored in each cell.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One memory cell structure involves the storage of more than one level of charge to be stored in a memory cell with each level representative of a bit. This structure is referred to as a multi-level storage (MLS) architecture. Unfortunately, this structure inherently requires a great deal of precision in both programming and reading the differences in the levels to be able to distinguish the bits. If a memory cell using the MLS architecture is overcharged, even by a small amount, the only way to correct the bit error would be to erase the memory cell and totally reprogram the memory cell. The need in the MLS architecture to precisely control the amount of charge in a memory cell while programming also makes the technology slower and the data less reliable. It also takes longer to access or “read” precise amounts of charge. Thus, both speed and reliability are sacrificed in order to improve memory cell density.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An even newer technology allowing multiple bits to be stored in a single cell is known as “MirrorBit®” Flash memory has been developed. In this technology, a memory cell is essentially split into two identical (mirrored) parts, each of which is formulated for storing one of two independent bits. Each dual bit flash memory cell, like a traditional Flash cell, has a gate with a source and a drain. However, unlike a traditional Flash cell in which the source is always connected to an electrical source and the drain is always connected to an electrical drain, each dual bit flash memory cell can have the connections of the source and drain reversed during operation to permit the storing of two bits.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The dual bit flash memory cell has a semiconductor substrate with implanted conductive bitlines. A multilayer storage layer, referred to as a “charge-trapping dielectric layer”, is formed over the semiconductor substrate. The charge-trapping dielectric layer can generally be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer, a charge-trapping layer, and a second insulating layer. Wordlines are formed over the charge-trapping dielectric layer perpendicular to the bitlines. Programming circuitry controls two bits per cell by applying a signal to the wordline, which acts as a control gate, and changing bitline connections such that one bit is stored by source and drain being connected in one arrangement and a complementary bit is stored by the source and drain being interchanged in another arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Programming of the cell is accomplished in one direction and reading is accomplished in a direction opposite that in which it is programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A major problem with the MirrorBit architecture has been discovered that the charges, which represent bits of data, tend to drain away over time through the semiconductor device leading to poor data retention. The cause of this charge leakage was not fully understood.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A solution to this problem has been long sought but has long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention provides a manufacturing method for a MirrorBit® Flash memory and includes providing a semiconductor substrate and depositing a charge-trapping dielectric layer. First and second bitlines are implanted and a wordline layer is deposited. A hard mask layer is deposited over the wordline layer. A photoresist is deposited over the wordline layer and used to form a hard mask. The photoresist is removed. The wordline layer is processed using the hard mask to form a wordline and the hard mask is removed. A data retention liner covers the wordline and the charge-trapping dielectric layer. An interlayer dielectric layer is deposited over the data retention liner. It has been unexpectedly discovered that the reason that charge leakage occurs is that hydrogen in the region of the charge-trapping layer acts as a carrier for the electrical charge and causes the data retention capability to be diminished. The hydrogen apparently is a result of the processes used at the back end of the line to produce various layers such as the etch stop layer. It has been unexpectedly discovered that the reason that charge leakage occurs is that hydrogen in the region of the charge-trapping layer acts as a carrier for the electrical charge and causes the data retention capability to be diminished. The hydrogen apparently is a result of the processes used at the back end of the line to produce various layers such as the etch stop layer. The data retention layer has reduced hydrogen and charge loss with subsequent data loss is substantially reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a plan view of a MirrorBit® Flash EEPROM <b>100</b>, which commonly includes a semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> in which one or more high-density core regions and one or more low-density peripheral portions are formed. High-density core regions typically include one or more M×N array cores <b>104</b> of individually addressable, substantially identical dual bit flash memory cells. Low-density peripheral portions typically include input/output (I/O) circuitry and programming circuitry for selectively addressing the individual memory cells. The programming circuitry is represented in part by and includes one or more x-decoders <b>108</b> and y-decoders <b>110</b>, cooperating with I/O circuitry <b>106</b> for connecting the source, gate, and drain of selected addressed memory cells to predetermined voltages or impedances to effect designated operations on the memory cell, e.g., programming, reading, and erasing, and deriving necessary voltages to effect such operations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term “horizontal” as used in herein is defined as a plane parallel to the conventional plane or surface the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> regardless of its orientation. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as “on”, “above”, “below”, “higher”, “lower”, “over”, “under”, “side” and “beside”, are defined with respect to these horizontal and vertical planes. The term “processed” as used herein is defined to include one or more of the following: depositing or growing semiconductor materials, masking, patterning, photolithography, etching, implanting, removal, and/or stripping.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a circuit schematic of a portion of one of the M×N array cores <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (PRIOR ART). The circuit schematic shows a line of memory cells <b>200</b>, which includes memory cells <b>201</b> through <b>204</b> and which together can form an 8-bit word. Each of the memory cells <b>201</b> through <b>204</b> is connected to a wordline <b>206</b>, which acts as a control gate. Each of the memory cells <b>201</b> through <b>204</b> has two associated bitlines with most of the memory cells having a common bitline. The memory cell <b>201</b> has associated bitlines <b>208</b> and <b>209</b>; the memory cell <b>202</b> has associated bitlines <b>209</b> and <b>210</b>; the memory cell <b>203</b> has associated bitlines <b>210</b> and <b>211</b>; and the memory cell <b>204</b> has associated bitlines <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Depending upon a signal on the wordline and the connection of the bitlines in a memory cell to an electrical source or drain, the memory cells <b>201</b> through <b>204</b> are capable of writing, reading, and erasing bits at locations <b>215</b> through <b>222</b>. For example, control of the bit at location <b>215</b> is achieved through connection of the drain to the bitline <b>208</b> and the source to the bitline <b>209</b>. Similarly, control of the bit at location <b>216</b> is achieved through connection of the drain to the bitline <b>209</b> and the source to the bitline <b>208</b>. Although adjacent memory cells share common bitlines, the adjacent memory cells do not interfere with each other because the memory cells are programmed one at a time and only one memory cell is active at a time while programming.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a plan view of a portion of one of the M×N array cores <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (PRIOR ART). The semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> has a plurality of implanted bitlines <b>304</b> extending in parallel with a plurality of formed wordlines <b>302</b> extending in parallel and at right angles to the plurality of implanted bitlines <b>304</b>. The wordlines <b>302</b> and bitlines <b>304</b> have contacts and interconnections (not shown) to the programming circuitry represented in part by x-decoders <b>108</b> and y-decoders <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (PRIOR ART).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a cross-sectional isometric view of a typical dual bit flash memory cell along the line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (PRIOR ART), such as a memory cell <b>400</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> is a p-doped silicon substrate with a threshold adjustment implant <b>402</b> of a p-type material, such as boron. The threshold adjustment implant <b>402</b> provides a region that is more heavily doped than the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> itself and assists in the control of the threshold voltage of the memory cell <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>404</b> is deposited over the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b>. The charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>404</b> generally can be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer <b>406</b>, a charge-trapping layer <b>408</b>, and a second insulating layer <b>410</b>. The first and second insulating layers <b>406</b> and <b>410</b> are of an oxide dielectric such as silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and the charge-trapping layer <b>408</b> is of a nitride dielectric such as silicon nitride (Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>). The oxide-nitride-oxide configuration is frequently referred to as a matter of convenience as an “ONO layer”.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The bitlines <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (PRIOR ART) are implanted under the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>404</b> in the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> as typified by first and second conductive bitlines <b>412</b> and <b>414</b>. They are typically of an implanted n-type material, such as arsenic, and can include an oxide portion (not shown) in some embodiments. The first and second conductive bitlines <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> are spaced apart and define a volume between them with the threshold adjustment implant <b>402</b>, which is a channel <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A material, such as polysilicon, is deposited over the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>404</b>, patterned, etched, and stripped resulting in a wordline <b>418</b>. The wordline <b>418</b> is one of the wordlines <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (PRIOR ART).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is understood that the implementation of each step in manufacturing has associated processing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The locations <b>420</b> through <b>422</b> indicate where bits can be stored in the memory cell <b>400</b> and locations <b>424</b> and <b>426</b> are adjacent locations, which are independent of the memory cell <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a partially processed memory cell <b>500</b> similar to a cross-sectional view along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (PRIOR ART). A p-type silicon substrate <b>501</b> has been implanted or processed with a p-type threshold adjustment implant <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> is deposited over the silicon substrate <b>501</b>. The charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> generally can be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer <b>506</b>, a charge-trapping layer <b>508</b>, and a second insulating layer <b>510</b>. The first and second insulating layers <b>506</b> and <b>510</b> may be of an oxide dielectric such as silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and the charge-trapping layer <b>508</b> may be of a nitride dielectric such as silicon nitride (Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) to form an ONO layer. It will be noted that the present invention is not limited to specific dielectric or charge-trapping materials.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The bitlines, as typified by a first n-type bitline <b>512</b>, are implanted under the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> in the silicon substrate <b>501</b> and a wordline material <b>515</b>, such as polysilicon, has been deposited over the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b>. Again, it will be noted that the present invention is not limited to specific bitline or gate materials. For example, NPN structures are shown but the structures can also be PNP.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A hard mask material <b>516</b> has been deposited over the wordline material <b>515</b> and has not been processed. The hard mask material <b>516</b> can act as an ARC or an ARC can be deposited as a separate layer, such as an optional ARC material <b>517</b>, but more importantly, the hard mask material <b>516</b> is formulated to be a material that can be stripped off the wordline material <b>515</b> without the stripping process damaging any exposed portion of the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to be strippable without damaging the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b>, the hard mask material <b>516</b> should be properly formulated to not affect the middle layer of the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b>. For example, where the nitride layer is the middle layer, an oxide such as silicon oxide would be the proper formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A photoresist <b>518</b> has been deposited over the hard mask material <b>516</b> or the optional ARC material <b>517</b>. The optional ARC material <b>517</b>, the hard mask material <b>516</b> and the photoresist <b>518</b> have been processed to form openings <b>521</b> through <b>523</b> to expose the wordline material <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, both the photoresist <b>518</b> and the optional ARC material <b>517</b> have been processed (i.e., the materials have been deposited, masked, patterned, exposed, and etched) for processing the hard mask material <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> after formation of a hard mask <b>519</b> and removal of the photoresist <b>518</b> and the optional ARC material <b>517</b>. The hard mask <b>519</b> alone is used to create the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that in the past, the photoresist and ARC would be used to create the wordlines <b>525</b> through <b>528</b> (without the hard mask material <b>516</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> so the ONO layer would be exposed between the wordlines and the problems noted above would occur.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> after processing using the hard mask <b>519</b> to form wordlines <b>525</b> through <b>528</b>. The processing using the hard mask <b>519</b> exposes the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> at exposed areas <b>530</b> through <b>532</b>. However, since the hard mask material <b>516</b> material is specifically formulated so as to not damage the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> during removal, the charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>504</b> will not be damaged at the exposed areas <b>530</b> through <b>532</b> when the hard mask <b>519</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, where the hard mask <b>519</b> is of silicon oxide, its removal would only cause openings in the top oxide layer of the ONO layers and not of the nitride layer. Thus, the subsequent pre-metal deposition oxide strip and oxide spacer etch photoresist strip would not penetrate the nitride layer. This would leave the nitride layer and the bottom oxide layer to protect the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> after removal of the hard mask <b>519</b>. An inorganic spacer material <b>534</b> has been deposited because it is required for the peripheral portions of the Flash EEPROM <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> after etching of the spacer material <b>534</b> to form spacers <b>535</b> through <b>538</b> around the respective wordlines <b>525</b> through <b>528</b>. If the spacers <b>535</b> through <b>538</b> are not formed, an additional masking step of the entire core is required or additional processing steps to provide access to the bitlines.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The memory cell <b>500</b> is also shown after application of the saliciding process to grow metal salicides <b>540</b> through <b>543</b>, such as cobalt silicide, titanium silicide, or nickel silicide contacts on top of the respective wordlines <b>525</b> through <b>528</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Since the metal silicide will not form on the exposed ONO layer or the nitride spacers, which do not contain silicon, the metal silicide will be self-aligned on the tops of the polysilicon wordlines; i.e., salicide will be grown.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As explained briefly earlier, major problem with the MirrorBit architecture has been discovered that the charges, which represent bits of data, tend to drain away over time through the semiconductor device leading to poor data retention. The cause of this charge leakage previously was not fully understood.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It has been unexpectedly discovered that the reason that charge leakage occurs is that hydrogen in the region of the charge-trapping layer acts as a carrier for the electrical charge and causes the data retention capability to be diminished. The hydrogen apparently is a result of the processes used at the back end of the line to produce various layers such as the etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> after deposition of a data retention liner <b>546</b> in accordance with the present invention. The data retention liner <b>546</b> is deposited over the surface of the wordlines <b>525</b> through <b>528</b>, the spacers <b>535</b> through <b>538</b>, and the charge-trapping layer <b>504</b>. The data retention liner <b>546</b> has the characteristic of having reduced hydrogen by being deposited by a low hydrogen retention process.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The term “reduced hydrogen” as used herein means that the data retention liner <b>546</b> has under about 2.7% nitrogen-hydrogen and silicon-hydrogen bondings based on Fourier transformation infra-red (FTIR) data.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the liner is a silicon nitride. Examples of the processes, which can be used to deposit a nitride data retention liner include:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0060">Tetrachlorosilane deposition (SiCl<sub>4</sub>).</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0061">Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) nitride at a high temperature from 500° C. to 550° C. without using a hydrogen containing carrier gas such as ammonia and an anneal at a higher temperature at about 600° C.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0062">PECVD nitride deposition at a high temperature from 500° C. to 550° C. with an oxygen anneal at a higher temperature from 600° C. to 1000° C.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">It has been found that the latter two PECVD nitride depositions increase film density and thus make the data retention liner of greater density than other deposition processes and thus less susceptible to hydrogen entrapment. With higher density comes the characteristic of being less permeable to hydrogen. The data retention liner <b>546</b> may also be used as an etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">Further, it has been discovered that depositing the nitride without a hydrogen containing carrier gas such as ammonia unexpectedly slows the deposition rate of the nitride. The slowing can be to the extent that an “ultra-slow deposition rate” is achieved which is defined herein as being 200% slower than deposition rate of nitride with ammonia. This permits superior process control resulting in precise thickness control and uniformity within a wafer as well as from wafer to wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">The superior process control has proved to be crucial for very thin nitride film depositions in the range of 100 Å to 500 Å. These very thin nitride films are particularly useful for data retention layers because they can replace etch stop layers (ESLs).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">By annealing at about 600° C., it has been further discovered that an “extremely high density” is achieved which is defined herein as meaning that the data retention liner <b>546</b> has a density greater than about 2.79 g/cc after deposition without ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> after deposition of the first interlayer dielectric layer <b>548</b> over the data retention liner <b>546</b>. The first interlayer dielectric layer <b>548</b> can be a material such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, therein is shown a simplified process chart <b>600</b> of the present invention which includes: providing semiconductor substrate <b>602</b>; implanting threshold adjustment implant <b>604</b>; depositing charge-trapping dielectric layer <b>606</b>; implanting bitlines <b>608</b>; depositing wordline layer <b>610</b>; depositing hard mask material <b>612</b>; depositing ARC material <b>614</b>; depositing photoresist <b>616</b>; forming hard mask <b>618</b>; removing photoresist layer (and optional ARC material) <b>620</b>; forming wordline <b>622</b>; removing hard mask <b>624</b>; forming spacer <b>626</b>; growing salicide <b>628</b>; depositing data retention liner <b>630</b>; and depositing first interlayer dielectric layer <b>632</b>. Various alternative sequences, additions, and deletions to this process chart would be obvious to those skilled in the art from a detailed reading of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">Various implementations of the method may be used in different electronic devices and especially the dual bit memory cell architecture may be achieved according to one or more aspects of the present invention. In particular, the invention is applicable to memory devices wherein both bits in a dual bit cell are used for data or information storage.</p>
