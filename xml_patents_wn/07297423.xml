<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a printed circuit board (PCB) for high frequency on which high frequency circuit elements of a GHz band are mounted and more particularly to a PCB capable of transmitting a signal with a low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-058947, filed on Mar. 3, 2004 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-007887, filed on Jan. 14, 2005, the entireties of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, according to a request for an information process at high speed and an information communication with high density at high speed, the frequency of a signal for operating a high frequency semiconductor element has been remarkably increased. For instance, an LSI chip currently used for a CPU of a computer operates under the clock frequency of several GHz. Further, in a satellite broadcasting a future expansion of which is greatly anticipated or a mobile communication such as a mobile phone, a mobile terminal or the like, a high frequency signal of a GHz band is used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a high frequency circuit, a loss is generated in a conductor and a PCB. Especially, the loss in the PCB has been serious. These losses appear as problems such as a heat generation, noise, high consumed electric power when transmitting a signal. That is, the material of the PCB used for elements in a high frequency band is desirably the material which has a property of low loss for the high frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the PCB tracks with characteristic impedance Z<sub>o </sub>(Ω) is driven under voltage V (V), a transmission loss P (W) is expressed by a following formula (1). This formula shows that the increase of Z<sub>o </sub>is effective for decrease of P under the condition of constant V.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P=V</i><sup>2</sup><i>/Z</i><sub>o</sub>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The characteristic impedance Z<sub>o </sub>is proportional to a square root of a ratio of the relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>of the material of the PCB to the relative dielectric constant ∈<sub>r </sub>as shown by a following formula (2).
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Z</i><sub>o</sub>=(<i>L/C</i>)<sup>1/2</sup>∝(μ<sub>r</sub>/∈<sub>r</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>  (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
(Here, L represents an inductance per unit length of PCB track and C represents an electric capacity per unit length).
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As the PCB with the low loss showing the high characteristic impedance Z<sub>o</sub>, the PCB using a material of low dielectric constant has been hitherto proposed (for instance, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. hei 6-53357). In this PCB, the characteristic impedance Z<sub>o </sub>can be increased by decreasing the relative dielectric constant ∈<sub>r </sub>of the PCB, so that the loss can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the material of the low dielectric constant, a fluororesin such as polytetrafluoro ethylene (the relative dielectric constant ∈<sub>r </sub>is about 2.1). When the porous density of the above-described fluororesin is increased, a lower dielectric constant can be achieved. For instance, in a porous polytetrafluoro ethylene resin having holes as many as 80%, the relative dielectric constant ∈<sub>r </sub>is about 1.1.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the PCB formed with the porous fluororesin is extremely low in its mechanical strength and has low stability for thermal. Accordingly, the above-described PCB has been hardly available for practical use.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, since there does not exist the material whose relative dielectric constant ∈<sub>r </sub>is smaller than 1, there has been a limitation in a method for reducing the loss of the conventional PCB.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention was devised by taking the above-described problems of the related art into consideration and it is an object of the present invention to provide a PCB that can transmit a high frequency signal of a GHz band can be transmitted with low loss.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inventors of the present invention newly noticed magnetic characteristics as well as the dielectric characteristics of the PCB. Specifically, they eagerly studied to reduce the loss not only by decreasing the dielectric constant (∈<sub>r</sub>), but also increasing the magnetic permeability (μ<sub>r</sub>) at the same time. Thus, they reached the achievement of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention proposed to solve the above-described problems relates to a PCB comprising an insulator and magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in the insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Here, the magnetic nanoparticles preferably exhibits superparamagnetism.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, the magnetic nanoparticles are desirably liquid-phase synthesized.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the insulator is preferably made of alumina ceramic, aluminum nitride ceramic, silicon nitride ceramic, boron nitride ceramic or a composite material of them.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Now, an embodiment of a PCB according to the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a sectional view of the PCB according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The PCB <b>10</b> includes an insulator <b>12</b> and magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in the insulator <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> are fine magnetic particles having the particle size of nano order, have blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>and preferably exhibit superparamagnetism. Especially, the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> are preferably superparamagnetic nanoparticles having the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>at 80° C. or lower. The blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>is set to 80° C. or lower to ensure a high relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>within the range of temperature of −10 to 80° C. as using temperature of the PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Now, the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>will be briefly described below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the spontaneous magnetization of the fine magnetic particles, an orientation is maintained by the magnetic anisotropic energy E of the fine particles. Here, the magnetic anisotropic energy E is expressed by the product of the magnetic anisotropic constant K and the volume V of the fine magnetic particles as shown by a following formula. The orientation of the spontaneous magnetization may be possibly changed by heat energy k<sub>B</sub>T. Here, k<sub>B </sub>represents Boltzmann constant and T represents absolute temperature.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>E=K·V<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When environmental temperature rises and the heat energy k<sub>B</sub>T is substantially the same as the magnetic anisotropic energy E or higher than the magnetic anisotropic energy, the direction of the spontaneous magnetization is continuously thermally activated and vibrated so that residual magnetization disappears. On the other hand, with the fall of temperature, when the heat energy k<sub>B</sub>T is adequately lower than the magnetic anisotropic energy E, the vibration in the spontaneous magnetizing direction is suppressed and the residual magnetization begins to appear. The blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>means the temperature at which the residual magnetization begins to appear.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> are desirably made of a material selected from a group including elements Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Sm, Nd, Tb, Al, Pd and Pt, intermetallic compounds of the elements, binary alloys of the elements, ternary alloys of the elements, or the elements, the intermetallic compounds, the binary alloys, the ternary alloys including, as additional elements, at least one of Si, N, Mo, V, W, Ti, B, C and P, Fe oxides, Fe oxides further including at least one of the elements except Fe, Mn—Zn ferrites, Ni—Zn ferrites, Mg—Zn ferrites, Mg—Mn ferrites and garnet.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b>, there are magnetic nanoparticles that are gas-phase synthesized or liquid-phase synthesized. The magnetic nanoparticles that are liquid-phase synthesized are preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A liquid-phase synthesizing method is a method in which metallic salt or organic metal is dissolved in liquid to separate particles by a reducing process or a decomposing process. As well-known liquid-phase synthesizing methods, a coprecipitation method, a reducing method by alcohol, a thermal decomposition method of organic metal compound, a reversed micelle method, an ultrasonic method and a reducing method by electride may be exemplified. Ordinarily, the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> that are liquid-phase synthesized are obtained as dispersion solution in which the surfaces of the magnetic nanoparticles are coated with an organic stabilizer.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, according to the liquid-phase synthesizing method, a particle diameter can be controlled by selecting synthesizing conditions. Still further, a particle size distribution can be also controlled by a size selective deposition method after the synthesis. The size selective deposition method is a method that a flocculant is dripped on the dispersion solution of the magnetic nanoparticles to selectively precipitate the particles having large diameter. As the flocculent, a solvent is selected that can be mixed with a solvent of the dispersion solution of the magnetic nanoparticles and has a different solubility of the organic stabilizer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> have different values of magnetic anisotropic constants K depending on the kinds of magnetic materials. For instance, in the case of Co, K is expressed by K=4.5×10<sup>5 </sup>J/m<sup>3</sup>. In the case of Fe, K is expressed by K=4.7×10<sup>4 </sup>J/m<sup>3</sup>. In the case of FePt, K is expressed by K=6.6×10<sup>6 </sup>J/m<sup>3</sup>. In the case of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, K is expressed by K=8.7×10<sup>3 </sup>μm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, an optimum particle size is suitably determined depending on the kind of the magnetic material. For instance, the average particle size of Co nanoparticles is preferably 8 nm or smaller. The average particle size of Fe nanoparticles is preferably 25 nm or smaller. The average particle size of FePt nanoparticles is preferably 4 nm or smaller. The average particle size of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles is preferably 30 nm or smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, in the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> used in the present invention, the standard deviation of the particle size distribution is not higher than 30% as large as the average particle size, preferably not higher than 20% and more preferably not higher than 10%. As the standard deviation becomes smaller, the distribution of the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>becomes narrower and a higher relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>is exhibited. On the other hand, when the standard deviation is higher than 30% as large as the average particle size, since the distribution of the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>is too wide, the relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>is decreased. For instance, within the range of temperature of −10 to 80° C., the relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>is smaller than 10.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The insulator <b>12</b> is made of a polymer material, ceramic, glass or a composite material of them.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> dispersed in the insulator <b>12</b> is preferably 60% or lower. When the filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> exceeds 60%, the mechanical strength of the PCB <b>10</b> is lowered and the PCB is easily apt to be deformed. Accordingly, the PCB <b>10</b> is caused to be distorted during the producing step of the PCB <b>10</b>. Thus, a positioning operation is difficult when a semiconductor device is produced by using the PCB <b>10</b>. As a result, the connection to the device is undesirably failed. Further, the volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> dispersed in the insulator <b>12</b> is preferably 5% or higher.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>is proportional to the product of the magnetic anisotropic constant K and the volume V of the magnetic materials as described in a following formula (4).

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Suitable kinds of magnetic materials, suitable particle size and a suitable particle size distribution are respectively selected for the magnetic nanoparticles <b>11</b> used in the PCB of the present invention. Thus, the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>can be adjusted. Accordingly, the relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>can be controlled to a desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For instance, when the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>is set to be distributed at 80° C. or lower, the relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>in the PCB of the present invention can be set to 10 or higher within the range of temperature of −10 to 80° C.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Now, there is a fear that the relative magnetic permeability μ<sub>r </sub>is lower than 10 due to a hysteresis loss and an eddy current loss in the high frequency area of the GHz band. However, groups of magnetic nanoparticles used in the present invention are distributed in the range where the blocking temperature T<sub>b </sub>is located at 80° C. or lower and do not show the hysteresis loss. Further, since the PCB has a structure that the below-described groups of fine particles not larger than skin depth are dispersed in the insulator, the specific resistance of the PCB is sufficiently high and the PCB does not exhibit the eddy current loss.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When a frequency is increased, the fine magnetic particles generate a natural resonance under a certain frequency and the magnetic permeability is abruptly decreased. Therefore, to maintain a satisfactory transmission loss in the PCB of the present invention, the PCB needs to be used in a frequency band except a natural resonance frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Here, a frequency f under which the fine magnetic particles generate the natural resonance is proportional to an anisotropic magnetic field H<sub>k </sub>of the fine magnetic particles as described by a following formula.
