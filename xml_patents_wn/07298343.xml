<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A radio frequency identification (RFID) device includes a conductive antenna structure having an elongated slot therein. Parts of the antenna structure on both sides of one end of the elongated slot are coupled to a wireless communication device, such as an RFID chip or interposer. On the opposite end of the elongated slot, parts of the antenna structure at both sides of the elongated slot are electrically coupled together, for instance by being coupled together by other conductive parts of the antenna structure. All of the parts of the antenna structure may be parts of a continuous unitary layer of conductive material. The antenna structure with the elongated slot therein may facilitate increased readability of the RFID device, particularly in directions out from the edges of the RFID device.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and labels, and in particular to tags and labels that include an antenna structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current inventory and manufacturing methods rely on the ability to track and identify items of concern, such as inventory items, packages, individual parts, etc., and to communicate information concerning such items of concern in a wireless manner for processing and use. One known method of tracking and providing information on such items of concern is to attach to each such item a wireless communication device, such as an active or passive transponder, incorporated into an identification tag or label that responds to radio frequency interrogation and commands. The tag may store or represent information concerning the object to which it is attached, such as a unique identifying number, object status such as opened or unopened, location, and the like. The tag may be attached to an individual item or to packaging containing multiple items.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One example of a prior art RFID device <b>1</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A radio frequency identification (RFID) device includes a conductive antenna structure having an elongated slot therein. Parts of the antenna structure on both sides of one end of the elongated slot are coupled to a wireless communication device, such as an RFID chip or interposer. On the opposite end of the elongated slot, parts of the antenna structure at both sides of the elongated slot are electrically coupled together, for instance by being coupled together by other conductive parts of the antenna structure. All of the parts of the antenna structure may be parts of a continuous unitary layer of conductive material. The antenna structure with the elongated slot therein may facilitate increased readability of the RFID device, particularly in directions out from the edges of the RFID device. The antenna structure may be directly conductively coupled to the wireless communication device. Alternatively, the antenna structure may be indirectly (reactively) coupled to the RFID device, such as by capacitive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an RFID device <b>10</b> includes an antenna structure <b>12</b> that is coupled to a wireless communication device, such as an RFID chip <b>14</b> that may be a part of an RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>. The RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b> includes conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> that are coupled to arms or parts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The standard elements of the interposer or strap <b>16</b> include the RFID chip <b>14</b> and conductive leads. The interposer or strap <b>16</b> also may include a substrate to support the RFID chip <b>14</b> and the conductive leads. In most embodiments herein (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) there is no substrate, but rather the conductive leads and the chip <b>14</b> are supported by the antenna. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 11A</figref> (discussed below), the interposer substrate is the same as the antenna substrate. In another possible variation, the RFID chip and the conductive leads may be supported by a separate substrate for processing purposes, and this separate substrate may remain with the chip and leads after the chip and leads are coupled to the antenna, or may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are on either side of an aperture or elongated slot <b>30</b>, an opening between the parts of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. At a first end <b>32</b> of the aperture or elongated slot <b>30</b>, an open end, the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are electrically coupled to the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>. The conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are in turn coupled to contact points of the RFID chip <b>14</b>. At a second end <b>36</b> of the aperture or slot <b>30</b>, a closed end that is distal relative to the RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>, the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are electrically connected together, for example by linked together by a conductive connection <b>38</b> that is also part of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and the conductive connection <b>38</b>, all may be parts of a unitary, continuous layer <b>40</b> of conductive material forming the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The conductive layer <b>40</b> may be attached or otherwise coupled to a substrate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The slot or aperture <b>30</b> may have a substantially constant width between the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The slot <b>30</b> may have a length from approximately one quarter of a wavelength of radiation used to communicate with the RFID chip <b>14</b>. The slot <b>30</b> has a slot length in a direction in which the slot is elongated (along a narrow axis <b>46</b> from the first end <b>32</b> to the second end <b>36</b>). and a slot width in a direction perpendicular to the slot length (between the arms <b>24</b> and <b>28</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the parts of the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> extending on the sides of the slot <b>20</b> along the slot length have a combined width in the direction of the slot width that is greater than the slot width of the slot <b>30</b>. The slot <b>30</b> allows the RFID device <b>10</b> to be read along the a narrow axis <b>46</b>. Indeed, the RFID device <b>10</b> may exhibit good readability characteristics in substantially any direction within or parallel to the plane of the antenna structure <b>12</b> or the RFID device <b>10</b> as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, at short ranges, the RFID device <b>10</b> demonstrates good read performance in other directions, such as above and below the tag. Thus the RFID device <b>10</b> shows good read performance in all directions around the device <b>10</b>. The read performance of the RFID device <b>10</b> is good even when the device <b>10</b> is of a small size. For example, an RFID device of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, having outer dimensions of 25 mm×25 mm (1 inch×1 inch) has been found to have good read performance at distances in excess of 2 m (6.5 feet), when utilizing suitable power and frequency levels. Examples of suitable power and frequency labels are operation over a frequency band of <b>902</b> to 928 MHz at a power of 4 W e.i.r.p (effective isotropic radiated power) in accordance with FCC part <b>15</b> section <b>247</b>. By using a suitable reader with either a circularized polarized antenna, or dual linear antennas polarized at 90 degrees to each other connected to separate ports on a reader system which are alternately switched, the antenna structure <b>12</b> gives a read capability that is good over a wide variety of orientations, and may be substantially orientation independent.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The coupling between the RFID chip <b>14</b> and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may either be a direct conductive coupling, occurring through the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the interposer <b>16</b>, or may be in whole or in part a reactive coupling, such as capacitive or inductive coupling through a dielectric material. Several configurations of reactive coupling connections are discussed below with regard to different embodiments of the RFID device <b>10</b>. With regard to the direct (conductive) electrical connections between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, such connections may be made by use of a suitable conductive adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A circuit path <b>54</b> proceeds from one side (contact point) of the RFID chip <b>14</b>, through the arm <b>26</b>, the conductive connection <b>38</b>, and the arm <b>28</b>, to another side (contact point) of the RFID chip <b>14</b>. Thus, in contrast to a standard slot antenna, there is not conductive material fully around the slot <b>30</b>. A standard slot antenna has a short circuit of conductive material fully surrounding a slot.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The antenna structure <b>12</b> of the RFID device <b>10</b> may have some features of loop antennas, and may have some features of slot antennas, while overcoming the null spots that may occur in traditional loop antennas and slot antennas. The antenna structure <b>12</b> may provide better coverage of a wide range of orientations by coupling to the RFID chip <b>14</b> with at least two modes of operation. The antenna modes may include two or more modes that include modes such as a mode substantially that of a notch antenna, a mode substantially that of a loop antenna, a mode substantially that of a folded dipole antenna, and/or a mode substantially that of a slot antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The RFID device <b>10</b> may utilize a variety of suitable materials. The substrate <b>42</b> may be a suitable plastic material, such as PET or polypropylene, which may be a flexible film or sheet of plastic material. The conductive layer <b>40</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b> may be formed, deposited or adhered onto the substrate <b>42</b> by any of a variety of suitable methods. For example, the conductive layer <b>40</b> may be a conductive ink, such as an ink containing metal particles, that is printed onto the substrate <b>42</b> in a suitable pattern. Alternatively, the conductive layer <b>40</b> may be plated onto the substrate <b>42</b>, such as by electroplating. As another alternative, the conductive layer <b>40</b> may be adhesively adhered to the substrate <b>42</b>. Etching may be used to remove conductive material to form the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The RFID device <b>10</b> may include additional suitable layers, such as protective layers to protect the functional elements of the device that may also provide desired surface properties such as printability or weatherability, and/or an adhesive layer to adhere the device <b>10</b> to an object.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be appreciated that a variety of wireless communication devices, such as RFID interposers or straps, may be used as the RFID interposer or strap <b>16</b>. Examples of suitable RFID interposers or straps include an RFID strap available from Alien Technologies, and the interposer (called a module) marketed under the name I-CONNECT, available from Philips Electronics. Chips available from Alien Technologies may be attached either conductively, in a flip-chip die, or conductively or reactively for a strap form of the chip. Suitable RFID chips include Philips HSL chip, available from Philips Electronics, and the EM Marin EM4222, available from EM Microelectronic-Marin SA, as well as RFID chips available from Matrics Inc. of Columbia, Md. USA.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It will be appreciated that the RFID device <b>10</b> may have any of a variety of suitable configurations, some of which are described further below. The configuration of the conductive areas and slot of the antenna structure may vary widely, for instance. As one example, the slot <b>30</b> may be substantially rectangular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Alternatively, the slot may have another shape, such as bent or curved.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one alternative configuration for the RFID device <b>10</b>, in which the slot <b>30</b> has a bent shape, with a number of constant-width segments <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>68</b>, angled with regard to one another. The segments <b>60</b>-<b>68</b> allow the same overall slot length on a small, more compact device. An RFID interposer <b>16</b> is mounted onto both sides of the aperture or slot <b>30</b>, thus using material of the conductive layer on both sides of the slot <b>30</b> and along a distal end of the elongated slot as a hybrid loop-slot antenna, similar to the above-discussed embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The conductive layer <b>40</b> covers substantially all of an underlying substrate <b>42</b>, with an exception of the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> is shown, in which the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are not directly electrically coupled to one another. Rather the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are reactively coupled together by respective coupling portions <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> of the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, that are capacitively coupled together across an interaction region <b>80</b> of the substrate <b>42</b> upon which the conductive arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are mounted. The interaction region <b>80</b> and the slot <b>30</b> are to some extent separate, although it will be appreciated that the interaction region <b>80</b> may be taken into account when properly tuning the antenna structure <b>12</b> by tuning the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> in the vicinity of the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be advantageously used with RFID chips that require that no short circuit be presented between the contacts of the chip that are coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Examples of such RFID chips are the EM4222 and the HSL chips.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b>, which has an antenna structure <b>12</b> that includes both a hybrid loop-slot antenna, as well as a monopole antenna element <b>90</b>. The hybrid loop-slot antenna may be similar to the structure described above with regard to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, with a pair of arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> coupled to different contact points of the RFID chip <b>14</b>, and a conductive connection <b>38</b> between the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, with the conductive connection <b>38</b> and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> defining the slot <b>30</b>. The arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are coupled, respectively, to an RF input <b>92</b> and a common (ground) connection <b>94</b> of the RFID chip <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The monopole antenna element <b>90</b> is a folded dipole element <b>96</b> that is electrically coupled to another contact point (connection) <b>100</b> of the RFID chip <b>14</b>. The dipole element <b>96</b> has a serpentine shape, with a number of back-and-forth segments <b>102</b>. The antenna structure <b>12</b> thus utilizes the hybrid loop-slot antenna as a ground plane for the folded dipole element <b>96</b>. The antenna structure <b>12</b> is thus a dual polarization antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7-14</figref> show various embodiments of the RFID device <b>10</b> that have capacitive coupling between the RFID chip <b>14</b> and at least one of the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Referring first to the embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the RFID interposer <b>16</b> are adhesively coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b> by respective adhesive pads or layers <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. The adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are made from a non-conductive adhesive that prevents direct (conductive) electrical coupling between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Rather, the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are capacatively coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> across the non-conductive adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. By avoiding direct conductive electrical coupling between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, shorting together of the corresponding contact points of the RFID chip <b>14</b> is avoided. As noted above, some chips may require that the contact points not be shorted together, for the chips to operate properly.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It will be appreciated that a suitable thickness may be selected for the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, in order to provide the desired capacitive coupling between the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The thickness of the adhesive pads may be selected based on such factors as the operating power and frequency, the coupling area, and the dielectric constant of the adhesive to be used. In one example, adhesive pads having an area of 5 mm<sup>2 </sup>and a thickness of 10 μm may be used, although it will be appreciated that a wide range of suitable areas and thicknesses may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> show another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b>, which illustrates one way of forming a device that utilizes adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> to attach conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, different parts of the device <b>10</b> are formed on different parts <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> of a substrate <b>124</b>. The parts <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> have a fold line <b>126</b> therebetween. On the first part <b>120</b> the RFID interposer <b>16</b> is placed, with the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> face up. The RFID interposer <b>16</b> may be attached to the first part <b>120</b> of the substrate <b>124</b> by use of a suitable adhesive. Alternatively, the interposer <b>16</b> may be formed in situ, by depositing or forming the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, such as by printing or electroplating, after placing the RFID chip <b>14</b> face up on the first part <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The antenna structure <b>12</b> is deposited or attached onto the second part <b>122</b> of the substrate <b>124</b>. The adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may then be deposited on the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>, for example by a suitable printing process.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Following making of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the two parts of the device are joined together by folding the substrate <b>124</b> along the fold line <b>126</b>. This brings in conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> into contact with the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, thereby adhesively joining together the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The first part <b>120</b> of the substrate <b>124</b> may be sized to substantially cover the second part <b>122</b>, when the first part <b>120</b> is folded over the second part <b>122</b>. The second part <b>122</b> may be pressed against and sealed to the second parts, such as by heat sealing, to enclose and protect the operative elements of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It will be appreciated that the method of making an RFID device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, may be performed as a series of continuous roll operations, such as in a roll-to-roll process. The placement of the RFID chip <b>14</b> and/or the interposer <b>16</b>; the formation of the antenna structure <b>12</b> on the substrate <b>124</b> (or adherence of the antenna structure <b>12</b> to the substrate <b>124</b>); and/or placement of the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, all may be performed as roll operations. Such operations may be performed on a web of material, which may then be suitably cut to produce individual RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It will be further appreciated that the sort of method described above may be utilized with RFID devices having other configurations, as described herein. For example, suitable electrically-conductive adhesive may be substituted for non-conductive adhesive of the adhesive pads <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, thereby producing an RFID device <b>10</b> where the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are directly (conductively) electrically coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. As another example, the antenna structure <b>12</b> may have some of the other configurations described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> illustrate another folded embodiment of the device <b>10</b>, with a first part <b>130</b> and a second part <b>132</b> of a substrate <b>134</b> being separated along a fold line <b>136</b>. The first part <b>130</b> has an RFID chip <b>14</b> and conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> thereupon. The second part <b>132</b> has the conductive layer <b>40</b>, with its various parts <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>38</b>, thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the first part <b>130</b> may be folded back along the fold line <b>136</b>, to make back-to-back contact with the second part <b>132</b> of the substrate <b>134</b>. The parts <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> may be joined with an adhesive layer <b>138</b>. In the resulting structure, the conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are capacitively coupled to the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, with the combined thickness of the parts <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> in between.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, another embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> has an interdigitated capacitive coupling <b>140</b> for coupling the RFID chip <b>14</b> (or an RFID interposer) to the arm <b>26</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>. The chip <b>14</b> is conductively coupled to a conductive pad <b>142</b> on the substrate <b>42</b>. The conductive pad <b>142</b> includes a number of fingers <b>144</b> jutting out therefrom, along the substrate <b>42</b>. The fingers <b>144</b> interdigitate with corresponding fingers <b>146</b> of the arm <b>26</b>, leaving a narrow serpentine gap <b>150</b> between the sets of fingers <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. Capacitive coupling may occur across the gap <b>150</b>, indirectly (capacitively) electrically coupling the conductive pad <b>142</b> and the arm <b>26</b>, without danger of short-circuiting of the arm <b>26</b>. The conductive pad <b>142</b> and the fingers <b>144</b> may be part of a conductive layer <b>154</b> that also includes the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and the conductive connection <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an additional embodiment of an RFID device <b>10</b> that has reactive coupling between the chip <b>14</b> and the arm <b>26</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the RFID chip <b>14</b> (or RFID interposer) is coupled to a conductive element <b>160</b> that follows a curvy path through the arm <b>26</b>, with a gap <b>162</b> between the conductive element <b>160</b> and the arm <b>26</b>. This enables capacitive coupling between the conductive element <b>160</b> and the arm <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates yet another capacitive coupling embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b>. The device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has the antenna structure <b>12</b> on an opposite side of the substrate <b>42</b> from the RFID interposer <b>16</b>. The conductive leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the RFID interposer <b>16</b> are capacitively coupled with the arms <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the antenna structure <b>12</b>, across the portions of the substrate <b>42</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A variety of capacitive coupling embodiments of the RFID device <b>10</b> have been described above. It will be appreciated that other types of indirect reactive coupling, such as inductive coupling via a magnetic field, may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the RFID device <b>10</b> with a corrugated cardboard layer <b>180</b>. A pair of conducting strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>, such as copper strips, are placed on corrugations <b>186</b> and <b>188</b> during manufacture of the cardboard layer <b>180</b>. The conducting strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> serve as the arms of a hybrid loop/aperture antenna. A shorting conductive connection <b>190</b> is placed at one point along the conductive strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>, and an RFID interposer <b>16</b> is placed at another point along the conductive strips <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>. The points for placement for the shorting connection <b>190</b> and the interposer <b>16</b> are chosen so that the aperture <b>12</b> defined by the various elements has a suitable length.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Following placement of the elements of the device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, construction of the cardboard layer may be completed by placement of a facing layer atop the corrugations. The cardboard may be used for suitable purposes, such as in a carton or other container. The RFID device <b>10</b> thus may be employed as an internal device within a cardboard layer, readable from a wide variety of orientations. The placement of the device within the cardboard layer may help protect the device from physical damage during handling of the cardboard. In addition, placement of the device within a cardboard layer helps to hide the device, protecting it from deliberate attempts to disable it. However, it will be appreciated that an external marker may be provided on the cardboard to indicate location of the RFID device <b>10</b>, for example to aid in placement of a reader for short-range reading.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates one application of the RFID device <b>10</b>, with application of the device <b>10</b> to a clothing item <b>200</b>, such as a shirt. The device <b>10</b> may be a card-mounted label placed between buttons of the clothing item <b>200</b>, or attached to the item <b>200</b> with a plastic fastener. The device <b>10</b> on the clothing item <b>200</b> may be read with a hand-held reader <b>204</b>, from any of a variety of directions relative to the clothing item <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a display unit <b>210</b> capable of reading RFID devices <b>10</b> on a group of clothing items <b>200</b>. The display unit <b>210</b> has a number of suitable antennas <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in a back wall <b>216</b> of the display unit <b>210</b>. The antennas <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> are coupled to a reader <b>220</b>. The ability of the RFID devices <b>10</b> to be read along their edges in a variety of orientations, especially along axes in the narrow directions of the devices <b>10</b>, facilitates reading of the devices by the display unit <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It will be appreciated that the variety of permissible edge-reading angles for the devices <b>10</b> allow reading even when the items <b>200</b> are placed in the display unit <b>210</b> at a variety of orientations, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The flexibility in variety of read orientation for the RFID devices <b>10</b> allows, for example, a retailer flexibility to display the items <b>200</b> at a variety of orientations, while still allowing them to be detected by the display unit <b>210</b>. In addition, detection by the display unit <b>210</b> may be maintained largely unaffected by how the items <b>200</b> are placed or misplaced in the display unit, such as by employees or customers.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates reading of RFID devices <b>10</b> on clothing items <b>230</b>, which are on a portable rack <b>240</b>. The RFID devices <b>10</b> may be integrated into labels <b>232</b> on the clothing items <b>230</b>. The devices <b>10</b> on the items <b>230</b> may be read from a side direction <b>244</b> or <b>246</b> as the rack <b>240</b> is moved past a reading station. The good edge-reading characteristics of the RFID devices <b>10</b> facilitate detection of the devices <b>10</b> in the directions <b>244</b> and <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the clothing items <b>230</b> mounted on a display rack <b>250</b>. The RFID devices <b>10</b> on the clothing items <b>230</b> may be read from a read direction <b>252</b>, from an antenna <b>254</b> on a back wall <b>256</b> of the display rack <b>250</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> illustrate the usefulness of the quasi-isotropic read properties of the RFID device <b>10</b>, allowing the clothing items <b>230</b> to be detected on a variety of racks, read from a variety of directions.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It will be appreciated that the read properties of the RFID devices <b>10</b> may be utilized in detecting and/or tracking a wide variety of objects in addition to clothing items. The detection of the clothing items <b>200</b> and <b>230</b> is but one example of a wide variety of objects with which the RFID devices <b>10</b> may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>, multiple objects <b>300</b>, each with an RFID device <b>10</b>, are placed in close proximity to one another, such that the proximity of the RFID devices <b>10</b> to one another enhances performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> shows the objects <b>300</b> placed in a carton or container <b>310</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> B shows the objects <b>300</b> placed on a shelf <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The term “close proximity,” as used herein, refers to adjacent (nearest) of the RFID devices <b>10</b> being within about twice a relevant longest dimension of conductive material (e.g., length or width) of the antenna of the RFID device <b>10</b>. A group of RFID devices <b>10</b> may be said to be in close proximity to one another if each of the RFID devices is in close proximity with at least one other device, and if all of the RFID devices are linked together by devices in close proximity with one another. For instance, if the antennas of the RFID devices <b>10</b> had a length and width of about 5 cm, the RFID device <b>10</b> may be in close proximity to one another if they are within about 10 cm of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It is believed that having the RFID devices <b>10</b> in close proximity to one another improves the radiation resistance of the RFID devices <b>10</b>. This improves the performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b>, such as by increasing the read distance and/or signal strength for the RFID devices <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">It will be appreciated that many advantages may be obtained by increasing performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b> when the devices <b>10</b> are in close proximity to one another. The increased performance of devices in close proximity to one another may allow use of smaller RFID devices, while still maintaining desired performance levels, at least when the devices are in close proximity to one another. Smaller RFID devices <b>10</b> are desirable from a number of standpoints: smaller RFID devices require less raw materials, which may reduce costs; and smaller RFID devices require less space to affix to an object, are loss obtrusive, and are less likely to be damaged. In addition, smaller RFID devices may be less detectable after purchase by the end user, when the RFID device <b>10</b> is no longer in close proximity to other such devices. The reduced detectability of a separated RFID device (not in close proximity to other devices) may allay privacy concerns concerning RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Increased performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b> may be particularly useful in circumstances where the RFID devices <b>10</b> are naturally grouped together, such as when objects are shipped in containers or are displayed on shelf or in other ways. For instance, the shelf <b>320</b> may have or be near a reader <b>324</b> used to keep track of available inventory.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b> may also be enhanced by the presence of electrically-conductive materials, other than those in the RFID device <b>10</b>. For instance, the objects <b>300</b>, the container <b>310</b>, and/or the shelf <b>320</b> may contain the metal or other electrically-conductive material that may enhance the performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The RFID devices <b>10</b> may have an overall size of about 8 cm (3 inches)×8 cm (3 inches) or less. The RFID device <b>10</b> may be even smaller, having for example a size of about 4 cm×4 cm or less, or of about 2.5 cm (1 inch)×2.5 cm (1 inch) or less. However, it will be appreciated that other sizes for the RFID devices <b>10</b> are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">From the definition of “close proximity” given above, it will be appreciated that there is a wide range of spacing of RFID devices <b>10</b> that will produce enhanced performance of the RFID devices <b>10</b>. For example, the RFID devices <b>10</b> may have enhanced performance when the nearest devices are within about 4 cm of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Generally, the enhancement of performance resulting by the close proximity of the RFID devices <b>10</b> is increased the closer the devices <b>10</b> are to one another. This result is not to be expected from experiences with at least some types of prior art antenna configurations, such as dipole antenna configurations. In contrast to the enhancement by close proximity described herein, performance of devices with dipole antennas actually degrades when the devices are brought closely together, with nearby devices effectively “de-tuning” one another.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> show the objects <b>300</b> in the container <b>310</b> and on the shelf <b>320</b>. It will be appreciated that objects with RFID devices may be placed in close proximity to one another in many other sorts of circumstances, including other sorts of display devices and/or transport devices and/or configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Generally it is observed in the case of RFID devices with hybrid antennas (combining characteristics of slot or notch antennas with characteristics of loop antennas) that the enhancement of performance is most pronounced if the tags are in close proximity, and are coplanar.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">This performance enhancement in grouping of tagged items may be employed to advantage in the RFID tagging of packaged articles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22E</figref> illustrate this effect in a variety of configurations of RFID-tagged, packed bottles <b>330</b>, with RFID devices <b>10</b> in close proximity to one another. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> the bottles <b>330</b> are tagged at their the bottom surfaces <b>332</b> with RFID devices <b>10</b>, wherein packing the bottles <b>330</b> on a common surface results in roughly co-planar placement of the RFID devices <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> shows multiple layers of tagged bottles <b>330</b> separated by packing sheets <b>336</b>, resulting in a series of co-planar groups of RFID devices (horizontal planes at different packing levels). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, the RFID devices <b>10</b> are applied to plastic bottle caps <b>340</b> instead of to the bottoms of the bottles. Placement of the RFID devices <b>10</b> on the bottle caps <b>340</b> may be desirable for bottles containing liquids, in order to provide greater distance of the RFID device <b>10</b> from the liquid. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22D and 22E</figref> the bottles <b>330</b> are tagged at their sidewalls <b>350</b>. For bottles <b>330</b> with cylindrical shapes <b>352</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref>), this may result in less consistency in co-planarity of groups of tags because of variations in orientation from bottle to bottle. For bottles <b>300</b> with flat faces <b>354</b> and natural orientations, such as rectangular cross sections <b>358</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22E</figref>), it is easier to assure co-planarity of the RFID devices <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22E</figref> show RFID devices <b>10</b> placed on bottles <b>330</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the bottles <b>300</b> are merely examples of a larger group of objects that may have RFID devices <b>10</b> attached to or mounted thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-32</figref> show several possible alternative configurations for the antenna structure <b>12</b> of the RFID device <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows an antenna structure <b>12</b><i>a </i>having a rectangular shape, with a straight slot <b>30</b><i>a </i>having a wider portion <b>400</b> close to an RFID interposer <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and a narrower portion <b>402</b> further from the interposer <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p>
