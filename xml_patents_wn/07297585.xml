<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In formation of a source/drain region of an NMOS transistor, a gate-directional extension region &lt;<b>41</b><i>a</i>&gt; of an N<sup>+</sup> block region &lt;<b>41</b>&gt; in an N<sup>+</sup> block resist film &lt;<b>51</b>&gt; prevents a well region &lt;<b>11</b>&gt; located under the gate-directional extension region &lt;<b>41</b><i>a</i>&gt; from implantation of an N-type impurity. A high resistance forming region, which is the well region &lt;<b>11</b>&gt; having a possibility for implantation of an N-type impurity on a longitudinal extension of a gate electrode &lt;<b>9</b>&gt;, can be formed as a high resistance forming region &lt;A<b>2</b>&gt; narrower than a conventional high resistance forming region &lt;A<b>1</b>&gt;. Thus, a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure capable of reducing body resistance and a method of manufacturing the same are obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having an SOI structure isolating elements from each other by an isolation film such as a partial insulator film partially leaving an SOI layer and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, each of “Y. Hirano et al., IEEE 1999 SOI conf., p 131” (Reference 1), Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-243973 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466934: Reference 2) and Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-39484 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/639953: Reference 3) discloses a semiconductor device having a conventional SOI structure (may hereinafter be referred to as “partially isolated body fixed SOI structure”) isolating elements from each other by an isolation film such as a partial insulator film partially leaving an SOI layer and fixing the potential of a body region.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure, however, it is difficult to form a semiconductor element such as a MOSFET while precisely controlling body resistance. The reason therefor is now described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a sectional view for illustrating a problem of the conventional partially isolated body fixed SOI structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, an SOI layer <b>3</b> is formed on an embedded oxide film <b>2</b> present on a silicon substrate (not shown), and subjected to element isolation by a partial oxide film <b>31</b>. The partial oxide film <b>31</b> is formed to leave a well region <b>11</b>, which is a lower part of the SOI layer <b>3</b>, under the same.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A channel forming region <b>7</b> is formed in a transistor forming region of the SOI layer <b>3</b>, so that a gate oxide film <b>8</b> and a gate electrode <b>9</b> are successively formed on the channel forming region <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, a body region <b>10</b> is provided oppositely to the channel forming region <b>7</b> through the partial oxide film <b>31</b>, and this body region <b>10</b> is electrically connected with the channel forming region <b>7</b> through the well region <b>11</b> located under the partial oxide film <b>31</b> since the well region <b>11</b> is in contact with the body region <b>10</b> and the channel forming region <b>7</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to form a source/drain region of a MOS transistor, S/D impurity ions <b>19</b> are implanted through the gate electrode <b>9</b> etc. serving as masks as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, while no mask is provided (no resist film is formed) on the partial oxide film <b>31</b> in general.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When forming the source/drain region, therefore, the S/D impurity ions <b>19</b> may be partially implanted into the well region <b>11</b> located under the partial oxide film <b>31</b> to increase the resistance value of body resistance, which is the resistance of the well region <b>11</b> reaching the channel forming region <b>7</b> from the body region <b>10</b>, disadvantageously resulting in unstable high-speed operation of the MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As the S/D=purity ions <b>19</b> for forming the source/drain region, As (arsenic) ions are implanted under conditions of 50 keV (injection energy) and 4×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>(dose), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a graph showing the impurity profile of As implanted under the aforementioned conditions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the impurity profile has standard deviation a (=8.5 nm) with reference to 26 nm, reaching a range of 51.5 nm (=26+3σ(nm)).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the thickness of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> is reduced to about 50 nm, therefore, the impurity ions <b>19</b> of As disadvantageously reach the well region <b>11</b>. Also when the thickness of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> is slightly larger than 50 nm, the As ions may still be implanted into the partial oxide film <b>31</b> since the tail part of the impurity profile is deeper than 51.5 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to reduce a leakage current from a silicide region of CoSi<sub>2 </sub>(cobalt silicide) or the like, P (phosphorus) is implanted under conditions of about 30 to 50 keV and about 1×10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. However, P has a higher possibility of reaching the well region <b>11</b> than As, due to a range deeper than that of As.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When trench isolation is employed, the partial oxide film <b>31</b> is formed by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). Therefore, the thickness of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> is remarkably dispersed by about ±30 nm, for example, depending on pattern density or the position in a wafer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, the partial oxide film <b>31</b> must be formed while setting a margin in consideration of the aforementioned dispersion. When the thickness of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> is so set that the As ions <b>19</b> for forming the source/drain region are not implanted into the well region <b>11</b> located under the partial oxide film <b>31</b>, however, an isolation step <b>32</b> between the surface of the SOI layer <b>3</b>, which is the surface of the SOI substrate, and the surface of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> reaches an unignorable level, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Consequently, a residue <b>33</b> may be left on a side surface of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. If an etching time for gate formation is increased for preventing formation of the residue <b>33</b>, the gate oxide film <b>8</b> is disadvantageously damaged and reduced in reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a plan view of a semiconductor device having the conventional partially separated body fixed SOI structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line C-C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. When an N-type impurity is implanted for forming the source/drain region, an N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> covering the overall body region <b>10</b> is masked with a resist film or the like, so that the N-type impurity is not implanted into the P-type body region <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> is generally formed in the minimum necessary size for reliably covering the body region <b>10</b>, so that the gate oxide film <b>8</b> is not charged and statically damaged by a charge-up phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When a P-type impurity is implanted into the body region <b>10</b>, on the other hand, a P<sup>+</sup> block region <b>39</b> entirely covering an N-type drain region <b>5</b> and an N-type source region <b>6</b> is masked with a resist film or the like, so that the P-type impurity is not implanted into the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, further, the P<sup>30 </sup> block region <b>39</b> is generally formed in the minimum necessary size for reliably covering the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b>, for a reason similar to that for the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As hereinabove described, the source/drain region and the body region <b>10</b> are formed while masking the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> and the P<sup>30 </sup> block region <b>39</b> respectively, and hence it follows that both of the N- and P-type impurities are implanted into regions other than the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> and the P<sup>30 </sup> block region <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Consequently, the impurities are implanted into the well region <b>11</b> electrically connecting the body region <b>10</b> with the channel forming region <b>7</b> (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> but present in the SOI layer <b>3</b> located under the gate electrode <b>9</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>), to cause such inconvenience that the resistance value of the body resistance RI of the well region <b>11</b> reaching the channel forming region <b>7</b> from the body region <b>10</b> is increased or dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to precisely control the body resistance RI.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the resistance value of the body resistance RI is increased, the threshold voltage of the transistor fluctuates to disadvantageously resulting in unstable operation. This problem is disclosed in “S. Maeda et al., IEEE Transaction on Electron Devices, vol. 45, No. 7, pp. 1479 to 1486 (1998)”, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The body resistance serves as a noise source increasing noise of the transistor. When a circuit such as a PLL (phase locked loop) circuit is formed by a transistor having unstable body resistance, therefore, phase noise (phase jitter) is disadvantageously increased.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, it is important for a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure to reduce and stably control body resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> illustrate the structure of a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure forming the basis of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are sectional views, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are sectional views taken along the lines A-A and B-B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, partial oxide films <b>31</b> formed with well regions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> on lower layer parts thereof isolate respective transistor forming regions of an SOI layer <b>3</b> of the semiconductor device having an SO structure formed by a silicon substrate <b>1</b>, an embedded oxide film <b>2</b> and the SOI layer <b>3</b>. In other words, a p-type well region <b>11</b> is formed under the partial oxide film <b>31</b> isolating NMOS transistors from each other, an n-type well region <b>12</b> is formed under the partial oxide film <b>31</b> isolating PMOS transistors from each other, and a p-type well region <b>11</b> (NMOS transistor forming region side) and an n-type well region <b>12</b> (PMOS transistor forming region side) are formed under the partial oxide film <b>31</b> (isolation film) isolating the NMOS and PMOS transistors from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the well region <b>11</b> is formed to enclose drain regions <b>5</b> and source regions <b>6</b> of the NMOS transistor group, and the well region <b>12</b> is formed to enclose drain regions <b>5</b> and source regions <b>6</b> of the PMOS transistor group. In this basic structure, the SOI layer <b>3</b> is covered with an interlayer isolation film <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In this basic structure, a single-unit MOS transistor isolated from another transistor by the partial oxide film <b>31</b> is formed by the drain region <b>5</b>, the source region <b>6</b> and a channel forming region <b>7</b> formed in the SOI layer <b>3</b>, a gate oxide film <b>8</b> formed on the channel forming region <b>7</b> and a gate electrode <b>9</b> formed on the gate oxide film <b>8</b>. A wiring layer <b>22</b> formed on the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b> is electrically connected with the drain region <b>5</b> or the source region <b>6</b> through a contact <b>21</b> provided in the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b>. Although the contact <b>21</b> is largely drawn, a plurality of small holes may be opened for preparing contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a body region <b>10</b> is formed between the well regions <b>11</b> in the SOI layer <b>3</b>, to be in contact with the adjacent well regions <b>11</b>. A wiring layer <b>25</b> formed on the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b> is electrically connected with the body region <b>10</b> through a body contact <b>23</b> provided in the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b>. A wiring layer <b>26</b> formed on the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b> is electrically connected with the gate electrode <b>9</b> through a gate contact <b>24</b> provided in the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Thus, in the semiconductor device having this basic structure, the partial oxide films <b>31</b> of element isolation regions do not reach a lower portion of the SOI layer <b>3</b> but the well regions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> into which impurities of the same conductivity types as the channel forming regions of the transistors to be isolated from each other are provided under the partial oxide films <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Therefore, a substrate potential of each transistor can be externally fixed through the wiring layer <b>25</b>, the body contact <b>23</b> and the body region <b>10</b> and the well regions <b>11</b> of high-concentrations. Also on the side of the PMOS transistor, the substrate potential of each respective transistor can be fixed through the body region <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The details are now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. The thickness of the embedded oxide film <b>2</b> is about 100 to 500 nm, for example, and the thickness of the SOI layer <b>3</b> is about 30 to 200 nm. The channel forming region <b>7</b> is formed by introducing about 10<sup>17 </sup>to 10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>of a first conductivity type impurity (a p-type impurity for the NMOS transistor or an n-type impurity for the PMOS transistor). The drain region <b>5</b> and the source <b>6</b> are formed by introducing about 10<sup>18 </sup>to 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>of a second conductivity type impurity (an n-type impurity for the NMOS transistor or a p-type impurity for the PMOS transistor) adjacently to the channel forming region <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Each partial oxide film <b>31</b> isolating adjacent transistors from each other is formed while leaving a lower layer part of the SOI layer <b>3</b> by about 10 to 100 nm, for example, for forming the well region.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The well regions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> (having impurity concentrations of 10<sup>17 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, which are identical to or in excess of those of the channel forming regions; punch-through phenomena can be prevented and isolation performance is improved as the concentrations are increased) having the same conductivity types as the channel forming regions are provided on the lower parts of the partial oxide films <b>31</b> for isolating oxide films from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a high-concentration impurity of 10<sup>18 </sup>to 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>having the same conductivity type as the adjacent well regions <b>11</b> is introduced into the body region <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a structure in which the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b> do not reach the embedded oxide film <b>2</b>, it is preferable to employ a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> in which the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b> reach the embedded oxide film <b>2</b>, or a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> in which a depletion layer <b>55</b> extending from the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b> reaches the embedded oxide film <b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 9</figref> are sectional views showing a basic method of manufacturing the semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">First, an SOI substrate consisting of the silicon substrate <b>1</b>, the embedded oxide film <b>2</b> and the SOI layer <b>3</b> is formed as a starting material by an SIMOX method of forming the embedded oxide film <b>2</b> by oxygen ion implantation or the like, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In general, the thickness of the SOI layer <b>3</b> is 50 to 200 nm, and the thickness of the embedded oxide film <b>2</b> is 100 to 400 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an oxide film <b>141</b> of about 20 nm in thickness and a nitride film <b>142</b> of about 200 nm in thickness are successively deposited on the SOI substrate for thereafter patterning isolation regions through a mask of a patterned resist film <b>143</b> and etching the triple multilayer film of the nitride film <b>142</b>, the oxide film <b>141</b> and the SOL layer <b>3</b> to leave the lower layer part of the SOI layer <b>3</b>, thereby forming a plurality of partial trenches <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Then, an oxide film of about 500 nm is deposited so that a structure formed with the partial oxide films <b>31</b> and the SOI layer <b>3</b> (the well regions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>) located under the same can be obtained by polishing the nitride film <b>142</b> to an intermediate portion by CMP treatment by a method similar to that in general trench isolation and thereafter removing the nitride film <b>142</b> and the oxide film <b>141</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Thereafter an existing CMOS transistor forming method of selectively implanting impurities or the like is employed for converting NMOS forming regions and PMOS forming regions of the SOI layer <b>3</b> to N- and P-type regions respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Then, the gate oxide films <b>8</b> and the gate electrodes <b>9</b> are selectively formed on the respective regions obtained by isolating the NMOS and PMOS regions by the partial oxide films <b>31</b> in units of MOS transistors, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Thereafter a resist film <b>15</b> is formed on a region for forming a source/drain region on the side of a PMOS transistor forming region and a region for forming a body region on the side of an NMOS transistor for masking these regions, and N-type impurity ions <b>17</b> are implanted thereby simultaneously forming the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b> on the NMOS region and the body region (not shown) in the PMOS region, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the resist film <b>15</b> is removed and thereafter another resist film <b>16</b> is formed on the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b> on the side of the NMOS transistor and the body region (not shown) on the side of the PMOS transistor for masking these regions, and P-type impurity ions <b>18</b> are implanted thereby simultaneously forming the drain region <b>5</b> and the source region <b>6</b> in the PMOS region and the body region (not shown) on the NMOS region respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a plan view showing a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure according to an embodiment 1 of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a P<sup>30 </sup> block region <b>39</b> is formed in the minimum necessary size for reliably covering regions (planned) for forming a drain region <b>5</b> and a source region <b>6</b> similarly to the prior art, while an N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>41</b> reliably covers a region (planned) for forming a body region <b>10</b> and has a gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a </i>obtained by extending a partial region on an extension of a gate electrode <b>9</b> along the longitudinal direction (gate width direction) toward a gate contact region <b>9</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The P<sup>30 </sup> block region <b>39</b> indicates a resist film forming region in implantation of the P-type impurity ions <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>41</b> indicates a resist film forming region in implantation of the N-type impurity ions <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line C-C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, showing a sectional structure in block resist formation according to the embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an N<sup>+</sup> block resist film <b>51</b> is formed on the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>41</b> extending toward the gate electrode <b>9</b> beyond the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> of the prior art. Similarly, a P<sup>30 </sup> block resist film <b>59</b> is formed on the P<sup>30 </sup> block region <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates both of the N<sup>+</sup> block resist film <b>51</b> and the P<sup>30 </sup> block resist film <b>59</b> for convenience, the N<sup>+</sup> block resist film <b>51</b> and the P<sup>30 </sup> block resist film <b>59</b> are not simultaneously present in practice but the N<sup>+</sup> block resist film <b>51</b> is provided in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the P<sup>30 </sup> block resist film <b>59</b> is formed in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in the manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a high resistance forming region which is a well region <b>11</b> into which both N- and P-type impurities may be implanted on the longitudinal extension of the gate electrode <b>9</b> can be narrowed to a high resistance forming region A<b>2</b> from a conventional high resistance forming region A<b>1</b> by the gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Thus, no N-type impurity is implanted into the well region <b>11</b> located under the gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a</i>. In other words, the well region <b>11</b> located under the gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a </i>is a P-type impurity region mixed with no N-type impurity, whereby the resistance value of body resistance can be reduced and dispersion can be suppressed. Consequently, a precisely controllable semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure can be obtained without increasing the resistance value of the body resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, the number of manufacturing steps is not increased beyond that of the prior art by carrying out the manufacturing method according to the embodiment 1 changing the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>41</b> from the conventional N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a sectional view showing a semiconductor device having a general partially isolated body fixed SOI structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it is assumed that a partial oxide film <b>31</b> is dug by 50 nm by trench etching when the thickness of an SOI layer <b>3</b> is 100 nm for forming the partial oxide film <b>31</b> to be provided with an isolation step projecting from the surface of the SOI layer <b>3</b> by 30 nm. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, side walls <b>13</b> are formed on the side surfaces of a gate electrode <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Considering dispersion in CMP treatment (the step of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the isolation step of about ±30 nm fluctuates. Therefore, the thickness of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> changes in the range of 80±30 nm, i.e., 50 to 110 nm, to reach 50 nm at the worst so that an N-type impurity is disadvantageously implanted into the partial oxide film <b>31</b> to reduce body resistance. According to the manufacturing method of the embodiment 1, however, no N-type impurity is implanted into the well region <b>11</b> located under the gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a </i>also in this case, and hence the aforementioned inconvenience can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing a collapse phenomenon of the partial oxide film <b>31</b>. In general, a region of the partial oxide film <b>31</b> into which both of N- and P-type impurities are implanted is scraped in advance of the remaining region in wet etching, and hence the thickness of this region is reduced by a collapse phenomenon as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an oxide film <b>4</b><i>a </i>and a silicon nitride film <b>4</b><i>b </i>form an interlayer isolation film <b>4</b>, and a silicon nitride film <b>13</b><i>b </i>forms the side wall <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Exemplary wet etching is dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment or APM (ammonia-hydrogen peroxide mixture) cleaning employing a mixed solution of ammonia (NH<sub>4</sub>OH), aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and pure water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and the dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment is carried out for removing a TEOS oxide film forming the side wall <b>13</b> or the like, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Consequently, the effective thickness of the well region <b>11</b> is reduced due to extension <b>37</b> of a depletion layer, and hence the body resistance is disadvantageously increased. Therefore, the collapse phenomenon is preferably suppressed to the minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a sectional view showing a sectional structure of the semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure manufactured by the conventional method. The section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is taken along the line C-C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, each side wall <b>13</b> is formed by a TEOS oxide film <b>13</b><i>a </i>and a silicon nitride film <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and the interlayer isolation film <b>4</b> is formed by an oxide film <b>4</b><i>a</i>, a silicon nitride film <b>4</b><i>b </i>and an oxide film <b>4</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, only the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> is masked against implantation of an N-type impurity, and hence the N-type impurity is disadvantageously implanted into most parts of the partial oxide films <b>31</b> to cause the aforementioned collapse phenomenon in regions A<b>5</b> to A<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a sectional view showing a sectional structure of the semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure manufactured by the method according to the embodiment 1.

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>41</b> wider than the N<sup>+</sup> block region <b>40</b> by the gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a </i>is masked against implantation of an N-type impurity, to result in the aforementioned collapse phenomenon in regions AS and A<b>7</b>, similarly to the prior art. However, the collapse phenomenon can be avoided in a region A<b>6</b>, which is masked by the gate-directional extension region <b>41</b><i>a </i>against implantation of the N-type impurity. In other words, the partial oxide film <b>31</b> located under the N<sup>+</sup> block resist film <b>51</b> is an N-type impurity-free region containing no N-type impurity, and hence no collapse phenomenon takes place in the region A<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Thus, the manufacturing method according to the embodiment 1, which can more suppress the collapse phenomenon than the prior art, can reduce the resistance value of the body resistance.</p>
