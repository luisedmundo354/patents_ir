<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to electrical panels, and particularly to the installation of remote operated and non-remote operated circuit breakers in electrical panels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrical panels typically house a plurality of circuit breakers that distribute power from a source to a plurality of loads while providing protection to the load circuits. The electrical panels may be single-phase, or three-phase with switching neutral for example, may have a variety of voltage ratings, such as 120 Vac to 600 Vac for example, and may have a variety of current ratings, such as 125 Amps to 400 Amps for example, thereby enabling the electrical panels to serve a variety of applications. One such application is a lighting panel, which may be used to service lighting loads in a commercial building having a plurality of lighting circuits. To facilitate the efficient utilization of power in such commercial buildings, remote operated circuit breakers (ROCBs) may be employed that enable the lighting loads to be turned on and off from a location remote to the electrical panel or from within the electrical panel. However, not all lighting loads may require a ROCB, and some of the load circuits may require a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCl). Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an electrical panel that may be readily adapted to accept a variety of circuit breakers, and particularly that may be readily adapted to accept ROCBs, non-ROCBs, and GFCls.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An embodiment of the invention provides a multi-pole mounting base for interfacing circuit breakers and/or circuit interrupters with an electrical panel. The electrical panel has an interior configured to receive remote operated circuit breakers (ROCBs), non-ROCBs, and ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCls). Each ROCB includes a communication port at its load end, which is configured to mate with a communication port at a communication board when both a ROCB and a communication board are installed in the electrical panel. Inside the electrical panel is a plurality of busbars for distributing electrical power from a source to a plurality of electrical loads via the aforementioned circuit breakers and/or circuit interrupters.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exemplary embodiment of an electrical panel <b>100</b> having an enclosure <b>105</b>, a cover <b>110</b>, and an interior <b>115</b>. The interior <b>115</b> is configured to receive a plurality of mounting bases <b>118</b>, which is best seen by now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each mounting base <b>118</b> provides a support platform <b>120</b> that is a unitary structure assemblable to the interior <b>115</b> via securing details <b>125</b>, and is configured to receive ROCBs, non-ROCBs, and GFCls, at any one of a first mounting region <b>130</b>. In an embodiment, mounting base <b>118</b> is molded as a single unit out of a plastic suitable for electrical applications. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each support platform <b>120</b> is configured to assemble adjacent another support platform <b>120</b> in the electrical panel <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, support platform <b>120</b> has six mounting regions <b>130</b> arranged in a three-by-two array configured to accept two three-phase circuit breakers mounted face-to-face (line side facing line side) with each other. Each first mounting region <b>130</b> has common mounting structure that enables ROCBs, non-ROCBs, and GFCls, to be interchangeable within a given first mounting region <b>130</b>. Support platform <b>120</b> also includes a second mounting region <b>135</b> configured to receive a communication board <b>140</b>, which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as part of the assembly on the far side of panel <b>100</b>, and in an exploded assembly state on the near side of panel <b>100</b>. Second mounting region <b>135</b> includes a locating feature <b>145</b> configured to mate with matching detail (not shown) on communication board <b>140</b> to align the communication ports <b>150</b> on the communication board <b>140</b> with the communication ports <b>155</b> on a ROCB <b>160</b>, best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In an embodiment, second mounting region <b>135</b> includes overlapping edges <b>137</b> formed by a first edge <b>138</b> having a thinned down bottom surface, and a second edge <b>139</b> having a thinned down top surface, thereby providing a continuous channel that provides electrical isolation to ground when communication board <b>140</b> is mounted at a plurality of adjacently arranged second mounting regions <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, at least two of the three first mounting regions <b>130</b> on one side of mounting base <b>118</b> have integrally arranged blind holes <b>132</b> configured to receive mounting hardware (not shown) from the underside associated with the electrical panel <b>100</b>, and to electrically isolate the mounting hardware from the ROCB mounted at first mounting region <b>130</b>. An expanded cross-section view of blind hole <b>132</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, and referring now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the ROCB <b>160</b> mounts to a first mounting region <b>130</b> of support platform <b>120</b> by way of a clip <b>165</b> engaging with a catch <b>170</b>, which in an embodiment has a barrel shape that is accessible from above or below via molded-in openings <b>172</b>. While only one reference numeral <b>170</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it will be appreciated that this is for clarity only and that features common to each first mounting region <b>130</b> may be represented by way of illustration only. ROCB <b>160</b> also includes a line strap <b>175</b> having a mounting screw <b>180</b>, which provides electrical connection to a busbar at interior <b>115</b> in a manner known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, a non-ROCB <b>185</b> may be mounted to any one of first mounting regions <b>130</b> via a mounting adapter <b>190</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for an expanded view of mounting adapter <b>190</b>). In an embodiment, mounting adapter <b>190</b> is secured to support platform <b>120</b> via mounting hardware <b>192</b> and pilot hole <b>122</b>, and includes a tab <b>195</b> that engages with a pocket (not shown but known in the art) at the load end of non-ROCB <b>185</b>, thereby securely coupling the load end of non-ROCB <b>185</b> to the mounting base <b>118</b>. The line end of non-ROCB <b>185</b> includes a line strap <b>200</b> having a mounting screw <b>205</b>, which are similar to and similar in function to that of line strap <b>175</b> and mounting screw <b>180</b>.</p>
