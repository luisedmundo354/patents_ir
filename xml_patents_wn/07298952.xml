<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to optical fiber management and, more particularly, to systems for connecting optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When providing services using an optical fiber network, it is generally necessary to add and drop subscribers over time. As a result, a variety of methods are provided for interconnecting subscriber locations with a central office connecting facility operated by an optical network provider. To improve the utilization of communication circuits within such a central office facility, interconnection cabinets, such as a centralized splitter cabinet (CSC) and/or centralized splitter cross-connect (CSX), may be provided as part of the outside plant (OSP) infrastructure of the optical fiber network. Doing so may allow some of the burden of establishing and changing connections on the network to be shifted away from the central office and facilitate incremental growth of an installed network as new subscribers are added.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A centralized splitter cabinet (CSC) is typically a passive optical enclosure that provides random termination of optical splitters suitable for use in OSP environment. A CSC may be pedestal or pole mounted in the field. A CSC may provide a flexibility point for termination of distribution cable as well as enclosing a splitter array. This flexibility in interconnections of the downstream fiber network may facilitate optimization of the use of electronic equipment in the central office by, for example, avoiding the need to dedicate circuits in the central office to each subscriber location when many such locations may not be active.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A field service technician may be sent to the CSC to modify the selection of a subscriber location coupled through a splitter to a particular fiber from the central office by connecting and disconnecting various cables found in the CSC. For example, it is known to provide connectorized pigtail cables associated with each subscriber location serviced by a CSC in the CSC. A technician can then select the cable for a designated subscriber location, for example, based on a label attached to the pigtail, and insert the selected cable in a connection point of a splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some currently available splitter interconnect cabinets utilize industry standard connectorized bulkhead modules to house splitters. These designs generally do not permit access to the rear of the connector without breaking a warranty seal and are designed for the central office environment. The seal may be critical for the manufacturer to ensure that no damage to the splitter occurs post-manufacturing (in the field). This requirement may be in direct opposition to the cleaning requirement, for which access to the front and back of a connection point may be desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide interconnect cabinets for optical fibers that include an enclosure and a splitter and termination panel mounted in the enclosure.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which illustrative embodiments of the invention are shown. In the drawings, the relative sizes of regions or features may be exaggerated for clarity. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some embodiments of the present invention utilize a multi-layer, fold down tray approach to support various functions, such as slack storage, pigtail to outside plant (OSP) cable splicing and angle down front patching. A termination module according to such embodiments may be designed in a modular fashion so that it can be used separately in a small pedestal or ganged together with other termination modules in a pad (i.e. ground) or pole mounted cabinet. The termination modules may also be pre-terminated to subscriber location optical fibers before mounting in an interconnect cabinet. The termination modules in some embodiments may also be removed from the cabinet and carried to a remote location, such as a splice truck, to facilitate initial installation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The termination modules in some embodiments include splice trays therein that may be oriented such that they can be worked on remotely or in the cabinet when a repair situation arises. In some embodiments, the entire patching field pivots downward and/or sideways, allowing access to both sides of the connector for cleaning while potentially reducing or avoiding the normal disruption of disconnecting existing subscribers to gain access. Cleaning both sides of an optical connector may be beneficial, particularly when using connectors in the OSP. A detachable cable security member is incorporated into some embodiments of the termination module of the present invention, which may allow fixation of the cable as well as the central strength member in both an open and closed position of the termination module without placing undue strain on the cable from a change in orientation of the termination module during installation or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cable security member of some embodiments of the present invention need only be separated from the termination module during closing (when the termination panel is moved from an open to a closed position). The relative position of the cable security member to the splice trays may remain substantially unchanged during the closing (or opening).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A splitter module array (one or more splitters) can be built up incrementally in a cabinet by adding one pre-connectorized splitter module at a time in some embodiments of the present invention. The splitter module may, for example, be splitter/splice trays coupled to a hanger bracket for purposes of mounting. However, alternative embodiments may use a splitter box that is loaded into a rack or some other bracket. Labels on the forward facing edge of the splitter module may be included to indicate subscribers allocated to that splitter. Labels on the front of the splitter module could also be included to indicate test data and/or relevant manufacturing information.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments of the present invention, random over-length storage of connectorized pigtails exiting the splitters may incorporate the use of half-moon spools, which may provide bend control as well as incremental slack compensation. The spools may be, for example, evenly spaced such that each spool is allocated to specific fields of the patch panel, which may simplify tracing of pigtails.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments of the present invention, only front access may be needed to work on cabinet. General fiber management and organization may be a problem with existing cabinet designs. Some embodiments of the present invention may overcome these shortcomings by regrouping the various functions (splicing, patching, splitting) in a way that may be counter-intuitive to standard practices. This regrouping of functions may significantly increase productivity, craft friendliness and/or maintainability of fiber management in interconnect cabinets according to some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For some embodiments of the present invention, as will be described further herein with reference to the figures, shifting the bulkhead connection point from the splitter to a patch panel may permit access to both sides of the connection point for cleaning. Also, for some embodiments of the present invention, a reduced number of loose/unterminated pigtails may need to be managed during routine maintenance and reconfiguration. Various embodiments of the present invention may provide for 216 or more pigtails hanging in bunches and that number may be incrementally reduced as subscribers are added to the network. Some embodiments of the present invention may reduce this congestion to a maximum of 15 fibers for 1×16 splitters or 31 for 1×32 splitters. This smaller number may be reduced as subscribers are added until none are left and a new splitter is added. The unused pigtails may be stored on the side of the cabinet segregated from the active fibers. The patch panel design may allow subscribers to be identified quickly as contrasted with other known approaches that require the craft to fumble through bundles of pigtails in search of one specific customer that has subscribed to the network and needs connecting.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the various embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an interconnect cabinet <b>100</b> for optical fibers according to some embodiments of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the interconnect cabinet <b>100</b> is used for connecting subscriber cable(s) <b>105</b> with the central office outside plant (OSP) cable(s) <b>110</b> so as to manage connectivity of subscriber locations to the central office. The interconnect cabinet <b>100</b> includes splice modules <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b</i>, a termination module <b>130</b> having a front face that provides a patch panel, a splitter module <b>140</b> and connectorized pigtails <b>150</b><i>a</i>, <b>150</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the splice modules <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b </i>may be used to connect optical fibers from the cables <b>105</b>, <b>110</b> to a backside of the optical fiber connection points (members) <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>. While two splice modules <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, more splice modules may be used depending upon the number of fibers to be routed through the interconnection cabinet <b>100</b>. Furthermore, although a separate splice module <b>115</b><i>b </i>is shown for use with the central office cable <b>110</b>, in various embodiments of the present invention, a common splice module may be used for both the cable fibers of the subscriber <b>105</b> and the central office <b>110</b>. Although splice modules for making such interconnections provide benefits in routing and control of radius of curvature and the like of optical fibers, it will understood that the present invention, in some embodiments, encompasses other methods of interconnect between the subscriber and central office cables <b>105</b>, <b>110</b> and the fiber connection points <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the splitter module <b>140</b> has a connectorized pigtail <b>150</b><i>a </i>extending to a fiber connection point <b>120</b><i>b </i>to optically couple to a fiber from the central office. The fiber from the central office is connected by the splitter module <b>140</b> to the plurality of connectorized pigtails <b>150</b><i>b</i>. Thus, each of the connectorized pigtails <b>150</b><i>b </i>are associated with an optical fiber feeder cable <b>110</b> coupled to a central office, typically through an individual fiber. The splitter module <b>140</b> may be a 4 to 1, 16 to 1, 32 to 1 or the like splitter module based on the desired number of subscribers to be carried and supported by a single fiber feed to the central office.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, ones of the fibers from the subscriber cable <b>105</b> associated with different subscriber locations are each coupled to respective ones of the fiber connection points <b>120</b><i>b </i>in the patch panel front face of the termination module <b>130</b>. The connectorized pigtails <b>150</b><i>b </i>have a cable length sufficient to allow connection of each of the pigtails <b>150</b><i>b </i>to the plurality of connection points <b>120</b><i>b</i>. As a result, service to an individual subscriber location may be readily provided or ended by coupling or decoupling one of the connectorized pigtails <b>150</b><i>b </i>from the one of the fiber connection points <b>120</b><i>b </i>associated with that subscriber. Therefore, providing a readily determined location on the front patch panel of the termination module <b>130</b> associated with each specific subscriber may simplify the task of making a connection for a field technician who might otherwise have difficulty locating a pigtail <b>150</b><i>b </i>associated with a specific subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fiber feed to the central office from the central office cable(s) <b>110</b>, like the fiber feed of the subscriber cable(s) <b>105</b>, is coupled through a splice module <b>115</b><i>b </i>to an interconnection point <b>120</b><i>b </i>on the patch panel front face of the termination module <b>130</b>. While shown as a separate connection points <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will understood that any of the connection points <b>120</b><i>b </i>could likewise be used to provide an interconnection to the central office cable(s) <b>110</b>. It will be further understood that, in some embodiments of the present invention, the input optical fiber to the splitter module <b>140</b> is spliced to a fiber in the central office cable(s) <b>110</b> directly without use of the termination module <b>130</b> and the connectorized pigtail <b>150</b><i>a</i>. For example, the input optical fiber to the splitter module <b>140</b> could be coupled to a fiber from the central office cable(s) in the splice module <b>115</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention will now be further described with reference to the embodiments of an interconnect cabinet <b>200</b> for optical fibers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the interconnect cabinet <b>200</b> includes an enclosure <b>202</b> having an upper chamber <b>210</b> and a lower chamber <b>205</b>. The enclosure <b>202</b> may be a double-walled housing configured to provide passive cooling for the cabinet <b>200</b>. The subscriber and central office cables <b>105</b>, <b>100</b> are received in the lower chamber <b>205</b>, which is protected by a front cover panel <b>207</b>. The cables <b>105</b>, <b>100</b> feed through a bottom panel <b>252</b> positioned between the upper chamber <b>210</b> and the lower chamber <b>205</b> through grommets <b>254</b>. Thus, for example, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upper chamber <b>210</b> may be provided a cleaner or more environmentally controlled environment than the lower chamber <b>205</b>. However, it will be understood that various embodiments of the present invention may provide for direct routing of the cables <b>105</b> and <b>110</b> into the upper chamber <b>210</b> of a single chamber enclosure not having a separate lower chamber.</p>
