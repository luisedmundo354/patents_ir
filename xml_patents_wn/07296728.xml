<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional patent application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/644,130 filed on Aug. 20, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,140,533 for a “Single Piece Packaging Container and Device for Making Same.”</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to packaging containers and a device for making the containers. More particularly, the present invention pertains to configurations for a packing container having self-formed end closures, created from a single piece of material. The present invention also pertains to a device for forming the containers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Packaging for lengthy items takes many forms. One construction includes a pair of corrugated, laminated paperboard top and bottom U-shaped channels configured for one to fit within the other. Most packages formed in this manner require separate end closures or caps, usually manufactured from cardboard or wood. These caps generally are stapled to adjacent package walls. Not only does this method necessitate close-fit manufacturing, but it is also very cumbersome at installation, and may cause content damage due to incompletely formed or off-positioned staples.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another variety of packaging container, one of the top and bottom U-shaped channels has a notch cut into opposing side walls of the “U,” so that the “U” portion may be folded over at a 90 degree angle. In such a configuration, channel ends are closed by the folded base portion and the side walls of the “U,” which are folded over adjacent side walls. To seal such a package, tape or a like strip-type adhesive sealant must be extended over the flaps that then are folded over the adjacent side walls. Even though a seal may be formed, openings may remain at the juncture of the folded-over base portion and the cover portion, seriously weakening the package. This design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,976,374.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another existing packaging container, disclosed in Loeschen, U.S. Pat. No. 6,382,447, resolves the above-referenced problems by providing a packaging container in which the entirety of the end closure is formed from the packaging material itself. However, the container base unit, which forms end closures for the packaging container, features mitered corners. These mitered corners require complex die-cutting with mirrored tools, and mandatory strapping at specific positions to restrain the miter flaps. The patent to Loeschen, which is commonly assigned herewith, is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A new, single-piece packaging container cut without miters is disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/264,506, filed Oct. 4, 2002, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. The end closures of this packaging container are formed from the packaging material itself. The container allows for no gaps at its closure locations, because its end closures meet or overlap along the container's main body portion, providing a high degree of structural strength and package integrity. Manufacturing the container is extremely simple and cost-effective, requiring only two straight saw-cuts on each package end.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Occasionally, packaging containers must accommodate objects with varied local height elevations, or objects that require segregation during shipping or storage. Normally, shippers rely on foam fillers or container partitions to protect such irregularly shaped or fragile objects. Foam fillers may compress, leak, or shift, and container partitions may shift or break during shipping, rendering shippers' attempts to protect their products worthless. Accordingly, there exists a need for specialized configurations for a single-piece packaging container having self-formed end closures, providing better protection for fragile and/or irregularly shaped objects than undependable foam fillers or container partitions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Configurations for a packing container formed from a single, preformed, rigid unit of U-shaped cross-section having a main body portion with a bottom wall and opposing side walls, and having self-formed end closures are disclosed. The unit forms a plurality of end closures, at each end of the packaging container. Each end closure is formed from a plurality of closure panels extending from and adjacent to each end of the main body portion. The main body portion and the plurality of end closures are separated from one another by fold lines.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For purposes of the present disclosure, the package material, although defined as having a U-shaped cross-section is, in fact, formed from a material having a channel-like or squared U-shape having a flat or near-flat bottom wall. The corners may be formed having a radius of curvature (i.e., rounded) or they may be formed having relatively sharp angles. However, again, for purposes of the present disclosure, the container material is referred to as “U-shaped.”</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The main body portion and the plurality of closure panels all have straight-cut corners at their junctions with each other. Some closure panels are configured for folding generally perpendicular to each other and to the main body bottom wall, and others are configured for folding generally parallel to each other and to the main body bottom wall.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the packaging container is configured to enclose an object with an elevated end (e.g., a support post with an attached asymmetrical flange). One of the end closure's closure panels has approximately the same height as the elevated end of the object to be packaged. Another embodiment is configured to enclose an object with an elevated mid-section (e.g., a crankshaft with integrated cam). Additional closure panels are included with this configuration, to accommodate the “bulge” made by the object's elevated mid-section.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the packaging container is configured to enclose an object with random elevations. Two of the end closure's closure panels have approximately the same height as the highest elevation of the object to be packaged. A fourth embodiment is configured to enclose two or more dissimilar objects that should be prevented from touching or intermingling during shipping in separate compartments. Another embodiment is configured to combine elements of the four above-referenced configurations, allowing a user to ship objects with elevated ends, elevated mid-sections, or random elevations in separate compartments. A sixth embodiment is configured to enclose one or more objects with a set of two closure panels that are about equal in length to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, in conjunction with the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present configuration additionally may be used as a packaging container with a built-in spacer. Frequently, objects are somewhat shorter than the length of available shipping containers. For example, it would be economical to ship an object four feet to five-and-a-half feet in length in a six-foot-long standard box. Usually, such an object would be randomly placed in a too-large box and covered with foam fillers or other, similar protective materials. However, fillers may compress, leak, or shift, leaving shipped objects without protection. Conversely, using the packaging container <b>10</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the short object could be placed against one end of the container <b>10</b>, and then custom enclosed into a segregated side, with a double-thick divider separating it from the other, fully-formed, hollow chamber. The present configuration allows shippers to customize packaging containers by creating a segregated, perfectly-sized compartment within a standard-sized box.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A fifth embodiment of the present invention is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which shows a packaging container configuration designed to combine all four of the above described configurations. As described in detail above, the packaging container <b>10</b> exhibited in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can accommodate and object with an elevated end <b>58</b>, an object with an elevated mid-section <b>60</b>, an object with random elevations <b>62</b> (not shown), and objects that must be segregated during shipping <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. To accomplish the composition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the side of the main body portion <b>12</b> containing the object with an elevated end requires four closure panels (<b>14</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>76</b>), and the side of the main body portion <b>12</b> containing the object with an elevated mid-section requires five closure panels (<b>16</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>). All of the closure panels are folded and inserted according to the above descriptions, resulting in completely object coverage and a double thick divider. If an object with random elevations <b>62</b> was packaged as part of a combination container, four closure panels would be required for its end of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A sixth embodiment is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, which show a packaging container configuration designed to enclose one or more objects <b>82</b>. Similar to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the packaging container <b>10</b> includes a main body portion <b>12</b>, first closure panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and second closure panels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, but no third closure panels. The lengths l<sub>14</sub>, l<sub>16 </sub>of the first closure panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are approximately equal to the heights h<sub>26</sub>, h<sub>34</sub>, and h<sub>36 </sub>of the main body, first closure panels, and second closure panels side walls <b>26</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>36</b>. In that this is a “seamless” container, the second closure panel <b>20</b> has a length l<sub>20 </sub>that is about equal to the length l<sub>12 </sub>of the main body portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the packaging container <b>10</b> as assembled. The main body <b>12</b>, and the first and second closure panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b> are laid out flat on a surface. The article to be packaged <b>82</b> is placed in the main body portion <b>12</b>. The first panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are then folded upwardly, so that the first panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are perpendicular to the bottom wall <b>24</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b>. As the first panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are folded, their side walls <b>34</b> can be inserted between the main body side walls <b>26</b>. The second panels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are then folded over, perpendicular to the first panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> so that the bottom walls <b>30</b> of the second panels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> lie substantially parallel to the bottom wall <b>24</b> of the main body portion <b>12</b>. As the second panels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are folded, their side walls <b>36</b> can be inserted between the side walls <b>34</b> of the first panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In that the length l<sub>20 </sub>is about equal to the length l<sub>12 </sub>of the main body portion <b>12</b>, the container appears to be “seamless”; that is, the container appears to be without a mid container seam across the top (which is panel <b>20</b>) or the main body portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there is shown one cutter device <b>102</b> for forming or making the side wall cuts in the container <b>10</b> material. The cutter <b>102</b> includes a frame <b>104</b>, a container support <b>106</b> and a carriage <b>108</b> that moves in a reciprocating manner in the direction of the cut. As illustrated, the container support <b>106</b> includes beam <b>110</b> on which are mounted stand-offs <b>112</b> for receiving the container <b>10</b>. The container <b>10</b> rests on the stand-offs <b>112</b> to define a base surface <b>114</b> and side surfaces <b>116</b> for supporting the container <b>10</b> as it is cut.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The carriage <b>108</b> is configured to move down and up, toward and away from the container <b>10</b> as it rests on the support <b>106</b>. The carriage <b>108</b> is configured to support a pair of rotary cutters <b>118</b>, for example, circular saws, one each mounted a carriage side wall <b>120</b>. In this manner, as the carriage <b>108</b> moves up and down (as indicated by the arrow at <b>122</b>), the cutters <b>118</b> move up and down for cutting through the side walls of the container <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 20</figref>, a cutting anvil <b>124</b> is positioned on the support <b>106</b> at the location at which the cutters <b>118</b> move into the container <b>10</b>. The anvil <b>124</b> includes channels <b>126</b> formed in the side walls to permit movement of the cutters <b>118</b> through the container side walls without contacting the anvil <b>124</b> side walls. In addition, the anvil <b>124</b> can include a raised portion or ridge <b>128</b> that extends transversely across the top wall <b>129</b> of the anvil <b>124</b> between the side wall channels <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a present embodiment, the carriage <b>108</b> is moved up and down by action of a drive <b>130</b>, such as the exemplary pneumatic cylinder. The pneumatic cylinder <b>130</b> is mounted to an upper carriage plate <b>132</b> to which the carriage side plates or walls <b>120</b> (mounting the cutters <b>118</b> to the carriage <b>108</b>) are mounted. In this manner, reciprocating movement of the cylinder <b>130</b> moves the carriage <b>108</b> which moves the cutters <b>118</b> into and out of contact with the container <b>10</b>. Other drives will be recognized by those skilled in the art and are within the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The cutters <b>118</b> are fixedly mounted to the carriage <b>108</b> to permit readily moving the carriage <b>108</b> up and down for cutting the container side walls. To facilitate holding or maintaining the container <b>10</b> in place as the carriage <b>108</b> moves downward and the cutters <b>118</b> move into contact with the container side walls, a pair of holding pins <b>134</b> can be mounted to the support <b>106</b>. The holding pins <b>134</b> move outwardly to hold the container <b>10</b> side walls against the carriage side surfaces <b>116</b> as the cutters <b>118</b> make contact with the container <b>10</b>. In a present embodiment, the pins <b>134</b> are pneumatically actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To further provide a “clean” container <b>10</b> appearance, the cutting device <b>102</b> is configured to emboss the container top or bottom wall <b>24</b> at fold or crease lines between the side wall cuts. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 19</figref>, the upper carriage plate <b>132</b> includes a transverse groove <b>136</b> formed therein that corresponds to the top wall ridge <b>128</b>. In this manner as the carriage <b>108</b> moves down to move the cutters <b>118</b> into contact with the container <b>10</b> side walls, the upper plate <b>132</b> “presses” the container top (or bottom) wall <b>24</b> between the upper carriage plate <b>132</b> and the support top wall <b>129</b>, sandwiching the container wall <b>24</b> between the ridge <b>128</b> and the groove <b>136</b>, thus “embossing” a groove into the wall <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To provide the appropriate spacing between cuts (e.g., to form appropriate sized panels <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>), the cutter device <b>102</b> can include an indexing assembly <b>138</b>. The indexing assembly <b>138</b> includes a drive <b>140</b>, such as the exemplary pneumatic cylinder, to move the container <b>10</b> a desired distance once a first cut is made to position the container <b>10</b> for a second cut. To effect movement, the cylinder <b>140</b> cycles between a retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) and an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). The extension length or distance of the cylinder <b>140</b> can be set to correspond to the desired distance between cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the carriage <b>108</b> can include openings or windows <b>142</b> in a side thereof that overlie a scale <b>144</b> that is applied to the support beam <b>110</b>. In this manner, the distance along the length of the container <b>10</b> at which the cut or cuts are formed can be precisely set and controlled.</p>
