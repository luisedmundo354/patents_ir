<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a tape measure having a screwdriver, and particularly to an assembly of a tape measure and a foldable screwdriver for easy use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a conventional tape measure includes a case <b>5</b> with an outlet <b>51</b> defined in one side thereof. A ruler <b>6</b> is received in the case <b>5</b> and has one end extending through the outlet <b>51</b>. A pushing button <b>7</b> is movably disposed at one side edge of the case <b>5</b> corresponding to the outlet <b>51</b>. A stop member <b>8</b> is coupled to the pushing button <b>7</b>. The pushing button <b>7</b> and the stop member <b>8</b> is respectively disposed with tooth-like portions <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> mated to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In use, the pushing button <b>7</b> is pushed to move downwardly whereby the tooth-like portion <b>71</b> of the pushing button <b>7</b> engages with the tooth-like portion <b>81</b> of the stop member <b>8</b> to rotate the stop member <b>8</b> to press the ruler <b>6</b> thereby positioning the ruler <b>6</b> at the desired scale. When it is desired to withdraw the ruler <b>6</b>, the pushing button <b>7</b> is pushed to move upwardly to rotate the stop member <b>8</b> through the tooth-like portions <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> of the pushing button <b>7</b> and the stop member <b>8</b> engaging with each other, whereby the stop member <b>8</b> leaves the ruler <b>6</b> <u style="single">├</u> and so the ruler <b>6</b> is recoiled in the case <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Though the conventional tape measure can be applied to measure via the ruler <b>6</b>, the tape measure does not have other functions. When a user or worker goes to work, he has to take many tools besides a tape measure, for example, a screwdriver, a spanner, a pair of tongs and so on. The screwdriver is classified as flat type and cross type each having different sizes for corresponding to different types and sizes of screws. Therefore, a user or worker has to takes a lot of tools which are different in type or in size. However, it is not only inconvenient to take, but also inconvenient to store. It is desired to combine some tools, such as a tape measure and a screwdriver, together for easy use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an assembly of a tape measure and a screwdriver which has a foldable screwdriver mechanism movably disposed in a receiving chamber of a tape measure thereby facilitating to use.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the above object, an assembly of a tape measure and a screwdriver of the present invention includes a tape measure having a case, a ruler received in the case, an outlet being defined in the bottom of one side of the case for extension of the ruler, a receiving chamber being defined in one surface of the case and extending to an edge of the case, a pressing unit being disposed at one side of the case; and a screwdriver mechanism movably disposed in the receiving chamber of the case, the screwdriver mechanism having a positioning unit corresponding to the pressing unit.</p>

The positioning unit <b>21</b> is disposed at the second pressing board <b>23</b> corresponding to the screwdriver unit <b>24</b>. The first pressing board <b>22</b> has a shaft body <b>221</b> movably connected to the screwdriver unit <b>24</b>. The spring <b>26</b> is sleevingly attached to the shaft body <b>221</b>. The screwdriver unit <b>24</b> includes a connection board <b>241</b> movably disposed between the first and second pressing boards <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, and a sleeve <b>242</b> extending from one end of the connection board <b>241</b>. The sleeve <b>242</b> is for movable insertion of the tool head <b>3</b>. The connection board <b>241</b> is defined with two cutouts <b>243</b>, <b>244</b> in two side edges thereof respectively corresponding to the positioning unit <b>21</b>. The positioning unit <b>21</b> includes a positioning post <b>211</b>, and a resilient member <b>212</b> having two ends respectively abutting the first pressing board <b>22</b> and the positioning post <b>211</b>. The positioning post <b>211</b> is annularly defined with a recess <b>213</b>. Therefore, the tape measure <b>1</b> and the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b> are combined to form the assembly of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Since the ruler <b>13</b> of the tape measure <b>1</b> can be drawn or retracted in the conventional manner, the tape measure is not detailedly described herein. Functions and effects that the assembly of the present invention has are detailedly described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, when it is desired to pull out the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b>, the pressing unit <b>16</b> is pressed to enable the pressing button <b>161</b> of the pressing unit <b>16</b> to press the positioning post <b>211</b> of the positioning unit <b>21</b>. So the positioning post <b>211</b> slides in the cutout <b>243</b> of the connection board <b>241</b> to enable the connection board <b>241</b> to fall into the recess <b>213</b> of the positioning post <b>211</b>. Meanwhile, the screwdriver unit <b>24</b> is resiliently moved by the rotation resilience of the spring <b>26</b>. Therefore, the screwdriver unit <b>24</b> rotates 180 degrees. Then the positioning post <b>211</b> of the positioning unit <b>21</b> is returned by the push of the resilient member <b>212</b>. The pressing button <b>161</b> of the pressing unit <b>16</b> is returned through the resilient member <b>162</b> whereby the positioning post <b>211</b> engages with the cutout <b>244</b> of the connection board <b>241</b>. The sleeve <b>242</b> of the screwdriver unit <b>24</b> is positioned at one side of the case <b>10</b>. Thus, the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b> is pulled out.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, when it is desired to fold the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b>, the pressing unit <b>16</b> is pressed to enable the pressing button <b>161</b> to press the positioning post <b>211</b> of the positioning unit <b>21</b> whereby the positioning post <b>211</b> slides in the cutout <b>244</b> of the connection board <b>241</b>. Therefore, the connection board <b>241</b> falls into the recess <b>213</b> of the positioning post <b>211</b>. The screwdriver unit <b>24</b> is closed toward the arcuate recessed portion <b>151</b> to enable the positioning post <b>211</b> to engage with the cutout <b>243</b> of the connection board <b>241</b>. Then the positioning post <b>211</b> of the positioning unit <b>21</b> is returned through the push of the resilient member <b>212</b>. Meanwhile, the pressing button <b>161</b> of the pressing unit <b>16</b> is returned through the resilient member <b>162</b> to enable the sleeve <b>242</b> of the screwdriver unit <b>24</b> to be folded in the arcuate recessed portion <b>151</b>. Thus, the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, when a user wants to replace the tool head <b>3</b> of the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b>, the cover <b>19</b> is turned on. During turning on the cover <b>19</b>, the cover <b>19</b> actuates the positioning plate <b>182</b> to ratate about the shaft pole <b>181</b> through the compressing resilience of the resilient member <b>183</b> on the shaft pole <b>181</b> of the rotation shaft unit <b>18</b>. Meanwhile, the cover <b>19</b> is driven to rotate 165 degrees to be turned on and so the storage zone <b>17</b> is exposed. Therefore, a user can select the tool heads <b>3</b> in the storage zone <b>17</b> and take down the tool head <b>3</b> from the latches <b>171</b> and then directly insert the tool head <b>3</b> into the sleeve <b>242</b> of the screwdriver unit <b>24</b>. Then the cover <b>19</b> is closed. Thus, the tool head <b>3</b> is assembled or replaced in the sleeve <b>242</b> of the screwdriver mechanism <b>2</b>.</p>
