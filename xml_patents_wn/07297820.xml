<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation, and language impairment. Postmortem examination of AD brain sections reveals abundant senile plaques (SPs) composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by filaments of highly phosphorylated tau proteins (for recent reviews and additional citations see Ginsberg, S. D., et al., “Molecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,” in <i>Cerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age</i>-<i>related Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex</i>, Kluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., “Cell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,” <i>Alzheimer's Disease</i>, Lippincot, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372). Familial AD (FAD) is caused by multiple mutations in the A precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes (Ginsberg, S. D., et al., “Molecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,” in <i>Cerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age</i>-<i>related Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex</i>, Kluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., “Cell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,” <i>Alzheimer's Disease</i>, Lippincot, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the exact mechanisms underlying AD are not fully understood, all pathogenic FAD mutations studied thus far increase production of the more amyloidogenic 42-43 amino-acid long form of the Aβ peptide. Thus, at least in FAD, dysregulation of Aβ production appears to be sufficient to induce a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that formation of extracellular fibrillar Aβ aggregates in the brain may be a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis (Selkoe, D. J., “Biology of B-amyloid Precursor Protein and the Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease,” <i>Alzheimer's Disease</i>, Lippincot Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 293-310; Selkoe, D. J., <i>J. Am. Med. Assoc. </i>283:1615-1617 (2000); Naslund, J., et al., <i>J. Am. Med. Assoc. </i>283:1571-1577 (2000); Golde, T. E., et al., <i>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta </i>1502:172-187 (2000)).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various approaches in trying to inhibit the production and reduce the accumulation of fibrillar Aβ in the brain are currently being evaluated as potential therapies for AD (Skovronsky, D. M. and Lee, V. M., <i>Trends Pharmacol. Sci. </i>21:161-163 (2000); Vassar, R., et al., <i>Science </i>286:735-741 (1999); Wolfe, M. S., et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>41:6-9 (1998); Moore, C. L., et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>43:3434-3442 (2000); Findeis, M. A., <i>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta </i>1502:76-84 (2000); Kuner, P., Bohrmann, et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>275:1673-1678 (2000)). It is therefore of great interest to develop ligands that specifically bind fibrillar Aβ aggregates. Since extracellular SPs are accessible targets, these new ligands could be used as in vivo diagnostic tools and as probes to visualize the progressive deposition of Aβ in studies of AD amyloidogenesis in living patients.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To this end, several interesting approaches for developing fibrillar Aβ aggregate-specific ligands have been reported (Ashburn, T. T., et al., <i>Chem. Biol. </i>3:351-358 (1996); Han, G., et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>118:4506-4507 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., <i>Biol. Psychiatry </i>35:627 (1994); Klunk, W. E., et al., <i>Neurobiol. Aging </i>16:541-548 (1995); Klunk, W. E., et al., <i>Society for Neuroscience Abstract </i>23:1638 (1997); Mathis, C. A., et al., <i>Proc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., </i>Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997); Lorenzo, A. and Yankner, B. A., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>91:12243-12247 (1994); Zhen, W., et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>42:2805-2815 (1999)). The most attractive approach is based on highly conjugated chrysamine-G (CG) and Congo red (CR), and the latter has been used for fluorescent staining of SPs and NFTs in postmortem AD brain sections (Ashburn, T. T., et al., <i>Chem. Biol. </i>3:351-358 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., <i>J. Histochem. Cytochem. </i>37:1273-1281 (1989)). The inhibition constants (K<sub>i</sub>) for binding to fibrillar Aβ aggregates of CR, CG, and 3′-bromo- and 3′-iodo derivatives of CG are 2,800, 370, 300 and 250 nM, respectively (Mathis, C. A., et al., <i>Proc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., </i>Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997)). These compounds have been shown to bind selectively to Aβ (1-40) peptide aggregates in vitro as well as to fibrillar Aβ deposits in AD brain sections (Mathis, C. A., et al., <i>Proc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., </i>Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997)).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of various insoluble, fibrillar proteins in the tissues of a patient. An amyloid deposit is formed by the aggregation of amyloid proteins, followed by the further combination of aggregates and/or amyloid proteins. Formation and accumulation of aggregates of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the brain are critical factors in the development and progression of AD. The fibrillar aggregates of amyloid peptides, Aβ<sub>1-40 </sub>and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, are major metabolic peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein found in senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in AD patients (Xia, W., et al., <i>J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>97:9299-9304 (2000)). Prevention and reversal of Aβ plaque formation are being targeted as a treatment for this disease (Selkoe, D., J. JAMA 283:1615-1617 (2000); Wolfe, M. S., et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>41:6-9 (1998); Skovronsky, D. M., and Lee, V. M., <i>Trends Pharmacol. Sci. </i>21:161-163 (2000)).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to the role of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, the presence of amyloid deposits has been shown in diseases such as Mediterranean fever, Muckle-Wells syndrome, idiopathetic myeloma, amyloid polyneuropathy, amyloid cardiomyopathy, systemic senile amyloidosis, amyloid polyneuropathy, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Down's syndrome, Scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Kuru, Gerstamnn-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, Isolated atrial amyloid, β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin amyloid in dialysis patients, inclusion body myositis, β<sub>2</sub>-amyloid deposits in muscle wasting disease, and Islets of Langerhans diabetes Type II insulinoma.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, a simple, noninvasive method for detecting and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient has been eagerly sought. Presently, detection of amyloid deposits involves histological analysis of biopsy or autopsy materials. Both methods have drawbacks. For example, an autopsy can only be used for a postmortem diagnosis.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Imaging agents may be based on two types of isotopes. <sup>99m</sup>Tc (T<sub>1/2</sub>, 6 h; 140 KeV) and <sup>123</sup>I (T<sub>1/2</sub>, 13 h; 159 KeV) are routinely used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), while <sup>11</sup>C (T<sub>1/2</sub>, 20 min; 511 KeV) and <sup>18</sup>F (T<sub>1/2</sub>, 110 min; 511 KeV) are commonly used for positron emission tomography (PET).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The direct imaging of amyloid deposits in vivo is difficult, as the deposits have many of the same physical properties (e.g., density and water content) as normal tissues. Attempts to image amyloid deposits using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-assisted tomography (CAT) have been disappointing and have detected amyloid deposits only under certain favorable conditions. In addition, efforts to label amyloid deposits with antibodies, serum amyloid P protein, or other probe molecules have provided some selectivity on the periphery of tissues, but have provided for poor imaging of tissue interiors.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Potential ligands for detecting Aβ aggregates in the living brain must cross the intact blood-brain barrier. Thus brain uptake can be improved by using ligands with relatively smaller molecular size (compared to Congo Red) and increased lipophilicity. Highly conjugated thioflavins (S and T) are commonly used as dyes for staining the Aβ aggregates in the AD brain (Elhaddaoui, A., et al., <i>Biospectroscopy </i>1: 351-356 (1995)). These compounds are based on benzothiazole, which is relatively small in molecular size.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It would be useful to have a noninvasive technique for imaging and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient. In addition, it would be useful to have compounds that inhibit the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits and a method for determining a compound's ability to inhibit amyloid protein aggregation.</p>

A small amount of non-radiolabeled compound (1-2 mg) is dissolved in 100 μL EtOH and mixed with 200 μL HCl (1 N) and 1 mL Sn-glucoheptonate solution (containing 8-32 μg SnCl<sub>2 </sub>and 80-320 μg Na-glucoheptonate, pH 6.67) and 50 μL EDTA solution (0.1 N). [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Pertechnetate (100-200 μL; ranging from 2-20 mCi) saline solution are then added. The reaction is heated for 30 min at 100° C., then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is analyzed on TLC (EtOH:conc. NH<sub>3</sub>9:1) for product formation and purity check. The mixture can be neutralized with phosphate buffer to pH 5.0.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0133">The present invention further relates to a method of preparing a technetium-99 m complex according to the present invention by reacting technetium-99 m in the form of a pertechnetate in the presence of a reducing agent and optionally a suitable chelator with an appropriate Ch-containing compound.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0134">The reducing agent serves to reduce the Tc-99 m pertechnetate which is eluted from a molybdenum-technetium generator in a physiological saline solution. Suitable reducing agents are, for example, dithionite, formamidine sulphinic acid, diaminoethane disulphinate or suitable metallic reducing agents such as Sn(II), Fe(II), Cu(I), Ti(III) or Sb(III). Sn(II) has proven to be particularly suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0135">For the above-mentioned complex-forming reaction, technetium-99 m is reacted with an appropriate compound of the invention as a salt or in the form of technetium bound to comparatively weak chelators. In the latter case the desired technetium-99 m complex is formed by ligand exchange. Examples of suitable chelators for the radionuclide are dicarboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, orthophtalic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salicylic acid or derivatives of these acids; phosphorus compounds such as pyrophosphates; or enolates. Citric acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, glucoheptonic acid or a derivative thereof are particularly suitable chelators for this purpose, because a chelate of technetium-99 m with one of these chelators undergoes the desired ligand exchange particularly easily.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0136">The most commonly used procedure for preparing [Tc<sup>v</sup>O]<sup>+3</sup>N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2 </sub>complexes is based on stannous (II) chloride reduction of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]pertechnetate, the common starting material. The labeling procedure normally relies on a Tc-99 m ligand exchange reaction between Tc-99 m (Sn)-glucoheptonate and the N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2 </sub>ligand. Preparation of stannous (II) chloride and preserving it in a consistent stannous (II) form is critically important for the success of the labeling reaction. To stabilize the air-sensitive stannous ion it is a common practice in nuclear medicine to use a lyophilized kit, in which the stannous ion is in a lyophilized powder form mixed with an excess amount of glucoheptonate under an inert gas like nitrogen or argon. The preparation of the lyophilized stannous chloride/sodium glucoheptonate kits ensures that the labeling reaction is reproducible and predictable. The N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2 </sub>ligands are usually air-sensitive (thiols are easily oxidized by air) and there are subsequent reactions which lead to decomposition of the ligands. The most convenient and predictable method to preserve the ligands is to produce lyophilized kits containing 100-500 μg of the ligands under argon or nitrogen.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0159">When the compounds of this invention are to be used as imaging agents, they must be labeled with suitable radioactive halogen isotopes. Although <sup>125</sup>I-isotopes are useful for laboratory testing, they will generally not be useful for actual diagnostic purposes because of the relatively long half-life (60 days) and low gamma-emission (30-65 Kev) of <sup>125</sup>I. The isotope <sup>123</sup>I has a half life of thirteen hours and gamma energy of 159 KeV, and it is therefore expected that labeling of ligands to be used for diagnostic purposes would be with this isotope. Other isotopes which may be used include <sup>131</sup>I (half life of 2 hours). Suitable bromine isotopes include <sup>77</sup>Br and <sup>76</sup>Br.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0160">The radiohalogenated compounds of this invention lend themselves easily to formation from materials which could be provided to users in kits. Kits for forming the imaging agents can contain, for example, a vial containing a physiologically suitable solution of an intermediate of Formula I, II, III, IV or V in a concentration and at a pH suitable for optimal complexing conditions. The user would add to the vial an appropriate quantity of the radioisotope, e.g., Na<sup>123</sup>I, and an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide. The resulting labeled ligand may then be administered intravenously to a patient, and receptors in the brain imaged by means of measuring the gamma ray or photo emissions therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0161">Since the radiopharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be prepared easily and simply, the preparation can be carried out readily by the user. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a kit, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0162">(1) A non-radiolabeled compound of the invention, the compound optionally being in a dry condition; and also optionally having an inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or auxiliary substances added thereto; and</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0163">(2) a reducing agent and optionally a chelator;</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">wherein ingredients (1) and (2) may optionally be combined; and</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">further wherein instructions for use with a prescription for carrying out the above-described method by reacting ingredients (1) and (2) with technetium-99 m in the form of a pertechnetate solution may be optionally included.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0164">Examples of suitable reducing agents and chelators for the above kit have been listed above. The pertechnetate solution can be obtained by the user from a molybdenum-technetium generator. Such generators are available in a number of institutions that perform radiodiagnostic procedures. As noted above the ingredients (1) and (2) may be combined, provided they are compatible. Such a monocomponent kit, in which the combined ingredients are preferably lyophilized, is excellently suitable to be reacted by the user with the pertechnetate solution in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0165">When desired, the radioactive diagnostic agent may contain any additive such as pH controlling agents (e.g., acids, bases, buffers), stabilizers (e.g., ascorbic acid) or isotonizing agents (e.g., sodium chloride).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0166">The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein refers to those carboxylate salts or acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “salts” refers to the relatively nontoxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. Also included are those salts derived from non-toxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, for example acetic acid, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, and aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Further representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactiobionate and laurylsulphonate salts, propionate, pivalate, cyclamate, isethionate, and the like. These may include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like, as well as, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium and amine cations including, but not limited to ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, and the like. (See, for example, Berge S. M., et al., <i>Pharmaceutical Salts, J. Pharm. Sci. </i>66:1-19 (1977) which is incorporated herein by reference.)</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0167">In the first step of the present method of imaging, a labeled compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V is introduced into a tissue or a patient in a detectable quantity. The compound is typically part of a pharmaceutical composition and is administered to the tissue or the patient by methods well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0168">For example, the compound can be administered either orally, rectally, parenterally (intravenous, by intramuscularly or subcutaneously), intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, intravesically, locally (powders, ointments or drops), or as a buccal or nasal spray.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0169">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the labeled compound is introduced into a patient in a detectable quantity and after sufficient time has passed for the compound to become associated with amyloid deposits, the labeled compound is detected noninvasively inside the patient. In another embodiment of the invention, a labeled compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V is introduced into a patient, sufficient time is allowed for the compound to become associated with amyloid deposits, and then a sample of tissue from the patient is removed and the labeled compound in the tissue is detected apart from the patient. In a third embodiment of the invention, a tissue sample is removed from a patient and a labeled compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V is introduced into the tissue sample. After a sufficient amount of time for the compound to become bound to amyloid deposits, the compound is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0170">The administration of the labeled compound to a patient can be by a general or local administration route. For example, the labeled compound may be administered to the patient such that it is delivered throughout the body. Alternatively, the labeled compound can be administered to a specific organ or tissue of interest. For example, it is desirable to locate and quantitate amyloid deposits in the brain in order to diagnose or track the progress of Alzheimer's disease in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0171">The term “tissue” means a part of a patient's body. Examples of tissues include the brain, heart, liver, blood vessels, and arteries. A detectable quantity is a quantity of labeled compound necessary to be detected by the detection method chosen. The amount of a labeled compound to be introduced into a patient in order to provide for detection can readily be determined by those skilled in the art. For example, increasing amounts of the labeled compound can be given to a patient until the compound is detected by the detection method of choice. A label is introduced into the compounds to provide for detection of the compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0172">The term “patient” means humans and other animals. Those skilled in the art are also familiar with determining the amount of time sufficient for a compound to become associated with amyloid deposits. The amount of time necessary can easily be determined by introducing a detectable amount of a labeled compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V into a patient and then detecting the labeled compound at various times after administration.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0173">The term “associated” means a chemical interaction between the labeled compound and the amyloid deposit. Examples of associations include covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions, hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, and complexes.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0174">Those skilled in the art are familiar with the various ways to detect labeled compounds. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be used to detect radiolabeled compounds. The label that is introduced into the compound will depend on the detection method desired. For example, if PET is selected as a detection method, the compound must possess a positron-emitting atom, such as <sup>11</sup>C or <sup>18</sup>F.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0175">The radioactive diagnostic agent should have sufficient radioactivity and radioactivity concentration which can assure reliable diagnosis. For instance, in case of the radioactive metal being technetium-99 m, it may be included usually in an amount of 0.1 to 50 mCi in about 0.5 to 5.0 ml at the time of administration. The amount of a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V may be such as sufficient to form a stable chelate compound with the radioactive metal.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0176">The thus formed chelate compound as a radioactive diagnostic agent is sufficiently stable, and therefore it may be immediately administered as such or stored until its use. When desired, the radioactive diagnostic agent may contain any additive such as pH controlling agents (e.g., acids, bases, buffers), stabilizers (e.g., ascorbic acid) or isotonizing agents (e.g., sodium chloride).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0177">The imaging of amyloid deposits can also be carried out quantitatively so that the amount of amyloid deposits can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0178">Preferred compounds for imaging include a radioisotope such as <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>76</sup>Br or <sup>77</sup>Br.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0179">The present invention is also directed at a method of imaging amyloid deposits. One of the key prerequisites for an in vivo imaging agent of the brain is the ability to cross the intact blood-brain barrier after a bolus iv injection.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0180">Another aspect of the invention is a method of inhibiting amyloid plaque aggregation. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits, by administering to a patient an amyloid inhibiting amount of a compound of the above Formula I, II, III, IV or V.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0181">Those skilled in the art are readily able to determine an amyloid inhibiting amount by simply administering a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V to a patient in increasing amounts until the growth of amyloid deposits is decreased or stopped. The rate of growth can be assessed using imaging as described above or by taking a tissue sample from a patient and observing the amyloid deposits therein. The compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient at dosage levels in the range of about 0.1 to about 1,000 mg per day. For a normal human adult having a body weight of about 70 kg, a dosage in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day is sufficient. The specific dosage used, however, can vary. For example, the dosage can depend on a number of factors including the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the pharmacological activity of the compound being used. The determination of optimum dosages for a particular patient is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0182">The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention.

<p id="p-0150" num="0197">The solid forms of peptides Aβ(1-40) was purchased from Bachem (King of Prussia, Pa.). Peptide aggregation was carried out by gently dissolving the peptide (0.5 mg/mL) in a buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and 1 mM EDTA. The solution was incubated at 37° C. for 36-42 h with gentle and constant shaking. Binding studies were carried out in 12×75 mm borosilicate glass tubes according to the procedure described<sup>1</sup>. Aggregated fibrils (10-50 nM in the final assay mixture) were added to the mixture containing 50 μl of radioligands (0.01-0.5 nM in 40% EtOH) and 10% EtOH in a final volume of 1 mL for saturation studies. The final concentration of EtOH was 10%. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 2 μM thioflavin T. For inhibition studies, 1 mL of the reaction mixture contained 40 μl of inhibitors (10<sup>−5</sup>-10<sup>−10 </sup>M in 10% EtOH) and 0.05 nM radiotracer in 40% EtOH. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and the bound and the free radioactivities were separated by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel M-24R cell harvester followed by 2×3 mL washes of 10% ethanol at room temperature. Filters containing the bound I-125 ligand were counted in a gamma counter (Packard 5000) with 70% counting efficiency. Under the assay conditions, the percent of the specifically bound fraction was less than 20% of the total radioactivity. The results of saturation and inhibition experiments were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using software EBDA<sup>2 </sup>by which K<sub>d </sub>and K<sub>i </sub>values were calculated. Values for (K<sub>i</sub>, nM) are the mean±SEM of three independent experiments, each in duplicate.

<p id="p-0151" num="0198">In in vitro binding assays using pre-formed Aβ aggregates of synthetic peptides and [<sup>125</sup>I]TZDM as the ligand, these novel stilbenes showed exceedingly high binding affinity (2-40 nM) to the TZ sites, while the affinity towards SB sites was very low (&gt;1,000 nM). It is evident that the stilbenes containing an electron donating groups, such as dimethylamino-, —OH or —OMe group, showed excellent binding affinity to Aβ aggregates. Benzothiazole ring appears to be unnecessary for binding at the TZ binding sites of Aβ aggregates. This information is of paramount importance because it reduces the molecular size (molecular weight of TZDM and 1 was 380 and 349, respectively) required for binding to the TZ sites; as such it significantly enhances the flexibility on designing new ligands. The idoinated stilbenes, such as 2 and 5, respresent a structural simplicity, which suggests minimum requirements for binding the Aβ aggregates may be three: 1) two benzene rings separated by a vinyl group. 2) one of the aromatic ring contains a electronic negative group, dimethylamino-, —OH or —OMe group. 3) there appears to be a bulk tolerance for substitution on the second aromatic ring. To characterize the compounds further, radioactive iodinated ligand, [<sup>125</sup>I]2, was prepared by converting the corresponding tributyltin derivative in the presence of Na[<sup>125</sup>I]I and hydrogen peroxide, by which the no-carrier added product was obtained in excellent yield (radiochemical purity&gt;95%). The direct binding assay showed that the new evaluation of postmortem AD brain sections with [<sup>125</sup>I]2 suggested that the novel ligand, as expected, labeled Aβ plaques.</p>
