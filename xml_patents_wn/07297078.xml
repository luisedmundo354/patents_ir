<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the mechanical arts. In particular, the invention relates to a training aid used by ball sports players to learn and/or improve batting, throwing, and pitching techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ball sports players have trained with the implements of their sports for centuries. For example, since the 1850's baseball players have used the wooden bats of their sport to practice batting balls thrown by a pitcher. Since the 1960's there has also been widespread use of pitching machines that emulate the pitcher. Similarly, pitchers and throwers have practiced by throwing a ball to a second person who returns the ball after each pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Ball player training therefore frequently relies the availability of a second person who pitches balls in the case of batter training, or returns balls in the case of pitcher and thrower training. In addition, either the second person or a third person will be required to observe batting or throwing technique that is unobservable to the player, that the player is unable to analyze for diagnostic purposes, or both. The opportunities for ball player training are therefore limited by the availability of a second person and the effectiveness of ball player training is limited by the availability of a person who provides diagnostic feedback to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Others have invented training aids for baseball batters that are aimed at solving some of these problems. For example, U.S. Pat. App. Publ. 2002/0055402 discloses a training bat having a handle, a shaft, and a graspable cylindrical sliding member mounted between stops on the training bat. When swung, the sliding member strikes one of the stops and produces a sound. But, this training bat fails to provide sufficient visual signals to the player, sufficient swing diagnostics, or a solution to the shock and shock related swing distortion and wear problems associated with the repetitive collisions between sliding and stationary parts.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Others have also invented training aids for throwing that are aimed at solving some of these problems. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,660 discloses a training aid for throwing sports balls having a hollow shaft with a hand grip affixed at one end. A ring encircling or a dowel within the shaft is free to move in response to a throw and to collide with a stop to produce a sound. But, this training thrower fails to provide ball release training and diagnostics nor does it provide a solution to the shock and shock related swing distortion and wear problems associated with the repetitive collisions of the ring or dowel with a stop.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there remains a need for ball sports training aids that provide sufficient visual signals and swing diagnostics to players in training. There remains a further need for ball sports training aids that provide ball release training and diagnostics for throwers. And, there remains a still further need for a solution to the shock and shock related swing distortion and wear problems associated with the repetitive collisions of contacting parts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention discloses a training aid for players of ball sports. In particular, the training aid is useful for teaching baseball and softball players proper swing mechanics. In an embodiment, the training aid has a relatively long shaft and is used for training batters. In another embodiment the training aid has a relatively short shaft and is used for training pitchers and throwers. These embodiments employ a ball assembly that slides along a distal portion of the shaft during a swing or a throw. The travel of the ball assembly is limited by a first retainer located near a handle end of the shaft and a second retainer located near a free-end of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The training aids provide visible and audible swing quality signals to the player. The use of a regulation or replica sports ball provides the player with a visual indication of correct swing timing. In addition, a distinct snap-like sound occurs when the ball assembly impacts the free-end retainer. The sound triggers the memory at impact and allows the user to see the correct timing of the swing. This combined proprioceptive input enhances the player's awareness of hand-eye coordination and timing while conditioning and training the specific muscles used for batting, pitching, and throwing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further advantage of the training aid that a damper is incorporated in the ball assembly to reduce the mechanical shock when the ball assembly collides with the free-end retainer. Coulomb damping resulting from friction between the ball and a damper tube inserted in the ball dissipates the energy of the collision resolving the shock and shock related swing distortion and wear problems associated with the repetitive collisions of contacting parts.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>show a training bat embodiment <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the present invention. The invention includes a shaft <b>102</b>, a first retainer <b>104</b>, a second retainer <b>106</b>, and a replica sports ball assembly <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shaft <b>102</b> of the training bat <b>100</b> has a handle end <b>110</b> and a free-end <b>112</b>. A handle section of the shaft <b>114</b> adjacent to the handle end provides space for the batter to hold the bat with two hands. While the batter may hold the bare shaft, some embodiments provide a grip <b>116</b> attached to the handle section for improving the batter's control of the bat. A knob <b>117</b> is preferably located at the handle end of the shaft to prevent the player's accidental release of the bat, In an embodiment, the shaft is a metallic tube. In some the embodiments the weight of the training bat and its weight distribution are similar to that of a regulation bat for baseball or for softball.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The ball assembly <b>108</b> is slidably engaged with the shaft <b>102</b>. The first ball assembly retainer <b>104</b> is located between the handle section <b>114</b> and the free-end <b>112</b> of the bat <b>100</b>. A second ball assembly retainer <b>106</b> is located near the free-end. The two retainers limit the sliding motion of the ball assembly to a region of the shaft located between the two retainers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the location of the first retainer <b>104</b> may be adjusted to select the length of travel of the ball assembly <b>108</b> during a swing and in some embodiments the second retainer <b>106</b> is replaceable for adjusting the weight at the free-end of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>show the parts of the ball assembly <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The ball assembly includes a light-weight replica sports ball <b>202</b> such as a replica sports ball such as a replica baseball or a replica softball and a damper tube <b>204</b> which is inserted in a hole in the sports ball.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The replica sports ball <b>202</b> has a through hole <b>206</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the hole has a substantially constant cross-sectional area defining a geometric centerline that is about coextensive with an axis x-x passing through the center of the ball. In some embodiments, the replica sports ball is a regulation baseball or softball with a through hole. And, in some embodiments the sports ball is made from one or more materials including a light weight core material such as cork (density of 100-300 kilograms/cubic-meter).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The damper tube has a flanged end <b>216</b>, a butt end <b>214</b>, and an inner surface <b>210</b>. The butt end is for striking a cup shaped surface <b>120</b> of the first retainer <b>104</b>. The flanged end is for striking an annular surface <b>118</b> of the second retainer <b>106</b> and for making an audible sound. In some embodiments one or both ends of the damper tube are butt ends and in some embodiments one or both ends of the damper tube are flanged ends. The damper tube is preferably made from a plastic material such as polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The outer surface of the damper tube <b>218</b> is in sliding contact or dampingly engaged with the side walls of the through hole <b>212</b> since the fit between the outer surface of the damper tube and the side walls of the through hole is an interference fit (gap shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>is for clarity). The amount of interference, material, and material surface properties determine the force required to overcome the related frictional forces tending to prevent the replica sports ball <b>202</b> from sliding along the damper tube <b>204</b>. In an embodiment, the damper tube and the through hole <b>206</b> have generally circular cross-sections.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, a suitable resilient material such as textiles including felts and piled materials or an elastomer including foams is interposed between the outer surface of the damper tube <b>218</b> and the side walls of the through hole <b>206</b>. Preferably, the resilient material is attached to the side walls of the through hole such that the damper tube <b>204</b> slides with respect to an adjacent surface of the resilient material which rubs against it. In an embodiment the resilient material is an elastomer such as an open-cell foam.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, an electronic signaling device <b>122</b> is mounted within the shaft <b>102</b> and/or within the second retainer <b>106</b> (as shown). The signaling device emits an audible sound in response to the flanged end of the damper tube <b>216</b> reaching the second retainer <b>106</b>. In an embodiment, an electronic sensing and signaling device provides swing diagnostics information including swing dynamics based on data acquired from sensors during the swing. Sensors used for this purpose include one or more of accelerometers for sensing relative motion and radio wave type locators including global positioning systems (GPS) and similar systems for obtaining position based on trilateration. Diagnostics are reported to the player and/or other persons using one or more of lighted indications and audible sounds emanating from the training aid and remote printers or video displays. In some embodiments the swing diagnostics are reported by a speech generator in signal communication with the electronic signaling device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the training bat embodiment of the invention <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>is used to train and/or improve a batter's swing. The batter handles the training bat in a manner that is similar to the way in which a regulation bat would be handled by a player. When a swing is made the ball assembly <b>108</b> moves from its rest against the first retainer <b>104</b>, along the shaft <b>102</b>, and impacts the second retainer <b>106</b> with an audible snap-like sound.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the ball assembly <b>108</b> is at rest against the first retainer <b>104</b>, the butt end of the damper tube <b>214</b> is about flush with the outer surface of the replica sports ball <b>222</b> and the flanged end of the damper tube <b>216</b> has its maximum projection <b>219</b> from the outer surface of the replica sports ball as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. When ball assembly <b>108</b> nears the free-end of the training bat <b>112</b>, the flanged end of the damper tube strikes the annular surface of the second retainer <b>118</b>. The mechanical shock of this collision and the associated undesirable wear of the colliding parts is reduced by Coulomb or frictional damping when the ball drags along the outer surface of the damper tube <b>208</b> and absorbs a portion of the energy/shock of the collision. Where electronic signaling devices <b>122</b> are mounted in the second retainer, the Coulomb damping of the ball assembly plays another important role in preserving the life of these electronic devices by reducing the mechanical shocks experienced during training.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the ball assembly <b>108</b> comes to rest against the second retainer, <b>106</b>, the butt end of the damper tube <b>214</b> has its maximum projection <b>220</b> from the outer surface of the replica sports ball <b>222</b> and the flanged end of the damper tube <b>216</b> is about flush with the outer surface of the replica sports ball as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. In preparation for another practice swing, the batter grasps the replica sports ball <b>202</b> and pulls the ball assembly <b>108</b> against the first retainer. This action forces the damper tube back through the replica sports ball such that the maximum projection of the flanged end of the damper tube <b>219</b> is restored.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, preparation for another swing requires only that the batter raise the training bat <b>100</b> to his shoulder to restore the damper tube's maximum projection <b>219</b>. Here, the act of raising the bat causes the ball assembly <b>108</b> to slide back toward the bat's handle end <b>114</b> causing the butt end of the damper tube <b>214</b> to strike the first retainer <b>104</b>. This collision causes the replica sports ball <b>202</b> to slide relative to the damper tube <b>204</b> until the butt end of the damper tube is about flush with the outer surface <b>222</b> of the replica sports ball <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The training bat provides a batter with at least three feedback signals from which to judge the quality of his swing. First, the “feel” of the swing informs the batter about the swing. Since the training bat uses a replica sports ball <b>202</b> rather than a weight, neither the swing dynamics nor the related player sensations are distorted when the replica sports ball slides along the length of the shaft <b>102</b> during the swing. Second, the replica sports ball is easily observed by the batter as the free-end of the training bat <b>112</b> passes in front of the batter. A correct swing is one in which the batter observes the replica sports ball reaching the second retainer of the bat just as the bat passes over a batter's plate. Third, the sound of the damper tube flange <b>212</b> striking the annular surface of the second retainer <b>118</b> provides a timed, audible indication of when the bat should be passing over the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>show a training thrower embodiment <b>300</b><i>a</i>, <b>300</b><i>b </i>of the present invention. The invention includes a shaft <b>302</b>, a first retainer <b>304</b>, a second retainer <b>306</b>, and a replica sports ball assembly <b>108</b>. Unless otherwise indicated, a reference to a player who is a pitcher also includes a player who is a thrower and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The shaft <b>302</b> of the training thrower <b>300</b> has a handle end <b>310</b> and a free-end <b>312</b>. A handle section of the shaft <b>314</b> adjacent to the handle end provides space for a pitcher to hold the training thrower with one hand. While the pitcher may hold the bare shaft, some embodiments provide a grip <b>316</b> attached to the handle section for improving the pitcher's control of the thrower.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ball assembly <b>108</b> is slidably engaged with the shaft <b>302</b>. A first ball assembly retainer <b>304</b> is located between the handle section <b>314</b> and the free-end <b>312</b> of the thrower <b>300</b>. A second ball assembly retainer <b>306</b> is located near the free-end. The two retainers limit the sliding motion of the ball assembly to a region of the shaft located between the two retainers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, the training thrower embodiment of the invention <b>300</b><i>a</i>, <b>300</b><i>b </i>is used to train and/or improve a pitcher's throw. The pitcher handles the training thrower in a manner that is similar to the way in which a regulation sports ball would be handled and practices throws. In particular, with one hand the pitcher clasps the handle section of the training thrower <b>314</b> against his palm using his small and index fingers. With the remaining fingers, the pitcher grasps the replica sports ball <b>202</b>. During practice throws, the pitcher releases the replica sports ball but not the handle. Once released, the ball assembly <b>108</b> moves from its rest against the first retainer <b>304</b>, along the shaft <b>302</b>, and impacts the second retainer <b>106</b> with an audible snap-like sound.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As in the case of the training bat <b>100</b> described above, after each throw the damper tube <b>204</b> is reset relative to the sports ball <b>202</b> when the pitcher grasps the replica sports ball <b>202</b> and pulls the ball assembly <b>108</b> against the first retainer <b>304</b> or in another embodiment when the act of raising the thrower <b>300</b> causes the ball assembly to collide with the first retainer <b>104</b> in a manner similar to that of the training bat discussed above. In addition, during throws the pitcher receives feedback signals from the thrower similar to those provided by the bat. These signals include the “feel” of the throw, the visible location of the replica sports ball on the shaft <b>302</b>, and the sound of the ball assembly striking the second retainer <b>318</b>. In some embodiments, electronic signaling and/or diagnostic devices <b>322</b> similar to those used in the bat may be incorporated in the thrower.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a workout assembly <b>400</b>. The workout assembly includes a strap <b>402</b> interconnecting a weight <b>406</b> and the training bat <b>100</b>. The strap is made of a flexible material including one or more of a fabric, plastic, or similar material. In an embodiment the strap is woven and includes nylon. The weight is made from a metallic or non-metallic material suitable for achieving the desired mass. In some embodiments the weight has a re-sealable cavity for receiving shot, sand, water, or another material to vary its mass.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Affixed near a first end of the strap <b>408</b> is a first connection <b>404</b> for engaging the weight <b>406</b>. In an embodiment, the first connection includes a means for releasably engaging the weight such as a spring clip (as shown). Affixed near a second end of the strap <b>410</b> is a second connection <b>504</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for engaging the grip <b>116</b> (as shown) or shaft <b>102</b> of the training bat. In an embodiment, the second connection includes a hook and loop fastener wherein a first hook and loop fastener portion <b>504</b> is attached to the strap and a mating hook and loop fastener portion <b>502</b> encircles the grip <b>116</b> near the first retainer <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross-sectional view <b>500</b> of the strap <b>402</b> and the training bat <b>100</b> prior to attachment of the strap to the training bat. Where a hook and loop fastener system is used, bringing the first hook and loop fastener portion of the strap <b>504</b> into contact with the mating hook and loop fastener portion of the training bat <b>502</b> releasably affixes the strap to the training bat. Attaching the weight <b>406</b> to the first end of the strap with the spring clip <b>404</b> or another suitable means completes assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross-sectional view <b>600</b> of the strap <b>402</b> and the training bat <b>100</b> during use. Here, the workout assembly <b>400</b> provides weight training of an athlete's hands, wrists, and forearms. This weight training is accomplished when the athlete grasps the training bat with both hands and rotates the training bat's shaft <b>102</b> in alternate directions. When rotated in a first direction <b>412</b>, the weight is raised <b>416</b> as the strap <b>402</b> is spooled <b>420</b> onto the training bat. When rotated in a second direction <b>414</b>, the weight is lowered <b>418</b> as the strap is de-spooled <b>420</b> from the training bat.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the length of the strap <b>402</b> can be varied to suit the physical attributes of the athlete. In addition, the mass of the weight <b>406</b> can be varied to suit the desired training regime.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
