<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to vehicle occupant safety restraint systems and devices. More specifically, this invention relates to seat belt restraint devices and in particular to buckle switches that sense whether a buckle is latched or unlatched and which provide appropriate signals for the various buckle latch states: buckled, unbuckled, short circuited, and open (damaged).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of seat belt buckle switches have been developed and are well known in the art. Traditionally, these devices provide a normally closed switch that may drive a courtesy light in the instrument panel and/or an audible sound that indicates to the driver that the seatbelt is not fastened. Many prior switches can be disabled or shorted out by inserting a foreign object, such as a nail file, a knife blade, or a key into the buckle, thereby causing the switch to erroneously signal that the buckle is buckled.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For general background material, the reader is directed to the following United States Patents, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for the material contained therein.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a diagram of the switch body of the preferred embodiment of this invention. The switch body <b>101</b> holds a first wire terminal <b>206</b><i>b </i>and a second wire terminal <b>206</b><i>a</i>. A first conductive path <b>103</b><i>a </i>electrically connects the first wire terminal <b>206</b><i>b </i>with a switching device <b>104</b>. The switching device <b>104</b>, in turn, is connected by a second conductive path <b>103</b><i>b </i>with a resistive circuit <b>105</b>. The resistive circuit <b>105</b> is then connected to the second wire terminal <b>206</b><i>a </i>via a third conductive path <b>103</b><i>c</i>. The switching device <b>104</b> is preferably comprised of a flexible metal member and a shorting pad, between which an air gap is maintained when the buckle is in an unbuckled state. When the buckle is buckled, the flexible metal member <b>104</b> is deflected bringing the flexible metal member and the shorting pad in direct electrical contact and thereby modifying the resistance of the circuit as measured at the first and second wire terminals <b>206</b><i>b,a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the preferred circuit diagram and output circuit of this invention. The preferred resistive circuit <b>105</b> is typically electrically connected to a control module <b>201</b>, which in an adaptive restraints application, monitors the switch resistance so that, in the event of a vehicle crash, the control module <b>201</b> can deploy other safety devices based on whether or not the occupant is belted, as determined from the resistance of the switch. The control module <b>201</b> may also use the measured resistance values from the switch to light courtesy lights in the vehicle to encourage the use of the seat belt. Electrically, typically and preferably, the control module connects to the resistive circuit <b>105</b> by the wire terminals schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as <b>206</b><i>a,b</i>. The dome switch <b>104</b> is shown schematically as a switch. The present preferred resistive circuit <b>105</b> itself comprises two resistors R<b>1</b><b>205</b> and R<b>2</b><b>204</b>, which are electrically in parallel when the dome switch <b>104</b> is closed and which have approximately equal resistance values. This preferred resistive circuit <b>105</b> provides four resistance determinative states. (1) A buckled state. When the latch plate/tongue is inserted in the buckle, the dome switch <b>104</b> is closed, thereby establishing an equivalent resistance R<sub>EQ </sub>due to the parallel combination of R<b>1</b><b>205</b> and R<b>2</b><b>204</b>. In the buckled state R<sub>EQ </sub>is non-zero, but relatively low. (2) The unbuckled state. When no latch plate/tongue is inserted in the switch, the dome switch <b>104</b> remains open, thereby establishing an equivalent resistance R<sub>EQ </sub>equal to R<b>1</b><b>205</b>. Therefore, in the unbuckled state R<sub>EQ </sub>is non-zero and relatively high. (3) Open Loop state. In the event that the resistive circuit or the switch is broken, the R<sub>EQ </sub>is expected to be equal to an open circuit, or approximately infinite. (4) Shorted switch condition. On occasion the switch may be shorted out, either intentionally by the user or unintentionally by accident. A shorted switch may defeat or impair the operation of the control module <b>201</b>. In a shorted switch condition the R<sub>EQ </sub>is equal to approximately zero. In sum, each condition, buckled, unbuckled, open and shorted, is detectable by the control module <b>201</b> by measuring the relative resistance of the resistive circuit <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a seat belt buckle <b>300</b> having the preferred switch of this invention. The buckle latch plate/tongue <b>305</b> being inserted into the buckle <b>300</b> causes the latch <b>306</b> to impose force on the flexible metal member <b>104</b>, thereby closing the circuit and indicating the buckling to the control module <b>201</b>. Two inserts <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> are shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. Insert <b>301</b> shows a detail perspective of the switch membrane <b>303</b> with the buckle tongue <b>305</b> not inserted and therefore, with the latch <b>306</b> out of contact with the dome switch <b>104</b>. Insert view <b>302</b> shows the latch <b>306</b> in contact with the dome switch <b>104</b> placing the flexible metal member in a deflected closed condition <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>4</b>(<i>e</i>) show a variety of views of the mechanical assembly drawings of the preferred embodiment of this invention. The detail of the switch body <b>101</b> is shown having placement <b>402</b><i>a,b </i>for the wire terminals <b>206</b><i>a,b</i>, as well as <b>404</b> for the switching device <b>104</b> and <b>401</b> for the insertion of the preferred resistive circuit <b>105</b>. View <b>405</b> shows additional detail of the conductive paths <b>103</b><i>a,b,c</i>. And, side views <b>402</b>, <b>406</b> show the side view depicting the dome switch <b>104</b>. Additional detailed mechanical dimensions are shown in view <b>407</b> of the switch body.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The described preferred embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not as restrictive. Although the embodiments shown here include specific component values, shapes and dimensions, the invention is not limited thereto. The scope of this invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes, which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims, are to be embraced as within their scope.</p>
