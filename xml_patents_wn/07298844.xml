<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a recording/reproducing apparatus in which illegal copying and illegal use of copy-generation managed data is prevented. Further, the present invention also relates to a method for moving data and a method for deleting data in which illegal copying and illegal use of copy-generation managed data is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, various digital recording/reproducing apparatuses have been developed and marketed. Among these digital recording/reproducing apparatuses, data can be copied without deteriorating the image quality and sound quality of the data. Thus, a digitalized, copyrighted production can be copied into a widespread, large capacity recording medium, such as a D-VCR, DVD-RAM, etc., with high image- and sound-qualities. By copying a production in such a way, illegally copied products called ‚Äúbootlegs‚Äù can be made. The illegally copied products can be readily distributed among the general public anonymously, and accordingly, the copyright of the production is violated. It is therefore necessary to prevent such illegally copied products in order to protect copyrights.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A known technique for preventing production of such an illegally copied product is described in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-16542. According to this technique, a predetermined ID bit for preventing illegal copying (a prohibition code of the CGMS (copy generation management system) standard) is superposed on an analog signal obtained by converting a digital signal recorded on an original recording medium. With such a superposed ID bit, illegal copying is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, even if the above technique described in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-16542 is employed, when data is transferred between apparatuses, a fraudulent party can steal the data from a data transfer path between the apparatuses so as to make an illegally copied product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A known technique for invalidating illegally copied data is described in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 11-39895. In this technique, digital data includes: an encrypted main part of the data; encrypted copy management information for managing permission/prohibition of copy for the main part of the data; and key information for decrypting the encrypted main part of the data. When the copy management information indicates that copying of the main part of the data is prohibited, decryption of the illegally copied, encrypted data is disabled by updating the key information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, even if the above technique described in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 11-39895 is employed, since the encrypted main part of the data and the key information used for decrypting the encrypted main part of the data are included in the same digital data, a fraudulent party can copy (harbor) the digital data in an external recording device or the like in a byte-by-byte manner before the key information is updated, so as to decrypt the illegally copied, encrypted main part of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, recently, movement of data which is stored in a large capacity recording device, such as a hard disc, to a highly-reliable medium, such as an optical disc for making a backup copy has been demanded.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general, data distributed by digital broadcasting is protected from being stored, but there is some data that can be stored for the sake of user's convenience only for a predetermined time period. There is a demand to surely delete such data such that a fraudulent party cannot illegally copy the data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a structure of a conventional video recording/reproducing apparatus <b>910</b>. The video recording/reproducing apparatus <b>910</b> includes: a data input section <b>900</b>; an encryption section <b>901</b>; a temporary storage section <b>902</b>; a data output section <b>903</b>; a decryption section <b>904</b>; a central processing unit (CPU) <b>905</b>; an input/output section <b>906</b>; a fixed storage device <b>907</b>; a read/write section <b>908</b>; and an information recording medium <b>909</b>. The CPU <b>905</b> controls the data input section <b>900</b>; the encryption section <b>901</b>; the temporary storage section <b>902</b>; the data output section <b>903</b>; the decryption section <b>904</b>; the input/output section <b>906</b>; and the read/write section <b>908</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The data input section <b>900</b> converts externally-input analog image data into digitally compressed image data. If copy generation management information attached to the compressed image data, which is input to the encryption section <b>901</b>, is free-content information indicating that the compressed data is a free content, the encryption section <b>901</b> does not perform an encryption process. If the copy generation management information indicates that production of a child copy (first generation copy) is permitted, the encryption section <b>901</b> changes the copy generation management information into copy prohibition information, and the compressed image data is encrypted and stored in the temporary storage section <b>902</b>. The temporary storage section <b>902</b> is a high speed memory, such as an SDRAM or the like. Since the above described sections work based on different data transfer rates, the temporary storage section <b>902</b> is used as buffer means for buffering the transfer rate difference among the sections. The decryption section <b>904</b> decrypts encrypted data and outputs the decrypted data to the data output section <b>903</b>. The data output section <b>903</b> converts the decrypted, digitally compressed image data into analog image data, and outputs the analog image data to an external apparatus. The input/output section <b>906</b> is a communication control means, such as IDE, SCSI, or the like, which controls data transfer to/from the fixed storage device <b>907</b>, such as a hard disc.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096">First, the principle of the present invention is described. As described above, an objective of the present invention is to prevent illegal copying and invalidate illegally copied data. To this end, data is appropriately controlled before and after movement of data. In the present specification, ‚Äúdata‚Äù may be a predetermined unit amount of data, such as a music program including a moving image, a television program, music data, image data, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows a recording/reproducing apparatus <b>5000</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for clearly explaining the principle of the present invention, the components of an actual recording/reproducing apparatus are shown in simplified forms.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">The recording/reproducing apparatus <b>5000</b> includes: a first storage section <b>5001</b>; a special information holding section <b>5002</b>; and a controller (CPU: central processing unit) <b>5003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">The first storage section <b>5001</b> encrypts externally-input data and stores data structure information including the encrypted data. The special information holding section <b>5002</b> holds special information which is associated with the data structure information. The controller <b>5003</b> controls the first storage section <b>5001</b> and the special information holding section <b>5002</b>. A second storage section <b>5004</b> is externally connected to the recording/reproducing apparatus <b>5000</b> such that the second storage section <b>5004</b> is controlled by the controller <b>5003</b>. However, the second storage section <b>5004</b> may be incorporated in the recording/reproducing apparatus <b>5000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">According to the above structure, the data structure information and the special information are stored separately, while the data structure information and the special information can be controlled so as to be associated with each other. As a result, the encrypted data of the data structure information cannot be solely encrypted. Therefore, the data structure information can be more securely stored.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the data structure information and the special information before and after a data movement operation in the recording/reproducing apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for simplicity of illustration, only the data structure information stored in the first storage section <b>5001</b> and the special information held in the special information holding section <b>5002</b> of the recording/reproducing apparatus <b>5000</b> are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">At pre-movement state, i.e., State (I), the data structure information includes: a management region <b>6001</b> for storing management information A, such as address, data size of stored data and use status of the first storage section; and an object region <b>6002</b> for storing encrypted data O. The encrypted data O includes data P<b>1</b>. The special information holding section <b>5002</b> holds special information S. The special information S is associated with the management information A and/or the encrypted data O.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">After the data P<b>1</b> in the object region <b>6002</b> has been moved to the second storage section <b>5004</b>, the data P<b>1</b> is deleted from the object region <b>6002</b>, and the special information S is then updated to special information S‚Ä≤. In response to the update of the special information S, data O is updated to data O‚Ä≤, and the management information A is updated to management information A‚Ä≤. Alternatively, in response to the update of data O and the management information A, the special information S may be updated to special information S‚Ä≤.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">When the controller <b>5003</b> controls the first storage section <b>5001</b> and the special information holding section <b>5002</b> in the above described manner, the special information held in the special information holding section <b>5002</b>, which is obtained after the data movement operation, mismatches with (i.e., differs from) the special information held in the section <b>5002</b> which is obtained before the data movement operation. In such a case, even if the data structure information <b>6000</b> stored in the first storage section <b>5001</b> at the pre-movement state, i.e., State (I), is harbored into a personal computer including a separate hard disk, or the like, and then returned to the first storage section <b>5001</b> at the post-movement state, i.e., State (II), the special information S, which is associated with the data structure information <b>6000</b> at State (I), is no longer present in the recording/reproducing apparatus <b>5000</b> at State (II). As a result, the returned data of the data structure information <b>6000</b> is invalid at State (II).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. In the following sections of the present specification, an encryption operation is exemplified for describing the embodiments of the present invention. Data to be encrypted (data x) and encrypted data (data x‚Ä≤) has the following relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Ey</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>x‚Ä≤</i>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Dy</i>(<i>x</i>‚Ä≤)=<i>Dy</i>(<i>Ey</i>(<i>x</i>))=<i>x</i>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where y represents a key used for encryption or decryption. E(t) represents an encryption operation. D(t) represents a decryption operation. Expression (1) means that data x is encrypted using key y so as to obtain data x‚Ä≤. Expression (2) means that the encrypted data x‚Ä≤ is decrypted using key y so as to obtain data x.

<p id="p-0101" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a structure of a recording/reproducing apparatus <b>114</b> of the present invention. The recording/reproducing apparatus <b>114</b> includes: a first storage section <b>111</b>; a special information holding section <b>110</b>; a controller <b>105</b>; an analog/digital input/output section <b>112</b>; and a second storage section <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">The analog/digital input/output section <b>112</b> includes an input section <b>100</b> and an output section <b>103</b>. The input section <b>100</b> converts externally-input analog data into digitally compressed data. The output section <b>103</b> converts the digitally compressed data into analog data.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">The first storage section <b>111</b> includes an encryption section <b>101</b>; a temporary storage section <b>102</b>; a decryption section <b>104</b>; an input/output section <b>106</b>; and a fixed storage device <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">If copy generation management information attached to data is free-content information, the encryption section <b>101</b> does not perform an encryption process. If the copy generation management information is information indicating that production of a child copy (first generation copy) is permitted, or information that permits storage of data for a predetermined time period, the encryption section <b>101</b> changes the copy generation management information into copy prohibition information, and the data is encrypted and stored in the temporary storage section <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">The temporary storage section <b>102</b> is a high speed memory, such as an SDRAM or the like. Since the above described sections work based on different data transfer rates, the temporary storage section <b>102</b> is used as buffer means for buffering the transfer rate difference among the sections.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">The decryption section <b>104</b> decrypts the encrypted data and outputs the decrypted data to the data output section <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0112">The input/output section <b>106</b> is a communication control means, such as IDE, SCSI, or the like, which controls data transfer to/from the fixed storage device <b>107</b>, such as a hard disc.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0113">The special information holding section <b>110</b> holds special information which is associated with data stored in the fixed storage device <b>107</b>. The special information holding section <b>110</b> cannot be accessed by an external device which is present outside the recording/reproducing apparatus <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">The second storage section <b>113</b> includes a read/write section <b>108</b> and an information recording medium <b>109</b>. The information recording medium <b>109</b> may be a portable optical disc, such as a DVD-RAM or the like, a hard disc, etc. The read/write section <b>108</b> writes data in and/or reads data from the information recording medium <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0115">The controller <b>105</b> controls the first storage section <b>111</b>, the special information holding section <b>110</b>, and the second storage section <b>113</b>. The controller <b>105</b> may be a central processing unit (CPU).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows data structure information where data (programs) P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are stored in a hard disc <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0117">Next, a recording operation of the recording/reproducing apparatus <b>114</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0118">The input section <b>100</b> externally receives a predetermined amount of analog image unit data P<b>1</b> (e.g., program P<b>1</b>), such as a broadcast wave or the like, and digitally compresses the analog image data P<b>1</b> based on MPEG. The compressed image data P<b>1</b> is transferred to the encryption section <b>101</b>. If the copy generation management information attached to the compressed image data P<b>1</b> is the copy prohibition information, the encryption section <b>101</b> is controlled by the controller <b>105</b> so as to stop a recording operation. If the copy generation management information is information which permits making a first generation copy, or information that permits storage of data for a predetermined time period, the encryption section <b>101</b> changes the copy generation management information into copy prohibition information, and encrypts the compressed image data P<b>1</b> using a title key Dk<b>1</b> which includes information inherent to the fixed storage device <b>107</b> and which corresponds to the predetermined unit amount of data P<b>1</b>. The encrypted data (EDk<b>1</b>(P<b>1</b>)) is transferred to the temporary storage section <b>102</b>. If copy generation management information is free-content information, the encryption section <b>101</b> does not perform an encryption process and transfers the compressed image data P<b>1</b> as it is to the temporary storage section <b>102</b>. In the following description, assume that the copy generation management information attached to the input data P<b>1</b> is information which permits making a first generation copy, or information that permits storage of data for a predetermined time period. The data EDk<b>1</b>(P<b>1</b>) stored in the temporary storage section <b>102</b> is moved to, and stored in, the fixed storage device <b>107</b> through the input/output section <b>106</b>. Specifically in this example, the encrypted data EDk<b>1</b>(P<b>1</b>) is stored in the fixed storage device <b>107</b> as an encrypted program <b>206</b> within an object region <b>202</b> of data structure information <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">Management information, such as a data storage position which is used for reading the encrypted program <b>206</b> from the object region <b>202</b>, a data size, and the use status of the fixed storage device <b>107</b>, are stored in a management region <b>201</b> within the data structure information <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0120">The management region <b>201</b> includes a data management region <b>204</b> and a use status management region <b>205</b>. The data management region <b>204</b> stores a data storage position and a data size. The use status management region <b>205</b> stores the use status of the object region <b>202</b> (e.g., unused capacity of the object region <b>202</b>). The management information in the management region <b>201</b> is updated every time data comes to the object region <b>202</b> and is stored therein.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0121">The title key Dk<b>1</b>, which is necessary for decrypting the encrypted program <b>206</b> in a reproduction operation, is encrypted using a system key Ds. The encrypted title key EDs(Dk<b>1</b>) is stored in an encryption region <b>203</b> within the data structure information <b>210</b>. The system key Da used for encrypting the title key Dk<b>1</b> is stored in the special information holding section <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">When another data P<b>2</b> is stored subsequently to the data P<b>1</b>, the data P<b>2</b> is encrypted using a title key Dk<b>2</b> which corresponds to the data P<b>2</b>, and stored as the encrypted program EDk<b>2</b>(P<b>2</b>) in the object region <b>202</b> where the data PI has been stored. When the data P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are stored in the object region <b>202</b>, all of the data stored in the encryption region <b>203</b> (in this example, the encrypted title key EDs(Dk<b>1</b>)) are read out and decrypted using the system key Ds held in the special information holding section <b>110</b>. After the decryption has been completed, the system key Ds is updated to system key Ds‚Ä≤. Then, the updated system key Ds' is used to encrypt the title keys Dk<b>1</b> and Dk<b>2</b>. The encrypted title keys EDs‚Ä≤ (Dk<b>1</b>) and EDs‚Ä≤ (Dk<b>2</b>) are stored in the encryption region <b>203</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">A reproduction operation for reproducing data recorded in such a way is substantially the same as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the special information held in the special information holding section <b>110</b> is used. Therefore, the description of the reproduction operation is herein omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0124">As described above, a title key which is used for decrypting encrypted data stored in the fixed storage device <b>107</b> (the hard disc <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is encrypted by using a system key held in the special information holding section <b>110</b> which is separately provided from the fixed storage device <b>107</b>. With such an arrangement, it is impossible to obtain reproducible data only with data stored in the fixed storage device <b>107</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0239" num="0301">If ‚Äúnot identical‚Äù at step <b>1703</b> or step <b>1706</b>, it is determined that an illegal processing has been performed, and an access by the controller <b>105</b> to the hard disc <b>200</b> is restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0302">According to embodiment 6, it is determined whether or not the value of the first check code S<b>0</b> held in the special information holding section <b>110</b> at the start-up of the recording/reproducing apparatus is identical to the value of the first check code S<b>0</b> calculated based on the management information and/or whether or not the value of the second check code S<b>1</b> held in the special information holding section <b>110</b> is identical to the value of the second check code S<b>1</b> calculated based on the encrypted title key. If not identical, it is determined that a fraudulent party conducted an illegal activity, and an access by the controller <b>105</b> to the hard disc <b>200</b> is restricted. On the other hand, a penalty can be imposed on the fraudulent party. For example, the fraudulent party is compelled to re-format data; an access by the fraudulent party is ignored by the recording/reproducing apparatus; or the fraudulent party is compelled to initialize the encryption region. According the present invention, such a penalty may be realized by any means which can bring some disbenefits to a fraudulent party in retaliation for his illegal data processing.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0303">A recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention includes: a first storage section for storing data structure information which includes encrypted data; a special information holding section for holding special information associated with the data structure information; and a controller for controlling the first storage section and the special information holding section. The data structure information and the special information are associated with each other such that the special information is updated in response to an update of the data structure information, or such that the data structure information is updated in response to an update of the special information. With such an arrangement, the data structure information and the special information are stored separately, while the data structure information and the special information can be controlled so as to be associated with each other. As a result, the encrypted data of the data structure information cannot be solely encrypted. Therefore, the data structure information can be more securely stored.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0304">Furthermore, in the recording/reproducing apparatus of the present invention, the control section controls movement of the encrypted data from the first storage section to a second storage section; and the control section updates the special information held in the special information holding section such that a mismatch occurs between the special information obtained before the movement of the encrypted data from the first storage section to the second storage section and the special information obtained after the movement of the encrypted data from the first storage section to the second storage section. With such an arrangement, the special information which is necessary for decrypting the encrypted data can be different between before and after the movement of the encrypted data from the first storage section to the second storage section. As a result, illegally copied data becomes useless by itself, and production of a plurality of illegal copies becomes impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0305">Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed.</p>
