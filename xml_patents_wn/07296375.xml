<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a launching cup, and particularly to a shotgun launching cup.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Muzzle launched projectiles have been in use for over a century. When launching a projectile from the muzzle of a firearm, such as a rifle or shotgun, a launching cup is attached to the muzzle of the firearm, the projectile is placed in the launching cup, and a blank round is used to launch the projectile. This method of launching projectiles provides advantages in terms of range and accuracy over hand-thrown counterparts and requires only a conventional firearm instead of a specialized launcher. Projectiles which can be launched by means of a launcher cup include, but are not limited to: flash grenades, concussion grenades, nets, noise generators, stun balls, tire puncturing elements, electromagnetic pulse generators, mines or bomblets, listening devices, signal emitting devices, and unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a conventional launching cup, both attached to a rifle and alone. These drawings are taken from the U.S. Navy's Nonresident Training Course (NRTC) Manual for Gunner's Mate 1 &amp; C (Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center, NAVEDTRA 14110; published 1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a conventional launching cup consists of a cylindrical steel tube approximately 8.5 inches long and 2.75 inches in diameter at the connecting end, or adapter portion, which fits over the muzzle of the firearm. The launcher is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> attached to a M14 rifle, with a projectile in front of the bell or cup portion of the launcher in which the projectile is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The launching cup in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> uses a wire loop, a latch, and a safety retaining pin to attach itself to the firearm, which, in this particular case, is an M14 rifle. When this particular launching cup is used, the adapter portion fits over the flash suppressor of the M14 rifle, and the wire loop fits over the rifle's bayonet lug, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In order to lock the launching cup onto the rifle, the safety retaining pin (attached by a lanyard to the cup so it will not be lost) fits through the latch.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although this type of attachment system is acceptable in most cases, problems may occur in situations of real danger or combat. For example, if the launching cup is being used to fire tear gas grenades at an approaching crowd, and then the crowd charges, there may be a need to fire live rounds from the rifle without removing the launching bell. However, most launching cup attachment systems are not reliable when live rounds are being fired. The vibrations caused by the firing of live rounds can shake the launching cup off the end of the firearm's muzzle, thus putting the user at risk.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Because of this, there is a need for a launching cup attachment system which is capable of remaining firmly locked into position while the firearm is being used to fire live rounds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One object of the present invention is to provide a launching cup attachment system which is capable of remaining firmly locked into position while the firearm is being used to fire live rounds.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This and other objects are accomplished by the present invention which provides a system and method of attaching a launching cup to a firearm in such a manner that the firing of live rounds will not cause the launching cup to shake loose. The presently preferred embodiments of the present invention use a portion of the firearm to obstruct the movement of a safety pin once the safety pin is locked in place within the launching bell. In particular, a ball-lock T-pin is engaged in a portion of the launcher cup behind the magazine tube ring support of the shotgun, which prevents the launcher cup from being shaken, or otherwise falling off, the muzzle of the shotgun.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings; whereas the various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of the disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, and specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to the drawing and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The presently preferred embodiments of the present invention are in the form of a launching cup for a shotgun, in particular, a Mossberg M500 shotgun, but the invention itself may be applied to a variety of firearms, including hand-held and shoulder weapons, weapons with rifled barrels, and weapons with smooth-bore barrels. In the preferred embodiment, the launching cup has a horseshoe-shaped segment at the end of an adapter portion. The horseshoe-shaped segment has a right and a left extension, and there are symmetrical matching holes in the ends of each extension. The matching holes in the horseshoe-shaped segment are for engaging a ball-lock safety pin. Once the ball-lock safety pin is slid through the matching holes in the horseshoe-shaped segment, protrusions on the distal end of the ball-lock safety pin are extended, thus locking the ball-lock safety pin in place within the matching holes of the horseshoe-shaped segment. Once locked into place, the ball-lock safety pin will not allow the launching cup to vibrate or otherwise shake off of the end of the shotgun muzzle, because the ball-lock safety pin can not slide past the magazine tube ring support of the shotgun, as will be described in greater detail below and shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The three basic parts are shown: the bell or cup portion <b>310</b>, the adapter portion <b>320</b>, and the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>. Only one side of horseshoe segment <b>330</b> with its single symmetrical hole <b>331</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Ball-lock safety pin (or “T-pin”) <b>340</b> is not inserted into the hole <b>331</b> of the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>, but remains attached to the launching cup <b>300</b> by lanyard <b>350</b>. When the button <b>342</b> on the end of the ball-lock safety pin <b>340</b> is pressed, the protrusions at the distal end <b>346</b> retract, thus allowing one to insert the distal end <b>346</b> into and through hole <b>331</b> in the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a right-hand side view of the first preferred embodiment when it is attached to, but not locked onto, a shotgun <b>400</b>. The adapter portion <b>320</b> has been slid onto the muzzle of shotgun <b>400</b> and the horseshoe segment <b>330</b> encircles the end of the magazine tube <b>410</b> of the shotgun. Although not seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref>, a small length of metal, the magazine tube ring support, connects the barrel <b>420</b> and the magazine tube <b>410</b> of the shotgun <b>400</b>. The magazine tube ring support in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> is hidden under the horseshoe segment <b>330</b> of the launching cup <b>300</b>; it is located to the right of hole <b>331</b> in the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>. The magazine tube ring support of a shotgun can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> described below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a right-hand side view of the first preferred embodiment when it is attached and locked onto the shotgun. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the ball-lock safety pin <b>340</b> has been inserted through both holes in the horseshoe segment <b>330</b> of the launching cup <b>300</b>, thereby locking the launching cup <b>300</b> on the muzzle, and barrel <b>420</b> of shotgun <b>400</b>. In order to insert the ball-lock safety pin <b>340</b> through the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>, the button <b>342</b> on the ball-lock safety pin <b>340</b> is pressed causing the protrusions at the distal end <b>346</b> of the safety pin <b>340</b> to retract. With the protrusions retracted, it is possible for the distal end <b>346</b> of the safety pin <b>340</b> to pass through both holes in the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>. Once the distal end <b>346</b> has exited out the other side of the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>, the button <b>342</b> is released, and the protrusions pop back out. The protrusions, when extended, do not allow the distal end <b>346</b> of the safety pin <b>340</b> to fit through the holes in the horseshoe segment <b>330</b>, thereby holding the safety pin <b>340</b> in place. The magazine support (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref>) connecting the barrel <b>420</b> and magazine tube <b>410</b> of shotgun <b>400</b> is located to the right of the engaged safety pin in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B-4C</figref>. Because the safety pin <b>346</b> when engaged in horseshoe section <b>330</b> cannot move past the magazine tube ring support, the launching bell <b>300</b> cannot slide, vibrate, or otherwise fall off of the muzzle of shotgun <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a top view of the first preferred embodiment when attached and locked to shotgun <b>400</b>. Both ends of safety pin <b>340</b> can be seen on either side of the shotgun in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Furthermore, the first preferred embodiment seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> has a open groove extending along the top of the adapter portion <b>320</b> of the launching cup <b>300</b>. The open groove is for the sight on the end of the shotgun barrel, and ensures that the launching cup is positioned correctly on the shotgun. In the first preferred embodiment, a sight is constructed on the appropriate section of the launching cup to aid in aiming the muzzle-launched projectile.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a view from the other side of the shotgun of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention (i.e., on the opposite side from the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>). The distal end <b>346</b> of the ball lock <b>340</b> can be seen sticking out of the hole in the horseshoe section <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> show a launcher cup according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. The launcher cup <b>500</b> according to the second preferred embodiment has a longer adapter section <b>520</b> than the adapter section <b>320</b> of the launcher cup <b>300</b> according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The adapter section <b>320</b> or <b>520</b> according to the first and second embodiments must change in length so that the holes in horseshoe segment <b>330</b> or <b>530</b> will be located on the other side of the magazine tube ring support when the launcher cup <b>300</b> or <b>500</b> is fully engaged on the barrel of the shotgun, thereby ensuring that ball lock pin <b>340</b> will securely lock the launcher cup <b>300</b> or <b>500</b> to the shotgun. Magazine tube ring support <b>650</b> of shotgun <b>600</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref> have good close-up views of the horseshoe segment <b>530</b> of the second preferred embodiment, as well as the groove that runs along the top of the adapter portion <b>520</b> of the launching cup <b>500</b> (and through horseshoe segment <b>530</b>). The sight on the barrel of the shotgun rides in the groove when launcher cup <b>500</b> is being slid onto the barrel of the shotgun. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the T-pin <b>540</b> inserted into the hole on one side of horseshoe segment <b>530</b>, but not pushed all the way through to the hole on the other side of horseshoe segment <b>530</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows T-pin <b>540</b> fully inserted through horseshoe section <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> show launcher cup <b>500</b> sliding, and then locked, onto shotgun <b>600</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, magazine tube ring support <b>650</b> can be seen on the far right of the drawing. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, it can be seen that horseshoe section <b>530</b> is located on the other side of magazine tube ring support <b>650</b>, thereby locking launcher cup <b>500</b> to the muzzle of shotgun <b>600</b> by having T-pin <b>540</b> engaged in both holes of horseshoe segment <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to presently preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the substances, constructions, and orientations illustrated and described, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, although a ball-lock safety pin, or T-pin, was used in the presently preferred embodiments, any type of locking, attaching, securing, and/or latching means could be used to secure the launcher cup to the magazine tube ring support of the shotgun (or other type of firearm) in accordance with the present invention. As another example, sections that are shaped differently than the horseshoe shaped section of the presently preferred embodiments could be used with the locking/securing means to secure the launcher cup to the firearm. As yet another example, a portion of the launching cup itself could be used to prevent the launching cup from moving, instead of inserting a pin.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover, it should be recognized that structures and/or elements shown and/or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto.</p>
