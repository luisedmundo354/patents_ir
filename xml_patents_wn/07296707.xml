<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to dispensing precise quantities of a hot-melt adhesive in exact locations on an object. In particular, the invention relates to a compact unit including an adhesive feed assembly and a positive displacement dispenser mounted closely together by an inlet block, which unit is mounted on a two or three-dimensional motion system and is connected to a control unit which maintains the temperature of the adhesive at critical levels as it moves through the unit and dispensed onto the object.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The dispensing of extremely small amounts or shots of flowable materials at a precise location in a rapid and controlled manner presents a challenge to those in the dispensing art due to the viscosity of the materials and the extremely small amounts that must be precisely delivered at a precise location on an object. This is especially critical where the adhesive is a hot-melt moisture cured adhesive which is extremely temperature sensitive, and once heated, remains in a stable state for only a certain duration of time, thereby requiring it to be maintained at a certain temperature and dispensed within that time period to prevent the adhesive curing within the dispensing equipment, requiring expensive and time consuming cleaning of the dispensing equipment and disposal of the remaining adhesive, which increase the manufacturing costs of the objects onto which the adhesive is being dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various types of positive displacement dispensers, such as shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,350,084 and 5,458,275, provide for positive displacement of adhesives. However, the adhesives used in these types of machines are not always temperature critical nor are they supplied in cartridges, and thus are not concerned with the problem of maintaining a critical temperature of the adhesive being dispensed from the supply adhesive in a replaceable cartridge through the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other devices, such as distributed by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company under their Trademark JET WELD provide a dispenser which maintains an adhesive contained within a cartridge at a certain temperature to prevent premature curing thereof. However, these dispensing systems do not accurately control and dispense extremely precise amounts of the adhesive as does a positive displacement dispenser, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, it is desirable for many repetitive tasks to mount the dispenser and adhesive supply on a motion control system for repetitive uniform motion of the dispenser for accurately and repeatedly dispensing the adhesive on the objects as they move into position adjacent the control system, while maintaining the constant uninterrupted flow of the adhesive, wherein the temperature is maintained at precise levels throughout the system, and which enables the assembly line-type production to be continuously maintained with very little down time.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These problems are difficult to overcome with the available mechanisms currently in use today for dispensing certain types of temperature sensitive adhesives, and in particular a hot-melt adhesive which is moisture cured relatively quickly after being exposed to the atmosphere, and when used with an adhesive having a relatively short life once heated to a desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the need exists for a system, method, and apparatus for accurately dispensing small amounts of a hot-melt adhesive which cures within a limited time period after being heated and exposed to the atmosphere, in a compact, highly efficient and reliable apparatus and method of dispensing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One aspect of the present invention is to provide a compact unit for containing a supply of a heated adhesive, such as a hot-melt moisture cured adhesive, which is fed to a positive displacement dispenser through an inlet block, both of which are provided with heaters for maintaining the adhesive at desired levels.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another aspect of the invention is to supply the cartridges containing the adhesive in a preheated state prior to inserting the cartridge into an adhesive feed assembly, thereby maintaining a constant supply of heated adhesive to the dispenser, reducing down time of the unit and interruption of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A still further feature of the invention is to insulate the adhesive feed assembly housing, inlet block and positive displacement dispenser to reduce the escape of heat therefrom so that the heat which is applied to the adhesive maintains the adhesive at its critical temperature throughout the unit from the supply cartridge until it exits a dispensing needle onto an object.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another feature of the invention is to provide a quick disconnect which enables the spent adhesive cartridge to be replaced quickly and easily with a preheated filled cartridge, with the adhesive being at a desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another aspect of the invention is to provide a control unit connected to the various components of the system to provide precise control thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further feature of the invention is to mount the compact unit on a two or three-dimensional motion control system which will repeatedly and accurately move the unit, and in particular the dispensing needle thereof, over an object whereupon the heated adhesive is dispensed at a precise location and in the correct amount on the object receiving the adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These features and advantages are achieved by the apparatus of the present invention which comprises a positive displacement dispenser for dispensing precise quantities of the hot-melt adhesive on an object, a feed assembly adapted to contain a cartridge of the adhesive to be dispensed by the dispenser, the feed assembly including a heater for heating the adhesive, an inlet block for mounting the feed assembly on the dispenser, the inlet block including a fluid passage for conveying the adhesive from the feed assembly into the dispenser and a heater for heating the adhesive as it is conveyed through said passage, and a control unit operatively connected to the dispenser, feed assembly and inlet block for maintaining the adhesive at a predetermined temperature in the feed assembly and inlet block, and for moving the adhesive from the feed assembly through the inlet block for subsequent dispensing from the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These features and advantages are further achieved by the improved method of the present invention, the general nature of which may include the steps of preheating a cartridge containing the adhesive to a first temperature, placing the preheated cartridge into a feed assembly, heating the adhesive to a second temperature in the feed assembly, moving the adhesive from the cartridge through an inlet block and into a positive displacement dispenser, heating the adhesive moving through the inlet block to a third level, and dispensing the heated adhesive from the dispenser onto an object.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The apparatus of the present invention which is in the form of a compact dispensing unit is indicated generally at <b>1</b>, and is shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>. Unit <b>1</b> includes as its main components an adhesive feed assembly <b>2</b>, an inlet block <b>3</b>, a positive displacement adhesive dispenser <b>4</b>, and a control unit <b>5</b>. Unit <b>1</b> preferably is mounted on a programmable, two or three-dimensional motion control unit <b>6</b> for depositing a dot, bead, or a strip of an adhesive <b>7</b> precisely on an object <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Adhesive feed assembly <b>2</b> is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and includes a housing indicated generally at <b>10</b>, which contains a hollow sleeve <b>11</b> adapted to slidably receive a cartridge <b>13</b> therein, containing a supply of a hot-melt adhesive <b>15</b>. An end cap <b>17</b> is mounted on the top of housing <b>10</b> and has a coupling <b>18</b> for receiving an air supply line <b>19</b> for supplying a positive air pressure to a piston <b>21</b> located within the interior of cartridge <b>13</b> for moving in the direction of arrow A, for discharging adhesive <b>15</b> from the cartridge into and through inlet block <b>3</b>. A remote pressurized air source <b>20</b> is connected to line <b>19</b> and is controlled by a conductor <b>23</b> connected to control unit <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with one of the features of the invention, one or more electric resistance heating elements <b>25</b> surround cartridge sleeve <b>11</b> for heating adhesive <b>15</b> contained therein to a predetermined level. Heating elements <b>25</b> are connected by one or more conductors <b>26</b> to control unit <b>5</b>. A thermocouple <b>28</b> is in communication with sleeve <b>11</b> and is connected by a conductor <b>29</b> to control unit <b>5</b> for measuring the temperature of adhesive <b>15</b> to maintain it at a desired level. Housing <b>10</b> preferably is encased in insulation panels <b>31</b> to assist in retaining adhesive <b>15</b> at the desired temperature when heated by heating elements <b>25</b>. Insulation <b>31</b> can be various types of insulation, one type of which is sold by General Electric Company under the trademark ULTEM.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with another feature of the invention, adhesive feed assembly <b>2</b> is connected directly to dispenser <b>4</b> by inlet block <b>3</b>. Block <b>3</b> is L-shaped and includes a first or upper section formed with an inlet passage <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in which is mounted a valve assembly <b>34</b> which receives the outlet end of cartridge <b>13</b>. Valve assembly <b>34</b> extends throughout a portion of inlet passage <b>33</b> and terminates in a discharge outlet <b>36</b>. An adhesive passage <b>37</b> extends through a second or lower section of block <b>3</b> and communicates with a lower end <b>38</b> of inlet passage <b>33</b> and extends generally at a right angle thereto. Thus, the material discharged from cartridge <b>13</b> passes through inlet block <b>3</b> and into dispenser <b>4</b>. Inlet block <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) preferably is formed of metal such as aluminum, and is covered with insulating panels <b>39</b>, similar to panels <b>31</b> of housing <b>10</b> to reduce heat loss from the heated adhesive moving through the block.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A heater tube <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is mounted within a passage <b>42</b> formed at least partially through the lower section of block <b>3</b> and is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by a conductor <b>43</b>. A thermocouple <b>45</b> is mounted within a passage <b>47</b> formed at least partially through the lower section of block <b>3</b>, adjacent and parallel with heater tube <b>40</b>, and is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by a conductor <b>48</b>. Alignment pins <b>49</b> and <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) extend outwardly from the upper and lower sections of L-shaped block <b>3</b> for engagement within corresponding holes (not shown) formed in the bottom of housing <b>10</b> and dispenser <b>4</b> in order to properly align the adhesive passageways formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One type of positive displacement dispenser <b>4</b> for use in unit <b>1</b> can be of the type sold by Liquid Control Corporation of North Canton, Ohio as model number 1053 under the trademark DISPENSIT. It includes a main housing <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) containing a lead screw <b>52</b> which extends through a retaining ring <b>53</b>. Screw <b>52</b> is connected to a metering rod connector <b>54</b> which moves along a pair of rods <b>55</b> when lead screw <b>52</b> is rotated by a motor <b>56</b> mounted on the top of housing <b>51</b>. Motor <b>56</b> preferably is an electric motor and is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by one or more conductors <b>58</b>. A dispensing rod <b>60</b> is connected to connector <b>54</b> and extends through a seal cup <b>61</b> into a metering channel <b>62</b>. Channel <b>62</b> is formed in a sleeve <b>64</b> which is mounted within a block <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with the invention, a heating device, such as a heater tube <b>67</b> is connected with block <b>66</b> for maintaining metering channel <b>62</b>, and in particular the adhesive contained therein, at a predetermined level. Heater tube <b>67</b> is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by a conductor <b>68</b>. A thermocouple <b>70</b> is mounted in block <b>66</b> and is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by a conductor <b>71</b>. Thus, this enables the temperature of the control block and correspondingly of the adhesive contained within metering channel <b>62</b>, to be determined and accurately maintained by thermocouple <b>70</b> and heater tube <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Metering channel <b>62</b> communicates with a reciprocal metering spool <b>72</b> through an inlet opening <b>77</b> formed therein. Spool <b>72</b> is reciprocated between feed and discharge positions by a pair of pneumatic actuated pistons <b>73</b> located within cylinders <b>74</b>, which are connected by air lines <b>75</b> to a source of compressed air, which in turn is connected to control unit <b>5</b>. Spool <b>72</b> passes accurately metered measured amounts of adhesive for subsequent discharge through a discharge needle <b>78</b>. The operation of dispenser <b>4</b> is similar to that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,350,084 and 5,458,275, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, and thus is not described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Block <b>66</b> is enclosed within insulating panels <b>80</b> to assist in maintaining the temperature of the adhesive within metering channel <b>62</b> and spool <b>72</b> at desired levels. Heater tube <b>67</b> and thermocouple <b>70</b> maintain and control the temperature of the adhesive within metering chamber <b>62</b>, and correspondingly within measuring spool <b>72</b> and discharge needle <b>78</b> by the heat transferred from heated block <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In further accordance with the invention, unit <b>1</b> is mounted on a two or three-dimensional motion control system <b>6</b> which is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by one or more conductors <b>82</b>. Motion control unit <b>6</b> can be one of various types of robotic-type devices well known in the manufacturing industry, and thus is not described in detail. Unit <b>6</b> receives control signals from unit <b>5</b> and will move unit <b>1</b> in the desired planes to accurately dispense adhesive strip <b>7</b> or dots along an object <b>8</b> in a repeatable, continuous fashion, such as on a manufacturing assembly line.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with another feature of the invention, a cartridge <b>13</b> is placed within a heating unit <b>85</b> which is connected to control unit <b>5</b> by a conductor <b>86</b>. Heating unit <b>85</b> preferably will be located closely adjacent to, but not on, control unit <b>1</b>. Unit <b>85</b> heats the adhesive to a desired temperature where it is maintained until the cartridge in feed assembly <b>2</b> is near empty or is close to the time limit of the heated adhesive. As soon as cartridge <b>13</b> within feed assembly <b>2</b> has reached a near empty stage or its time limit, a quick release pin <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>), which is mounted in a hole <b>90</b> formed in block <b>3</b> and passes through a channel <b>91</b> formed in valve assembly <b>34</b>, is removed which enables the spent cartridge to be lifted out of valve assembly <b>34</b> and from sleeve <b>11</b> upon removal of end cap <b>17</b>. Preheated cartridge <b>13</b> is then inserted into sleeve <b>11</b> with its discharge end being pierced by a needle <b>92</b> mounted in valve assembly <b>34</b> and end cap <b>17</b> reinstalled. The appropriate signal is then supplied to air source <b>20</b> through conductor <b>23</b> which forces piston <b>21</b> downwardly into the interior of cartridge <b>13</b> to move the adhesive out of discharge outlet <b>36</b> through discharge passage <b>37</b> of inlet block <b>3</b> and into dispenser <b>4</b> where it enters spool <b>72</b> through spool inlet <b>77</b>. The adhesive flows through metering channel <b>62</b> for subsequent injection into metering spool <b>72</b> upon actuation of motor <b>56</b> and movement of dispenser rod <b>60</b>, in order to accurately discharge the desired amount through discharge needle <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The temperature of the adhesive in a cartridge <b>13</b> is elevated to a certain level by preheating it in heating unit <b>85</b>, and thus is ready to be dispensed when placed within feed assembly <b>2</b> instead of requiring a time lull while the adhesive is being heated to the required temperature. The preheated adhesive in newly placed cartridge <b>13</b>, preferably is heated an additional 5° or 10° by heating elements <b>25</b> in sleeve <b>11</b>, and then further heated several more degrees as it moves through inlet block <b>3</b> by heater tube <b>40</b>. The temperature of the adhesive is either maintained, or preferably heated several more degrees by heater tube <b>67</b> in dispenser <b>4</b>, so that it reaches the most efficient temperature just when being dispensed through needle valve <b>78</b>. Thus, this series of heaters will maintain, and preferably raise the temperature of the adhesive as it moves through unit <b>1</b> from feed assembly <b>2</b> through inlet block <b>3</b> for subsequent discharge from dispenser <b>4</b> so that the preferred temperature is reached at the time of discharge through valve <b>78</b>. The temperature is accurately maintained by the use of thermocouples <b>28</b>, <b>45</b>, and <b>70</b>, which are connected to control unit <b>5</b>. Thus, should the sensed temperature be too low or too high, an appropriate signal is sent to the respective heating elements or tubes <b>25</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>67</b> for applying more or less heat to the adhesive, either within cartridge <b>13</b>, or within the appropriate passages within inlet block <b>3</b> and dispenser <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, the closeness of feed assembly <b>2</b> to dispenser <b>4</b> by mounting it directly thereto through heated inlet block <b>3</b> assists in maintaining this temperature control to a higher degree of accuracy than would be possible with an adhesive feed supply located remotely from the dispenser <b>4</b> as in prior art dispensers. For example, in the preferred embodiment inlet block <b>3</b> will have a length L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of approximately 3.5 inches and a height H of approximately 2.6 inches. Thus, this enables the adhesive feed assembly to be mounted directly on dispenser <b>4</b> to enable the temperature to be maintained from the adhesive supply contained in a cartridge <b>13</b> before being dispensed through needle valve <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">One type of adhesive used for many applications is a moisture-cured polyurethane which has a life of approximately 16 hours once it is heated to a certain level, afterwhich it begins to harden and loses the required viscosity. Thus, a cartridge <b>13</b> would be placed in preheater <b>85</b> and programmed to be heated to reach a desired temperature level at nearly the same time that the cartridge <b>13</b> contained in feed assembly <b>2</b> is exhausted. Thus, as soon as a cartridge is exhausted in feed assembly <b>2</b>, it is removed and immediately replaced with a preheated cartridge whose temperature has been programmed to reach a desired level, thereby providing the maximum life to the adhesive. The adhesive is then progressively heated to a higher level as it moves through unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control unit will be programmed so that an alarm will be actuated should the life of the adhesive within the cartridge of feed mechanism <b>2</b> be approached to insure that the cartridge is removed and replaced with another preheated cartridge to prevent damage to the equipment and/or an unsatisfactory adhesive being dispensed from dispenser <b>4</b>. Control unit <b>5</b> also controls the actuation of piston <b>21</b>, located within feed assembly <b>4</b>, as well as the air to move piston <b>73</b> within dispenser <b>4</b>. The control unit also can be programmed to communicate with motion control unit <b>6</b>, as well as with motor <b>56</b> of dispenser <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, in accordance with the invention, a very compact accurately controlled adhesive supply system and dispenser is provided which can be easily mounted-on a motion control unit for dispensing very fine and accurately controlled beads or dots of an adhesive by a positive displacement dispenser, wherein the dispensing of the adhesive is accurately controlled by a central control unit which measures and maintains the temperature of the adhesive as it is being dispensed from a cartridge and through an inlet block and into the dispenser for subsequent dispensing therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is understood that the adhesive is heated by the heaters applying heat to the cartridge or adjacent metal block or sleeve without physically contacting the adhesive. Likewise, the thermocouple can measure the temperature of the adjacent metal blocks, sleeves, cartridge, etc. to provide the temperature of the adhesive without directly contacting the adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If desired, adhesive feed assembly <b>3</b> can be mounted directly on dispenser <b>4</b> without the particular inlet block <b>3</b> shown and described above without affecting the concept of the invention. However, block <b>3</b> provides a convenient means of producing a support for the outlet end of cartridge <b>13</b> and transition between feed assembly <b>2</b> and dispenser <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is understood that control unit <b>6</b> is a readily available and programmable computer of the type used in automated control systems, and can be adjusted by one skilled in the art for achieving the desired temperature, time of heating of the adhesive, speed and time of dispensing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness, and understanding. No unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed.</p>
