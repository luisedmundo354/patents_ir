<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vehicular air conditioner for controlling a cooling means and a heating means to adjust the temperature and humidity in a passenger compartment without fogging the window glass.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vehicular air conditioners have in combination an evaporator for cooling and dehumidifying air by utilizing the heat of vaporization of a refrigerant and a heater for heating air with the heat of an engine coolant to adjust the temperature and humidity in the passenger compartment of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the vehicular air conditioner is controlled to lower the cooling ability of the evaporator at a low atmospheric temperature, then since the dehumidifying ability of the evaporator is also lowered, the water vapor in the passenger compartment is possibly condensed on the window glass, etc. when the atmospheric temperature is low and the atmospheric humidity is high.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To eliminate the above drawback, a conventional vehicular air conditioner for keeping a sufficient dehumidifying capability to prevent the window glass from fogging due to condensation, and also for preventing unnecessary cooling thereby to save energy has been developed (see, for example, Japanese Patent No. 3298151 for details).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The conventional vehicular air conditioner estimates the temperature of the surface of a window glass and calculates a necessary humidity of ejected air which represents the humidity in the passenger compartment that will not cause window condensation at the estimated temperature. Further, the conventional vehicular air conditioner determines a dew point of air which represents the calculated necessary humidity of ejected air, and sets a lower temperature of a necessary temperature of ejected air and the dew point as a control temperature of the evaporator for controlling the temperature in the passenger compartment at a preset temperature. The conventional vehicular air conditioner uses a preset humidity in the passenger compartment and humidity in the passenger compartment which is detected by a humidity sensor installed in the passenger compartment for the calculation of the necessary humidity of ejected air.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the temperature of ejected air that is necessary for controlling the temperature in the passenger compartment at the preset temperature is lower than the temperature of ejected air that produces the humidity in the passenger compartment that will not cause window condensation, then since the humidity in the passenger compartment is high even if the temperature in the passenger compartment is close to the preset temperature, the passengers in the passenger compartment may feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the humidity in the passenger compartment is lower than the humidity which causes window condensation, and the temperature is lower than the present temperature entered by the passengers, and the humidity is lower than the humidity which makes the passengers feel uncomfortable, then since the passenger compartment does not need to be further cooled or dehumidified, there the cooling ability of the evaporator may further be controlled in order to save energy.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">If the humidity of exterior air that enters the passenger compartment is not taken into account in the process of determining the temperature of ejected air that produces the humidity in the passenger compartment that will not cause window condensation, because the necessary humidity of ejected air cannot be calculated highly accurately on account of a humidity change caused by the humidity of introduced exterior air, the cooling ability of the evaporator may possibly be excessively controlled or the necessary amount of dehumidification cannot be obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a general object of the present invention to provide a vehicular air conditioner which is capable of controlling the interior of a passenger compartment at an appropriate temperature and humidity, avoiding condensation on the window glass, and limiting energy consumption to a required minimum, and a method of controlling such a vehicular air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A major object of the present invention is to provide a vehicular air conditioner which is capable of controlling the temperature and humidity in a passenger compartment without fogging the windows, using the cooling capacity of a compressor as a required minimum, and a method of controlling such a vehicular air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the present invention is to provide a vehicular air conditioner which is capable of controlling the temperature and humidity in a passenger compartment taking into account the humidity of exterior air introduced into the passenger compartment, and a method of controlling such a vehicular air conditioner.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

If necessary, a window glass temperature sensor <b>21</b> for directly detecting the temperature of the surface of a window glass which faces the interior of the passenger compartment may be connected to the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The air conditioner unit <b>16</b> has an exterior/interior air switching damper actuator <b>32</b>, a fan actuator <b>34</b>, an air mixing damper actuator <b>36</b>, and a mode selection damper actuator <b>38</b>, which are all connected to the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>. The air conditioner unit <b>16</b> also has a duct <b>48</b> which has an exterior/interior air inlet <b>40</b> for introducing exterior air or interior air, and defroster, face, and foot outlets <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> for supplying air, whose temperature, humidity, and supplied quantity have been adjusted, into predetermined regions, i.e., defroster, face, and foot regions, in the passenger compartment. The exterior/interior air inlet <b>40</b> is combined with an exterior/interior air switching damper <b>50</b> which is actuated by the exterior/interior air switching damper actuator <b>32</b> to switch between exterior air and interior air. The defroster, face, and foot outlets <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are combined with mode selection dampers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> which are actuated by the mode selection damper actuator <b>38</b> to switch between the defroster, face, and foot outlets <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The duct <b>48</b> houses therein a fan <b>56</b> disposed closely to the exterior/interior air inlet <b>40</b> and actuatable by the fan actuator <b>34</b>. The duct <b>48</b> also houses therein an evaporator <b>58</b> disposed downstream of the fan <b>56</b> with respect to the direction of air delivered by the fan <b>56</b> in an intermediate region of the duct <b>48</b>. The evaporator <b>58</b> serves to cool and dehumidify air that is delivered by the fan <b>56</b>. Between the evaporator <b>58</b> and the outlets <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, there is disposed a heater <b>60</b> for heating air that has passed through the evaporator <b>58</b> with the coolant supplied from the engine <b>18</b>. An air mixing damper <b>62</b> is disposed between the evaporator <b>58</b> and the heater <b>60</b> and is actuated by the air mixing damper actuator <b>36</b> to adjust the amount of air that has passed through the evaporator <b>58</b> and is supplied to the heater <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An evaporator outlet temperature sensor <b>66</b> for detecting the temperature of air discharged from an air outlet of the evaporator <b>58</b> is disposed near the air outlet of the evaporator <b>58</b>. The evaporator outlet temperature sensor <b>66</b> is connected to the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The air conditioner unit <b>16</b> further has a compressor <b>68</b> actuated by the rotational power from the engine <b>18</b> for compressing a refrigerant, a condenser <b>70</b> for condensing the refrigerant which is compressed by the compressor <b>68</b>, a gas-liquid separator <b>72</b> for separating the refrigerant condensed by the condenser <b>70</b> into a liquid component and a gas component, and an expansion valve <b>74</b> for expanding the gas component of the refrigerant which has been separated by the gas-liquid separator <b>72</b> and supplying the expanded gas component to the evaporator <b>58</b>. The refrigerant supplied to the evaporator <b>58</b> is supplied in circulation to the compressor <b>68</b>. If the compressor <b>68</b> is of a variable-capacity type, then it is connected to the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>, which controls the capacity of the compressor <b>68</b>. If the compressor <b>68</b> is of a fixed-capacity type, then a clutch controller <b>71</b> for controlling a clutch <b>69</b>, which selectively connects and disconnects the engine <b>18</b> and the compressor <b>68</b>, is connected to the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>, which controls the compressor <b>68</b> through the clutch controller <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The vehicular air conditioner <b>10</b> is basically constructed as described above. Operation of the vehicular air conditioner <b>10</b> will be described below with reference to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A passenger on the vehicle <b>12</b> operates the console/display unit <b>20</b> to turn on the power supply of the vehicular air conditioner <b>10</b>, and then sets a temperature, an amount of supplied air, and a mode. The air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> reads sensor information from the exterior air temperature sensor <b>22</b>, the solar radiation sensor <b>24</b>, the coolant temperature sensor <b>26</b>, the passenger compartment temperature sensor <b>28</b>, the compartment interior humidity sensor <b>30</b>, and the evaporator outlet temperature sensor <b>66</b> in step S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> acquires a window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax that is a limit compartment interior absolute humidity at which no water vapor is condensed on the surface of a window glass, which faces the interior of the passenger compartment, in step S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the vehicle <b>12</b> is running, a window glass compartment interior surface temperature Tg, which is the temperature of the surface of a window glass, which faces the interior of the passenger compartment, is regarded as being substantially equal to an exterior air temperature Tam. Using a psychrometric chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax can be determined from an exterior air temperature Tam (=Tg) that is detected by the exterior air temperature sensor <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the window glass temperature sensor <b>21</b> may be mounted on the surface of a window glass which faces the interior of the passenger compartment, and a window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax may be determined using a window glass compartment interior surface temperature Tg that is directly detected by the window glass temperature sensor <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The psychrometric chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents the relationship between physical states such as air temperature (° C.), air absolute humidity (kg/kg), air relative humidity (%), and enthalpy. A window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax may be determined by expressing the relationship between air temperature and air absolute humidity at a relative humidity of 100% in the form of a polynomial, and calculating the polynomial using an exterior air temperature Tam (=Tg) as a variable. Alternatively, the relationship may be stored as a lookup table in a memory <b>23</b> of the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>, and a window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax may be determined from the lookup table based on an exterior air temperature Tam or a window glass compartment interior surface temperature Tg which is acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> determines a compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset within a range in which the window glass is not fogged and the passenger feels comfortable in the passenger compartment in steps S<b>3</b> through S<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Specifically, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> determines a temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) from the psychrometric chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> using a compartment interior set temperature Tset, which is set with the console/display unit <b>20</b> by the passenger, and a preset compartment interior upper limit relative humidity in step S<b>3</b>. The compartment interior upper limit relative humidity may be set to a relative humidity of about 60% that is an upper limit relative humidity at which human beings normally feel comfortable in the passenger compartment. The compartment interior upper limit relative humidity may be set by the passenger with a setting dial on the console/display unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The relationship between two variable indicative of the air temperature and the air relative humidity, and the air absolute humidity may be expressed by a polynomial, and a temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) may be determined by calculating the polynomial using the compartment interior upper limit relative humidity as a variable. Alternatively, the relationship at each air relative humidity may be stored as a lookup table in the memory <b>23</b> of the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b>, and a temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) may be determined from lookup table based on a selected air relative humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Then, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> compares the window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax and the temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) with each other in step S<b>4</b>. If Xrmax&gt;temporary Xset, then even when air having the temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) is cooled in the vicinity of the window glass, the window glass is not fogged because the air does not exceed the relative humidity of 100%. On the other hand, if Xrmax≦temporary Xset, then when air having the temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) is cooled in the vicinity of the window glass, because the air exceeds the relative humidity of 100%, the window glass is fogged.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, if Xrmax&gt;temporary Xset, then the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> sets the compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset to the temporary compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset (temporary Xset) (Xset=temporary Xset) in step S<b>5</b>. If Xrmax≦temporary Xset, then the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> sets the compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset to the window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax (Xset=Xrmax) in step S<b>6</b>. By thus setting the compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset, with the cooling capacity of the compressor being used as a required minimum, the window glass is not fogged, and a comfortable humidity is achieved in the passenger compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Then, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> calculates an outlet air required temperature Tao and an outlet air required absolute humidity Xao at the outlet <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, or <b>46</b> which are required to achieve the compartment interior set temperature Tset and the compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset in step S<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An outlet air required temperature Tao is calculated from the compartment interior set temperature Tset which is set by the passenger, the compartment interior temperature Tr detected by the passenger compartment temperature sensor <b>28</b>, the exterior air temperature Tam detected by the exterior air temperature sensor <b>22</b>, and the amount Ts of solar radiation detected by the solar radiation sensor <b>24</b>, according to the following equation (1):

<p id="p-0042" num="0050">Using the outlet air required temperature Tao and the outlet air required absolute humidity Xao thus calculated, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> calculates a control temperature Tea for minimizing the ratio of operation of the compressor <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">If the compressor <b>68</b> is of a fixed capacity and is connected between the engine <b>18</b> and the clutch <b>69</b>, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> controls the detected value of the evaporator outlet temperature sensor <b>66</b> at the control temperature Tea when the compressor <b>68</b> is disconnected from the engine <b>18</b> and also controls the detected value of the evaporator outlet temperature sensor <b>66</b> at the control temperature Tea+ε (ε: a constant) when the compressor <b>68</b> is connected to the engine <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">The air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> compares the window glass dew-point compartment interior absolute humidity Xrmax acquired in step S<b>2</b> with the compartment interior absolute humidity Xr detected by the compartment interior absolute humidity Xr detected by the compartment interior humidity sensor <b>30</b> in step S<b>8</b>. If Xrmax≦Xr, then when the air in the passenger compartment is cooled in the vicinity of the window glass, the window glass may be fogged. Therefore, in order to maximize the dehumidifying ability of the evaporator <b>58</b>, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> sets the control temperature Tea to a lower limit humidity min at which the evaporator <b>58</b> is not frosted in step S<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">If Xrmax&gt;Xr in step S<b>8</b>, then even when the air in the passenger compartment is cooled in the vicinity of the window glass, because the air does not exceed the relative humidity of 100%, the window glass is not fogged. If a margin for the temperature is represented by δ and a margin for the humidity by γ, and if (Tset−δ)&gt;Tr in step S<b>10</b> and (Xset−γ)&gt;Xr in step S<b>11</b>, then since the passenger compartment does not need to be further dehumidified and cooled at present, the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> sets Tea=β (e.g., about 20° C.) in order to minimize the operation of the compressor <b>68</b> in step S<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">If Xrmax&gt;Xr in step S<b>8</b>, (Tset−δ)≦Tr in step S<b>10</b>, and (Xset−γ)&gt;Xr in step S<b>13</b>, then the air conditioner ECU <b>14</b> judges that the passenger compartment needs to be cooled.

<p id="p-0050" num="0058">Then, the air conditioner unit <b>16</b> is operated to air-condition the passenger compartment to equalize the temperature in the passenger compartment and the compartment interior set temperature Tset, and also to equalize the humidity in the passenger compartment and the compartment interior set absolute humidity Xset. The passenger compartment is thus adjusted to an air-conditioned state, in which the window glass is prevented from being fogged, and the humidity in the passenger compartment is prevented from exceeding an upper limit for comfortable humidity. Since the compressor <b>68</b> is controlled with a required minimum drive power to keep the passenger compartment in the above air-conditioned state, the energy consumed by the compressor <b>68</b> is saved. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a comparison of energies consumed per unit time by the compressor <b>68</b> with respect to the exterior air temperature Tam when the control temperature Tea was calculated according to the equation (2) with the term Kxma·Tam ignored and the air conditioner unit <b>16</b> was controlled (as indicated by the dotted-line curve) and when the control temperature Tea was calculated according to the equation (2) and the air conditioner unit <b>16</b> was controlled (as indicated by the solid-line curve), under such conditions that the exterior humidity was normal (e.g., 50%), the compartment interior set temperature Tset was 25° C., and the compartment interior upper limit relative humidity was 60%.
