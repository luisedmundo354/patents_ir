<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to piano moving apparatus and more particularly relates to apparatus for facilitating the moving of grand pianos having depending lyres.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Procedures for moving grand pianos has remained substantially unchanged since the first production thereof although modern piano moving techniques have incorporated a number of lift devices along with padded dollies and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Grand pianos are very delicate and require extreme care and handling despite the fact that they are notoriously cumbersome. As a result, they have not been amenable for handling and transport thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, piano movers typically rely solely on manpower to carefully lift the grand piano, tilt it on its side and carry it through passageways and the like for movement from room to room or building to building.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This difficult manual task includes removing the piano legs and carefully tilting the flat body of the piano on its side in order to place the piano on a padded support board or dolly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This procedure is particularly dangerous for the piano lyre, which includes footpedals for operation of the piano. As a result of this possible damage, the piano must be carefully manipulated to afford damage and the labor intensive procedure required to safely move the grand piano as particularly onerous in situations in which the piano must be moved on a regular basis, such as, between concert locations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides for a lyre crutch, which facilitates the transport of a piano while at the same time preventing damage to the lyre and further facilitating piano transport.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A piano lyre crutch in accordance with the present invention generally includes a panel along with a fixture for temporarily attaching the panel to a top of the lyre. A panel depending portion includes a length greater than a length of the depending lyre. In this fashion, when the piano, with a leg removed, is pivoted, or rotated, or lowered, the panel undertakes the load and prevents contact of the lyre with the floor/ground. Accordingly, the integrity of the lyre is maintained in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of the present invention, the fixture comprises a vice clamp having opposing chucks for engaging sides of the lyre top. The clamp may comprise a rod portion intermediate the opposing chucks with one of the opposing chucks being fixed to the rod portion and another of the opposing chucks being releasably fixed to the rod for clamping the lyre via top. This adjustability of the releasable chuck enables accommodation for various lyre tops (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the rod portion passes through the panel top and a clamp stop disposed in the panel top is provided for positioning the lyre crutch between the opposing chucks. This feature enables the lyre crutch in accordance with the present invention to be centered in front of the piano lyre and position the depending portion at a position for receiving the weight of the piano upon the lowering of the piano with a leg removed, as hereinafter described in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the panel depending portion tapers toward a bottom thereof in order to facilitate positioning and visual alignment of the crutch with the lyre during the use thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still more particularly, the lyre crutch in accordance with the present invention may further include a foot disposed proximate a panel bottom for adjusting an effective length of the panel. In this manner, the crutch effective length can be changed to accommodate for various lengths of lyres so that the crutch will provide floor contact and support the piano weight upon movement, thus isolating the piano lyre form any load.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment of the present invention, the fixture may comprise at least one bolt for removably fastening the panel to the lyre top.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with the present invention, a method for moving a grand piano generally includes temporarily attaching a panel to a piano lyre and thereafter removing a front leg of the piano.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A front end of the piano is then lowered over the removed leg to engage the panel with the floor with the lyre suspended above the floor to prevent any loading or possible damage thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The piano is then rotated onto a side adjoining the removed leg and onto a dolly or the like, the remaining legs of the piano are removed and the piano is transported on the dolly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More particularly, in accordance with the method of the present invention, an effective length of the panel can be extended to a position below the piano lyre before removing the first piano leg. This procedure insures protection of the lyre during movement of the piano utilizing the lyre crutch in accordance with the present invention.</p>

It is anticipated that piano manufactures may utilize this arrangement for facilitating movement of grand pianos in accordance with the apparatus and method of the present invention, once of the benefits of the present invention are appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, a foot may be provided and disposed proximate the panel bottom <b>60</b> for adjusting an effective length of the panel <b>16</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the foot <b>70</b> includes a slot <b>72</b> and a bolt arrangement <b>74</b> through the panel <b>16</b> enables the foot <b>70</b> to be moved vertically with respect to the panel <b>16</b> and effectively lengthen the panel <b>16</b> as may be necessary for various lengths of lyres (not shown) for different pianos (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be appreciated that the crutch <b>10</b>, including the panel <b>16</b> and foot <b>70</b> may be made from conventional materials, such as plywood or the like. However, any suitable materials capable of bearing the weight of a piano should be considered to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A method in accordance with the present invention for moving a grand piano is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. After temporarily attaching the panel <b>16</b> to the piano lyre <b>24</b>, as hereinabove described, a front leg <b>78</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is removed. The piano <b>12</b> is lowered at a front end <b>82</b> of the piano over the removed leg <b>78</b> in order to rotate the piano in a direction of arrow <b>84</b> and engage the panel <b>16</b> with a floor <b>88</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and more particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As illustrated, the piano may be rested on a dolly or mat <b>90</b> while the pedestal <b>34</b> is prevented from engaging the floor <b>88</b> by the load-bearing panel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thereafter, the piano <b>12</b> is rotated onto a side <b>94</b>, as illustrated by the arrow <b>98</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The remaining piano legs <b>100</b> may be optionally removed as well as the lyre <b>24</b> and panel <b>16</b> for further convenience in moving.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Set up of the piano is followed in a reverse manner in accordance with the method hereinabove set forth.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although there has been hereinabove described a specific grand piano lyre crutch and method in accordance with the present invention for the purpose of illustrating the manner in which the invention may be used to advantage, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto. That is, the present invention may suitably comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of the recited elements.
