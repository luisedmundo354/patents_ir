<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A NiH/NiCd (nickel hydrogen/nickel cadmium) battery charger with the function of emergency power supply unit having a main body with a charging chamber and a charging circuit positioned within the main body to allow an electric connection to the charging chamber and the power input interface. This charging control circuit is controlled by an electrical switch which divides the charging chamber into two or more parts. When the power input interface is connected, the electrical switch shuts off automatically to make the batteries in the charging chamber to be charged in groups. This is the function of charger. When the power input interface is switched off, the batteries in different circuit are joined in series to supply power as an emergency power supply unit.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a NiH/NiCd (nickel hydrogen/nickel cadmium) battery charger with the function of emergency power supply, and more particularly to a charger in which the batteries can be charged separately in different charging circuits during the charging status. When they are not charged, the batteries in different circuits will be automatically connected in series to supply power as an emergency power supply unit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since portable electronic products, such as digital cameras, game players, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular phone, LED illuminating devices, etc. become more and more popular, a greater capacity of secondary batteries is much required. In addition, the charging time is preferably shorter and the charger's volume is preferably smaller. Therefore, a smaller and cheaper charger with shorter charging time and longer service life is anticipated by the market.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional NiH/NiCd battery chargers have their own advantages and disadvantages. However, they still can't reach the expected effects and need to be improved. These are described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional series charger is shown. This charger utilizes a transformer or an exchange power unit <b>11</b> to convert the power mains AC 100˜240V into DC voltage. Meanwhile, the batteries B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, and B<b>4</b> . . . in series connection are charged by a charging circuit <b>12</b>. This charging mode has advantages of simple configuration and low price. However, its disadvantage lies in that one is fully charged while the others are not. This will easily cause overcharge of the full-charged battery when the charging process is continued, thereby lowering its service life.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a conventional charger in parallel is shown. All parallel-connected batteries B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, and B<b>4</b> are charged by a charging circuit <b>12</b>. The advantage thereof lies in that every battery has almost identical charging voltage without disadvantages of overcharge or being not-fully-charged status of the series batteries. However, the greatest disadvantage of the parallel charger lies in that it can't meet the speedy charging requirement. Moreover, the choice and the installation of the electronic control elements are difficult. Supposed that the charging voltage is 2V, and the charging current of each parallel-connected battery is 1.5 A, the required total current will amount to 16 A. However, the diode of the electronic components has problem with internal resistance. In addition, the transistor has problem with pressure difference. To create a low-voltage and high-current charging loop has much to be overcome. For example, it's difficult to fulfill the safety requirement that the wiring of the circuit board has to amount to over 16 mm. Thus, the volume of the parallel charger can't be reduced. Moreover, the components are easily over-heated. Furthermore, the rapid charging requirement can't be fulfilled. If the voltage is increased to enhance the power and to reduce the current value, the four switch transistors Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> will due to the pressure difference produce a high temperature which is difficult to be overcome. And to add cooling elements will increase the whole volume and the material cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The conventional charges, either serial or parallel ones, have disadvantages to some extent. Especially the normal charger is just used now only for charging NiH/NiCd batteries. It is a pity that the other functions of this kind of charger are not used. Therefore, the inventor concentrates on the innovations, in the hope that the current chargers can also supply power as a power supply unit in case of emergency without changing the structure of the conventional charger, increasing the cost, size and using complicated parts. For this purpose, the batteries in the parallel charger must be connected in series to provide sufficient voltage, but it is not very easy. For the four batteries in series, they can provide high voltage, but as above mentioned, there is a disadvantage of overcharging or not full charging which may shorten the battery life. Therefore, the topic how to enlarge the charging capacity as well as to fulfill the function of emergency power supply, will be discussed hereinafter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a primary object of the present invention to eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks of the conventional current charger for NiH/NiCd secondary batteries by a design principle of “separate charging and common sharing”. During the charging process, a plurality of batteries can be charged individually in the respective charging circuit to avoid the problem of over-charging or not full charging. When used, the batteries in different charging circuits are automatically connected in series to provide adequate voltage. It can be used as an emergency power supply unit in case of emergency.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a NiH/NiCd charger that can be used as a portable power supply unit when we go outdoors. The charger can supply power to the electrical products with batteries in the charging chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further object of the invention is to provide a multifunctional charger with the unique circuit design and different emergency power output interfaces for power supply to various electrical products, thereby achieving the multifunctional effect.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">First of all, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C, an applicable embodiment of the invention includes:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">a main body <b>20</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">a charging chamber <b>21</b> in the main body <b>20</b> for accommodating four NiH/NiCd secondary batteries (B); and</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">a power input interface <b>22</b> under the main body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C, the power input interface <b>22</b> is constructed as a plug <b>221</b>. Furthermore, an emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b> is positioned at one side of the main body <b>20</b> which can be designed as a universal serial bus (USB) port to couple with various electrical products available in the market. Of course, it can be also a normal connector. In addition, a plurality of light-emitting diode (LED) indicators <b>24</b> is mounted on the surface of the main body <b>20</b> for indicating the charging status of the batteries (B) in the charging chamber <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another applicable embodiment in respect of a different appearance of the invention is shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C. For example, the power input interface <b>22</b> can be designed as a jack for receiving a connecting cable <b>26</b> of a cigarette lighter <b>261</b>, a connecting cable <b>27</b> of an adapter <b>271</b>, etc. The emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b> can be placed at one side or two sides to meet the requirements. The arrangement of the invention is various and will not be explicitly described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The charging chamber <b>21</b> of the invention looks fairly no different with normal ones, but the important character of the invention is the charging control circuit <b>30</b> in the main body <b>20</b>. This charging control circuit <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is interposed between the power input interface <b>22</b> and the charging chamber <b>21</b> to control the charging process of four batteries. However, in order to employ the invention as an emergency power supply unit, those four batteries must be linked in series to create the adequate voltage. In this way, when the four series-connected batteries are charged, the problem of overcharging or not fully charging will appear and the life span of the batteries will be significantly shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For this purpose, a design principle of “separate charging and common sharing” is adopted in the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for the structure, when the power input interface <b>22</b> is switched on, it will be disconnected automatically by three electrical switches <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and the four batteries are charged separately in four groups of charging circuits to avoid the disadvantages of series charging. But for the batteries which are charged separately, they are not able to supply the required high voltage in case of emergency. Therefore, when the batteries are not charged, the three electrical switches <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> will be activated automatically to link automatically the four batteries which were charged in independent circuits in series. Then the four series-connected batteries can supply adequate voltage. The voltage output from this power source with four series-connected batteries can be controlled by a manual output control circuit <b>40</b>, or this voltage can be provided directly through the emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b> for the electrical products. A derivation from this embodiment is that, when the batteries are charged, the input voltage can be supplied to the manual output control circuit <b>40</b> directly without through the charging control circuit <b>30</b>. Then this voltage is supplied to electrical products via the emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above mentioned design conception of “separate charging and common sharing” will be described in detail with respect to the different charging and emergency power supply modes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a circuit diagram for batteries in charging process is shown. The charging control circuit <b>30</b> consists of a microprocessor <b>31</b>, a current detecting circuit <b>32</b> and a plurality PWM drive circuits <b>33</b> in connection with four diodes (D<b>1</b>˜D<b>4</b>) for driving the charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>˜BAT<b>4</b>) and three electrical switches <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>. Those three electrical switches divide the four batteries into four groups of charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>˜BAT<b>4</b>). In other words, the first electrical switch <b>34</b> is interposed between the first and the second charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>, BAT<b>2</b>), the second electrical switch <b>35</b> between the second and the third charging circuits (BAT<b>2</b>, BAT<b>3</b>), and the third electrical switch <b>36</b> between the third and the fourth charging circuits (BAT<b>3</b>, BAT<b>4</b>). In this way, if two charging circuits need an electrical switch, therefore, eight charging circuits need seven electrical switches. Since this embodiment illustrates one of the most popular chargers for four NiH/NiCd secondary batteries, three electrical switches <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> are employed in this embodiment. Each electrical switch is made of a series connection of an N-Channel metal oxidation semi-conductor field effect transistor (N-MOSFET) with a P-CHANNEL metal oxidation semi-conductor field effect transistor (P-MOSFET). The source (S) of the N-MOSFET (Q<b>10</b>) in each electrical switch (such as the first one <b>34</b>) is grounded, the gate thereof is connected with the power source (VDD), and the drain (D) thereof with the negative terminal of the previous charging circuit (such as the first charging circuit BAT<b>1</b>). Moreover, the source (S) of the P-MOSFET (Q<b>13</b>) is connected to the drain of the N-MOSFET (Q<b>10</b>), the gate (G) thereof to the power source (VDD), and the drain (D) to the positive terminal of the following charging circuit (such as the second BAT<b>2</b>). The second and third electrical switches are also connected in this way and no further descriptions thereto are given hereinafter.</p>

Therefore, four separate charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>, BAT<b>2</b>, BAT<b>3</b> and BAT<b>4</b>) are automatically divided to charge the four batteries individually. The black line in bold type shows the direction of charging current. When the batteries in the charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>˜BAT<b>4</b>) are fully charged, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the microprocessor <b>31</b> detects a signal through the current detecting circuit <b>32</b> to light up the LED indicators <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the power input interface <b>22</b> is electrically unloaded, the batteries in the charging chamber <b>21</b> are fully charged. When the power source is removed, there is no voltage in the charging control circuit <b>30</b> and each PWM drive circuit <b>33</b> is off; therefore, the N-MOSFETs (Q<b>10</b>˜Q<b>12</b>) of the first, the second and the third electrical switches (<b>34</b>˜<b>36</b>) are off, whereas the MOSFETs (Q<b>13</b>˜Q<b>15</b>) are on. The four batteries in the first, the second, the third and the fourth charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>˜BAT<b>4</b>) are connected in series automatically to supply power. The black line in bold type shows the direction of power flow which is directed to the emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b>. Since the four batteries are connected in series, they can provide adequate voltage to the electrical products (such as PDA<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00007" he="2.12mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US07298114-20071120-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>MP3<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00008" he="2.12mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US07298114-20071120-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>LED, etc.). Also, a DC-AC transformer (not shown) can covert the direct current into alternating current and supply the AC electrical mini products such as power saving PL-lamp und cool cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</figref>, another embodiment of the invention can be designed as follows. A manual output control circuit <b>40</b> is installed before the emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b>. It consists of a multistage selector <b>41</b> and two p-MOSFETs <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>. With a button <b>411</b> of this multistage selector <b>41</b> on the surface of main body <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), the emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b> can be freely set to one of the different modes OFF, ON or EMERGENCY. The mode OFF means that the emergency power supply output interface <b>23</b> does not supply any power. Mode ON means the charging batteries can supply directly and not be controlled by the charging control circuit <b>30</b>. EMERGENCY means that batteries in different charging circuits are connected in series to supply power. The modes can be selected according to the requirements. This multi-switch employed in the invention to control the voltage output is a mature technique, so that no further descriptions thereto are given hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the main circuit of the invention. Those who are familiar with this art can take advantage of it. Since the microprocessor <b>31</b>, the current detecting circuit <b>32</b> and the PWM drive circuit <b>33</b> are conventional charging circuits and do not belong to the object of the invention, no further decryptions thereto are given hereinafter. The unique character of the invention lies in the design of electrical switches which divide the charging chamber <b>21</b> into four independent parts (BAT<b>1</b>˜BAT<b>4</b>). When the power source is removed, the four batteries in four charging loops link together automatically and supply power as a practical power supply unit. This feature makes the invention to be a charger normally and also an emergency power supply unit in case of emergency or going outdoors. Furthermore, it can conveniently supply electrical power to all kinds of electronic products such as PL-lamp, CCFL, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, we discuss above with four rechargeable batteries and charging circuits, but it is more universal. That the charger can charge independently with several separate charging circuits and the batteries can be connected automatically through an electronic switch to supply power can be included in the invention. The charger in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> holds only two batteries; therefore, an electrical switch <b>34</b> can divide it into two charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>) and (BAT<b>2</b>). When the power source is removed, the two batteries are automatically connected in series to supply power. Of course, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an electrical switch <b>34</b> divides it into two charging circuits (BAT<b>1</b>) and (BAT<b>2</b>). Each charging circuit has two batteries which are charged separately in couple. In case of an emergency, the four batteries are joined together to supply power. When two batteries are charged simultaneously, the normal current detecting circuit can detect the full charging signal so that the problem of over-charging can be eliminated. Thus, this application is also practical, although it is not so precise as the individual charging of the batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Many changes and modifications in the above-described embodiments of the invention can, of course, be carried out without departing from the scope thereof. Accordingly, to promote the progress in science and the useful arts, the invention is disclosed and is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
