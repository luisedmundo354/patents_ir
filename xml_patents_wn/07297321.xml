<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods for making mixed porous oxides, and more particularly relates, in one embodiment, to methods for making super-microporous metal oxides and the metal oxides so made.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Zeolites are heavily used commercial products as ion exchangers, catalysts, and in separations technology. Their useful pore sizes are limited to 10 Å or less. In the past decade, many metal oxides have been prepared with pore sizes in the 20-200 Å range as seen in C. T. Kresge, et al., “Ordered Mesoporous Molecular Sieves Synthesized by a Liquid Crystal Template Mechanism”, <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 359, 710-712 (1992) and J. S. Beck, et al., “A New Family of Mesoporous Molecular Sieves Prepared with Liquid Crystal Templates”, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc</i>. Vol. 114, 10834-10843, (1992). Several very specific cases with materials exhibiting pores 13-17 Å were demonstrated by Y. Ying et al. (please see T. Sun, et al., “Synthesis of Microporous Transition Metal Oxide Molecular Sieves with Bifunctional Templating Molecules,” <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed</i>., Vol. 37, No. 5, pp. 664-667, 1998; T. Sun, et al., “Synthesis of Amorphous, Microporous Silica with Adamantanamine as a Templating Agent,” <i>Chem. Commun</i>., pp. 2057-2058, 2000; and M. Wong, et al., “Supramolecular-Templated Synthesis of Nanoporous Zirconia-Silica Catalysts,” <i>Chem. Mater</i>., Vol. 14, No. 5, pp. 1961-1973, 2002, (published on Web Apr. 3, 2002). There is thus a gap between the two where very few materials have pore sizes in the 10-20 Å range.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Almost all microporous and mesoporous materials are made in aqueous media using amine or surfactant templates. Generally, the template is removed by heating to 500-550° C.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Intense research activity in the synthesis, structural elucidation and properties of mesoporous materials has resulted from the discovery of MCM-41 type mesoporous molecular sieves, Kresge, et al. and Beck, et al., id. and Q. Huo, et al., “Organization of Organic Molecules with Inorganic Molecular Species into Nanocomposite Biphase Arrays”, <i>Chem. Mater</i>. Vol. 6, 1176-1191 (1994). By using surfactants with moderately long alkyl chain lengths, pores in the 20-50 Å range are routinely obtained. As noted, the most common preparative procedures involve the use of cationic or anionic surfactants and oppositely charged inorganic precursors, designated S<sup>+</sup>I<sup>−</sup> or S<sup>−</sup>I<sup>+</sup>, respectively where S represents the surfactant and I the inorganic species, Huo, et al., id. A second pathway involves the use of neutral amine surfactants (S°) or nonionic polyoxyethylene surfactants (N°) with neutral inorganic precursors (I°) through hydrogen bonding at the interface of the pairs, as seen in P. T. Tanev, et al., “Mesoporous Molecular Sieves Prepared by Ionic and Neutral Surfactant Templating”, <i>Chem. Mater</i>. Vol. 8, 2068-2079 (1996). Following these pioneering studies in the silica system mesoporous oxides of a large number of metals were prepared, F. Schüth, “Non-Siliceous Mesostructured and Microporous Materials”, <i>Chem. Mater</i>. Vol. 13, 3184-3195 (2001) and Q. Huo, et al., “Generalized Synthesis of Periodic Surfactant/Inorganic Composite Materials”, <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 368, 317 (1994). These oxides are generally not as thermally stable as the silica based products; collapse of the pore structure in many cases occurring at temperatures required for removal of the template. Titania and zirconia are special cases where the stability may be preserved to 550° C. by phosphate additions. The well known zeolites are more highly crystalline than the mesoporous materials but are limited in useful pore size to about 10 Å. A family of inorganic-organic hybrids with pores in the desired range was recently prepared, as noted by A. Clearfield and Z. Wang in <i>J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans</i>. 2002, pp. 2937-2947 (2002) and Z. Wang, J. Heising and A. Clearfield in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc</i>. Vol. 125, pp. 10375-10383 (2003). These were zirconium phosphonates containing biphenyl groups. The phenyl rings can be sulfonated to produce very strong Bronsted acid catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, it would be desirable if a way to produce supermicroporous metal oxides having pore sizes in the 10-20 Å range.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide supermicroporous metal oxides having pore sizes in the 10-20 Å range.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide supermicroporous metal oxides having pore sizes where the pore size could be adjusted to be between about 8-25 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object is to provide supermicroporous metal oxides of this invention suitable as catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In carrying out these and other objects of the invention, there is provided, in one form and/or in preferred embodiment, a method for preparing supermicroporous metal oxides that involves combining a metal salt in the presence of a carboxyl anion to form a mixture, and adding into the mixture an amine to form either a homogeneous solution or a thixotropic gel. In one non-limiting embodiment, all salts are added prior the addition of the hydrolyzing agent. The mixture is hydrolyzed by either water contained in the reagents or by adding water or water diluted with solvent to the mixture. The mixture is stirred for an extended period of time and/or refluxed, and optionally hydrothermally treated, and the supermicroporous metal oxide is obtained by collecting and drying a solid from the mixture. The invention also relates to supermicroporous metal oxides made by this method.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another non-limiting embodiment of the invention, there are supermicroporous metal oxides made by this process, which can form the basis for a catalyst, or which are useful in separation processes, or as ion exchangers.</p>

In several non-limiting cases the supermicroporous products were obtained directly from solvent-free reaction mixtures. The initial hydrolysis and/or polymerization is effected by the water molecules present in the starting materials. Further hydrolysis and/or polymerization of the reagents is effected by addition of a water/water-solvent mixture followed by vigorous stirring and/or refluxing, and/or hydrothermal synthesis. The hydrolysis may be further effected by addition of bases such as, but not limited to, an amine or ammonia or mixtures thereof. The amine and solvent are removed by thorough washing and/or calcining at temperatures as low as 200° C. In several non-limiting cases no washing was applied to the products, and the volatiles were removed by calcination. Mixtures of transition metal oxides with either ZrO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2 </sub>and/or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or mixtures thereof were prepared and while the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—ZrO<sub>2 </sub>system is described in detail here the selected examples of other systems will also be provided. The procedures for the other systems would correspond to the one described. In one non-limiting embodiment of the invention, the surface area of the supermicroporous metal oxides of the invention range from about 200 to about ˜1100 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The surface area curves of the pure oxides are Type I with surface areas of 400-600 m<sup>2</sup>/g for the individual oxides. However, the oxides so prepared likely tend to lack thermal stability as the pore size increases with increased calcination temperature and collapse of the walls for some of the systems occurs above 400° C. Addition of phosphate improves the stability slightly, but the thermal stability is greatly improved by preparing mixed oxides of transition metals in zirconia or silica, titania, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or mixtures thereof. Type I isotherms are obtained to ˜450° C. and in some cases to 900° C. and above. There is a tendency to increase pore size with an increase in calcination temperature and on calcining above 500° C. a significant amount of mesopores may be formed. Hydro-thermal treatment accelerates the trend towards larger pores. In some cases, the pore limit can be lowered to 8 Å or raised to 25 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A goal was to fill the gap between the two types of well known porous materials by synthesizing oxides with pores in the 10-20 Å range. The inventors have discovered the synthesis of a family of oxides with supermicropores, that is, containing pores in the 10-20 Å range. The inorganic precursors are metal acetates and/or other metal salts in the presence of corresponding carboxy anion and the surfactant is propylamine, butylamine, hexylamine or octylamine, although other amines including those of larger carbon chains have been successfully employed. The reactions in many non-limiting embodiments were carried out in alcohol-water mixtures in the presence of amount of amine sufficient to effect the hydrolysis of the metal salts. The general procedure is to add the metal acetate to a non-aqueous solvent, generally an alcohol and stir until the solid is uniformly distributed. Then amine is added and after stirring for 30-60 minutes finely ground (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>and/or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>is optionally added. An additional amount of amine is optionally added and stirring continued for several hours preferably overnight to achieve either a homogeneous solution or a thixotropic gel in the case of zirconium, lanthanum, titanium, or mixtures thereof. Then water diluted with alcohol is slowly added with stirring. After all the water-propanol mixture is added, the mixture is refluxed overnight and/or hydrothermally treated or in some cases stirred for extended periods of time. The solid is then collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with alcohol and dried at as low as 55° C. Similar experiments were carried out where the mixture was treated hydrothermally at temperatures up to 200° C. in addition to/or in place of refluxing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">More generally, suitable metal salts for the method of this invention include, but are not necessarily limited to, tetraethyl orthosilicate, titanium acetate or propoxide, vanadium acetate, vanadium phosphate, vanadium sulfate, chromium acetate and nitrate, zirconium acetate, zirconium oxochloride and propoxide, niobium acetate, molybdenum acetate, lanthanum acetate, aluminum tri-sec-butoxide, aluminum nitrate, nickel acetate, manganese acetate, iron acetate, zinc acetate, copper acetate, cobalt acetate and/or nitrates and/or chlorides or mixtures thereof. If salts other than acetates are employed the addition of appropriate salt containing acetate or other carboxy anion and/or corresponding acid is sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one non-limiting embodiment of the invention, suitable solvents include, but are not necessarily limited to, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, ethanol, methanol, pentanol, heptanol, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With respect to suitable amine templates, appropriate amines in one non-limiting embodiment of the invention are neutral amines having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. In an alternate, non-limiting embodiment suitable amines include, but are not necessarily limited to, methylamine, propylamine, butylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, trimethylammonium compounds, tetrabutylammonium, dipropylamine, tripropylamine, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the method of this invention, the ratio of the amine to the solvent should be sufficient to effect a high degree of salt hydrolysis, and in one non-limiting case may range from about 0.91 mol:8.41 mol to about 0.039 mol:8.38 mol preferably from about 0.089 mol:6.52 mol to about 0.39 mol:11.13 mol. In another non-restrictive embodiment, the ratio of solvent to amine ranges from about 0.1:8.0 to about 200:1. In the case where a thixotropic gel is formed, the gel may be aged for a period of time between about 3 hours and about 96 hours prior to reflux (if necessary); in another non-limiting embodiment from about 6 to about 96 hours. As noted, the mixture may be optionally treated hydrothermally in addition to or in place of the refluxing step.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further in the method of the invention, the collecting and drying of the solid mixed metal oxides from the mixture to form the supermicroporous metal oxides may be conducted by any conventional technique known to those skilled in the art. In a particular non-limiting embodiment of the invention, the drying is conducted at a temperature in the range of about 45 to about 180° C. in an alternate, non-limiting embodiment from about 45 to about 110° C., preferably from about 55 to about 100° C. Calcining may be subsequently performed at a temperature ranging from about 180 to about 900° C., preferably from about 200 to about 600° C., and in an alternate, non-limiting embodiment from about 190 to about 650° C.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The nitrogen sorption-desorption isotherms for chromia prepared from a refluxed sample of (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>Cr<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2 </sub>(Example No I) heated at different temperatures for 24 hours are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and the pore sizes derived from the isotherms are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. All the samples were outgassed at 180° C. for 22 h. The data are summarized in Table 1. The samples of A preheated at 190° and 250° C. yielded Type I isotherms representative of microporous materials. The pore size distribution for the 190° sample is 6.5-11 Å and for the 250° C. sample the pores are centered at a maximum of 11-14 Å. Further preheating to 320° C. changes the character of the isotherm to that of a mixed micro-mesoporous solid. However micropores still account for most of the surface area (S.A.) with pores centered at 16 Å diameter together with a second group at 18 Å. Heating to 410° C. converted the sample to one with non-descript or broad ranging mesopores with loss of more than half the surface area. The hydrothermally treated sample designated as B in Table 1, showed the same trends on heat treatment, had overall larger surface areas, and larger pore sizes but collapsed to a broad spectrum of mesopores between 250°-320° C.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">X-ray powder patterns showed the samples to be completely amorphous. Upon drying at 55° C., the solids contain about 18% carbon attributed to hexylamine, propanol and a small amount of acetyl groups. A TGA curve showed a weight loss of about 13% to 190° C. The bulk of the organic is then lost (about 30-32%) from 190° to 260° C. An additional weight loss to 900° C. of 8% takes place in two steps, 5% from 260° to 340° C. and the remainder from 520° to 600° C. The hydrothermally treated sample behaved similarly, but the overall weight loss was ˜42% or about 10% less than the refluxed sample. Heating under isothermal conditions at 250° C. removes most of the organic, but the pores are mesoporous.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Because mesoporous zirconia was previously reported to be more stable than most mesoporous oxides and because zirconium has a very stable four plus oxidation state, reactions of the type described above for zirconia were carried out using a basic zirconium acetate Zr(OH)<sub>4-X</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>X</sub>, x=1.36. The porosity of the resultant hydrous zirconia was not at all like that of the chromia. Even the sample dried at 190° C. exhibited a Type IV isotherm and the shape of the desorption curve near P/P<sub>0</sub>=0.5 indicated a broad distribution of pore sizes. A second sample of zirconia did give a Type I isotherm with a S.A. of 284 m<sup>2</sup>/g when heated treated at 260° C. The pore size distribution was narrow with a maximum in the volume versus mean diameter curve of 10 Å. This sample lost surface area rapidly with increasing temperatures and the pore structure collapsed at ˜350° C. The use of reduced amounts of water employed for the hydrolysis yielded a substantially more thermally stable product. In one non-limiting embodiment the product calcined at 600° C. exhibited Type I adsorption/desorption isotherm and retained its microporous structure with the maximum on the pore size distribution curve at ˜11 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A mixture of basic acetates 37 mol % Cr and 63 mol % Zr was prepared as before in propanol to which was added sufficient hexylamine and a solution of diammonium hydrogen phosphate. The mole ratio Zr:Cr:P was 1:1.80:0.58. Sufficient water in propanol was added to hydrolyze the acetates to their respective hydrous oxides. Because the basic chromium acetate contains three Cr per molecule the final mixture of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+ZrO<sub>2 </sub>was in the mol ratio of 47/53 mol %. The surface areas and pore sizes are shown in and the isotherms in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, respectively. The isotherms for the refluxed sample (Example No III) are of Type I, characteristic of micropores. Isotherms of this type persisted up to preheating temperatures of 460° C. with the bulk of the pores between 10 and 15 Å. Preheating to 520° C. and above changed the shape of the isotherms to Type IV as the average pore size increased but remained in a narrow-range.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The effect of hydrothermal treatment is to produce somewhat larger surface areas and larger pores. The shape of the isotherms in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is indicative of a bimodal pore structure of micro and mesopores with a hysteresis feature. However, the t-plot method indicated that the bulk of the pores are in the micropore region up to a preheating temperature of 520° C. (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Heating above that temperature yielded solids with a broad distribution of mesopores. Note that the desorption region of the isotherms near P/P<sub>0</sub>=0.5 are curved in a shape recognized as tensile pressure This means that the mesopores are likely to have a much broader range than is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Subsequently the mole ratio Zr/Cr was changed to as high as 2.34 with results very much like those reported for the much higher loading of chromium reported above. The outcome with a wide variety of other transition elements mixed with zirconia gave similar results to the chromium system, stability was maintained to above 500° C. and the pore sizes were in the 10-20 Å range. There were also produced a series of mixed silica-transition metal oxides with similar characteristics to the zirconia based materials. An isotherm of the SiO<sub>2</sub>—NiO system is shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The S.A. is 508 m<sup>2</sup>/g with the mean pore diameter at 13.4 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the control of the type of porosity as well as the pore size distribution the parameters altering these properties include, but not limited to, the choice of templating amine, solvent and amounts thereof; ratio of the starting reagents, time of reaction and its temperature, amounts of water added and the concentrations of water in the solution been added.</p>

The surface area (S.A.) and pore diameters of the resultant solid heat treated at the temperatures indicated were as shown in Table 2 (Sample A). It is seen that while the surface area decreases with increase in heating temperature there is no collapse of the structure to 613° C. The pore size increases with increase in heating temperature. Thus the mixture of ZrO<sub>2</sub>—Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is more stable than chromia without the ZrO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

The catalyst described in details in the Example No XI and catalysts similar to that were heated at 390° C. for 24 hours to remove all organic. A phenyl halide (PhX) (see Table 4), 10 mmol, styrene (10 mmol), sodium acetate (11.2 mmol) and 10 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) were added to the reaction vessel along with 2 mmol of naphthalene as an internal standard for GC analysis. The reaction vessel was then placed into an oil bath preheated at 80° C. and stirred vigorously. Small samples were removed periodically and subjected to GC analysis. The results are provided in Table 4. The products of the reaction were benzene, stilbene and no more than 3% 1,1-regioisomers.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Preliminary results for the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene have been obtained using nickel reduced Ni—ZrO<sub>2 </sub>samples to which had been added ammonium dihydrogenphosphate during the preparation of the samples. The material obtained was further hydrothermally treated at 180° C. The conditions were optimized at catalyst reduction at 400° with an increased H<sub>2 </sub>flow of 4.92 L/h and in the reaction an H<sub>2 </sub>flow of 6.13 L/h and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl:H<sub>2</sub>=1:40.

<heading id="h-0039" level="1">The Effect of Washing on the Material Porosity</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The starting solution for the synthesis of the Samples had the following composition: 13.08 g of Mn(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O, 53.13 g of Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, 1.79 g of Al(OCH(CH<sub>3</sub>)C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, 19.14 g hexylamine. To prepare the Sample 1.40 g of H<sub>2</sub>O were added to 28.06 g of the starting solution. The solution obtained was aged for 24 hrs and the Sample A dried as made at 130° C. 15.28 g of gel A were washed in propanol and centrifuged three times yielding the Sample B. The porosity of the samples obtained was characterized via argon adsorption. The samples A and B gave correspondingly 628.4 and 544.9 m<sup>2</sup>/g NLDFT desorption surface area with the latter having the pore size distribution much better refined around 16.8 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Although others have produced a large number of porous oxides starting with metal chlorides dissolved in alcohol, the products templated with polyoxo block copolymers had pores in excess of 10 nm, as noted by C. L. Carnes, et al. in “Synthesis, Characterization and Adsorption Studies of Nanocrystalline Aluminum Oxide and a Bimetallic Nanocrystalline Aluminum Oxide/Magnesium Oxide”, <i>Chem. Mater</i>. Vol. 14, 2922-29 (2002). The same was true for the mixed oxides. The present inventive process is a beginning towards producing supermicroporous oxides routinely.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the pore size distribution can be tailored by using a wide variety of methods including, but not necessarily limited to, the choice of the solvent; the amount of solvent; the choice of the amine; the amount of amine; the amount of water; the time of reaction; the time of refluxing; the time of hydrothermal treatment; the calcination temperature; and the time of calcinations. In one non-limiting preparation embodiment, the solid is washed prior to collecting and drying it to form the supermicroporous metal oxide, and tailoring the pore size distribution is effected via choice of the washing agent or absence thereof. Suitable washing agents include, but are not necessarily limited to alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethyl acetate, dioxane and the like. Additionally, as noted, providing for the presence of mesopores in the supermicroporous material may enhance its catalytic properties due to improved diffusion as compared with an otherwise identical catalyst absent mesopores.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof, and has been demonstrated as effective for producing supermicroporous metal oxides. However, it will be evident that various modifications and changes can be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit or scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Accordingly, the specification is to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. For example, specific combinations of metal acetates, alcohols and amine templates falling within the claimed parameters, but not specifically identified or tried in a particular method to make supermicroporous metal oxides herein, are anticipated to be within the scope of this invention. It is anticipated that the compositions of this invention may also supermicroporous metal oxides having particular utility as catalysts, in separation methods and in ion exchange techniques.</p>
