<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates in general to a manufacturing process of an emboss type flexible or rigid printed circuit board, and more particularly to a structure design of an emboss type flexible printed circuit board wherein a circuit is directly formed on a carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductors are manufactured into a huge variety of electronic products. A conventional manufacturing technique for the semiconductors is to fabricate multiple pre-manufactured grain-shaped chips into semiconductor elements having external contacts or pins. Then the contacts or the pins of the semiconductor elements are soldered to be coupled with a circuit on a circuit board, so as to manufacture the electronic products with predetermined functions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, as the overwhelming trend in electronic products is towards developing portable and compact devices, a surface adhering technique is applied to secure the semiconductor elements to be coupled to the circuit board. Moreover, when fabricating the circuit board by using the surface adhering technique, excessive cost is inevitable due to high-priced raw materials. Hence the consumers have to decide between paying more for the state of the art products or choosing lower priced but less attractive products. Further, it is difficult for purchasing departments of companies to control and even predict the prices of those raw materials, especially when the material purchase orders must be signed long before the products can be manufactured.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a manufacturing process of an emboss type flexible or rigid printed circuit board, which can minimize the disadvantage of high-priced raw materials. The manufacturing process of an embedded type flexible or rigid printed circuit board of the present invention can produce a circuit board with the same effectiveness as the conventional circuit board fabricated by the high-cost surface adhesive technique.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another objective of the present invention, an entirely different application structure can be developed by switching the steps in the manufacturing process of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the aforesaid objectives, the manufacturing process for an emboss type flexible or rigid printed circuit board of the present invention includes multiple steps as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">First, a layer of copper foil is prepared and the layer of the copper foil is coated with a layer of dry film or liquid type photo resist. A circuit is formed after exposure and development. An etching stop layer of 3-10 μm depth is electroplated on the circuit. The etching stop layer is further electroplated with copper. Then the dry film or photo resist is removed. Next, the copper foil is heated to become soft. The copper foil is coated with an organic surface layer, whereafter the organic surface layer is solidified such as by heating or UV. Then, the layer of the copper foil is etched, and the etching stop layer is also removed. Finally, the circuit is transferred to be emboss into the organic material, and subsequently a surface of the circuit is processed with isolation coating, exposure, development, and a contact point surface process, so as to complete functionality of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The layer of the copper foil can be completely removed in the aforesaid step of etching the copper foil.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The layer of the copper foil can be partially removed in the aforesaid step of etching the copper foil.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the aforesaid steps, the manufacturing process of the embedded type flexible printed circuit board of the present invention does not need use of a conventional carrier, so as to economize on the cost and further enhance competitiveness.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the aforesaid description of the manufacturing process of the emboss type flexible printed circuit board of the present invention, details are illustrated as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a first step is to prepare a layer of copper foil <b>10</b> and the layer of the copper foil <b>10</b> is coated with a layer of dry film <b>11</b>. A circuit pattern <b>12</b> is formed on the layer of the copper foil <b>10</b> after exposure and development or any conventional method. The circuit pattern <b>12</b> is electroplated with an etching stop layer <b>13</b> of 3-10 μm. The etching stop layer <b>13</b> is electroplated with a layer of copper electroplating <b>10</b>′. Then the dry film <b>11</b> is removed from the layer of the copper foil <b>10</b>. Next, the copper foil <b>10</b> is heated to become soft. An organic surface layer <b>14</b> which includes an optional adhesive layer <b>141</b> is attached to the copper electroplating <b>10</b>′ by coating, adhering or compressing. The organic surface layer <b>14</b> is then solidified such as by heating or irradiating of ultraviolet light (UV). Moreover, the organic surface <b>14</b> can be directly coated on the copper electroplating <b>10</b>′ without the adhesive layer <b>141</b>. After the layer of the copper foil <b>10</b> is etched, the etching stop layer <b>13</b> is removed. Finally, the copper electroplating <b>10</b>′ that serves as a conductive circuit is transferred to the organic material, which is on the organic surface layer <b>14</b>. A surface of the conductive circuit can be further processed with isolation coating, exposure, development, and a contact point surface process, so as to complete functionality of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The notable point is that the organic surface layer <b>14</b> used in the present invention is a soft nonmetal organic material layer, hence the organic surface layer <b>14</b> is used as a substrate according to the conventional manufacturing process. That is to say, the organic surface layer <b>14</b> of the present invention has replaced the carrier of the conventional manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The layer of the copper foil <b>10</b> can be completely removed in the aforesaid step of etching the layer of the copper foil <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The layer of the copper foil <b>10</b> can be partially removed in the aforesaid step of etching step, so as to leave the copper foil <b>10</b> that corresponds to the copper electroplating <b>10</b>′ as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. The remaining copper foil <b>10</b> can function as electrode contact points to be coupled with other electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a single side flexible board can be made by coating the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> with an insulating paint or by repeating the step in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The aforesaid the manufacturing process of the circuit board also can be used to manufacture a double-layered flexible printed circuit with copper on both sides, such as TAB (tape automatic bonding) and COF (chip-on-film) products also like TCP (Tape Carried Package).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The aforesaid manufacturing process of the circuit board can be further proceeded by stacking processes to form a multilayer structure with rigid parts or metal parts. The stacking processes can be performed by well known processes including high density interconnection technology (HDI).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With the aforesaid steps, the manufacturing process of the embedded type flexible printed circuit board of the present invention does not need use of a conventional carrier, so as to greatly reduce costs. Moreover, the circuit board of the present invention can achieve the objectives of the portability and compactness with the structure design of the embedded type flexible printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In conclusion, the manufacturing process of the embedded type flexible printed circuit board of the present invention indeed can improve the conventional drawback of high costs to produce the portable and compact products, and also provides high utilization values to the industry, so as to meet the requirements to apply a new patent.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
