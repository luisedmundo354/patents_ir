<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ceramic materials are well known and widely used for different applications due to some of their exceptional properties such as high modulus, hardness, high temperature stability and chemical resistance. However they are also heavy, brittle, and difficult to process. On the other hand, organic polymers are tough, flexible, light, and easy to fabricate; low modulus and relatively low decomposition temperatures are their main drawbacks. Pre-ceramic polymer technology is emerging as a promising process to produce materials that share the advantages of both polymers and ceramics while minimizing the disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore new methods are needed to create micron-size (or even smaller) ceramic structures for applications such as microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A particularly challenging area is creating three-dimensional (3D) ceramic structures. These application areas are very difficult using traditional ceramic technologies. Pre-ceramic polymers afford unique properties in responding to these requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many polymers such as polysilazanes are known to act as ceramic precursors and their use for production of ceramic structures has been reported. The formation of miniaturized ceramic structures by pyrolysis of poly (vinylsilazane) using LIGA (German Lithographie, Galvanoformung, and Abformung) process including deep X-ray lithography, electroforming, and plastic molding has been demonstrated. An injectable polymer-precursor technique has been detailed; also a microforged mold method to fabricate high temperature MEMS using polysilazanes has been disclosed. All of the described techniques, however, involve complex and time-consuming processing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photopolymerization provides an alternative route to construct solid microstructures. Photopolymerization techniques offers direct pattern formation capability, freestanding structures, and cost-effective processing. Through layer-by-layer processes such as stereolithography, photopolymerization techniques can also allow for the fabrication of 3-dimensional structures. Efforts have been made to create ceramic microstructures using free radial inititated photopolymerization of liquid polysilazane; low photopolymerization speed, however, was observed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Single-photon polymerization techniques have been used to form patterned pre-ceramic polymer microstructures using thiol-ene chemistry including polysilazanes. Two-photon polymerization of polymer nanocomposites has been used to pattern 3D silica microstructures.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0035">This method is advantageous in that it provides a composition with improved single-photon photosensitivity, resulting in generally reduced manufacturing time. It also provides the advantages described above for the multi-photon reactive composition.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0036">In addition to a single-photon method of photoinitiating a polysilazane-containing/multi-functional acrylate-containing reactive composition the present invention provides a method of multi-photon photosensitizing a polysilazane-containing and multi-functional acrylate-containing photoreactive composition. The multi-photon method comprises irradiating (preferably, pulse irradiating) the composition with light sufficient to cause simultaneous absorption of at least two photons, thereby inducing at least one radical-initiated chemical reaction where the composition is exposed to light. The photoreactive composition comprises: (a) at least one polysilazane-containing and at least one multi-functional acrylate-containing reactive species that is capable of undergoing a radical-initiated chemical reaction (preferably, a curable species selected from the group consisting of monomers, oligomers, and reactive polymers); and (b) at least one multi-photon photocuring composition.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0037">The method of the invention provides enhanced multi-photon photosensitivity by combining (in photochemically-effective amounts) at least one multi-photon photosensitizer having a relatively large two-photon absorption cross section (compared to those of many commonly available dyes) with optionally one or both of an electron acceptor and an electron donor so as to efficiently form a polymerization-initiating species (radicals, etc.). The increased sensitivity of the method of the invention provides utility by, for example, allowing rapid fabrication of three-dimensional structures by means of three-dimensional light patterns and permitting the use of lower peak intensity lasers (including, for example, robust industrial lasers such sa nanosecond and picosecond Nd:YAG lasers) for exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0038">It is believed novel in the art to produce patterned pre-ceramic microstructures by use of single- and multi-photon polymerization of polysilazane/multi-functional acrylate-containing receive compositions that are free of thiols, i.e., free of —SH containing compounds. The multi-photon technology enables fabrication of hollow or solid, three-dimensional microstructures with submicron resolution in a single exposure/development cycle. Complex 3-D geometries can be fabricated that cannot be formed by other methods such as molding or powder pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0039">To the best of our knowledge, single and multi-photon photocuring compositions have never been disclosed for a combination of polysilazane and multi-functional acrylate polymerization.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">MULTI-PHOTON PHOTOSENSITIZERS</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0080">Multi-photon photosensitizers suitable for use in the multi-photon photocuring composition of the photoreactive compositions are those that are capable of simultaneously absorbing at least two photons when exposed to sufficient light and that have a two-photon absorption cross-section preferably at least about 1.5 times that of fluorescein.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0081">Preferably, the photosensitizer is soluble in the relative species (if the reactive species is liquid) or is compatible with the reactive species and with any binders (as described below) that are included in the composition. Most preferably, the photosensitizer is also capable of sensitizing 2-methyl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine under continuous irradiation in a wavelength range that overlaps the single photon absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer (single photon absorption conditions), using the test procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,729,313, which is incorporated herein by reference. Using currently available material that test can be carried out as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0082">A standard test solution can be prepared having the following composition: 5.0 parts of a 5% (weight by volume) solution in methanol of 45,000-55,000 molecular weight, 9.0-13.0% hydroxyl content polyvinyl butyral (Butvar™ B76, Solutia, St. Louis, Mo.); 0.3 parts trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate; and 0.03 parts 2-methyl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine (see Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 42, 2924-2930 (1969)). To this solution can be added 0.01 parts of the compound to be tested as a photosensitizer. The resulting solution can then be knife-coated onto a 0.05 mm clear polyester film using a knife orifice of 0.05 mm, and the coating can be air dried for about 30 minutes. A 0.05 mm clear polyester cover film can be carefully placed over the dried but soft and tacky coating with minimum entrapment of air. The resulting sandwich construction can then be exposed for three minutes to 161,000 Lux of incident light from a tungsten light source providing light in both the visible and ultraviolet range (FCH™ 650 watt quartz-iodine lamp, General Electric Lighting, Cleveland, Ohio). Exposure can be made through a stencil so as to provide exposed and unexposed areas in the construction. After exposure the cover film can be removed, and the coating can be treated with a finely divided colored powder, such as a color toner powder of the type conventionally used in xerography. If the tested compound is a photosensitizer, the trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate monomer will be polymerized in the light-exposed areas by the light-generated free radicals from the 2-methyl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine. Since the polymerized areas will be essentially tack-free, the colored powder will selectively adhere essentially only to the tacky, unexposed areas of the coating, providing a visual image corresponding to that in the stencil.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0083">The multi-photon photocuring composition preferably comprises photochemically effective amounts of (1) at least one multi-photon photosensitizer that is capable of simultaneously absorbing at least two photons and that has a two-photon absorption cross-section at least 1.5 times that of fluorescein (generally, greater than about 75×10<sup>−50 </sup>cm<sup>4 </sup>sec/photon, as measured by the method described by C. Xu and W. W. Webb in J. Opt. Soc. Am.

<p id="p-0063" num="0084">Preferably, a photosensitizer can also be selected based in part upon shelf stability consideration.

<p id="p-0074" num="0095">Another class of useful multi-photon photosensitizers are semiconductor nanoparticle quantum dots that are described in US2004/0067431 A1, the description of which is incorporated herein by reference. These include at least one type of semiconductor nanoparticle that has at least one electronic excited state that is accessible by absorption of two or more photons. More particularly, semiconductor nanoparticle quantum dots that can be used as multi-photon photosensitizers in the compositions of the invention include those that have at least one electronic excited state that is accessible by absorption (preferably, simultaneous absorption) of two or more photons. Preferably, the quantum dots are substantially soluble (thus, substantially non-agglomerated) in the reactive species. Preferred nanoparticle quantum dots generally exhibit solubility in the reactive species that is greater than about 1.0 percent by weight (preferably, greater than about 2.0 percent, more preferably, and more preferably greater than about 5.0 percent), based upon the total weight of all components of the photoreactive composition. The nanoparticle quantum dots are preferably sufficiently soluble in the reactive species that the photoreactive composition is optically clear when viewed by the human eye.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0096">Suitable nanoparticle quantum dots generally range in average diameter between about 1 nm and about 50 nm. Preferably, the nanoparticle quantum dots have an average diameter of at least about 1.5 nm; more preferably, at least about 2 nm. The nanoparticle quantum dots are preferably no greater than about 30 nm in average diameter; more preferably, no greater than about 10 nm. Nanoparticle quantum dots having a fairly narrow size distribution are preferred in order to avoid competitive one-photon absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0097">The nanoparticle quantum dots can comprise one or more semiconductor materials. Useful semiconductor materials include, for example, Group II-VI semiconductors (for example, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, MgTe, and the like), Group III-V semiconductors (for example, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InN, InP, InAs, InSb, A1As, A1P, A1Sb, A1S, and the like), Group IV semiconductors (for example, Ge, Si, and the like), Group I-VII semiconductors (for example, CuCl and the like), alloys thereof, and mixtures thereof (for example, ternary and quaternary mixtures). Preferred semiconductor nanoparticle quantum dots comprise a Group IV or a Group II-VI semiconductor (more preferably, a Group II-VI semiconductor, most preferably, a Group II-VI semiconductor comprising zinc or cadmium).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0098">Semiconductor nanoparticles (for example, monoelement semiconductors such as silicon or germanium and compound semiconductors such as GaAs, InP, CdSe, or ZnS) can be synthesized using a wet chemical process based on standard colloidal chemistry. The general synthesis involves the rapid addition (for example, by injection) of molecular precursors of the semiconductor (for example, dimethyl cadmium and trioctylphosphine selenide for CdSe) into a hot coordinating solvent (for example, an amine or phosphine) that can serve to control growth and prevent aggregation of the nanoparticles (see, for example, Murray et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115: 8706 (1993)). In view of the highly reactive nature of the precursors and/or to prevent or minimize oxidation of the growing nanoparticles, the synthesis is generally carried out in an inert atmosphere (for example, a nitrogen atmosphere).</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">ELECTRON DONOR COMPOUNDS</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0100">Electron donor compounds useful in the multi-photon photocuring composition of the photoreactive composition comprise those compounds (other than the photosensitizer itself) that are capable of donating an electron to an electronic excited state of the photosensitizer. Such compounds may be used, optionally, to increase the multi-photon photosensitivity of the photoinitiator system, thereby reducing the exposure required to effect photoreaction of the photoreactive composition. The electron donor compounds preferably have an oxidation potential that is greater than zero and less than or equal to that of p-dimethoxybenzene. Preferably, the oxidation potential is between about 0.3 and 1 volt vs. a standard saturated calomel electrode (“S.C.E.”).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0101">The electron donor compound is also preferably soluble in the reactive species and is selected based in part upon shelf stability considerations (as described above). Suitable donors are generally capable of increasing the speed of cure or the image density of a photoreactive composition upon exposure to light of the desired wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0102">In general, electron donor compounds suitable for use with particular photosensitizers and photoinitiators can be selected by comparing the oxidation and reduction potentials of the three components (as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,572 (Farid et al.), the description of which is incorporated herein by reference). Such potentials can be measured experimentally (for example, by the methods described by R. J. Cox, “Photographic Sensitivity,” Chapter 15, Academic Press (1973)) or can be obtained from references such as N. L. Weinburg, Ed., “Technique of Electroorganic Synthesis Part II Techniques of Chemistry,” Vol. V (1975), and C. K. Mann and K. K. Barnes, “Electrochemical Reactions in Nonaqueous Systems” (1970). The potentials reflect relative energy relationships and can be used as described in WO 01/96409 (PCT/US01/19164), the description of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

No. 5,545,676 at column 4, line 14 through column 5, line 18, which descriptions are incorporated herein by reference. Such electron donor compounds include amines (including triethanolamine, hydrazine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, triphenylamine (and its triphenylphosphine and triphenylarsine analogs), and aminoaldehydes, and aminosilanes), amides (including phosphoramides), ethers (including thioethers), ureas (including thioureas), sulfinic acid salts, salts of (alkyl)<sub>n</sub>(aryl)<sub>m</sub>borates (wherein n+m=4) (tetraalkylammonium salts being preferred), various organometallic compounds such as SnR<sub>4 </sub>compounds (where each R is independently chosen from among alkyl, aralkyl (particularly, benzyl), aryl, and alkaryl groups) (for example, such compounds as n—C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>Sn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, (allyl)Sn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and (benzyl)Sn(n—C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), ferrocene, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The electron donor compound can be unsubstituted or can be substituted with one or more non-interfering (with reaction of the reactive species) substituents. Particularly preferred electron donor compounds contain an electron donor atom (such as a nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, or sulfur atom) and an abstractable hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon or silicon atom alpha to the electron donor atom. Many examples of useful electron donor compounds are described in WO 01/96409, the description of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0104">Preferred electron donor compounds for free radical-induced reactions include amines that contain one or more julolidinyl moieties, alkylarylborate salts, and salts of aromatic sulfinic acids. However, for such reactions, the electron donor compound can also be omitted, if desired (for example, to improve the shelf stability of the photoreactive composition or to modify resolution, contrast, and reciprocity).</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">ELECTRON ACCEPTORS</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0105">Suitable electron acceptor compounds for the reactive species of the photoreactive compositions are those compounds (other than the photosensitizer itself) that are capable of being photosensitized by accepting an electron from an electronic excited state of a multi-photon photosensitizer, resulting in the formation of at least one free radical. Such electron acceptors include chloromethylated triazines (for example, 2-methyl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine, 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine, and 2-aryl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine), diazonium salts (for example phenyldiazonium salts optionally substituted with groups such as alkyl, alkoxy, halo, or nitro), sulfonium salts (for example, triarylsulfonium salts optionally substituted with alkyl or alkoxy groups, and optionally having 2,2′ oxy groups bridging adjacent aryl moieties), azinium salts (for example, an N-alkoxypyridinium salt), and triarylimidazolyl dimers (preferably, 2,4,5 triphenylimidazolyl dimers such as 2,2′, 4,4′,5,5′-tetraphenyl-1,1′-biimidazole, optionally substituted with groups such as alkyl, alkoxy, or halo), and the like, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0106">The electron acceptor is preferably soluble in the reactive species and is preferably shelf-stable (that is, does not spontaneously promote reaction of the reactive species when dissolved therein in the presence of the photosensitizer and the electron donor compound). Accordingly, selection of a particular electron acceptor can depend to some extent upon the particular reactive species, photosensitizer, and electron donor compound chosen, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0107">Preferred electron acceptors include chloromethylated triazines, triarylimidazolyl dimers (more preferably, 2,4,5-triphenylimidazolyl dimers), sulfonium salts, and diazonium salts. More preferred are chloromethylated triazines and the 2,4,5-triphenylimidazolyl dimers.</p>

The components of the invention can be combined under “safe light” conditions using any order and manner of combination (optionally, with stirring or agitation), although it is sometimes preferable (from a shelf life and thermal stability standpoint) to add the photoinitiator (electron acceptor) last (and after any heating step that is optionally used to facilitate dissolution of other components). Solvent can be used, if desired, provided that the solvent is chosen so as to not react appreciably with the components of the composition.

<p id="p-0103" num="0124">Prior to exposure, the resulting photoreactive compositions can be coated on a substrate, if desired, by any of a variety of coating methods known to those skilled in the art (including, for example, knife coating and spin coating). The substrate can be, for example, a film, sheet, or other surface depending upon the particular application and the method of exposure to be utilized. Preferred substrates are generally sufficiently flat to enable the preparation of a layer of photoreactive composition having a uniform thickness. For applications where coating is less desirable, the photoreactive compositions can alternatively be exposed in bulk form. Following coating, the reactive composition can, optionally, be soft baked (for example on a hot plate or in an oven) to remove some or all of the residual solvent. The substrate can be made of any suitable material (e.g., glass, fused silica, silicon, calcium fluoride) and can be chosen from a wide variety of films, sheets, wafers, and other surfaces, depending upon the particular application and the method of exposure to be utilized. The substrate can optionally be pre-treated with a primer (for example, silane coupling agents) to enhance adhesion of the photoreactive composition to the substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">SINGLE-PHOTON EXPOSURE SYSTEM AND ITS USE</heading>
<p id="p-0104" num="0125">Single-photon photoreactive compositions can be photopatterned using standard photolithography techniques such as contact or projection lithography (See for example W. Moreau, Semiconductor Lithography: Principles, Practices, and Materials (3<sup>rd </sup>Ed.), Plenum Press: New York, 1991). The light source can be any light source that produces actinic radiation (i.e., radiation capable of initiating a photoreaction process) and can, in practice, be any light source that provides sufficient intensity at a wavelength appropriate for the photoinitiator or photosensitizer used in the photoreactive composition. Such wavelengths are generally in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and can be in the range of about 150 to about 800 nm; preferably, from about 200 to about 600 nm; more preferably, from about 240 to about 500 nm. Exposure times generally depend upon the type of exposure system used to cause image formation (and its accompanying variables such as numerical aperture, geometry of light intensity spatial distribution, and average light intensity), as well as upon the nature of the photoreactive composition exposed.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">MULTI-PHOTON EXPOSURE SYSTEM AND ITS USE</heading>
<p id="p-0105" num="0126">Useful exposure systems for multi-photon curing include at least one light source (usually a pulsed laser) and at least one optical element. Suitable light sources include, for example, femtosecond near-infrared titanium sapphire oscillators (for example, a Coherent Mira Optima 900-F, Santa Clara, Calif.) pumped by an argon ion laser (for example, a Coherent Innova). This laser, operating at 76 MHz, has a pulse width of less than 200 fermtoseconds, is tunable between 700 and 980 nm, and has average power up to 1.4 Watts. However, in practice, any light source that provides sufficient intensity (to effect multi-photon absorption) at a wavelength appropriate for the photosensitizer (used in the photoreactive composition) can be utilized. (Such wavelengths can generally be in the range of about 300 to about 1500 nm; preferably, from about 600 to about 1100 nm; more preferably, from about 750 to about 850 nm. Peak intensities can generally range from at least about 10<sup>6 </sup>W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The upper limit of the pulse fluence is generally dictated by the ablation threshold of the photoreactive composition.) For example, Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers (for example, a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray PRO, Mountain View, Calif.), visible wavelength dye lasers (for example, a Spectral-Physics Sirah pumped by a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray PRO), and Q-switched diode pumped lasers (for example, a Spectra-Physics FCbar™) can also be utilized. Preferred light sources are near infrared pulsed lasers having a pulse length less than about 10<sup>−8 </sup>second (more preferably, less than about 10<sup>−9 </sup>second; most preferably, less than about 10<sup>−11 </sup>second). Other pulse lengths can be used provided that the above-detailed peak intensity and pulse fluence criteria are met.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0127">Optical elements useful in carrying out the method of the invention include refractive optical elements (for example, lenses and prisms), reflective optical elements (for example, retroreflectors or focusing mirrors), diffractive optical elements (for example, gratings, phase masks, and holograms), polarizing optical elements (for example, linear polarizers and waveplates), diffusers, Pockels cells, waveguides, waveplates, and birefringent liquid crystals, and the like. Such optical elements are useful for focusing, beam delivery, beam/mode shaping, pulse shaping, and pulse timing. Generally, combinations of optical elements can be utilized, and other appropriate combinations will be recognized by those skilled in the art. It is often desirable to use optics with large numerical aperture to provide highly-focused light. However, any combination of optical elements that provides a desired intensity profile (and spatial placement thereof) can be utilized. For example, the exposure system can include a scanning confocal microscope (BioRad MRC600, Thornwood, N.Y.) equipped with a 0.75 NA objective (Zeiss 20X Fluar, Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0128">Generally, multi-photon exposure of the photoreactive composition can be carried out using a light source (as described above) along with an optical system as a means for controlling the three-dimensional spatial distribution of light intensity within the composition. For example, the light from a pulsed laser can be passed through a focusing lens in a manner such that the focal point is within the volume of the composition. The focal point can be scanned or translated in a three-dimensional pattern that corresponds to a desired shape, thereby creating a three-dimensional image of the desired shape. The exposed or illuminated volume of the composition can be scanned either by moving the composition itself or by moving the light source (for example, moving a laser beam using galvo-mirrors).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0129">If the light induces, for example, a reaction of the reactive species that produces a material having solubility characteristics different from those of the reactive species, the resulting image can optionally be developed by removing either the exposed or the unexposed regions through use of an appropriate solvent, for example, or by other art-known means. Cured, complex, three-dimensional objects can be prepared in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0130">Exposure times generally depend upon the type of exposure system used to cause image formation (and its accompanying variables such as numerical aperture, geometry of light intensity spatial distribution, the peak light intensity during the laser pulse (higher intensity and shorter pulse duration roughly correspond to peak light intensity)), as well as upon the nature of the composition exposed (and its concentrations of photosensitizer, photoinitiator, and electron donor compound). Generally, higher peak light intensity in the regions of focus allows shorter exposure times, everything else being equal. Linear imaging or “writing” speeds generally can be about 5 to 100,000 microns/second using a laser pulse duration of about 10<sup>−8 </sup>to 10<sup>−15 </sup>second (preferably, about 10<sup>−11 </sup>to 10<sup>−14 </sup>second) and about 10<sup>2 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>pulses per second (preferably, about 10<sup>3 </sup>to 10<sup>8 </sup>pulses per second).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0131">As disclosed in Assignee's U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0068023A1, filed Oct. 2, 2002, (the description of photopatterners of structures of which is incorporated herein by reference), the single or multi-photon reactive radiation induces a reaction in the reactive composition that produces a material having solubility characteristics different from those of the unexposed reactive composition. The resulting pattern of exposed and unexposed material can then be developed by removing either the exposed or the unexposed regions with an appropriate solvent. An optional post exposure bake following exposure but prior to development may be required for certain photoreactive compositions. Reacted, complex, seamless three-dimensional structures can be prepared in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0132">The resulting structures can have any suitable size and shape, but the method of the invention is particularly well suited for adding a microstructure to a microstructured surface of an article. The structures can be formed on the surface of the article, or within or on a feature of the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0133">The photopatterned structure can be thermally treated (pyrolysis) to convert the pre-ceramic polymer to a ceramic material. Following the polymerization reaction, the resultant polymeric material is typically pyrolyzed to form the ceramic material. For example, depending on the conditions employed for the thermal treatment, amorphous or crystalline structures can be obtained. Amorphous structures are generally obtained particularly when the pyrolysis is carried out in a temperature range from about 700 to 1200° C., preferably from 900 to 1200° C. When the thermal treatment is carried out at higher temperatures, for instance from 1200 to 2000° C., preferably from 1500 to 2000° C., at least partially crystalline structures are typically obtained. Pyrolysis is typically carried out under a protective gas cover or a reaction gas cover (e.g., helium, argon, nitrogen, ammonia, etc.) or in a vacuum. Further, pyrolysis is typically performed for about 0.5 to 2 hours to convert the polymeric material to a ceramic material. Optionally, a ceramic material is subjected to additional processing following pyrolysis. For example, a stable body is typically obtained after a sintering procedure at temperatures of 900° C. up to 2000° C., preferably 1600-2000° C., for 0.5 to 2 hours or more.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0134">After sintering, the structure has a substantially inorganic composition and dimensions that are smaller than prior to the sintering step.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">UTILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0114" num="0135">Representative applications for these higher temperature resistant materials include patterned ceramic devices such as microcombustors, micro-heat-exchangers, sensor and actuator systems, microfluidic devices, and micro-optics systems that can be used independently or integrated into other systems, such as microelectromechanical systems. Ceramics that can resist high temperatures are a good alternative to conventional polymeric material because of their superior thermal properties, corrosion and chemical resistance, high modulus, and hardness.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0144">A mixture of 2,5-bis(chloromethyl)-1-methoxy-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzene (28.26 g), prepared essentially according to the procedure of U.S. Pat. No. 5,189,136 and triethyl phosphite (37.4 g) was heated to reflux for 6 hours. After cooling, the product was heated under high vacuum to remove residual triethyl phosphite. A thick oil was obtained which slowly crystallized after several days and was used without further purification in the following step. To a mixture of the thick oil (11.60 g), 4-diphenylaminobenzaldehyde (12.34 g), and dry tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) was added dropwise potassium t-butoxide (1.0 M in tetrahydrofuran, 44 mL). The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, then the solvent was removed under vacuum. Water (100 mL) was added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted several times with methylene chloride. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using 30/70 methylene chloride/hexane to give 14.44 g of Dye 1, bis-[4-(diphenylamino)stryl]-1-(2-ethyhexyloxy),4-(methoxy)benzene, as a bright green solid.

<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Curing Poly(vinylsilazanes) By Two-Photon Polymerization</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0145">Several drops of a mixture of VL20 (2.00 g), TMPTA (0.30 g), ITX (0.040 g), Dye 1 (0.011 g), and dichloromethane (0.26 g) were placed on each of three clean glass microscope slides between two strips of adhesive tape (SCOTCH 810 MAGIC TAPE, available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.) that were adhered to each slide approximately 1 cm apart. Glass cover slips were then placed over each mixture. Two-photon polymerization was performed using a diode pumped Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, Calif.) operating at a wavelength of 800 nm, nominal pulse width 45 fs, pulse repetition rate of 80 mHz, and beam diameter of approximately 1.5 mm. The optical train consisted of low dispersion turning mirrors, a beam expander, an optical attenuator to vary the optical power, an acousto-optic modulator as a shutter, and a computer controlled 2-axis (x-y axes) galvomirror scanning system mounted on a vertical z-axis stage. A 100X oil-immersion Plan Fluorite microscope objective (numerical aperture 1,4, available from Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, N.Y.) was used to focus the laser light into the sample. The position of the microscope objective was adjusted to set the focal point at the interface of the polymer composition and the glass slide. Under computer control, the focused laser was rastered to form a series of bars that were approximately 100 microns wide. The scan speed of the laser was varied from 0.67 mm per second to 43 mm per second and the average power of the laser was varied from approximately 7 mW to approximately 12 mW in order to determine the threshold writing speed as a function of average power. The threshold writing speed is the maximum scan speed at a given average power the provides a polymerized structure that remains intact following the development step described below. Following exposure of the samples to the laser, each sample was developed. Each glass slide was washed with acetone to remove unpolymerized poly(vinylsilazanes). After each glass slide was dried in air at room temperature, each was examined using an optical microscope. The data are given in Table 1.</p>

<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Ceramic Structure from One-Photon Polymerized Poly(vinylsilazanes)-Acrylate Composition</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0148">One side of a glass microscope slide was coated with NORLAND OPTICAL ADHESIVE 81 (available from Norland Products, Cranbury, N.J.) at a thickness of approximately 500 microns. The coating was irradiated through a shadow mask for 2 minutes using a light source comprising a Model 66001 lamp housing (available from Oriel Corp., Stratford, Conn.) and a Model USH-200DP lamp (available from USHIO America, Inc., Cypress, Calif.) that was approximately 4 inches (10 cm) from the coating. The sample was then developed by washing the slide in ethyl acetate to remove uncured adhesive. The sample was then dried in a stream of air for approximately 2 minutes to afford the glass slide with a pattern of cured adhesive on one side. A second glass slide was coated with 3M ESPE EXPRESS 7301 vinyl polysiloxane dental impression material (available from 3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn.) and this slide was pressed against the slide on which the adhesive was cured so that the EXPRESS dental impression material was in contact with the cured adhesive. The slides were held pressed together for approximately 5 minutes to allow the dental impression material to cure, after which time the slides were separated. The cured dental impression material retained the inverse of the pattern of the cured adhesive and provided a mold for the next step. A mixture of VL20 (4.00 g), TMPTA (0.55 g), tetravinylsilane (1.00 g), platinum(II) acetylacetonate (0.02 g), IRGACURE 819 (0.01 g), dicumyl peroxide (0.04 g), and dichloromethane (5 drops) was poured onto the cured dental impression material on the glass slide to fill the pattern with the mixture. The mixture was irradiated with the Model USH-200DP lamp in the Oriel housing for 2 minutes. After the irradiation was stopped, the sample was allowed to stand at room temperature for approximately 3 hours. The dental impression material mold was carefully peeled off of the cured polysilazanes layer. The cured polysilazanes layer was pyrolyzed in air in a model 3-550 oven (available from Neytech, Bloomfield, Conn.) by heating at a rate of 10° C. per minute to 600° C. for 2 hours, then at 800° C. for two hours, then at 1000° C. for two hours. The oven containing the sample was allowed to cool to room temperature and the ceramic structure was removed. The ceramic structure produced was an accurate replication of the mold. Other useful ceramic structures can be produced using an inert pyrolysing atmosphere.</p>
