<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-188498, filed Jun. 30, 2003, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a setup support system and setup support method, which can suitably be applied to, e.g., a server computer that constructs a RAID configuration by using a plurality of hard disk drives.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recent penetration of computers to offices and households is remarkable. Computers of this type requires setup including, e.g., installation of an operating system. This operation is cumbersome. Recently, standard setup is executed in advance before shipment from the manufacturer or selling agency, or a software installation support tool is packed together.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, an installation module described in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 5-289855 allows to install a basic OS only by power-ON.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A computer used as a server in an office often constructs a RAID configuration by using a plurality of hard disk drives instead of using a single hard disk drive, thereby increasing the fault tolerance. In this case, the operating system is installed in a hard disk drive after constructing the RAID configuration. On the other hand, the above-described installation module described in Japanese Patent Application No. 4-93214 has no consideration about initialization of the storage medium as the installation destination, i.e., construction of the RAID configuration at all.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For these reasons, installation support tools have recently been provided, which support, before installation of an operating system, construction of a RAID configuration or setting of a partition where the operating system should be installed. These tools are normally stored in a storage medium such as an optical disk and distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For an installation support tool which supports computer setup including installation of an operating system to be installed in a storage medium that requires initialization, as in construction of a RAID configuration, not only the storage medium and a storage medium that stores the installation support tool but also a storage medium such as a floppy disk (R) that requires no initialization is essential. The reason for this is as follows. Until initialization is ended, no data can be written/read in/from the storage medium as the installation destination. On the other hand, setting parameters representing the contents of various configuration setup designated by the user or status data representing the situation of progress must be stored in a storage medium before and during initialization.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, when the third storage medium is essential, the cost increases, resulting disadvantages for both the user and the manufacturer or selling agency.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To omit the third storage medium, the user may execute input for various kinds of setup in two steps, i.e., before and after initialization of the storage medium as the installation destination of the operating system. With these procedures, any situation that requires storage of setting parameters and status data in the storage medium before and during initialization can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, this method cannot meet the user requirement that all necessary input operations should be ended at once, e.g., at the start, and forces the user to waste time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a setup support system which supports setup of a computer, including installation of an operating system to be installed in a storage medium that requires initialization, comprises a physical access unit configured to execute physical access to the storage medium without intervening the operating system, an interface unit configured to execute input operations for configuration setup of the computer, including initialization of the storage medium, at once, a setting parameter management unit configured to store setting parameters representing input setting contents in the storage medium before initialization by using the physical access unit, a medium setting unit configured to initialize the storage medium after storage of the setting parameters by the setting parameter management unit, and a setup unit configured to read out the setting parameters stored in the storage medium by using the physical access unit after initialization of the storage medium by the medium setting unit, and execute setup of the computer, including installation of the operating system, based on the setting parameters.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the hardware configuration of a computer to which a setup support system according to the embodiment of the present invention is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This computer is a high-end computer used as a server in an office. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the computer comprises a CPU <b>11</b>, a bridge <b>12</b>, a system memory <b>13</b>, a local area network (LAN) controller <b>14</b>, a bridge <b>15</b>, a basic input/output system (BIOS)-ROM <b>16</b>, an optical disk drive (ODD) <b>17</b>, a keyboard controller <b>18</b>, a RAID card <b>19</b>, and a plurality of hard disk drives (HDDs) <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The CPU <b>11</b> controls the whole system and executes various kinds of programs including an operating system and utilities stored in the system memory <b>13</b> or a BIOS stored in the BIOS-ROM <b>16</b>. The bridge <b>12</b> connects the CPU bus and system bus as its primary function. The bridge <b>12</b> also has a function of a control device called a memory controller or graphic controller and executes access control for the system memory <b>13</b> or image display control for an externally connected display device. The system memory <b>13</b> is a storage medium serving as the main memory of the system. The system memory <b>13</b> temporarily stores various kinds of programs to be executed by the CPU <b>11</b> and their data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The LAN controller <b>14</b> is connected to the system bus that is connected to the CPU bus through the bridge <b>12</b>. The LAN controller <b>14</b> executes data communication with a plurality of client computers scattered in the office through a network constructed by, e.g., an Ethernet (R) system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The bridge <b>15</b> has, as its main function, a function of connecting the system bus to various I/O devices. The BIOS-ROM <b>16</b>, the ODD <b>17</b>, and the keyboard controller <b>18</b> are connected to the bridge <b>15</b>. The BIOS-ROM <b>16</b> stores a BIOS to drive and control, by software, various kinds of hardware incorporated in the system. The BIOS stored in the BIOS-ROM <b>16</b> has a physical access routine <b>101</b> (to be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ODD <b>17</b> is a control device to read out a program or data stored in, e.g., an optical disk or hard disk or write a program or data in a hard disk. This setup support system or an operating system to be installed is loaded in the computer by the ODD <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When an externally connected keyboard or mouse or various buttons including a power supply switch <b>181</b> prepared on the housing surface are operated by the user, the keyboard controller <b>18</b> stores data representing the operation contents in an internal register. The keyboard controller <b>18</b> then generates an interrupt signal to cause the CPU <b>11</b> to refer to the internal register, thereby transmitting the operation contents to the CPU <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The RAID card <b>19</b> is a control device that can construct various RAID configurations such as RAID0, RAID1, or RAID5 by using the plurality of HDDs <b>20</b>. The plurality of HDDs <b>20</b> that construct a RAID configuration under the control of the RAID card <b>19</b> store enormous quantities of programs and data as an external memory of the system, i.e., the auxiliary device of the system memory <b>13</b>. The operating system of this computer is installed in the HDDs <b>20</b> that construct a RAID configuration. This setup support system can appropriately support computer setup including installation of the operating system without requiring any extra storage medium such as a floppy disk, except the ODD <b>17</b> used to read a program for a distributed optical disk and HDDs <b>20</b> which require construction of a RAID configuration and correspond to the installation destination of the program and also without forcing the user to waste time. This will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a software configuration so as to explain the operation principle of setup support executed by the setup support system according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Assume that an optical disk A which stores the setup support system and an optical disk B which stores the operating system are packed together with the computer in shipping. Also, assume that the ODD <b>17</b> is set as the first device in the boot sequence by the BIOS function. This setup support system is constructed by two programs, i.e., a setup support utility <b>112</b> and physical access driver <b>113</b>. These programs are stored in the optical disk A together with a simple operating system <b>111</b> that has minimum functions for executing and controlling the programs. On the other hand, the optical disk B stores an OS setup module <b>121</b> as an installation support tool of an operating system <b>122</b> to be installed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Immediately after the power supply switch <b>181</b> is turned on, if the optical disk A is set in the ODD <b>17</b>, the simple operating system <b>111</b> stored in the optical disk A is activated. In addition, the setup support utility <b>112</b> and physical access driver <b>113</b> are activated under the control of the simple operating system <b>111</b>. The activated setup support utility <b>112</b> displays, e.g., a main menu window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When a setup icon a <b>1</b> is selected by a mouse on the main menu window, the setup support utility <b>112</b> starts a setup operation for constructing a RAID configuration, generating a partition, or installing the operating system <b>122</b>. The setup support utility <b>112</b> that has started the setup operation sequentially displays, e.g., windows for various kinds of configuration setup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a window on which the type of RAID configuration or the number of HDDs to be used for construction are selected. The user can select a desired configuration from three types, i.e., RAID0, RAID1, and RAID5 on the window. For example, when RAID0 should be constructed by using five HDDs <b>20</b>, the user selects a radio button a<b>2</b> by using the mouse. The user also selects the desired number of HDDs (since the settable number of HDDs is 5, “MAX” corresponds to 5) by a pull-down menu a<b>3</b>. When a button a<b>4</b> is selected by the mouse, the setup support utility <b>112</b> determines that RAID setting on this window is ended and displays the window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A button a<b>5</b> on the left side of the button a<b>4</b> or a button a<b>6</b> on the right side is clicked to return the display to the preceding window and execute the operation again. When the button a<b>5</b> is selected, the display can easily be returned to the immediately preceding window. When the button a<b>6</b> is selected, the display can easily be returned to the first window. The functions of the buttons a<b>4</b> to a<b>6</b> are common to all subsequent windows.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a window on which a partition where the operating system is to be installed is set. The user can select the partition size and file system on this window. For example, to select the FAT16 file system, the user selects a radio button a<b>7</b> by the mouse. When the FAT16 is selected, a partition size of 4,096 Mbytes is employed. The user need not input the partition size. When the button a<b>4</b> is selected by the mouse, the setup support utility <b>112</b> determines that disk partition setting on the window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is ended and displays the window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a window on which pieces of so-called user information are set, including the name of the user, the name of the company, and the name of the section to which the user belongs. The user inputs each information to a corresponding text box a<b>8</b> on this window by using the keyboard. When the button a<b>4</b> is selected by the mouse, the setup support utility <b>112</b> determines that setting of the user information on the window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is ended and displays the next window.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the configuration setup on all windows including those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> writes setting parameters representing the setting contents to the HDD <b>20</b> by using the physical access driver <b>113</b>. The physical access driver <b>113</b> has an interface to transmit/receive an instruction or data to/from the setup support utility <b>112</b>. On the basis of an instruction received from the setup support utility <b>112</b> through the interface, the physical access driver <b>113</b> executes physical access to the HDD <b>20</b>. That is, by using the physical access driver <b>113</b>, the setup support utility <b>112</b> can write/read data in/from the HDD <b>20</b> before construction of the RAID configuration and generation of the disk partition, i.e., initialization is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The physical access driver <b>113</b> is a program that executes physical access to the HDD <b>20</b> by invoking the physical access routine <b>101</b> in the BIOS <b>100</b>. In the data write, the physical access driver <b>113</b> receives the identifier of the HDD <b>20</b>, the write destination address, and the write data from the setup support utility <b>112</b> and invokes the physical access routine <b>101</b> by, e.g., the following format.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">INTxx, hardware identifier, write destination address, write data</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Then, the requested write is executed by the physical access routine <b>101</b>. The physical access driver <b>113</b> notifies the setup support utility <b>112</b> that the data write is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the data read, the physical access driver <b>113</b> receives the identifier of the HDD <b>20</b>, the read source address, and the data size from the setup support utility <b>112</b> and invokes the physical access routine <b>101</b> by, e.g., the following format.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">INTxx, hardware identifier, read source address, data size</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, data in the data size given as a parameter is returned from the physical access routine <b>101</b>. The physical access driver <b>113</b> returns the data to the setup support utility <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">By using the physical access driver <b>113</b>, the setup support utility <b>112</b> writes the setting parameters representing the configuration setup contents in the HDD <b>20</b> before construction of the RAID configuration. Then, the setup support utility <b>112</b> constructs the RAID configuration on the basis of the setting parameters. In this case, a RAID0 configuration using five HDDs <b>20</b> is constructed. At this time, the setup support utility <b>112</b> writes status data representing that construction of the RAID configuration is progressing in the HDD <b>20</b> by using the physical access driver <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When construction of the RAID configuration is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> rewrites the status data in the HDD <b>20</b> by using the physical access driver <b>113</b> to indicate that construction of the RAID configuration is ended, and reboots the system. After the reboot, the setup support utility <b>112</b> executes a physical read of the setting parameters and status data by using the physical access driver <b>113</b>. It can be seen from the readout status data that construction of the RAID configuration is ended. On the basis of the readout setting parameters, the setup support utility <b>112</b> generates the disk partition on the HDD <b>20</b> in which the RAID configuration is constructed. Even at this time, the setup support utility <b>112</b> writes status data representing that generation of the disk partition is progressing in the HDD <b>20</b> by using the physical access driver <b>113</b>. When the generation is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> rewrites the status data by using the physical access driver <b>113</b> to indicate that generation of the disk partition is ended. In this example, the FAT16 file system is generated, and a partition in a size of 4,096 Mbytes is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When construction of the RAID configuration and generation of the disk partition, i.e., initialization of the HDD <b>20</b> is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> writes the setting parameters and status data in the HDD <b>20</b> again as files under the simple operating system <b>111</b>. When initialization is ended, access to the HDD <b>20</b> can be executed as file access under the simple operating system <b>111</b>. The setup support utility <b>112</b> restores the setting parameters to data that is writable/readable by a normal program.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, the setup support utility <b>112</b> displays a window that prompts the user to set, in the ODD <b>17</b>, the optical disk B that stores the operating system <b>122</b> to be installed, and the like. When the user sets the optical disk B in the ODD <b>17</b> in response to the window display, the OS setup module <b>121</b> is activated. The setup support utility <b>112</b> transfers, to the OS setup module <b>121</b>, various kinds of setting information containing the user information represented by the setting parameters. On the basis of their contents, the OS setup module <b>121</b> installs the operating system <b>122</b>. After that, the OS setup module <b>121</b> reboots the system to activate the operating system <b>122</b> installed in the HDD <b>20</b> instead of the simple operating system <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart showing the operation procedures of setup support executed by the setup support system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">First, the setup support utility <b>112</b> sequentially displays the windows for various kinds of configuration setup and acquires the setting parameters at once (step S<b>1</b>). The setup support utility <b>112</b> writes the acquired setting parameters in the HDD <b>20</b> before initialization, which is the installation destination of the operating system <b>122</b>, by using the physical access driver <b>113</b> (step S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When this write is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> constructs the RAID configuration and generates the disk partition while accessing the setting parameters on the HDD <b>20</b> by using the physical access driver <b>113</b> (steps S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>). When construction of the RAID configuration and generation of the disk partition, i.e., initialization of the HDD <b>20</b> is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> restores the setting parameters to files under the operating system (step S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When restoration of the setting parameters is ended, the setup support utility <b>112</b> prompts the user to set, in the ODD <b>17</b>, the optical disk B which stores the OS setup module <b>121</b> and the operating system <b>122</b> to be installed. Various kinds of setting information are transferred to the thus activated OS setup module <b>121</b> so that the operating system <b>122</b> is installed (step S<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, this setup support system has the physical access driver <b>113</b> which executes physical access to the HDD <b>20</b> by invoking the physical access routine <b>101</b> in the BIOS <b>100</b>. With this arrangement, the setup support system allows computer setup including installation of the operating system <b>122</b> without requiring any extra storage medium except the HDD <b>20</b> as the installation destination of the operating system <b>122</b>. As a result, for example, no floppy disk (R) drive need be equipped, and the cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, since the physical access driver <b>113</b> is used, the user need not execute input for various kinds of setup in two steps, i.e., before and after initialization of the HDD <b>20</b> even when, e.g., the floppy disk (R) drive is omitted. That is, all input operations for various kinds of configuration setup can be ended at once at the start, as required by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, after initialization of the HDDs <b>20</b>, the setting parameters are converted into a file format accessible under the operating system <b>122</b>. For this reason, for example, a verification operation of referring to the setting parameters can also easily be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The above-described embodiment has been described assuming that the physical access driver <b>113</b> accesses the HDDs <b>20</b> of predetermined type. When, various kinds of HDDs <b>20</b> including, e.g., IDE, SCSI, and SCSI-RAID are used, and one of the HDDs can arbitrarily be selected as the installation destination of the operating system <b>122</b>, a parameter representing the HDD type may be exchanged between the physical access driver <b>113</b> and the setup support utility <b>112</b>. The physical access driver <b>113</b> may give the received parameter to the physical access routine <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
