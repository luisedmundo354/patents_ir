<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Microfluidic systems, that is, systems or devices having channels or chambers that are fabricated on the micron or submicron scale, are used to perform a multitude of chemical and physical processes on a micro-scale. Individual components of the microfluidic systems can be used alone or together, for example, to control or measure the transport of fluid inside microchannels. Typical applications for microfluidic systems include analytical and medical instrumentation, industrial process control equipment, and liquid and gas phase chromatography. In these systems, methods to reliably aliquot volumes of sample from one conduit into a second conduit are important for performance of the analysis. In some cases, sample volumes as small as 1 nL are required for analysis, which is a volume too small to be reliably dispensed by known macroscale methods, such as conventional valves or pipettes. It would be advantageous to have a microfluidic system that could be used with a wide range of processes and process liquids and could be fabricated on a microchip platform. It would also be advantageous to have a device with a fast response time and precise control over small sample volumes and flows.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microfluidic control devices, such as microvalves manufactured from silicon or elastomers, including devices fabricated from hydrogels, soft elastomers with control lines embossed in a substrate, and devices fabricated with structures that are free to move within microchannels are currently known. More information on these devices can be found in Shoji and Esashi, J., <i>Micromech. Microeng</i>., 4, 157-171, 1994; Beebe et al., <i>Nature</i>, 404, 588-590, April, 2000; Unger et al., <i>Science</i>, 288, 113-116, April, 2000; and Rehm et al., <i>uTAS </i>2001, 227-229, October, 2001. Disadvantageously, however, these devices suffer from one or more of the disadvantages of not being easily integrated into microchip platforms, have excess dead volume, high power requirements, slow response times, are difficult and costly to manufacture and assemble, are able to withstand only modest pressure differentials, are restricted to a narrow range of processes and process liquids, are subject to solvent-induced deformation effects, exhibit performance variations from minor variations in material properties, and respond poorly to solvent-induced shrinkage and swelling.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, there is a need for a microfluidic control device that has a fast response time, precise control over small gas and liquid flows, and precise control over small gas and liquid volumes in the channels and chambers of microfluidic systems. There is also a need for a microfluidic control device that can be integrated into a microchip platform and is compatible with a wide range of chemical solvents that are used in microfluidic systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the present invention, a device for microfluidic control is provided. The device comprises a conduit having a first end and a second end, a first path in fluid flow contact with the conduit, a second path in fluid flow contact with the conduit, and a regulator that is moveable in the conduit. The regulator has an outer dimension that is larger than the first end and the second end so the regulator cannot pass out of the conduit and is comprised of a substantially elastic material having a structural component, which can be a composite polymer formed from a composite mixture comprising a polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler. The composite mixture can additionally comprise a photo-initiator, and/or two or more polymerizable precursors. Optionally, the device can have a plurality of paths, such as first, second, and third paths, where each path is in fluid flow contact with the conduit, and/or a plurality of regulators that are movable in a conduit. The regulator can be substantially incompressible, have optical properties, and/or have a substantially stable volume when exposed to a fluid. Further, the regulator can be formed from a composite mixture in the conduit by the in situ polymerization of the composite mixture with an energy source. The composite mixture can additionally comprise a photo-initiator and the energy source can be a radiating light source. The regulator can also be substantially cylindrically shaped and moveable in a back and forth motion or reciprocating motion within the conduit. Alternately, the regulator can be substantially toothed wheel shaped and rotationally moveable within the conduit. The device can additionally comprise a substrate where the conduit, and/or a plurality of conduits are in the substrate. Optionally, the substrate can have an axle and the regulator can be substantially toothed wheel shaped and rotationally moveable around the axle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system for microfluidic control comprising a plurality of conduits is also provided, where each conduit has a first end and a second end, a first path in fluid flow contact with one or more conduit, a second path in fluid flow contact with one or more conduit, and a plurality of regulators, each regulator being independently moveable in a separate conduit. Each regulator has an outer diameter that is larger than the first end and the second end so each regulator cannot pass out of the conduit, and is comprised of a substantially elastic material having a structural component.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The device can be fabricated by combining a polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler to form a composite mixture, introducing the composite mixture into a conduit, and exposing the conduit to an energy source to polymerize the composite mixture in situ thereby forming a regulator. The composite mixture can additionally comprise a photo-initiator and the conduit can be exposed to a radiating light source through a mask to form the regulator. Additionally, the device can have two or more regulators within each conduit, and/or unpolymerized composite mixture can be removed from the conduit. Optionally, a substrate having a plurality of conduits can be selected and the composite mixture can be introduced into each conduit, thereby forming a plurality of regulators. The substrate can have three or more conduits and the composite mixture can be introduced into three or more conduits to form three or more regulators on the same substrate. One or more of the conduits can be exposed to a radiating light to form one or more substantially cylindrically shaped regulators and each substantially cylindrically shaped regulator can be moveable in a back and forth motion within the conduit. Alternately, one or more of the conduits can be exposed to a radiating light to form one or more substantially toothed wheel shaped regulators and each substantially toothed wheel shaped regulator can be rotationally moveable within the conduit. The substrate can additionally have an axle and the conduit can be exposed to a radiating light to form a substantially toothed wheel shaped regulator around the axle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The device can be used for determining a fluid flow rate in a microfluidic device by moving a fluid with a viscosity past a regulator, thereby moving the regulator at the fluid flow rate. A radiating light is directed to a portion of the regulator such that the radiating light is reflected or transmitted to a detector and the reflected or transmitted light is measured as a periodic signal in time. Then, the signal is processed and the frequency of the signal is determined, followed by relating the signal frequency to the fluid flow rate. The radiating light can be reflected or transmitted to a plurality of detectors. Also, a plurality of radiating lights can be directed to the regulator and the radiating lights can be reflected or transmitted to a plurality of detectors. A device for microfluidic control as described above having a substantially toothed wheel shaped regulator can be used to determine fluid flow rate and the radiating light can be directed to a toothed portion of the regulator such that the radiating light is reflected or transmitted to the detector.</p>

Further, the microfluidic control device of the present invention has a fast response time and precise control over small gas and liquid flows and small gas and liquid volumes in the channels and chambers of the microfluidic system. Further, the microfluidic control device can be integrated into a substrate, such as a microchip platform.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A and 1B</figref>, there is schematically shown a microfluidic control device <b>10</b> where the device is a composite check valve according to the present invention. The device comprises a conduit <b>11</b> having a first end <b>12</b> and a second end <b>13</b>. The conduit has a first path <b>14</b> and a second path <b>15</b> that are in fluid flow contact with the conduit <b>11</b>. The device also has a regulator <b>16</b> that is moveable in the conduit <b>11</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, and <b>1</b>C, the regulator <b>16</b> has an outer dimension <b>17</b> that is larger than the first end <b>12</b> and the second end <b>13</b> so the regulator <b>16</b> cannot pass out of the conduit <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows the cross-sectional configuration of the regulator <b>16</b> at position A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, which illustrates the outer dimension <b>17</b> of the regulator <b>16</b>. The regulator <b>16</b> is comprised of a substantially elastic material having a structural component which can be a composite polymer formed from a composite mixture comprising a polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A and 1B</figref>, the regulator <b>16</b> is a composite check valve comprising a conduit <b>11</b> having walls fabricated in such a way that the shape of the conduit <b>11</b> encloses the regulator <b>16</b>. The regulator <b>16</b> is movable in the conduit in a reciprocating, that is, a back and forth, or piston-like motion. The motion of the regulator <b>16</b> is stopped by an altered conduit geometry. The altered conduit geometry creates a barrier, also referred to herein as a weir, in the conduit <b>11</b> so that the regulator <b>16</b> cannot pass out of the conduit. In a preferred, but not required embodiment, the geometry of the conduit <b>11</b> is altered by changing the depth, width, diameter or shape of the conduit, or inserting another material between the regulator <b>16</b> and the conduit <b>11</b>, such as a porous membrane, that allows fluid flow but prevents the regulator <b>16</b> from passing out of the conduit. In a most preferred but not required embodiment, the regulator <b>16</b> is a sliding piece that is substantially cylindrically shaped moved by or moving against fluid pressure in a back and forth motion within a cylindrically shaped conduit <b>11</b>. The movement of the regulator <b>16</b> is stopped by narrowing the diameter of the conduit <b>11</b>. However, other regulator and conduit geometries can be used for stopping the motion of the regulator, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The device <b>10</b> can additionally comprise an interconnecting conduit <b>18</b> that provides a route for fluid to be redirected around the regulator <b>16</b> when the regulator <b>16</b> is seated against the conduit second end <b>13</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, fluid does not pass through the conduit <b>11</b> when the regulator <b>16</b> is seated against the conduit first end <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>D, which schematically show microfluidic control devices according to the present invention, where the device is a composite check valve with an integrated flow path. According to this embodiment, a detached flow path <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A and 1B</figref>, is not needed for fluid flow. The device <b>30</b> comprises a conduit <b>31</b> having a first end <b>32</b> and a second end <b>33</b>. The conduit has a first path <b>34</b> that is in fluid flow contact with the conduit <b>31</b> and a second path <b>35</b> that is in fluid flow contact with the conduit <b>31</b>. The device also has a regulator <b>36</b> that is moveable in the conduit. The regulator has an outer diameter <b>37</b> that is larger than the first end <b>32</b> and the second end <b>33</b> so the regulator <b>36</b> cannot pass out of the conduit <b>31</b>. The regulator <b>36</b> is comprised of a substantially elastic material having a structural component. In a preferred but not required embodiment, the regulator <b>36</b> is a composite polymer obtained by photoinitiated polymerization of a mixture of particulate filler and one or more polymerizable precursors.</p>

A gap between the second end <b>33</b> and the regulator <b>36</b> allows unobstructed fluid flow between the first path <b>34</b>, which is an inlet, and the second path <b>35</b>, which is an outlet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the device stopping fluid flow in the opposite direction. Fluid entering from the second end <b>35</b> actuates the regulator <b>36</b> until its rests against the first end <b>32</b>. The fluid path is blocked and no flow is allowed from the second path <b>35</b> to the first path <b>34</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C and 2D</figref>, which schematically show an embodiment of the invention where there is no conduit end directly between the second path <b>35</b> and the regulator <b>36</b>. According to this embodiment, the second end <b>33</b>, which is a side weir, provides the same functionality as the second end <b>33</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>

In this system, multiple regulators are combined to create a system used for dispensing fluid from a sample source, that is, a sample dispenser. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 3B</figref> show a system comprising a conduit <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b> where each conduit <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b> has a first end <b>44</b>, <b>45</b>, and <b>46</b>, respectively, and a second end <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>49</b>, respectively. A first path <b>50</b>, from a sample source, is in fluid flow contact with the conduit <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b>, respectively. A second path <b>51</b>, from a fluid source, is in fluid flow contact with the conduit <b>41</b> and <b>43</b>, respectively. A flow path <b>55</b> is in fluid flow contact with an actuation source. Each regulator <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, and <b>54</b> is moveable in the conduit <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b>, respectively, and the outer diameter of each regulator <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, and <b>54</b> is larger than the first end <b>44</b>, <b>45</b>, and <b>46</b>, respectively, and the second end <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>49</b>, respectively, so each regulator cannot pass out of the respective conduit <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b>.

According to a preferred but not required embodiment, the sample source can be a reservoir of a sample fluid, a system of channels containing a sample fluid, or an external connection to the device containing a sample fluid, such as a syringe. The actuation source is a source of pressure and/or a vacuum used to actuate the primary piston. However, the system can have other configurations for loading and delivering samples and the sample source can be other fluid containing devices, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Now referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 3B</figref>, the system <b>40</b> additionally comprises an excess fluid outlet <b>58</b> that can be a conduit leading to a waste reservoir, or can be a conduit connected to a vacuum source, or a conduit connected to the actuation source.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A and 5B</figref>, a device <b>70</b> for microfluidic control where the device has a substantially toothed shaped regulator, or a gear, that is, a mechanism that performs a function in a machine, is shown. The device comprises a conduit <b>71</b> having a first end <b>72</b> and a second end <b>73</b>. The conduit <b>71</b> has a first path <b>74</b> and a second path <b>75</b> in fluid flow contact with the conduit <b>71</b>. The device also has a regulator <b>76</b> that is substantially toothed shaped and moveable in the conduit <b>71</b>, and the regulator <b>76</b> has an outer diameter <b>77</b> that is larger than the first end <b>72</b> and the second end <b>73</b> so the regulator <b>76</b> cannot pass out of the conduit <b>71</b>.

In a most preferred but not required embodiment, the device <b>70</b> additionally comprises a substrate having an axle <b>78</b>, also referred to herein as an axis or center peg, and the regulator <b>76</b> is rotationally movable around the axle. However, the regulator can have other gear configurations that surround a central point or pin, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A and 5B</figref>, in a preferred but not required embodiment, the device can be used as a flowmeter.

When the fluid flows past the regulator <b>76</b>, viscous drag from the fluid flow in the conduit can turn the regulator <b>76</b> at a rate that is a function of the fluid flow. A light source <b>79</b> can be used to measure the rotation of the regulator <b>76</b>, which can be measured by examining the reflected (or transmitted) light incident on a portion of the regulator <b>76</b> with a detector <b>80</b>, such as a photo sensor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a mask <b>81</b> with a window <b>82</b> can be used to ensure that light is incident only on a region where the teeth of the toothed wheel shaped regulator will be visible. As the regulator <b>76</b> turns, and the teeth pass by the window <b>81</b>, a measured signal of light reflected by the teeth will be periodic in time. In a preferred but not required embodiment, the device does not aliquot fixed volumes of fluid and the regulator can rotate freely in a moving fluid stream. As will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the flow meter can operate with other types and arrangement of detectors, such as using a magnetic filler in the regulator and sensing the motion of regulator <b>76</b> with a magnetic sensor, for example as used in a Hall field sensor.</p>

In this fashion, the two detectors are sequentially illuminated as the regulator <b>76</b> rotates. In the illumination sequence, the signal from the first detector <b>80</b> changes prior to that from the second detector, or vice versa, providing the direction of rotation and hence the direction of the flow. As will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, an increased flowrate resolution can be obtained through the addition of a second, a third, and more detectors. Also, a second, a third, and more sources of light can also be added to the device. Additional detectors can be arranged along an arc that is parallel to the arc of rotation of regulator <b>76</b>, and where the angular spacing of the detectors along this arc does not match the angle between the teeth on regulator <b>76</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the regulator is a substantially elastic material having a structural additive or component structure. The regulator can be a composite polymer formed from the polymerization of a composite mixture comprising a polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler. The regulator is movable in the conduit, that is, the regulator will not bond to the surrounding conduit walls or surrounding structures and is free to move or rotate inside the conduit. The regulator is also confined within regions of the conduit, as defined by specific features in the device geometry. In a preferred but not required embodiment, the regulator is formed by the in situ polymerization of the composite mixture in the conduit. In a more preferred but not required embodiment, the in situ polymerization is effected by light exposure or heating. In a most preferred but not required embodiment, the composite mixture is polymerized by the in situ photo-initiated and lithographically defined polymerization of a polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler in the conduit. According to this embodiment, the composite mixture is polymerized in situ in the shape of a mask by exposing a region of the conduit to a radiating light through the mask. The use of a mask allows fabrication of regulators with irregular and arbitrary geometry inside the channel. Furthermore, since the regulators do not bond to the surrounding conduit walls or surrounding structures, the regulators are moveable in the conduit. For example, the regulator can move in a back and forth motion within the conduit, or the regulator can be rotationally movable in the conduit. When the regulator is formed by photo-initiated polymerization of the composite mixture in situ, optical access to the composite mixture in the conduit region of polymerization is provided. When the regulator is formed by in situ polymerization by thermal or other radiative means, optical access is not necessarily provided.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The composite mixture is comprised of one or more polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler and can additionally comprise a polymerization initiator, such as a photo-initiator, and one or more solvents. The composite mixture can be in the form of a slurry, that is, a liquid containing a particulate filler that may not necessarily be suspended, such as with a particulate filler having a particle size of between about 100 nm and about 100 μm; a colloidal suspension, such as with a particulate filler having a particle size range of between about 1 nm and 100 nm); and a free-flowing liquid. However, the composite mixture can have other forms as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The polymerizable precursor can be any of various monomer materials, such as butanediol diacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, divinyl benzene, ethylene glycol diacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetracrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, heptafluorobutyl acrylate, trifluoroethylacrylate, and combinations of the preceding monomers. In a preferred but not required embodiment, the polymerizable precursor is hexanediol diacrylate. However, other polymerizable precursors that are capable of forming a composite polymer can be used according to the present invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The particulate filler can be in the form of a particle, bead, powder, fumed ceramic, fiber, floc, and other structural material, and a combination of the preceding particulate fillers. The particulate filler can be encapsulated, that is, chemically non-bonded with the surrounding polymer. Alternately, the particulate filler can bond directly to the surrounding polymer. The size of the particulate filler is selected to be less than the smallest dimension of the conduit and can be as small as several nanometers. The composition of the particulate filler can be a glass, ceramic, metals and metal oxides, polymer, carbon black, and combinations of the preceding fillers. The surfaces of the particulate can be modified to control hydrophobicity, reactivity, etc., for example an acrylate-modified silica. In a preferred but not required embodiment, the particulate filler is selected from the group consisting of a silica, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, titania, such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, alumina, such as AlO<sub>x</sub>, zirconia, such as ZrO<sub>x</sub>, magnetically permeable matearials, such as colloidal iron and iron-nickel alloys, mica, glass, and polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(methyl methacrylate), latex, polystyrene, and combinations of the preceding fillers. In a more preferred embodiment, the particulate filler is silica. However, other forms, sizes, and compositions of the particulate fillers can be used according to the present invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a particulate filler can be selected such that the composite polymer regulator is substantially incompressible as compared to a monolithic polymer regulator. The particulate filler can occupy a substantial fraction of the volume of the regulator and the particulate filler can be selected such that the particulate filler is selected to have a higher modulus of elasticity than that of a monolithic polymer. According to the present invention, when the composite polymer regulator is under compression, the compaction of the regulator is limited to a value greater than the filler volume fraction, thereby resulting in increased durability of the regulator under high compressive forces. In a preferred but not required embodiment, a composite polymer regulator will not exceed the bulk polymer elastic limit of the polymer and the composite polymer regulator will be substantially resistant to creep when a compressive force is applied to the composite polymer regulator. However, polymers with other compressive properties can be used according to the present invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to another embodiment, the particulate filler or other additives, such as dyes, etc., can be selected to add specific optical properties to a composite polymer regulator. Micro-scale polymer devices can disappear when immersed in a liquid. The use of a particulate filler in the composite mixture results in a composite polymer regulator that can exhibit amplified light scattering and/or light-absorbing and/or fluorescent properties as compared to a monolithic polymer. When a regulator with an optical property is desired, a particulate filler can be selected that is naturally colored and/or that has a refractive index substantially different than that of the bulk polymer and/or that is fluorescent. For example, light reflected, absorbed, or fluoresced from a regulator can be used as a diagnostic to obtain information on the location or orientation or motion of the regulator. Regulators having optical properties can be used in a sensing system, such as with a microfluidic control device that is used as a flow meter. According to the present invention, the particulate filler can be varied to modify other properties of the composite polymer, such as the volume and type of particulate filler can be varied to modify the friction coefficient of the regulator, and the volume and type of filler can be varied to improve the polymerization resolution of the regulator, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a particulate filler can be selected such that the composite polymer has a substantially stable volume when exposed to various fluid compositions, that is, the composite polymer will have reduced or no dimensional change in response to variations in fluid composition, as compared to a monolithic polymer. Micro-scale polymer devices that are immersed in liquid can be prone to solvent-induced dimensional change due to the chemical interaction of the polymer surface with ions in the fluid, that is, the shape and size of the polymer can change with exposure to fluids of varying polarity. This behavior can limit the practical usefulness of polymer devices to perform reliable mechanical functions. According to the present invention, an amount and a composition of a particulate filler can be selected and added to the composite mixture, prior to polymerization, such that the composite polymer containing the selected particulate filler will have reduced or no dimensional change in response to variations in fluid composition. However, composite polymers with other volumetric properties, such as other dimensional change properties, can be used according to the present invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a solvent can be combined with the polymerizable precursor and the particulate filler.

In a more preferred but not required embodiment, the solvent is methanol. However, other solvents can be used according to the present invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a polymerizing element can be combined with the polymerizable precursor and the particulate filler. The polymerizing element can include any of various common polymerization initiators and combinations thereof, such as azobisisobutyronitrile, azobisdihydrochloride, benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, potassium persulfate, and other common free radical thermal-and photo-initiators. In a preferred but not required embodiment, the polymerizing element is a photo-initiator. In a more preferred embodiment, the polymerizing element is azobisisobutyronitrile. However, other polymerizing elements can be used according to the present invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to another embodiment of the present invention is a method of making a device for microfluidic control. The method comprises combining a polymerizable precursor and a particulate filler to form a composite mixture. Then, the composite mixture is introduced into the conduit.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a preferred but not required embodiment, the above-described methods for making a device for microfluidic control can be used to fabricate a regulator in a conduit where the conduit can be actuated by pressure. In another preferred embodiment, the above-described methods for making a device for microfluidic control can be used to fabricate fluidic components such as a valve and a flow meter inside a network of microfluidic channels. The method of making a device for microfluidic control can be used to fabricate composite polymer gears inside a conduit. This can be accomplished by fabricating a gear around a center point, which can be a pin or axle formed in the substrate. However, the above described methods for making a device for microfluidic control can be used to fabricate other components for microfluidic control as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for microfluidic control. The method comprises selecting a device for microfluidic control, where the device comprises a conduit having a first path and a second path that are in fluid flow contact with the conduit, and a regulator, where the regulator is movable in the conduit and the conduit is sized so the regulator cannot pass out of the conduit. Then, fluid is placed into the conduit. Next, the regulator is moved by the application of a pressurizing force to direct or stop the fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a preferred but not required embodiment, the fluid is placed in the conduit by injecting the fluid into the conduit. According to the present invention, the initial state of operation of the device is a load state. In the load state, a fluid fills an open conduit between the first path, which is a fluid inlet, and a second path, which is a fluid outlet. The injection can be performed from this initial load state. However, the injection can be performed by other methods, such as with the fluid inlet and fluid outlet at varying pressures, as will be understood by those of skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>

Now referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 3B</figref>, the method comprises injecting a sample into the device when the device is in a load state. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the regulator <b>53</b>, which is a primary piston, is drawn against the second end <b>48</b> of the conduit <b>42</b> when the device is in the load state. Then, the sample is injected into the device through the flow path <b>50</b> at the first end <b>44</b> of the conduit <b>41</b>. Next, the regulator <b>53</b> is actuated by applying a positive pressure, or a pressure that is greater than that of the adjoining conduits through flow path <b>55</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Next, the regulator <b>53</b> is moved down the sample chamber <b>402</b> and an associated fluid flow and pressure are generated in front of the regulator <b>53</b> which moves the regulator <b>52</b> and closes is an inlet check valve <b>401</b>, and also moves regulator <b>54</b> and opens outlet check valve <b>403</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.

The injection is completed when the regulator <b>53</b> reaches the first end <b>45</b> of the conduit <b>56</b> at the end of the sample chamber <b>402</b>. Any fluid from the actuation source that continues to flow into the actuation inlet can be diverted to the excess fluid outlet <b>58</b> and an equilibrium pressure can be reached behind the primary piston that will be a function of the hydrodynamic flow resistance of the excess fluid outlet and ability of the actuation source to deliver said pressure at that flow rate. The volume of sample injected into the analysis column can be approximately equal to the original open volume in the sample chamber <b>402</b>. The method of using the device to deliver a sample can be performed at other pressures, including vacuum, at the fluid outlet <b>58</b>, the sample inlet, and in the analysis column <b>59</b>, that are of any value less than the pressure at the actuation source inlet.</p>

A sample fluid is drawn from plow path <b>50</b> through the first end <b>44</b> of the conduit <b>41</b>, which is a sample inlet, and an open conduit path is created between the sample inlet and an excess fluid outlet <b>58</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Additional suction can be applied to the excess fluid outlet <b>58</b> to flush the sample chamber <b>402</b> with multiple volumes of sample in order to ensure the sample chamber <b>402</b> contains pure sample fluid. This step can also be performed with a separate cleaning/flushing fluid in the sample reservoir in order to clean the device prior to insertion of a new sample fluid. In an alternate embodiment, the excess fluid outlet <b>58</b> and flow path to the actuation inlet <b>56</b> can be connected to achieve the same effect. The sample inlet, analysis column inlets and outlets can be at various pressures above the actuation inlet/excess fluid outlet pressure in order to achieve this process.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another embodiment, the pressure in the analysis column <b>59</b> can be the highest pressure in the system at that time, leading to the outlet check valve <b>403</b> closing immediately after the injection state is terminated. This procedure leads to an alternate method of filling the sample chamber and achieving the load state. Now referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 3B</figref>, when the actuation inlet and excess fluid outlet are at or near atmospheric pressure and the pressure in the analysis column is above the sample inlet pressure, the regulator <b>53</b>, which is a primary piston, is in an ‘inject’ state, where the regulator is drawn against the first end <b>45</b> of the conduit <b>42</b>. Applying a positive pressure differential to the sample inlet forces the inlet check valve <b>401</b> to open and the regulator <b>53</b> moves toward the actuation inlet <b>56</b>. The outlet check valve <b>403</b> remains closed due to the higher pressure in the analysis column <b>59</b>. The sample fluid flows through the opened conduit path <b>41</b> and fills the sample chamber <b>402</b>. When the primary piston reaches the second end <b>48</b> of the conduit <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sample fluid flows through the sample chamber and out the excess fluid outlet. The excess fluid outlet can be connected to the second end <b>48</b> of the conduit <b>42</b> in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which is a flow chart showing the method of using a device according to the present invention as a flowmeter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the method comprises selecting a device having a substantially toothed wheel regulator, according to the present invention. Then, a fluid with a viscosity is passed by the regulator, thereby turning the regulator at a fluid flow rate. Next, a radiating light is directed to a toothed portion of the regulator and the radiating light is reflected or transmitted to a detector, such as a photo-sensor. Next, the reflected or transmitted light is measured as a periodic signal in time. Next, the signal is processed and the frequency of the signal is determined and related to the fluid flow rate as a function of the fluid viscosity. In one embodiment, multiple regulators of varying dimensions and conduit cross-sections can be used in succession to widen the dynamic range of the measurement and improve measurement accuracy.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The composite mixture was prepared by mixing the ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate, SR454, available from Sartomer Corporation, Exton, Pa., US and the trifluoroethylacrylate, 2,2,2 TFEA, available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., US to form a monomer mixture. Then, the photo-initiator, 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile, AIBN, (5 mg) available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., US was added to the monomer mixture. A solvent mixture was prepared by combining the dioxane, available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., US and the 2-methoxyethanol, available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., US The monomer mixture and solvent mixture were then mixed in a 8:2 volume:volume ratio, that is, 800 μL of the monomer mixture was mixed with 200 μL of the solvent mixture. A particulate filler of 1 μm diameter, non-porous silica particles (10 wt %), available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., US, was then added to the monomer mixture and solvent mixture to create a suspension/slurry of monomer, solvent, and particles.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Incompressibility of Composite Polymers</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A particulate filler was selected such that the composite polymer regulator was substantially incompressible, as compared to a monolithic polymer regulator. As a comparative example, a regulator comprising a monolithic polymer was substantially extruded through a fine passage when the regulator was subjected to a 10,000 psi high compressive force. Whereas, a regulator comprising a composite polymer containing a 50% silica particulate filler, prepared according to the present invention, compressed to about 50% of the initial volume. This degree of compression did not exceed the bulk polymer elastic limit of the polymer and the regulator part was substantially resistant to extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As a further example, the compressive strength of Nylon 6,6 and compared to the compressive strength of a composite polymer prepared with Nylon 6,6 according to the present invention. The compressive strength of Nylon 6,6 was tested and at 10% compression, the compressive strength was about 12,000 psi. Whereas, a composite polymer prepared according to the present invention with 30% glass-filled Nylon 6,6 was tested and the compressive strength at 10% compression was about 39,000 psi.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Volume Stability Of Composite Polymers</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A particulate filler was selected such that the composite polymer had a substantially stable volume when exposed to various fluid compositions, that is, the composite polymer had reduced or no dimensional change in response to variations in fluid composition, as compared to a monolithic polymer. As a comparative example, a monomer mixture containing ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate and trifluoroethylacrylate in an 80:20 volume:volume ratio was mixed with methoxyethanol in a 50:50 volume:volume ratio. Trace amounts of azobisisobutyronitrile, a photoinitiator, was added and the mixture was photopolymerized. When the resulting monolithic polymer was placed in water, the element shrank to 55% of its original volume. Whereas, following the same procedure, and adding 7 wt % of particles of colloidal antimony pentoxide, with an outer diameter of 7-11 nm, to the mixture, the polymerized composite polymer shrank by only 20% of its original volume.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLE IV</heading>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Microfluidic Control Device</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A regulator that was used as a composite piston was formed by introducing the composite mixture from Example I into a 150 μm inner diameter optically transparent silica capillary by injecting the composite mixture into the capillary with a syringe. A 2 mm length of the capillary was then exposed to broadband ultraviolet radiation, peaking at around 365 nm with total energy flux of 40 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, for 30 seconds. Upon exposure to the ultraviolet radiation, a composite particle-filled solid polymer piston with a length dimension of 2 mm and a width dimension that is approximately equal to the inner diameter of the surrounding capillary was formed. The composite piston did not bond to the surrounding capillary and was thus free floating. The piston was mobilized by applying between about 1 psi to about 5 psi of pressure to one terminal end of this first capillary. An adjoining second capillary, having a 25 μm inner diameter, was connected to the second terminal of the first capillary. The composite piston within the first capillary was pushed against the adjoining capillary and put under pressure in excess of 2000 psi with little to no damage or permanent distortion to the composite piston. Ejecting the composite piston from the first capillary and examining the composite piston under a microscope confirmed the geometry of the composite piston. The composite piston was iteratively exposed to acetonitrile, methanol, isopropanol, water, and aqueous buffers with pH ranging from between about 2 to about 12. The swelling and shrinking of the composite piston was observed between exposures to these liquids and the swelling and shrinking of the composite piston was less than 10% of its original diameter in all cases.</p>
