<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to relay controllers, and more particularly to communicating relay controllers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A relay controller circuit may generally include a processing device and a relay having contacts. The contacts are driven by the processing device to an open position or a close position, depending on the desired output of the relay. In various applications of the relay controller, the relay may be switched frequently throughout its lifetime. The number of switches in its lifetime, along with conditions under which the relay is switched, causes the relay contacts to degrade.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The degrading of the relay contacts can cause failures of the relay to switch when commanded by the processing device. The failure may momentarily interrupt normal relay switching operation, or may be permanent. Depending on the degradation of the relay contacts, the relay may still be able to switch and function in the degraded state. If the relay does not switch, the relay has failed, and will not function without repair or replacement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventor hereof has succeeded at designing relay controllers and methods of operation that are capable of communicating a service requirement. The communicating of the service requirement can diminish or eliminate system down time and prevent damage to critical components by communicating service requirements before a failure of the relay.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the present invention, a relay controller for switching a power source includes at least one relay having at least two contacts, a processing device operable to selectively switch the relay contacts and a feedback circuit adapted to identify an actual state of the relay contacts. The processing device is configured to recognize a fault contact condition. The fault contact condition is a disparity between an expected state of the relay contacts and the actual state of the relay contacts. The processing device is also configured to responsively communicate information relating to the fault condition.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of operating a relay controller having at least one relay having at least two contacts includes monitoring an expected state of the relay contacts and an actual state of the relay contacts, upon detection of a fault contact condition, pulsing the relay until the fault contact condition is overcome, and communicating information relating to the fault condition.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a relay controller for connecting a power source supplying an alternating current includes a relay having an open position and a closed position, a processing device configured to switch the relay between the open position and the closed position, and a feedback circuit for monitoring an actual position of the relay. The processing device recognizes a weld condition by a disparity between an expected position of the relay and the actual position of the relay. The processing device pulses the relay until the weld condition is overcome. The relay controller is adapted predict a subsequent failure based on the frequency of the weld conditions and the number of pulses necessary to overcome the weld condition, and is adapted to communicate information including a predicted failure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further aspects of the present invention will be in part apparent and in part pointed out below. It should be understood that various aspects of the invention may be implemented individually or in combination with one another. It should also be understood that the detailed description and drawings, while indicating certain exemplary embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following description of exemplary embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the present invention, its applications, or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One embodiment of a relay controller according to the principles of the present specification is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and is indicated generally by reference numeral <b>100</b>. The relay controller <b>100</b> includes at least one relay <b>102</b> having at least two contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, a processing device <b>108</b>, and a feedback circuit <b>110</b>. The processing device <b>108</b> is operable to selectively switch the relay contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The feedback circuit <b>110</b> is adapted to identify the actual state of the relay contacts. The processing device is configured to recognize a relay fault or un-expected state of the contacts, and to responsively communicate a signal indicative of the fault or un-expected contact state.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A relay fault condition may be a disparity between an expected state of the relay contacts and the actual state of the relay contacts. The relay controller is operable to selectively switch the relay contacts between an open position and a closed position. The closed position creates an electrical continuity between the contacts, and the open position creates an electrical discontinuity between the contacts. The expected state of the contacts is that state commanded by the processing device, and the actual state of the contacts is the actual open or closed position of the contacts. For example, the relay fault condition may be a contact weld condition. The contact weld condition exists when a weld forms between the contacts to inhibit the transition of the contacts from the closed position to the open position. In another example, the relay fault condition is a failure of the closed position contacts to create electrical continuity between the contacts, due to a high impedance condition. In other embodiments, different types of fault contact conditions can exist depending on at least the type of relay and environmental conditions of operation of the relay.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To overcome a relay fault condition, the processing device may repeat the command or activation signal to the relay. The command or activation signal from the processing device switches the relay to a particular contact state. For example, upon determining a contact weld condition, the processing device may establish a command or activation signal for closing the contacts (which signal may be a voltage to the relay) followed by a command or activation signal for opening the contacts (which signal may be an interruption of voltage). If the actual state of the contacts does not change from the weld condition in response to the command signals, the processing device will detect the continued fault condition and repeat the “pulse” command to the relay. The relay may be “pulsed” until the fault condition is overcome and the actual state of the relay contacts is consistent with the expected state of the relay contacts. In another example in which the contacts are in the closed position but do not have electrical continuity between the contacts, the processing device may establish a command or activation signal for opening the contacts (which signal may be either an interruption or application of voltage to the relay) followed by a command or activation signal for closing the contacts. If the contacts close and establish electrical continuity then the fault condition is overcome, and the actual state of the relay contacts is consistent with the expected state of the relay contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various embodiments, the processing device is adapted to store information corresponding to a particular fault condition. The information may include pulse characteristics, such as the number of pulses necessary to overcome the particular fault contact condition, or the pulse frequency for overcoming the particular fault contact condition. In some relay controller embodiments, analysis of the faults and pulse characteristics can be used to predict subsequent failure or ultimate failure of the relay. In one embodiment, the analysis comprises comparing the number of pulses required to overcome a fault condition with a predetermined maximum number of allowed pulses stored in the processing device. For example, if the number of pulses required to overcome the fault condition is 5 times and the predetermined maximum is 6 times, the processing device may responsively predict an imminent failure. The predetermined maximum can be a fixed or variable value depending on a number of factors, including the operating load or current conducted, the type of relay, the number of contacts, other components in the system, etc. For example, empirical testing of a specific relay may disclose that the specific relay when operated over 100,000 times or cycles will most likely not overcome a contact weld fault condition, even after 6 successive pulses. The predetermined maximum value may accordingly be set to some number less than 6 times. In other embodiments, the pulse characteristics can be analyzed independent of a predetermined maximum to form a predicted failure based solely on the number of fault occurrences and the number of times the relay has been switched or “cycled”.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The processing device may communicate the type of fault condition, and other information such as a predicted failure point for the relay. The communication may include the number of pulses required to overcome the relay fault condition. The analysis of the fault type, pulse characteristics, and number of relay cycles may be used in estimating or predicting a subsequent or ultimate failure of the relay. Accordingly, the fault information and predicted failure can provide a variety of data for the processing device to communicate. Moreover, some applications in which the relay controller may be employed mingt demand that the relay controller communicate a service requirement for a single fault condition, where the relay is critical to the system. Other applications may be much more fault tolerant and can wait until just before ultimate failure of the relay to communicate diagnostic or service information to an interface or display device. Accordingly, the relay controller may be adaptable to different applications with either critical or non-critical components.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a single relay <b>102</b> having two contacts <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, it should be understood that a different number of contacts or different types of relays can be employed in other embodiments of a relay controller. For example, a latching relay can be employed rather than a normally open single pole switching relay. It should be understood that the present disclosure should not be limited to the particular exemplary embodiments of a processing device <b>108</b> and feedback circuit <b>110</b>, and that and modifications such as relay type may be made without departing from the scope of the claims. Different types or forms of processing devices capable of controlling the operation the required logic operations may be employed. For example, the processing device may be a microprocessor that is configured to send command signals for selectively switching the relay contact.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, different types of interface may receive the information communicated by the processing device. The interface may be any device capable of receiving and/or responding to the communication from the processing device. For example, the interface may be an onsite diagnostic reporting device, a hand-held “palm” type device, or a gateway for a remote network. The processing device could also communicate information to a display device integrated into the relay controller, such as an LED (light emitting diode) or an LCD (liquid crystal display) for visually communicating fault information. Various other types of interfaces can be employed depending on the application of the relay controller and the information included in the service requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another aspect of the present disclosure, various methods for controlling operation of a relay controller are provided. In some embodiments, the method includes monitoring an expected state of the relay contacts and an actual state of the relay contacts, detecting a fault condition in the contacts, and pulsing the relay until the fault condition is overcome. The method may further include communicating the fault condition and/or the pulse characteristics corresponding to the fault condition. In other embodiments of a method, the relay may be switched in a manner that reduces the probability of occurrence of a contact fault condition.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One embodiment of a method for controlling operation of a relay controller is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The relay controller method begins at step <b>202</b> by applying a switch signal to the relay to switch the contacts to a desired state (open or closed contacts). At step <b>204</b>, the method compares an expected state of the relay contacts to the actual state of the relay contacts. If no disparity exists between the actual state of the relay contacts and the expected state of the relay contacts, the method proceeds to step <b>208</b>. If a disparity is detected at step <b>204</b>, the method communicates information relating to the fault condition, and proceeds to step <b>202</b> to repeat the signal for switching the relay contacts. The method may be continued or repeated until the expected state of the relay contacts is the same as the actual state of the relay contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A second embodiment of a method for controlling operation of a relay controller is generally referenced at <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The method begins by applying a switch signal to the relay at step <b>302</b>, and then compares the expected state of the relay contacts to an actual state of the relay contacts at step <b>304</b>. If no disparity exists between the actual state of the relay contacts and the expected state of the relay contacts, the method proceeds to <b>318</b> (the relay try counter is at zero at step <b>316</b> if contacts are in expected state). If a disparity is detected at step <b>304</b>, the method indicates or communicates the fault condition at step <b>306</b>. At step <b>310</b>, the method also increments the number of tries, or times that the relay is signaled or pulsed to switch the relay to a desired state. At step <b>314</b>, a refresh interval is applied before returning to step <b>302</b> to repeat the signal for switching the relay contacts. The method determines whether the relay pulse counter has reached a predetermined maximum at step <b>308</b>. If the predetermined maximum has not been reached, the relay pulse counter is incremented by one (step <b>310</b>), and the method is repeated. If the predetermined maximum is reached at step <b>308</b>, a service requirement or communication signal is issued at step <b>312</b>. The method is followed until no disparity exists between the actual state of the relay contacts and the expected state of the relay contacts, or the predetermined maximum has been reached at step <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For purposes of illustration only, the method <b>300</b> may the control operation of a relay controller as described in the following exemplary scenario. A fault contact condition first occurs after 100,000 switches or cycles of the relay, and requires three pulses of the relay to overcome the condition. A second fault contact condition occurs at 120,000 cycles, and requires four pulses of the relay to overcome. A third fault contact condition occurs at 129,000 cycles, and requires five pulses to overcome. For each of these fault conditions, the processing device has stored the number of cycles or switches the relay has accumulated at the time of the fault condition, and the number of pulses requires to overcome the fault condition and restore the relay to expected operation. After a preset number of intermittent fault contact conditions (such as the three above), the processing device may predict a subsequent failure at 141,000 switches. The processing device may communicate a service requirement to an interface or display device that includes the predicted failure. A response to the service requirement can entail a technician ordering a replacement relay controller, or replacing the relay within a minimum time frame. This progression has been purely exemplary, and a different number of switches, fault contact conditions, and pulses may be stored and/or analyzed in various manners for predicting a fault or failure condition of the relay to be communicated to provide notice of the predicted failure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another aspect of the present disclosure, various methods for controlling switching of a relay are provided. The life expectancy and failure of a relay may be related to the manner of operating and switching the relay. Thus, operating the relay in a specific manner can extend the life of the relay. For example, in applications with AC sources, the voltage applied to the relay varies between a positive voltage and negative voltage, and closing the contacts at a point in time where a potential difference (voltage potential) between the two contacts can lead to a sparking/arcing between the contacts just before closure. This sparking/arcing can accelerate the degradation of the relay contacts, resulting in a shorter relay life. Where one relay contact is connected to one branch of a voltage source that transitions between positive voltage and negative voltage, and another relay contact controls a load connected to another branch of the voltage source that transitions between positive voltage and negative voltage, the changing voltage in both branches of the voltage source create situations in which the differential voltage potential between the contacts is zero (eg.—when one leg of a 208 volt Y-configuration with ground is at a positive voltage value and another leg of 208 volt three phase power source is at the same positive voltage value).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the voltage source is an AC source, similar to a sine wave. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a voltage <b>400</b> on one relay contact and a common voltage <b>402</b> on another relay contact. A ground reference <b>404</b> is also shown. A contact closure occurs at line <b>406</b> when there is a voltage potential or difference between voltage waveform <b>400</b> and voltage waveform <b>402</b>. At line <b>406</b>, the voltage potential between the contacts (difference between the positive voltage value of <b>400</b> and negative voltage value of <b>402</b>) generally can lead to sparking/arcing between the relay contacts. Alternately as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a contact closure occurs at line <b>408</b> when the difference between the voltage value in waveform <b>400</b> and the voltage value in waveform <b>402</b> are at a minimum (both waveforms are at about the same value). By closing at or near the crossing point of the waveforms where the difference or voltage potential between the waveforms is minimal, the contacts can be closed without risk of sparking/arcing. The prevention of sparking/arcing between the contacts inhibits the accelerated degradation of the relay.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A third embodiment of a method for controlling the operation of a relay controller is generally referenced at <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The method is adapted to control switching of a relay to close the relay contacts connected to a power source at a minimum voltage potential, or near the crossing of the voltage waveforms. The method comprises an offset sequence <b>500</b> that includes monitoring the contact closure of the relay with respect to the crossing of the waveforms of the power source, and adjusting the time offset to minimize the time difference between the contact closure and the crossing of the waveforms. The time offset is a variable time value that is tuned to ensure that the closure of the contacts and the waveform-crossing coincide. The method also includes utilizing the time value or offset in commanding a closing of the contacts of the relay. The time value for commanding a closing of the contacts of the relay allows the contact closure to coincide with the waveform-crossing of the power source, essentially implementing the time offset. The method may adjust the offset time value of the contact closure by a value in the range of 20 to 150 milliseconds. The time offset achieved by the controller offset sequence <b>500</b> may be tailored to the specific relay embodiment, and it should be understood that various controller logics can be employed to adjustor offset the contact closure of a relay based on requirements of other implementations of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two waveforms of a 208 AC voltage source used in a Y-configuration with respect to ground are shown. The voltage source is an AC source, having waveforms similar to a sine wave. One voltage waveform <b>600</b> is electrically applied to one relay contact and another voltage waveform <b>602</b> is applied to a load in connection with another relay contact. A ground reference <b>604</b> is also shown. A contact closure occurs at point <b>608</b> when the voltage waveforms <b>600</b> and <b>602</b> are at a crossing point. At points other that <b>608</b>, the voltage potential between the contacts (difference between the voltage value of <b>600</b> and voltage value of <b>602</b>) generally can lead to sparking/arcing between the relay contacts. A contact closure occurring at crossing-point <b>608</b> where the difference between the voltages in waveform <b>600</b> and <b>602</b> are at a minimum (both waveforms are at about the same value). It should be noted that such waveform crossing is not the same as “zero-crossing”, and that a significant voltage potential exists between the contacts when either waveform <b>600</b> or <b>602</b> crosses zero volts. By closing at or near the crossing point of the waveforms where the difference or voltage potential between the waveforms is minimal, the contacts can be closed without risk of sparking/arcing. The prevention of sparking/arcing between the contacts inhibits the accelerated degradation of the relay.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A second embodiment of a relay controller is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and is generally referenced by numeral <b>700</b>. The relay controller <b>700</b> includes a relay <b>702</b>, a processing device <b>704</b>, and a feedback circuit <b>706</b>. The feedback circuit is adapted to allow the processing device to detect the actual state of the contact and allow the processing device to detect the waveform-crossing of a power source <b>708</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a block representation of a climate control system <b>710</b> includes the relay controller <b>700</b>. It should be understood that a climate control system is only one implementation of the invention, and various other implementations exist for relay controllers within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram of a feedback circuit <b>1000</b> that may be employed in the second embodiment of a relay controller <b>700</b> above. The feedback circuit <b>1000</b> includes several resistors and four dual operational amplifiers <b>1006</b>, <b>1010</b>, <b>1014</b>, and <b>1022</b> that provide inputs to a microprocessor <b>1028</b>, which controls a relay <b>1030</b> for switching line voltage to a motor <b>1040</b>. When an AC power source is connected to input pins <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b>, operation amplifier <b>1006</b> outputs an AC signal to a microprocessor input pin <b>1008</b>, which monitors the voltage value. An operational amplifier <b>1010</b> outputs a direct current (DC) square wave to microprocessor input pin <b>1012</b>. The rising and falling edges of the DC square wave (pin <b>1012</b>) coincide with the pin <b>1008</b> waveform intersecting another waveform of the power source (i.e. zero-voltage potential between the AC waveforms). Thus, transitions in the DC square wave input pin <b>1012</b> denote the waveform crossings of the AC power waveforms supplied to pins <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The voltage across the motor <b>1040</b>, which is switched by a relay <b>1030</b> that is controlled by the microprocessor <b>1028</b>, is monitored by an operational amplifier <b>1014</b>. Based on the signal at input pin <b>1012</b>, the microprocessor switches the relay <b>1030</b> and calculates a time offset with respect to the waveform-crossing point and the closing of the relay contacts. When the relay contacts close to cause the voltage across the motor <b>1040</b> to be sensed by operational amplifier <b>1014</b>, a direct current square wave is output from operational amplifier <b>1022</b> to the microprocessor input pin <b>1016</b>. The microprocessor is adapted to calculate the difference (if any) in time between the relay contact closure from input pin <b>1016</b> and the waveform-crossing from input pin <b>1012</b>. That difference is added or subtracted (as appropriate) to adjust the offset time, for subsequently switching the relay <b>1030</b> such that the relay contacts close at or near the waveform cross point where the voltage potential between the waveforms is minimized, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This feedback circuit <b>1000</b> and its operation should be understood to be one preferred embodiment of the present invention. It should be noted that the feedback circuit, microprocessor <b>1028</b> and relay <b>1030</b> may be integrated into a single relay controller device. Other circuits and different components can be employed to create a feedback circuit within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a graph illustrates a ninth embodiment of a method for operating a relay controller. The processing device commands the switching of the relay contacts as required for the application. The method comprises detecting a first fault weld condition by a disparity between an expected position of the relay and the actual position of the relay, and storing the number of switches (or cycles) the relay made as of the contact weld fault condition. The method pulses the relay a number of times until the weld condition is overcome, and stores the number of pulses required to overcome the welded contact failure condition. The method then calls for detecting a second weld condition and storing the number of relay switches when the weld condition occurred, subsequently pulsing the relay a number of times until the second weld condition is overcome, and stores the number of pulses required to overcome the second weld condition. The method also provides for determining a predicted failure of the relay contacts based on the number of fault conditions relative to the number of relay switching occurrences, the number of pulses required to overcome the relay weld condition, or both. For example, empirical testing of a specific relay type may show that after 6 or more pulses, the welded relay contacts will not likely be able to be corrected. The method may use numerical analysis methods, such as linear or geometric progressions, to estimate when the relay will fail based on the progression of the number of pulses required to correct the weld fault, or the progression of the number of weld fault conditions relative to the number of relay switching cycles, or a combination of both. The graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates this method by way of example of a hypothetical series of relay contact weld fault conditions. A first contact weld fault condition occurring at 159,000 cycles requiring 2 pulses to overcome the weld is shown at <b>1110</b>. A second contact weld fault condition occurring at 259,000 cycles requiring 2 pulses to overcome the second weld is shown at <b>1120</b>. A third contact weld fault condition occurring at 339,000 cycles requiring 3 pulses to overcome the third weld is shown at <b>1130</b>. A fourth contact weld fault condition occurring at 379,000 cycles requiring 4 pulses to overcome the fourth weld is shown at <b>1140</b>. A fifth contact weld fault condition occurring at 399,000 cycles requiring 5 pulses to overcome the fifth weld is shown at <b>1150</b>. Based on the progression of pulses, the method could predict that the next weld condition could require more than 5 pulses, in which case the relay contact weld condition could likely become permanent. Likewise, based on the progression of the number of fault conditions relative to the number of cycles (eg. 80,000 cycles after 3<sup>rd </sup>fault, 40,000 cycles after 4<sup>th </sup>fault, 20,000 cycles after the 5<sup>th </sup>fault), the method could predict that the next weld condition could occur in approximately 10,000 cycles at <b>1160</b> (at 419,000 cycles). Each of the above predicted failure criteria may be implemented individually or in combination with each other to provide for communication of a service report that includes a predicted failure estimation. It should be noted that various algorithms may be employed to weight the weld contact failure condition data, or to combine the progression of the data to compile the data into an estimated predicted welded contact failure event of the relay, for communicating in a service report.</p>
