<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to Korean Patent application No. 2002-777587 filed on Dec. 7, 2002, and laid open on Jun. 12, 2004, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light emitting module designed to shape a beam emitted by a light source and an optical pickup apparatus and method employing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a light emitting module designed to shape a beam using a beam shaping window and an optical pickup apparatus and method employing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a light emitting module is employed in an optical pickup apparatus to perform non-contact recording and/or reproduction of information on an optical recording medium and includes a light source that emits a laser beam and a monitor photodetector that monitors the light output power of the laser beam emitted by the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional light emitting module includes a cap <b>3</b> that is disposed on a base <b>1</b> and has a window <b>5</b> that transmits a laser beam, a mount <b>2</b> disposed on the base <b>1</b>, a semiconductor laser <b>10</b> that is disposed on a sidewall of the mount <b>2</b> and emits a laser beam having a predetermined wavelength in two side directions, and a monitor photodetector <b>7</b> that is disposed on the base <b>1</b> and receives a beam L<sub>2 </sub>emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> in the backward direction. The monitor photodetector <b>7</b> monitors the light output power of a laser beam L<sub>1 </sub>emitted in the forward direction of the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> based on a detected signal. The semiconductor laser <b>10</b> and the monitor photodetector <b>7</b> are connected to leads <b>9</b> used as conducting lines to carry current.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a laser beam emitted at a predetermined position of an active layer <b>11</b> of the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> has an elliptical cross-section. The elliptical beam profile is due to a difference in the angle that a laser beam emitted in a thickness direction of the active layer <b>11</b> and a width direction perpendicular thereto will diffract. The difference in diffraction angles is caused by a difference in the size of the beam exits. In this case, the laser beams in the thickness (Y-axis) direction and in the width (X-axis) direction appear to have been emitted from the front of the laser <b>10</b> and a location that is a distance ΔZ behind the front of the laser <b>10</b>, respectively. Here, the distance difference ΔZ is called astigmatism. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, θ<sub>81 </sub> and θ<sub>⊥</sub> denote angles in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively that the beam diverges in.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the light emitting module is employed in an optical pickup apparatus, astigmatism occurs due to the geometry and structure of a light source. Large amounts of astigmatism results in degradation in jitter characteristics when a signal reflected from an optical recording medium is reproduced through a main photodetector of the optical pickup apparatus. This adversely affects the quality of a detected signal. Here, jitter refers to a displacement or deviation of a signal from its ideal location caused by defects in pits recorded on the optical recording medium or the asymmetric shape of a beam spot created on the optical recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the jitter in particular severely degrades the quality of information being stored on the optical storage medium, there is a need for beam shaping in order to use the light emitting module in an optical pickup apparatus for recording.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a solution for beam shaping, a beam shaping prism configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has been proposed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a conventional beam shaping prism <b>20</b> includes an incident surface <b>21</b> on which a laser beam is incident and which is disposed opposite a semiconductor laser <b>10</b> and a reflecting surface <b>23</b> that reflects the incident laser beam. The beam shaping prism <b>20</b> is optically arranged such that the incident surface <b>21</b> is inclined at an angle to the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> and refracts a laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> has an elliptical cross-section indicated by dotted line A. The elliptical beam is refracted through the incident surface <b>21</b>, reflected off the reflecting surface <b>23</b>, and transformed into a circular profile indicated by dotted line B.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, use of the conventional beam shaping prism having the above-described configuration requires large assembling tolerances as well as high manufacturing costs due to a complicated optical structure. Furthermore, there is a high possibility that an optical axis will deviate during high-temperature operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides a light emitting module with a simple structure which is designed to shape a beam using a window that protects the inside of the module from foreign materials such as dust particles and an optical pickup apparatus and method employing the light emitting module.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a light emitting module and method including a base, a semiconductor laser that is installed on the base and emits a laser beam of a predetermined wavelength, a cap surrounding the semiconductor laser, and a beam shaping window that is fitted with a predetermined portion of the cap corresponding to the propagation path of the laser beam and shapes a transmitted laser beam while reflecting a portion of an incident beam. The light emitting module further includes a monitor photodetector that is disposed within the cap and receives the laser beam reflected by the beam shaping window in order to monitor the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Here, the beam shaping window includes a first surface that is inclined at an angle to an optical axis of a laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser and refracts a majority of an incident beam while reflecting the remaining portion of the beam; and a second surface that is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the beam refracted through the first surface and directs an incident beam.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical pickup apparatus and method including a semiconductor laser that emits a laser beam of a predetermined wavelength; a beam shaping window that is disposed in the propagation path of the laser beam and shapes a transmitted beam into a beam having a circular cross-section while reflecting a portion of the incident beam; a light path changer that is disposed in the propagation path of the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser and changes the propagation path of an incident beam; an objective lens that focuses an incident laser beam to a beam spot on an optical recording medium; and a main photodetector that receives a laser beam that is reflected from the optical recording medium and passes through the objective lens and the light path changer in order to detect an information signal and an error signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a light emitting module <b>30</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a base <b>31</b>, a semiconductor laser <b>41</b> and a monitor photodetector <b>43</b> disposed on the base <b>31</b>, a cap <b>33</b> surrounding the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> and the monitor photodetector <b>43</b>, and a beam shaping window <b>45</b> disposed in a propagation path of a laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The semiconductor laser <b>41</b> is installed on a mount <b>32</b> disposed on the base <b>31</b> and emits a laser beam of a predetermined wavelength toward the beam shaping window <b>45</b>. The wavelength of the laser beam emitted from the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> is 655 nm, 408 nm, or 785 nm and is not limited to a specific wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cap <b>33</b> encases the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> and the monitor photodetector <b>43</b> and protects the same against external contamination. The beam shaping window <b>45</b> is combined with a predetermined portion of the cap <b>33</b> disposed in the propagation path of the laser beam and shapes the transmitted laser beam while reflecting a portion of the incident beam toward the monitor photodetector <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the beam shaping window <b>45</b> has a first surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>on which a laser beam is incident and a second surface <b>45</b><i>b </i>that the laser beam exits. Since the first surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>is slanted at an angle to an optical axis of the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>41</b>, most of the incident beam is refracted while the remaining portion of the beam is reflected toward the monitor photodetector <b>43</b>. To this end, the first surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>can be coated to refract approximately 90% of the incident beam and reflect the remaining portion of the beam toward the monitor photodetector <b>43</b>. The second surface <b>45</b><i>b </i>is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the beam refracted through the first surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>and directs most of the incident beam. To this end, the second surface <b>45</b><i>b </i>can be coated to direct approximately 99% of the incident beam. By constructing the beam shaping window <b>45</b> in this manner, it is possible to shape an exit beam into a desired profile.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A beam shaping principle will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a beam shaping prism <b>46</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, corresponding to the beam shaping window (<b>45</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), is a transparent element having a refractive index n and has a base plane <b>46</b><i>a </i>and an inclined plane <b>46</b><i>b </i>slanted at an angle θ to the base plane <b>46</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that a laser beam is incident on the inclined plane <b>46</b><i>b </i>at an angle α and exits through the base plane <b>46</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, where an incident beam and a corresponding exit beam have a cross-sectional diameters of a/2 and, respectively, and the beam shaping prism <b>46</b> is a medium having a refractive index n<sub>d </sub>of 1.514362, the angles θ and α are set as shown in Equations (1) and (2). The angles θ and α can be determined by simultaneously solving Equation (1) representing Snell's law and Equation (2) associated with a geometric shape:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>sin(90−α)=<i>n</i><sub>d </sub>sin θ  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2 sin α=cos θ  (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The angles θ and α that satisfy the Equations (1) and (2) at the same time are 37.29° and 23.44°, respectively.
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The above example illustrates a beam entering the beam shaping prism <b>46</b> in one direction, such as the horizontal direction (the θ<sub>∥</sub> direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The beam-shaping prism <b>46</b> also allows a beam incident in the vertical direction (the θ<sub>195 </sub> direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to be transmitted without changing the diameter of the beam. Thus, when a laser beam with an elliptical cross-section enters the beam-shaping prism <b>46</b>, the beam-shaping prism <b>46</b> allows the elliptical beam to be transformed into a circular beam and produce an exit laser beam of a desired diameter by determining predetermined values as the angles θ and α.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the monitor photodetector <b>43</b> is fitted onto a predetermined location of a mount <b>32</b> installed on the base <b>31</b> and receives a portion of a laser beam reflected from the first surface <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the beam shaping window <b>45</b> and monitors the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The monitor photodetector <b>43</b> is disposed within the cap <b>33</b>, thus making the light emitting module compact. Furthermore, an embodiment of the present invention allows the monitor photodetector <b>43</b> to receive a portion of the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> in the forward direction and monitor light emission from the semiconductor laser <b>41</b>, thereby enabling an auto power controller (APC) circuit disposed between the monitor photodetector <b>43</b> and the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> to more precisely control the light output power of the semiconductor laser <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an optical pickup apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a light emitting module <b>30</b>, a light path changer <b>51</b> that changes the propagation path of an incident beam, an objective lens <b>55</b> that focuses the incident beam onto an optical recording medium D, and a main photodetector <b>59</b> that receives a beam reflected from the optical recording medium D. The light emitting module <b>30</b> includes a semiconductor laser <b>41</b> that emits a laser beam having a predetermined wavelength, a beam shaping window <b>45</b> that shapes the beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> and reflects a portion of the incident beam, and a monitor photodetector <b>43</b> that receives the beam reflected by the beam shaping window <b>45</b> and monitors the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light emitting module <b>30</b> further includes a base <b>31</b> and a cap <b>33</b> for arranging the optical elements as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Since the light emitting module <b>30</b> has substantially the same construction as that described with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>, a detailed description thereof will not be given.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The light path changer <b>51</b> disposed in an optical path between the light emitting module <b>30</b> and the objective lens <b>55</b> reflects the beam emitted by the light emitting module <b>30</b> toward the optical recording medium D and transmits the beam reflected from the optical recording medium D toward the main photodetector <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that the light path changer <b>51</b> is a polarization beam splitter that transmits or reflects the incident beam depending on its polarization direction. The polarization beam splitter reflects a beam emitted having one polarization by the semiconductor laser <b>41</b> toward the objective lens <b>55</b> and transmits a beam having the other polarization toward the main photodetector <b>59</b>. To achieve this function, the optical pickup apparatus further includes a quarter wave plate <b>54</b> and a polarization holographic optical element <b>53</b> disposed in an optical path between the polarization beam splitter and the objective lens <b>55</b>. The quarter wave plate <b>54</b> converts an incident linearly polarized beam into a circularly polarized beam or vice versa. The polarization holographic optical element <b>53</b> directs the entire vertically polarized beam while acting as a hologram to diffract a horizontally polarized beam and change the path of propagation. Thus, only a vertically polarized beam is directed to the polarization beam splitter among those reflected from the optical recording medium D, passes through the polarization beam splitter, and is incident on the main photodetector <b>59</b>. By constructing the light path changer <b>51</b> in this manner, it is possible to prevent the laser beam reflected from the optical recording medium D from traveling toward the monitor photodetector <b>43</b>, so that the reflected laser beam has no adverse effects on controlling the light output power of the semiconductor laser <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Meanwhile, instead of the polarization beam splitter, the light path changer <b>51</b> may be a beam splitter that transmits or reflects the incident beam at a predetermined ratio or a holographic optical element that directs a beam emerging from one direction and diffracts a beam emerging from another direction in order to change the path of propagation. When the light path changer <b>51</b> is the beam splitter, a flat plate beam splitter may be used instead of the cubic beam splitter as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The optical pickup apparatus may further include a collimating lens <b>52</b> that is disposed in an optical path between the light path changer <b>51</b> and the objective lens <b>55</b> and collimates an incident divergent beam to a parallel beam.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The main photodetector <b>59</b> receives a laser beam that is reflected from the optical recording medium D and passes through the objective lens <b>55</b> and the light path changer <b>51</b> in order to detect an information signal and error signals. Here, a concave lens <b>57</b> can be disposed between the light path changer <b>51</b> and the main photodetector <b>59</b> in order to change the optical axis length and cross-sectional diameter of a beam traveling toward the main photodetector <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By changing the structure of a window that protects the inside of the light emitting module against dust particles, it is possible to shape a beam into a desired profile, simplify the structure of the light emitting module, and lower the manufacturing costs. By monitoring a portion of the laser beam emitted in forward direction of a semiconductor laser, it is also possible to precisely control the light output power of the laser.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the optical pickup apparatus employing the light emitting module having the above-described configuration prevents a laser beam reflected from an optical recording medium D from traveling toward the monitor photodetector <b>43</b>, so that the laser beam does not have an effect on controlling the light output power of the semiconductor laser. The embodiments of the present invention also solve astigmatism problems by transforming an elliptical laser beam incident through a beam shaping window into a circular laser beam. This improves jitter characteristics during reproduction of information.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.</p>
