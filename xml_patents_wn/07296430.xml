<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A burn-in oven is provided with a plurality of spaced, stacked burn-in-boards, each with a plurality of individual circuits being tested under heated conditions, and a plurality of valve trays positioned between two burn-in-boards to form a heat exchange compartment below the valve tray. Each valve tray has a plenum formed above it to provide a separate chamber that is a source of cooling air. Each valve tray has a plurality of valves, one over each of a number openings in the tray. Each opening overlies an integrated circuits or device under test on the burn-in-board below the valve tray. The valves control the flow of air for cooling the integrated circuits. The flow of air through the valves is the only path for cooling airflow to the integrated circuits on the burn-in-boards.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to apparatus for controlling temperatures of integrated circuit chips being tested on burn-in-boards in a burn-in oven or system. More particularly, the invention relates to a flow control valve that controls the flow of cooling air onto an associated heat sink for a circuit chip supported directly below the valve. The temperature of each integrated circuit chip is sensed and compared with a desired set point temperature to determine a temperature error signal and the amount of cooling air directed toward the heat sinks is varied as a function of the error signal to maintain precise temperature control.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Burn-in-ovens that are used for testing integrated circuits are well known. The prior art ovens have used various types of cooling devices for controlling the temperatures of the burn-in-boards within a selected range. Individual fans for providing cooling air directly on heat sinks, are shown in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/020,348, filed Dec. 12, 2001. The fans work well but do not provide the cooling capability of the present invention. A more passive way of controlling the heat has been to provide a flow of air from plenum chambers at the ends of an oven across a number of the chips supported on burn-in-boards and then exhausting the air out through exhaust panels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The power required for testing has increased with the advent of circuits that consume more power in use. The ability to provide an adequate amount of cooling to each individual high power circuit under test to regulate the cooling and thus the temperature of each chip within acceptable limits has become more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The need for an easily controlled, highly responsive cooling airflow control continues to exist.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a cooling airflow control system for a burn-in-board oven or enclosure that uses individual valves for controlling flow from a plenum chamber having a supply of cooling air onto one of the circuits, and in particular, onto a heat sink that is provided as part of a holder for the circuit chips for transferring heat away from the circuit. The valves are over openings in a tray, with each tray above a burn-in board. The heat sinks have radiating fins thereon and the cooling airflows help to dissipate the heat generated by the circuit devices under test, sometimes called DUTs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The plenum chamber which forms an air supply for the valves is preferably, and as shown, an individual plenum chamber for each tray of valves used in the burn-in-oven. As will be shown, the valve trays are spaced so a burn-in-board with DUTs can be placed below each valve tray.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each holder for the DUTs includes a temperature sensor that senses the temperature of the circuit chip and provides a signal to a control computer or processor. A temperature sensor may also be embedded in the DUT for the same purpose. The processor compares the sensed temperature with a desired set point temperature to develop an error signal if there is the need for more or less cooling air. This error signal is used for controlling the valves of the present invention as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the present invention, the temperature differential signal, or error signal, is used for controlling the opening of individual valves that are positioned on a valve tray spaced from and above the individual circuits supported on a burn-in-board. The valve tray is a solid wall tray or plate spanning the burn-in oven and supported on rails in the oven, and has openings through which a valve controls air flow.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A cooling air plenum chamber is formed above each of the valve trays a shown, and preferably by using a solid wall panel overlying the respective valve tray supported on three sides of the tray to form plenum chambers with one side forming an inlet slot. There is a cooling air inlet opening at one end of the oven for each cooling air plenum chamber that is open to the inlet slot when the valve tray assembly is installed. The exit or exhaust passage for air from the cooling air chamber is through the valves and corresponding openings in the tray to a heat sink chamber formed below the valve trays and above the respective underlying burn-in-board. The heat sinks are each in contact with a DUT to conduct heat away from the DUT.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The valve trays and burn-in-boards in the oven are alternated and stacked with spaces between the trays and boards so that the cooling air space or chamber above the valve tray may also be formed by another overlying burn-in-board. With any desired cooling air chamber above a valve tray, when a valve is opened, cooling air flows into the heat sink or heat exchange chamber between the valve tray and underlying burn-in-board and directly onto the heat sink below that valve. When all of the valves on a valve tray are closed, no cooling air flows onto the heat sinks for DUTS on the burn-in-board below the valve tray.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In use, the burn-in-oven will always have a full complement of valve tray assemblies, and may not have burn-in-boards under each valve tray assembly. If no burn-in-board is below a valve tray, the valves in such tray are left closed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown, a conventional cooling air system is adapted to the desired oven configuration. An exhaust chamber receives air from each of the exhaust passageways for air from the heat sink chamber above the burn-in-boards after the air has been passed over the heat sinks for the individual circuits. The air exhausted from the heat sink chambers circulates through an air cooler and then is forced back to the air supply by a blower or fan.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The valves are individually controlled and provide for better modulation of flow. Since barrel valves can adjust the flow through valve openings more precisely than other types of valves in use, such as butterfly valves, barrel valves are preferred, but other controllable valves will work.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A typical burn-in oven <b>10</b>, shown schematically, is provided with a frame <b>12</b> that has four corner posts <b>13</b>, held together as desired and supporting a series of rails or guides <b>14</b> for holding burn-in-board trays, and guides <b>16</b> for holding valve trays or boards made according to the present invention. The burn-in-board trays (also just called burn-in-boards) shown generally at <b>20</b> will slide in on the rails <b>14</b>, and completely fill the area between the side guides and the walls defined by the frame <b>12</b>, so that the burn-in-boards block airflow vertically in the oven enclosure. Insulated side walls and a door enclose the oven or other enclosure for testing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Individual air flow control valve tray assemblies made according to the present invention includes trays or boards shown generally at <b>22</b> and specifically numbered <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and these would be <b>22</b>N valve tray assemblies in a burn-in oven. The valve trays slide into the rails <b>16</b> and likewise will completely block the open horizontal area in the frame <b>12</b>. As perhaps best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, each valve tray <b>22</b>A–<b>22</b>D has an overlying solid wall <b>23</b>A–<b>23</b>D spaced therefrom to form a cooling air plenum chamber <b>26</b>A–<b>26</b>D, up to <b>26</b>N plenum chambers. Each wall <b>23</b>A–<b>23</b>D is supported on solid edge walls <b>25</b> on three sides of the respective tray leaving one side of the cooling air plenum chamber open with an inlet slot <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cooling air plenum chambers <b>26</b>A–<b>26</b>N of respective valve trays <b>22</b>A–<b>22</b>N are above the valve trays and each valve tray <b>22</b>A–<b>22</b>N is above an associated burn-in-board.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The space between the lower side of a valve tray and the underlying burn-in-board forms a heat sink chamber or heat exchange chamber. A first heat sink chamber <b>24</b> is formed above burn-in-board tray <b>20</b>. A further valve tray <b>22</b>B is positioned above the burn-in-board <b>20</b>B, to form a heat sink chamber <b>24</b>A above the burn-in-board <b>28</b>B, and each subsequent burn-in-board <b>20</b> has an overlying valve tray <b>22</b> for a total <b>20</b>N burn-in-boards, and <b>22</b>N valve trays that form heat sink or heat chambers <b>24</b>N stacked vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The valve tray assembly a second cooling air plenum chamber <b>26</b>B above the valve tray <b>22</b>B is formed by walls <b>23</b> and <b>25</b>. The stacked valve trays and overlying burn-in-boards form “<b>26</b>N” cooling air plenum chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The cooling air is provided by a suitable fan or blower <b>28</b> that is coupled to a main cool air supply chamber shown schematically at <b>30</b> on one side of the oven <b>10</b>. The cool air supply chamber <b>30</b> is open to the end inlet slots <b>27</b>A–<b>27</b>D (up to <b>27</b>N) of each of the cooling air chambers <b>26</b>A–<b>26</b>N that are formed above the stacked burn-in-boards <b>22</b>N. Only a few burn-in-boards and valve trays are shown for sake of simplicity in illustration, but they can be stacked vertically in as many of the slides or rails <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, as desired. Again, all of the positions for valve tray assemblies in the oven are filled, but if desired, only a selected number of burn-in-board trays are in the oven.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Cooling airflow is provided from the main cool air supply chamber <b>30</b> through slots or openings <b>32</b>A–<b>32</b>D (up to <b>32</b>N) through the side wall of the oven, and are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The slots <b>32</b>A–<b>32</b>N in the oven wall align with the cooling air plenum chamber inlet slots <b>27</b>A–<b>27</b>D at the ends of the cooling air plenum chambers <b>26</b>N formed by the valve trays <b>22</b>, and walls <b>23</b> and <b>25</b>. The cooling air plenum chamber of all of the valve tray assemblies are provided with cooling airflow from the main cool air supply chamber <b>30</b> through the slots <b>32</b>A–<b>32</b>N.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the side of the oven enclosure opposite from the main cool air supply chamber <b>30</b> for cooling air, there are exhaust discharge slots or openings <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) (up to <b>34</b>N), that align with the heat sink or heat exchange chambers <b>24</b> formed above each burn-in-board and below the respective overlying valve tray. There is an exhaust slot or opening for each of the heat sink or heat exchange chambers <b>24</b> formed by the respective burn-in-boards and the overlying valve trays. Exhaust openings are only from the heat exchange chambers <b>24</b>–<b>24</b>N and lead into an exhaust chamber <b>21</b> in which an air circulation blower or fan <b>28</b> can be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cooling air plenum chambers <b>26</b>N above each of the valve trays have the inlet slots <b>27</b>N at one end, but no constantly open exhaust openings. Cooling air is exhausted from plenum chambers <b>26</b> by passing through valves <b>40</b> that control flow into the heat exchange chambers <b>24</b>–<b>24</b>N through openings <b>58</b> in the valve tray. However, some air will bleed out along the tracks or rails for the trays, and in order to provide some cooling air along the bottom surfaces of the burn-in-boards, a gap shown at <b>35</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> permits some cooling air to enter the space above each wall <b>23</b> and below the overlying burn-in-board.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cooling air for the main cool air supply chamber <b>30</b> is circulated by fan or blower <b>28</b> through an air cooler <b>42</b> in the flow path to exhaust air chamber <b>21</b>, so that the air in the cool air supply <b>30</b> is cooled and is used for maintaining and reducing the temperature of the individual circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of the circuits or devices under test (DUT) is supported in a socket or holder <b>44</b>, that comprises a finned heat exchanger or heat sink, generally formed as shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/646,889, filed Jan. 14, 2002, and incorporated by reference. Each of the holders for the DUTs has a heater <b>45</b> and temperature sensor indicated schematically at <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The temperature signal from the temperature sensor <b>46</b> is fed to a controller <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), and the controller in turn is connected to the valves <b>40</b> to control the amount of opening of each valve. The burn-in-boards have connectors <b>47</b> at ends that extend out from one wall of the burn-in oven, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a typical valve tray assembly <b>21</b> and the valves <b>40</b> are shown in position on a tray <b>22</b>. The valves <b>40</b> are preferably barrel valves as shown that have valve bodies <b>60</b> housing rotary valve elements <b>76</b> controlled by suitable motors <b>96</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7–10</figref> as well.) The motors <b>96</b> for two valves <b>40</b> are positioned side by side with the valve bodies <b>60</b> extending in opposite directions. The cooling airflow direction is indicated by the arrow <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The valves <b>40</b> are positioned at a slight angle to the orthogonal direction of airflow through the plenum chambers <b>26</b> and across the associated valve tray <b>22</b>. The valve tray <b>22</b> may have rails <b>54</b> on opposite sides thereof that are used for supporting it in the guides <b>16</b> of the burn-in oven <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As can be seen, the typical valve tray <b>22</b> has a plurality of individual barrel valves <b>40</b>. Each of the valves <b>40</b> is mounted over an opening <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) through the valve tray <b>22</b> so that flow controlled by the valve will be directed onto a finned heat sink or heat exchanger comprising the holder for the DUT on the burn-in-board directly below the respective valve <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a top plan view of a typical preferred valve <b>40</b> is illustrated. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8–10</figref> are referred to for showing the different parts of the valves.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While barrel valves are preferred, and are illustrated as a best mode, other controllable valves can be used. Slide valves, rotary or pivoting cover valves, poppet valves and the like, which are capable of being opened and closed as a function of a control signal will work.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the preferred form of valves <b>40</b> is provided with a valve body <b>60</b> that is made in two stacked sections <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). When the two sections are assembled, the housing has end walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, joined by side walls <b>66</b> and <b>68</b>. The side walls <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> are spaced apart to form a top opening <b>70</b>, and a bottom opening <b>72</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes a partial cross-section of the valve tray <b>22</b>A. It shows that the valve tray <b>22</b>A has openings <b>58</b> directly below the valve lower opening <b>72</b> so that there is an alignment for flow between the cooling air plenum chamber <b>26</b>N above the respective valve tray <b>22</b>A to the heat sink or heat exchange chamber <b>24</b>N below the valve tray <b>22</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The valve <b>40</b> has a rotary barrel valve element <b>76</b> that has mounting shafts <b>78</b> on both ends. The shafts <b>78</b> are rotatably mounted in suitable supports <b>80</b> on the end walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of the valve body.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each of the valve body sections <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B includes a portion of the end walls and the side walls formed to define the openings <b>72</b> and <b>70</b>. The barrel valve element <b>76</b> is a part of a cylinder with parallel planar surfaces through which a central opening or passageway <b>88</b> is formed. The opening or passageway <b>88</b> is divided into four sections with transverse flow straightener walls <b>90</b>. The opening or passageway <b>88</b> goes all the way through the part cylindrical valve element <b>76</b>, as can be seen. The part cylindrical outer surface portions of the valve element <b>76</b> are along the top as indicated at <b>92</b>. These part cylindrical surfaces extend between the parallel planar surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The side surfaces of the valve element opening in the valve body mate with the part cylindrical surface of the valve element <b>76</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the lower housing section <b>82</b> has part cylindrical surfaces <b>94</b>, and the upper section has similar surfaces. The surfaces <b>94</b> seal with the outer part-cylindrical surfaces of the rotary or barrel valve element <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The mating part-cylindrical surfaces are such that they will continue to seal as the barrel valve element rotates <b>76</b>. The valve element <b>76</b> has planar side surfaces, as can be seen. The sealing will continue as the barrel valve element <b>76</b> is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The valve element <b>76</b> of each valve <b>40</b> is driven by a separate motor <b>96</b> that is connected to a suitable source of power through the controller <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Connections to the motors <b>96</b> are made at connector ends <b>97</b> of the valve trays, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>. The direction and amount of rotation of the output shaft <b>98</b> of each motor <b>96</b> will be determined by the controller in relation to the amount of air flow through the opening in the valve <b>40</b> onto the underlying heat sink that is called for by the sensed temperature differential signals between the sensed temperature at the DUT and the set point or reference temperature. Each valve motor can be controlled by a PID controller <b>48</b>A which forms part of the main controller <b>48</b> again, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The valve motors can drive other types of controllable valve elements, as explained.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The direction of rotation of the valve element <b>76</b> can be reversed by the motor <b>96</b>. Barrel valves can control the flow more precisely than a butterfly valve, for example, because the rotation of the barrel valve elements will proportionally open the flow path between a fully closed position and a fully open position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It can be seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> that the associated motor <b>96</b> mounts directly onto the end of the body <b>60</b> for the barrel valve element <b>76</b>, and makes a very compact package. Also it can be seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the valves <b>40</b> are arranged in pairs, with the motors <b>96</b> overlapping, and the valve bodies then extend from the motors in opposite directions to overlie openings <b>58</b> in the valve tray <b>22</b>N.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a simplified block diagram of the controller <b>48</b> and components and functions controlled. The heater <b>45</b> can be used to aid in controlling the temperature of the DUT. The controller also can control the temperature of the air heat exchanger <b>42</b> used to cool the supply air with a suitable refrigeration unit. The block <b>44</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is used to represent the complete holder, including the heat sink and the DUT.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Use of the individual valves permits much better control of airflow for cooling relative to the heat sinks than can be achieved with other forms and very precise and high temperatures can be controlled with this arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While the preferred embodiment shown provides a separate cooling air plenum chamber formed above each valve tray, when a burn-in-board is in place above a valve tray, the overlying burn-in-board will form a cooling air plenum above the valve tray.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If all of the burn-in-board trays are installed in an oven, the separate walls forming the cooling air plenums above the valve trays can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The valve trays or boards are relatively low cost, easily installed, and will provide for a direct, very controlled airflow path across the heat sinks on circuits being tested or burned in.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
