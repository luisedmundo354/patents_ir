<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a thin film transistor array panel for a display.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A display provides information as an image. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic EL displays (OLEDs) are used more than other flat displays, and thin film transistor (TFT) array panels have a role as display controllers in LCDs and OLEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A TFT array panel has a plurality of gate lines in rows, a plurality of data lines in columns, a plurality of pixel electrodes formed at pixel areas defined by intersection of the gate lines and the data lines, and TFTs connecting the pixel electrodes to the gate lines and data lines. The TFTs switch transmission of data signals that are transferred through the data lines to the pixel electrodes according to gate signals transferred through the gate lines. A driving voltage generator generates a gate-on voltage or a gate-off voltage and transfers it to a plurality of gate driving integrated circuits (ICs). The gate driving ICs generate gate signals according to the control of a signal controller. Data signals are generated by a plurality of data driving ICs that transform a gray signal from the signal controller to an analog voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A signal controller and a driving voltage generator are formed on a printed circuit board (PCB) outside the LCD array panel, and a driving IC is embodied on a flexible printed circuit (FPC) interposed between a PCB and an LCD assembly. Generally, two PCBs are used. One of them, called a gate PCB, is located on one side of the liquid crystal (LC) panel assembly, and the other, called a data PCB, is located on another side. Since a gate driving IC is interposed between the gate PCB and a display panel, and a data driving IC is interposed between the data PCB and the display panel, each IC respectively receives signals from a corresponding PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the gate PCB may not be used and only the data PCB may be used without position change of the gate FPC and the gate driving IC on the gate FPC. In this case, both the data FPC and the TFT array panel have wirings to transfer signals from the signal controller and a driving voltage generator on the data PCB to the gate driving ICs, Further, the gate FPC also has wirings to transfer the signals the next gate driving IC.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, many fine wires are formed on the TFT array panel, some of which may become disconnected or shorted. In preparation for occurrence of such things, a structure for repairing the disconnected or shorted circuit is prepared to prevent the panel from discard. A repair line for repairing disconnection of a data line is one of the most popular methods. The repair line surrounds the display region of the TFT panel and intersects the both ends of data lines with an insulating layer interposed therebetween. When a data line is disconnected, both ends of the disconnected data line are connected to the repair line by irradiating a laser.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when a static electricity flows into the repair line, the static electricity may destroy the insulating layer and flow into the data lines intersecting the repair line. As a result, a defect of a TFT in the display region may be caused.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technical subject on the present invention prevents damage of a thin film transistor array panel from static electricity through a repair line.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a thin film array panel, comprising: an insulating substrate; gate lines formed on the insulating substrate; data lines intersecting the gate lines while being insulated, and defining a display region defined by intersecting the gate lines; electrostatic dispersion lines intersecting the gate lines; diodes attached to the gate lines and to the electrostatic dispersion lines; repair lines for repairing the data lines, formed on the insulating substrate outside the display region, and intersecting the electrostatic dispersion line.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, the diodes may include a first diode which has two electrodes connected to the gate lines and to the electrostatic dispersion lines so a forward current can flow from the gate lines to the electrostatic dispersion lines, and a second diode which has two electrodes connected to the gate lines and to the electrostatic dispersion lines so a forward electrostatic current can flow from the electrostatic dispersion lines to the gate lines.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The repair lines may include a first repair line intersecting the data lines, a second repair line not intersecting the data lines, the second repair line may intersect the electrostatic dispersion line while being insulated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The thin film transistor array panel may further comprise a wiring that is farther than the second repair line from the display region and is adjacent to the second repair line. The electrostatic dispersion line may intersect the repair line before the repair line intersects the data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The thin film transistor array panel may further comprise an insulating layer interposed between the repair line and the electrostatic dispersion line.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The repair line may also intersect the data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A thin film transistor array panel is also provided, comprising: an insulating substrate; gate lines formed on the insulating substrate; data lines insulated from the gate lines, intersecting the gate lines, and defining a display region by intersecting the gate lines; electrostatic dispersion lines intersecting the gate lines; diodes connected to the gate lines and the electrostatic dispersion lines; repair lines for the data lines, formed on the insulating substrate outside the display region and intersecting the electrostatic dispersion lines; periphery wiring paths formed on the insulating substrate outside the display region and intersecting the electrostatic dispersion lines.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also it is desirable that the periphery wiring paths intersect the second signal line while being insulated.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferred embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. The present invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the drawings, the thickness of layers, films, and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like numerals refer to like elements throughout. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, film, region, or substrate is referred to as being “on” another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. By contrast, it will be understood that when an element such as a layer, film, region, or substrate is referred to as being “directly on” another element, it means that intervening elements must not be present.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a liquid crystal display according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an equivalent circuit of a pixel of a liquid crystal display (LCD) according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an LCD has a liquid crystal (LC) panel assembly <b>300</b>, a gate driver <b>400</b> connected to the LC panel assembly <b>300</b>, a data driver <b>500</b> connected to the LC panel assembly <b>300</b>, a driving voltage generator <b>700</b> connected to the gate driver <b>400</b>, a gray voltage generator <b>800</b> connected to the data driver <b>500</b>, and a signal controller <b>600</b> controlling the driving voltage generator <b>700</b> and the gray voltage generator <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that the LC panel assembly <b>300</b> includes a plurality of signal lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>n </sub>and D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m</sub>, and a plurality of pixels connected to the signal lines. Each pixel includes a switching element Q connected to the signal lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>n </sub>and D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m</sub>, and to an LC capacitor C<sub>lc </sub>and a storage capacitor C<sub>st</sub>. Signal lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>n </sub>and D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m </sub>include a plurality of scanning signal lines or gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>n </sub>transferring a scanning signal or a gate signal in columns, and data signal lines or data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m </sub>transferring an image signal or a data signal in rows. The switching element Q has three terminals. The control electrode is connected to the gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>n</sub>, the input electrode is connected to the data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m</sub>, and the output electrode is connected to an electrode of the LC capacitor C<sub>lc </sub>and to an electrode of the storage capacitor C<sub>st</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The other electrode of the LC capacitor C<sub>lc </sub>is connected to a common voltage V<sub>com </sub>or a reference voltage. The other electrode of the storage capacitor C<sub>st </sub>is connected to another voltage, for example, a reference voltage.

One of the two diodes is configured such that a forward current flows from the gate line <b>121</b> to the electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b>, and the other is configured such that a forward current flows from the electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b> to the gate line <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When static electricity is introduced into one of gate lines <b>121</b>, the static electricity is transmitted to the electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b> through diode D<b>2</b> and is dispersively scattered over all the gate lines <b>121</b> through the diode D<b>1</b>.

Accordingly, the electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b> and the repair line <b>701</b> are insulated by the gate insulating layer <b>140</b>. In addition a passivation layer <b>180</b> is formed on the electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b>.</p>

The distance between the repair line <b>701</b> and the wiring path <b>801</b> is very short on an out lead bonding (OLB),pad.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In such a structure of the TFT array panel, static electricity often flows into the wiring path <b>801</b> formed on the outermost side of the TFT display panel.

Even though the repair line <b>701</b> and the electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b> are insulated by the gate insulating layer <b>140</b>, the static electricity has a high voltage that can cause insulating breakdown of the gate insulating layer <b>140</b>, and it is transferred to an electrostatic dispersion line <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Consequently, the static electricity flowing into the repair line <b>701</b> cannot penetrate into the display region due to intersection of the repair line <b>701</b> and the electricity dispersion line <b>601</b>, and the defect of the TFTs in the display region D incurred by the static electricity may be prevented.</p>
