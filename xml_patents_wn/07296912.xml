<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an LED (light emitting diode) light bar assembly of miniature size and comprised essentially of an elongated casing in which are removably retained one or more elongated LED modules with the assembly being connectable to a support structure by at least one end connector. Preferably, but not exclusively, the light bar assembly is used in articles of furniture to provide a source of lighting which can easily be concealed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Lighting systems used in articles of furniture such as display cases for jewelers, kitchen cabinets, gazebos and like applications where it is important to conceal the lights, utilize two common sources of lighting, namely fluorescent and halogen light sources. However, these light sources have many disadvantages when used in these applications. For example, when using fluorescent lighting, such usually requires additional wiring to bring in the standard 110 volt A.C. supply. It is also necessary when using fluorescent lamps to install a lamp housing provided with supports which secure to opposed ends of the lamp and which are connected to the electrical supply through a ballast. The wiring is concealed in the casing. With these constraints, it is often difficult to conceal fluorescent lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another disadvantage of fluorescent lamps is that although they come in different lengths, the shorter the lamp, the lower is the lumen. It is therefore difficult to use these lamps when a certain lumen is required and the mounting space is restricted. Also, if two or more tubes are used, then dark spots will result between the zones between the fluorescent tubes. These dark spots are the result of the size of the housings whereby when installed end-to-end, there will be dark spots between each of the fluorescent tubes due to the spacing therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another type of lighting used in such applications is halogen lighting which also has disadvantages but different from those of fluorescent tubes. The major disadvantage of halogen lamps is that they generate heat. Accordingly, if these lamps are used in a constrained space, this heat needs to be taken into consideration as it could be damaging. However, the lighting produced by halogen lights is excellent.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another disadvantage of halogen lamps is that they have a relatively short life. If these lamps are used in display cases, the heat can damage the articles being displayed. It is estimated that ninety percent (90%) of the power of these halogen lamps is transformed into heat. Accordingly, these inconveniences limit the application of these lamps and they are mostly utilized in encapsulated housings mounted in ceilings of building structures and exposed to open spaces. These encapsulated halogen lamps can be used in furniture cabinets provided that there are no products exposed to the lighting within ten inches thereof as the heat generated thereby will often cause discoloration of the articles. They are also not recommended for use in enclosed display cases for jewelers as this heat will affect the lubricants in watches, for example. Also because these lamps need to be periodically changed, they cause an inconvenience. Still further, due to their sizes, they are difficult to conceal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is a feature of the present invention to provide a lighting system for use in the above-mentioned applications and which does not generate intense heat and which provides a strong intensity of illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an LED (light emitting diode) light bar assembly which is miniature in size and which can easily be concealed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an LED (light emitting diode) light bar assembly which is easy to assemble and secure and wherein the light bulbs have a long life.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an LED (light emitting diode) light bar assembly which is aesthetically pleasing, which has flexibility in that it can be provided in different lengths and which can be utilized in enclosed areas such as display cases.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an LED (light emitting diode) light bar assembly wherein the wiring and the supply of the light bar assembly is not visible.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the LED (light emitting diode) light bar assembly of the present invention. It is constituted by an elongated casing <b>11</b> which may be extruded from aluminum material or which may be formed of plastics, either extruded or molded, and in which there is slidingly retained one or more elongated heat sink LED modules <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The light bar assembly also comprises at least one end connector <b>13</b> which is detachably securable to an end of the casing <b>11</b> for securing the casing to a support structure <b>14</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, although it can be secured to various other types of support structures.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the elongated casing <b>11</b> has an elongated cavity <b>11</b>′ which is substantially U-shaped in cross-section and defines a base wall <b>15</b>, opposed side walls <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>′ and an elongated open end <b>17</b>. The side walls <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>′ are inwardly curved side walls for reason as will be described later. The outer appearance of the casing may have different shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The modules <b>12</b> are substantially rectangular or square in cross-section and define opposed parallel flat side walls <b>18</b> and <b>18</b>′, a bottom wall <b>19</b> and a top wall <b>20</b>. Two or more LEDs, herein four LEDs <b>21</b> project in cavities <b>22</b> provided in the bottom wall <b>19</b>. Electrical connections or component parts to these LEDs are concealed within the modules <b>12</b> and such does not form part of the present invention. These LEDs are white light lamps which are exposed in a spaced apart relationship in this bottom wall <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the modules <b>12</b> are disposed in sliding fit within the casing <b>11</b> and cavity <b>11</b>′ and because the side walls <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>′ of the casing are curved side walls, they define a pair of internal channels <b>23</b> and <b>23</b>′ to accommodate the passage of the wiring <b>24</b> which connects to the LEDs of each module retained within the casing <b>11</b>. Accordingly, this wiring <b>24</b> is not visible from the exterior of the light bar assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the top wall <b>20</b> of the modules is a flat top wall and is disposed in contact with the flat inner surface <b>15</b>′ of the base wall <b>15</b> to provide for heat conduction therewith. Accordingly, heat is dissipated through the casing <b>11</b>. As well, heat is dissipated through the channels and the connectors, and the exposed bottom wall <b>19</b>, as will be described later. It is also conceivable that all of the wiring could be run through a single one of the channels and that the inner face of one of the side walls <b>16</b> or <b>16</b>′ have a flat surface in contact with a side wall of the module to provide improved thermal conductivity therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the modules, herein modules <b>12</b> and <b>12</b>′, are provided with cavities <b>25</b> and <b>25</b>′, respectively, at their opposed ends and through their side walls <b>18</b> and <b>18</b>′ for the passage of electrical wires <b>24</b> as better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when these modules are connected in end-to-end facial contact in the casing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, there is shown the construction of the end connector <b>12</b>. As hereinshown the end connector has a hollow connecting hub <b>30</b> which is dimensioned and configured for frictional sliding friction fit at a connecting end <b>30</b>′ thereof (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) into a space <b>31</b> of the cavity <b>11</b>′, adjacent a free end of the casing <b>15</b>. The wire bundle <b>24</b>′, as shown in these Figures, is received and concealed in the hollow connecting hub <b>30</b> which hub constitutes an internal passage for such wiring. A connecting means in the form of a transverse connecting flange <b>32</b> formed integral with the hub at a free end thereof is provided for securing the connector to support means such as a vertical wall, etc. The connecting flange <b>32</b> is provided with holes <b>33</b> whereby to receive fasteners <b>34</b> therein to achieve this fastening.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the support structure is herein constituted by a vertical wall board <b>40</b> or board section with the connecting flange <b>32</b> secured to an internal surface <b>41</b> of the wall board <b>40</b> and with the hollow connecting hub <b>30</b> extending through a mounting hole <b>42</b> in the board <b>40</b> and protruding from the opposed surface <b>43</b> of the board <b>40</b> whereby to expose the connecting end <b>30</b>′ thereof for connection within a free end section of the casing <b>11</b>. As hereinshown, the wire bundle <b>24</b>′ extends through the hollow hub <b>30</b> and behind the internal surface <b>41</b> of the vertical wall board. Of course, this vertical wall board can be a kitchen cabinet with the light bar assembly <b>10</b> extending therefrom. The wires would then run in one of the cupboards of the cabinet where a transformer can be concealed. There are several other ways in which this light bar can be connected. The connector <b>30</b> may be provided at one end only of the assembly <b>10</b> with the other end being fitted with a plug (not shown) with the bars supported freely from a support wall such as the vertical wall board <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the assembly may be suspended, if it is a long assembly, by wires extending from a ceiling or from any wall above the elongated light bar assembly which may be several feet in length. The miniature casing of the present invention is approximately ¼ inch in cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B, there will be described the specific application or use of the light bar assembly. As hereinshown, the vertical wall board <b>40</b> is that as used in the construction of a display case <b>50</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A second exterior wall board <b>51</b> is provided and against which the wall board <b>40</b> is secured. A channel <b>52</b> is routed in this second exterior wall board <b>51</b> adjacent to the hub of the connector <b>13</b> for the passage of the wire bundle <b>24</b>′ therethrough. As hereinshown, the flange <b>32</b> of the connector is also mounted in a routed cavity <b>53</b> so that it is flush with the inner surface <b>51</b>′ of the second wall board <b>51</b>. Accordingly, the wiring is concealed in a composite wall panel of the display case <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the display case has a bottom wall <b>54</b> and a glass top wall <b>55</b> and front wall (the latter not being shown herein). One end of the light bar assembly <b>10</b> is supported by the connector <b>13</b> and the other end may be supported by a support disc <b>56</b> which is secured to the opposed vertical wall <b>57</b> by means of a screw fastener <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The vertical wall board <b>40</b>, or board section, as hereinshown has a flat bottom wall <b>59</b> which is provided with one or more support threaded bolts <b>60</b> which provide for vertical wedging displacement of the wall board <b>40</b>. It also provides for the removal of the vertical wall board or section and the light bar assembly <b>10</b>. Such is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, when the threaded bolt <b>60</b> is threaded outwardly, it wedges the wall board <b>40</b> or section upwardly in the direction of arrow <b>61</b> placing it in the position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the bolt <b>60</b> is threaded in, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the vertical wall board <b>40</b> or board section can be lowered a limited amount sufficient to cause it to tilt outwardly in the direction of arrow <b>62</b> to disengage the light bar assembly. Of course, in doing so it is necessary to pull on the wire bundle <b>24</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, the vertical wall board <b>40</b> or board section may extend to the base wall <b>54</b> and an exterior board piece <b>63</b> inserted adjacent the connector <b>13</b> in the exterior wall <b>51</b> may be removable whereby to provide access to the connector <b>13</b> for the removal thereof. These illustrated attachments of the connector only illustrate a few examples of attachment and many other configurations of connections are possible and it is not intended to restrict the present invention to the attachments as herein illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another important advantage of the connector <b>13</b> is that it permits for the casing and its LED modules to be rotated about the support axis of these connectors whereby to orient the light beams of the LED or the bottom wall <b>19</b> of the modules at a specific angle. This is particularly useful when the light bar is used in a display case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or in other applications where it is required to orient the light beam at a specific angle or to change the angle of the light beam from time-to-time depending on its intended use.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> there is also shown that an air cooling current could be directed through the light bar assembly by providing a concealed fan <b>70</b> with a conduit <b>71</b> extending to the open end <b>32</b>′ of the connector <b>13</b> or to the channel <b>52</b> formed in the support wall <b>51</b>. The other end of the assembly may have a hole <b>72</b> whereby to evacuate air as illustrated by arrow <b>73</b>. Accordingly, this small fan would generate a continuous airflow through the channels <b>23</b> and <b>23</b>′ and thereby continuously cooling the modules <b>12</b> and the casing <b>11</b>. Because the system of the present invention is a modular system, this may be desirable when the light bar assembly is of a very long length and used in a restricted space. It is also pointed out that the connectors <b>13</b> may be provided at opposed ends of the casing and each be connected in a terminal box which is hung from a ceiling by a tube and in which one of the tubes would accommodate the wire bundle. Accordingly, the assembly can be either connected to a wall or suspended from a ceiling depending on the application thereof.</p>
