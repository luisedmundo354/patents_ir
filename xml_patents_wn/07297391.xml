<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation-in-part and claims priority from U.S. Utility patent application Ser. No. 10/783,946, filed Feb. 20, 2004, now abandoned entitled “DRAW RESONANT RESISTANT MULTILAYER FILMS,” naming inventors Kevin G.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure, in general, relates to draw resonant resistant multilayer films, methods for manufacturing same and articles including same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Increasingly, manufacturers are turning to polymers to create surfaces that are resistant to chemical and environmental damage. For example, fluorinated polymers exhibit a resistance to damage caused by exposure to chemicals, such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), a resistance to stains, and a resistance to damage caused by exposure to environmental conditions. Such polymers have been used in applications such as airplane and train cargo hold liners, vinyl siding surface treatments, and photovoltaic protective coverings.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, processing of such films for use in these applications is difficult. Line speed in production is often limited by the appearance of draw resonance at relatively low line speeds, such as below 50 feet per minute. These processing limitations increase costs and reduce the availability of these beneficial films. As such, robust multilayer films having preferred mechanical and processing properties are generally desirable in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer film comprising a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a blend of a first fluoropolymer having a first average molecular weight and a second fluoropolymer having a second average molecular weight. The first average molecular weight is greater than the second average molecular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a further embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer polymeric film comprising a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a fluoropolymer having a bimodal molecular weight distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer film comprising a polymeric layer including a first fluoropolymer having a first average molecular weight and a second fluoropolymer having a second average molecular weight. The first average molecular weight is greater than the second average molecular weight. The multilayer film is adapted to be drawn at a linespeed of at least about 50 ft/min with a thickness variance no more than about 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a method of manufacturing a multilayer film. The method includes extruding a first polymer layer and extruding a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a blend of a first fluoropolymer having a first average molecular weight and a second fluoropolymer having a second average molecular weight. The first average molecular weight is greater than the second average molecular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further aspects of the disclosure are found in a multilayer polymeric film comprising a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a fluoropolymer having a bimodal molecular weight distribution of molecules and the first polymer layer has a melt phase tensile strength at least about 50% greater than the melt phase tensile strength of the second layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer film typically including a layer having properties useful for the processing of the multilayer film and a layer having properties that provide mechanical properties in the resulting multilayer film. The multilayer film may further include a layer that provides desirable surface properties. These surface properties may include chemical resistance or adhesiveness. In one exemplary application, the multilayer film may be used in fluoropolymer processing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary multilayer film. The exemplary film <b>100</b> has two layers, <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Layer <b>102</b> includes a polymer or polymer blend that provides processing characteristics and desired processing behaviors. Layer <b>104</b> includes a polymer or polymer blend that provides desired mechanical properties and behaviors exhibited in the resulting multilayer film.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Layer <b>102</b> includes a polymer or polymer blend that exhibits desirable processing properties or behaviors in a melt phase. In one exemplary embodiment, the polymer or polymer blend may exhibit melt strain hardening behavior at a given draw ratio or within a given draw ratio domain. In another exemplary embodiment, a polymer or polymer blend may exhibit a higher melt-phase tensile force for a given draw ratio. In one particular embodiment, the polymer of layer <b>102</b> may include a melt stain hardening acrylic. In another exemplary embodiment, the polymer or polymer blend may include a polymer having a relatively high molecular weight distribution and exhibiting a relatively high melt-phase tensile force.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Layer <b>102</b> may comprise a polymer component exhibiting melt strain hardening at processing conditions. Melt strain hardening is exhibited when the melt-phase tensile force smoothed slope relative to a draw ratio domain is significantly positive for a polymeric component. In one exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening component is a non-polyolefin polymer that exhibits melt strain hardening at draw ratios greater than 10:1. In another exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening component is a non-polyolefin polymer component exhibiting a melt-phase tensile force smoothed slope in the melt phase of greater than about 0.03 cN between the draw ratios of between 0 and greater than 30:1. For example, the melt-phase tensile force to draw ratio slope may be greater than about 0.04 cN in the draw ratio domain between about 10:1 to about 20:1 or about 10:1 to about 15:1. In another embodiment, the melt strain hardening component may exhibit increasing smoothed melt-phase tensile force in the draw ratio domain between about 5:1 and about 30:1, such as between about 10:1 and about 15:1 or between about 20:1 and about 30:1. In a further exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening polymer exhibits melt strain hardening in which the polymer exhibits a positive ratio of change in melt-phase tensile force to change in draw ratio in the draw ratio domain of between a first draw ratio and a second draw ratio, wherein the damage resistant polymer may exhibit a melt plateau in the same domain. According to a particular embodiment, the melt strain hardening polymer exhibits a melt-phase tensile force to draw ratio slope of greater than about 0.03 cN in the desired draw ratio domain. For example, the melt strain-hardening polymer may exhibit a slope of not less than about 0.03 cN over a specific draw ratio domain, such as not less than about 0.4 cN or not less than about 0.5 cN over a specific draw ratio domain. In contrast, a mechanical property or surface property polymer may exhibit a small slope or generally flat slope of less than about 0.03 cN, such as less than about 0.005 cN or substantially zero cN over the specific draw ratio domain. In a further exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening polymer exhibits a positive ratio change in melt-phase tensile force to change in draw ratio in the draw ratio domain of about 10:1 and about 15:1 during processing at about 230° C. The damage resistant polymer exhibits a generally flat slope in the same draw ratio domain under the same processing conditions. In a further exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening component may exhibit a greater melt-phase tensile force to draw ratio slope than the mechanical or surface components over a draw ratio domain, such as at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about 80%, at least about 100%, or at least about 300% greater slope.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The processing property polymer may exhibit a higher melt-phase tensile force than the polymers of the mechanical layer <b>104</b> in a given draw ratio domain or at a given draw ratio. For example, an exemplary polymer or polymer blend may exhibit a melt-phase tensile force that is greater than the melt-phase tensile force exhibited by the polymer component of the mechanical layer <b>104</b> at a given draw ratio. In one exemplary embodiment, the higher melt-phase tensile force component exhibits a melt-phase tensile force that is at least about 50% greater than that of the mechanical property component in the draw ratio domain of 10:1 to 30:1. For example, a melt-phase tensile force exhibited by the melt properties polymer is at least about 66% higher than the melt-phase tensile force exhibited by the mechanical properties polymer in the range of draw ratios between about 10:1 and 20:1, or between about 10:1 and 15:1. For example, the melt-phase tensile force may be at least about 70% higher, at least about 90% higher, at least about 100% higher, or at least about 133% higher.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The melt strain hardening or higher melt-phase tensile force polymer may, for example, be a non-polyolefin polymer such as acrylic and not polyethylene or polypropylene. In one exemplary embodiment, the non-polyolefin polymer may be a branched polymer. In another exemplary embodiment, the non-polyolefin polymer may be a linear polymer. An acrylic polymer may be formed from a monomer having an alkyl group having from 1-4 carbon atoms, a glycidyl group or a hydroxyalkyl group having from 1-4 carbon atoms. Representative acrylic polymers include polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate, polyglycidyl methacrylate, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate, polyethyl acrylate, polybutyl acrylate, polyglycidyl acrylate, polyhydroxyethyl acrylate and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The acrylic polymer may, for example, be an impact grade or impact modified acrylic. Impact-modified acrylic polymers generally comprise a copolymer of monomers of acrylic monomers with an effective amount of suitable comonomer or graft moiety to produce the desired elastic modulus and impact resistance. An acrylic elastomer, sometimes referred to as acrylate rubber, polyacrylate rubber, polyacrylic elastomer or “ACM” and which is a composition based on a mixture of a polyacrylate and polymethacrylate, a polyacrylate and ethylene methacrylate copolymer (“EMAC”) (such as Chevron Chemicals EMAC 2260), or a polyacrylate and ethylene butylacrylate (“EBAC”) can be used. Alternatively, a thermoplastic impact-modified acrylic polymer can be a blend of a clear glassy acrylic polymer, such as a plastic copolymer of ethylene and a carboxylic acid compound selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and mixtures thereof, with elastomeric components, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the impact-modified acrylic polymer generally includes fine particles of the elastomer dispersed uniformly in the plastic copolymer. The impact grade acrylic may comprise transparent toughened thermoplastic blends prepared by blending 10 to 99 weight percent of a block copolymer; 0.1 to 1 weight percent of particulate rubber having a particle size from 0.1 to 10 microns; and the balance a clear glassy polymer. Another suitable technique for making impact-modified acrylic polymer employs the use of a so-called “core/shell” product, such as Atofina DR-101 resin. These generally are polymer particles that have a central core of one polymer surrounded by a shell of another polymer. The core can be either the plastic or elastomer component and the shell will be the opposite, i.e., elastomer or plastic component. The core/shell particles are fed to a melt mixing apparatus, such as a melt extruder in which the core and shell domains are blended in the melt phase to form a homogeneous blend on a much smaller scale and a film is formed from the extrudate of this homogeneous blend.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one particular embodiment, the melt strain hardening material may be a linear impact modified acrylic. In a further exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening acrylic may be a branched impact modified acrylic. Generally, linear acrylic polymers that are not impact modified, such as those used in adhesive layers, are not suitable. However, an acrylic exemplifying melt strain hardening behavior in the desired draw ratio domain is suitable. In another exemplary embodiment, an acrylic exemplifying higher melt-phase tensile force in the desired draw ratio domain may be suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In further exemplary embodiments, the layer <b>102</b> comprises a blend of melt strain hardening polymer and other components. For example, the layer <b>102</b> may comprise at least about 70% by weight of the melt strain hardening component, such as, impact grade acrylic. In an exemplary embodiment, the layer may comprise at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, or at least about 90% impact grade acrylic. Layer <b>102</b> may also include other components such as the damage resistant polymer. For example, the layer <b>102</b> may include no more than about 30% PVDF, PVDF copolymer or blend thereof by weight when the melt strain hardening component includes acrylic.
