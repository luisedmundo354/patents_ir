<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to projection systems having micromirrors and micromirror arrays. The present invention also relates to integrated circuits having at least one deflectable element.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various technologies have been proposed for projection and display systems such as those utilizing spatial light modulation employing various materials. Among these are silicon-based micromechanical spatial light modulation (SLM) devices in which a large portion of the device is optically active. In such systems, micromirrors may deflect in one or more directions. For instance, in architectures that rely on a passive drive scheme, a voltage bias is accomplished by an address electrode. Once the mirror rotates, the electrode floats and the mirror maintains its deflected position. As the bias is reset, the mirror rotates back to the flat state at a rate that is limited by the hinge spring constant of the micromirror device. The hinge spring constant typically results in a reset cycle that is slower than the drive cycle. This limits the ability of the micromirror device to twitch at high frequencies. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a micromirror architecture that could facilitate high reset frequencies, while providing high efficiency and operational integrity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed herein is a microelectromechanical device having a reset electrode suitable for use in projection display devices such as spatial light modulators. The device includes an optically transmissive substrate, a semiconductor substrate positioned a spaced distance from the optically transmissive substrate, and a member positioned between the optically transmissive substrate and the semiconductor substrate deflectable between a rest position and at least one operative position. The deflectable member is supported by one of the optically transmissive substrate or the semiconductor substrate. The deflectable member deflects when electrostatically attracted to at least one address electrode and returns to an undeflected position by operation of a reset electrode.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure is directed to display devices, particularly those utilizing spatial light modulators. The present disclosure is also directed to microelectromechanical devices that include a member deflectable between a rest position and at least one operative position. The deflectable member can be made of various reflective media in order to redirect light from one light path to another. Reflective deflectable members are typically referred to as micromirrors.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Deflection is typically accomplished by electrostatic force generated by at least one address electrode at a given bias voltage. In the device disclosed herein, the deflectable member is returned to an undeflected position by operation of a reset electrode operating independent of the CMOS architecture. The bias voltage produced by the reset electrode is sufficient to redirect the deflectable member. In certain instances the bias voltage produced by the reset electrode may be greater than the bias voltage exerted by the address electrode. Thus, the electrostatic force generated by reset electrode can quickly and efficiently return the deflectable member to a rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is contemplated that the microelectromechanical device may include any suitable deflectable member requiring rapid reset. For purposes of illustration the device will be described in terms of a digital micromirror device. However, other microelectromechanical devices and configurations may be effectively utilized within the scope and spirit of this disclosure. Digital micromirror devices that would be suitable for use with the rapid reset configuration as described herein are described in co-pending application Ser. No. 10/136,719 entitled “Micro-mirror Device”, filed Apr. 30, 2002, and commonly assigned to the entity herein, the specification of which is incorporated by reference herein. As generally discussed herein, the digital micromirror device may have various planar geometries as desired and/or required.

The deflectable member assembly <b>810</b> is in electrical contact with ground electrode <b>808</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B, and <b>8</b>C, ground electrode <b>808</b> is patterned on or integrated into the lower face <b>820</b> of the optically transmissive substrate <b>814</b>. It is also contemplated that the ground electrode <b>808</b> could be mounted on the lower face <b>820</b> by any suitable method. A reset electrode <b>818</b> is also patterned on, integrated into, or mounted on the lower face <b>820</b> of the optically transmissive substrate <b>814</b>. The reset electrode <b>818</b> is composed of optically transparent material. It is contemplated that the ground electrode <b>808</b> may be composed of any suitable material including, but not limited to, optically transmissive materials enumerated herein as would be applicable. The ground electrode <b>808</b> and reset electrode <b>818</b> function independently of one another and are both independent of the CMOS architecture found in the semiconductor substrate <b>812</b>. Address electrode <b>816</b> is positioned in the semiconductor substrate <b>812</b>. Typically the address electrode <b>816</b> functions within the CMOS architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The deflectable member assembly <b>810</b> with mirror <b>800</b> is in a rest or optically neutral position when the voltage biases between the reset electrode <b>818</b> and ground electrode <b>808</b> are canceled. Discontinuation of the bias voltage in reset electrode <b>818</b>, together with introduction of a bias voltage sufficient to generate an electrostatic attractive force at address electrode <b>816</b> drives the deflectable member assembly <b>810</b> into a tilted or operative position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Reset to the start position can be accomplished by discontinuation of the voltage bias of the address electrode <b>816</b> together with introduction of a voltage potential in the reset electrode <b>818</b>. This state is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, in the rest or optically neutral state, the bias voltage of the reset electrode <b>818</b> (V<sub>r</sub>=+) balances or cancels the bias voltage of ground electrode <b>808</b> (V<sub>g</sub>=−). The absolute value of the respective bias voltage may be any suitable value. Typically, the bias voltage absolute value of ground electrode <b>808</b> and reset electrode <b>818</b> will exceed the absolute value of the bias voltage of the address electrode <b>816</b>. It is contemplated that the ground electrode <b>808</b> and reset electrode <b>818</b> achieve bias voltage values between −100V and 100V.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The deflectable member assembly <b>810</b> can remain in the operative position as long as desired or required. When reset to the rest or operatively neutral position is required, reset can be accomplished by discontinuation of the bias voltage of address electrode <b>816</b> (V<sub>e1</sub>=0) and resumption of bias voltage for reset electrode <b>818</b> (V<sub>r</sub>=+) as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Location of the ground electrode <b>808</b>, reset electrode <b>818</b> and associated deflectable member assembly <b>810</b> on the optically transparent substrate <b>814</b> permits standard CMOS processes (like SRAM) to be located on the semiconductor substrate <b>812</b> in the region below or covered by the deflectable member assembly <b>810</b>. Integration of the microelectromechanical system such as the deflectable member assembly <b>810</b> on substrate <b>814</b> permits greater flexibility in the formation of CMOS architecture and location on semiconductor substrate <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The microelectromechanical device with the reset electrode as disclosed herein may be used in a variety of applications. One nonlimiting example is in spatial light modulators. It is contemplated that a spatial light modulator can include a plurality of MEMS devices as disclosed herein having micromirrors or other suitable deflectable digital light device elements arranged in a suitable array. An optically transmissive layer and a semiconductor substrate can cooperatively define a sealed chamber or cavity in which the deflectable member(s) operate. Typically, the sealed chamber or cavity can contain any suitable fluid or gaseous material for facilitating operation of the deflectable member(s). Where fluids are employed, it is contemplated that the fluid of choice will have suitable properties for enhancing function of the deflectable member, optical reflectivity, or the like. It is contemplated that various dielectric fluids in general and dielectrophoretic fluids in particular may be introduced into the sealed chamber or cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The spatial light modulator is composed of an optically transmissive substrate as defined herein, a semiconductor substrate a spaced distance from the optically transmissive substrate, and deflectable member(s) positioned between the optically transmissive substrate and the semiconductor substrate. The deflectable member(s) may be appropriately configured micromirror(s) positioned between the semiconductor substrate and the optically transmissive substrate and supported by one of the foregoing. The deflectable member(s) are configured to deflect from a rest or optically neutral position to at least one operative position when electrostatically attracted to at least one address electrode located on the semiconductor substrate. The spatial light modulator also includes at least one reset electrode operable on the deflectable member to reset it to the rest or optically neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The spatial light modulator can be used with various display devices. One such device is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic view of an image projection system <b>900</b> using an improved micromirror device as depicted herein. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, light from light source <b>904</b> is focused on the micromirror device <b>902</b> by lens <b>906</b>. Although shown as a single lens <b>906</b>, the lens <b>906</b> is typically a group of lenses, integrators, and mirrors that together focus and direct light from light source <b>904</b> onto the surface of micromirror device <b>902</b>. Image data and control signals from controller <b>914</b> are written onto a suitable SRAM cell, DRAM cell, or the like, associated with each micromirror. The data in these associated cells cause some of the mirrors to rotate to an on position. Mirrors on the micromirror device <b>902</b> that are rotated to an off or rest position can reflect light into a light trap <b>908</b> or away from projection lens <b>910</b>, while mirrors rotated to an on position reflect light to projection lens <b>910</b>, which is also shown as a single lens for simplicity. Projection lens <b>910</b> focuses the light modulated by the micromirror device <b>902</b> onto a single image plane or screen <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The micromirror device <b>902</b> can be configured according to the disclosure herein and will broadly include an optically transmissive substrate, a semiconductor substrate, and at least one micromirror supported by one of the foregoing. The micromirror device <b>902</b> may also include at least one address electrode and at least one reset electrode as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The device disclosed herein may be fabricated in the manner discussed herein in order to construct a microelectromechanical device with a reset electrode. Appropriate spacer layers and patterning processes can be utilized to define appropriate structure such as hinge support posts, address electrode support posts, and the like on a suitable semiconductor substrate having address circuitry defined thereon as at reference numeral <b>1010</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Depending upon the location of the reset electrode in the finished microelectromechanical device, the semiconductor substrate can have a reset electrode already defined thereon or the reset electrode can be established on one of either the semiconductor substrate (as at reference numeral <b>1012</b>) or a region distal to the semiconductor substrate as at reference numeral <b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In micromirror devices, it is contemplated that the various elements of the micromirror can be established sequentially through various strategies and processes. Where the reset electrode is positioned on the semiconductor substrate, it is contemplated that the reset electrode can be established as part of the same fabrication sequence. Where the reset electrode is positioned on the optically transparent substrate, it is contemplated that the process can include suitable patterning and deposition of a reset electrode region in the spacer region distal to the semiconductor substrate as at <b>1014</b>. Alternately, the reset electrode can be established on the optically transmissive substrate by suitable deposition procedures including appropriate patterning and etching processes. Once the micromirror structure is established as at <b>1016</b>, the optically transparent substrate layer with associated reset electrode can be established as at <b>1018</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a simplified outline of a micromirror construction sequence, it is contemplated that a first spacer layer may be established, patterned, and etched to define structures such as address electrode support posts, hinge support posts and optionally one reset electrode and the like to be constructed. Hinge elements may be established in the appropriate spacer layer to connect the hinges to the hinge support posts. Similarly, address electrodes can be established on the address electrode supports.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In order to establish a mirror element, a second spacer layer may be patterned in overlying relationship to the previously defined architecture. The spacer layer can be patterned to define connections between at least one hinge element and at least one mirror element.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An optically transparent substrate may be established in sealed overlying relationship with the mirror assembly and semiconductor substrate along with appropriate removal of sacrificial layers. If not defined on the semiconductor substrate, at least one reset electrode can be established and associated with the optically transmissive substrate in a manner which permits the reset electrode to operate independent of the address electrode and, if need be, generate a bias voltage greater than the address electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">While embodiments have been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s) but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is permitted under the law.</p>
