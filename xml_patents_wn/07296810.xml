<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to apparatus and a method for installing a sensor, and more particularly, to apparatus and a method for installing a sensor in adjustable connection with relatively movable members, particularly a steerable wheel of a vehicle and related structure, for accurately sensing relative position thereof, without requiring adjusting the sensor during or after the installation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Commonly, a sensor for sensing relative position of members require some adjustment of the sensor during installation. For instance, a sensor for sensing a rotational position or steering angle of a wheel and/or wheel hub assembly of a vehicle about a steering axis typically must be installed such that correct electrical outputs are produced when the wheel and/or hub assembly is in a center or straight ahead position and in a range of rotated or turned positions. Achieving this commonly entails a trial and error process wherein the sensor is mounted or installed, and then is adjusted, such as by applying a voltage input to the sensor and rotating it while in its mounted position and measuring voltage outputs, until an orientation is found wherein desired output or outputs are obtained. The sensor is then fixed in that orientation. Disadvantages of this process include the time and equipment required for the trial and error steps, and inconvenience due to the location of the sensor in connection with a steering system which is typically in a difficult to access location such as beneath the vehicle or in a steering assembly. If exposes, and adjustably mounted, the sensor can be jarred out of adjustment, and fasteners holding the sensor in an adjusted position can become loosened. Additionally, an extension such as a shaft or other member is commonly required to connect the sensor input to the relatively movable member to which it is to be connected, which can add another variable to the adjustment process. Reference in this regard, Lukac U.S. Pat. No. 6,494,471B1 issued Dec. 17, 2002 to New Holland North America, Inc., and Chino et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,182B1 issued Jul. 17, 2001 to Kabushiki Kaisha Toyoda Jidoshokki Seisakusho of Japan.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a similar manner, when a linear sensor actuated by a lever must be installed such that a correct electrical output is produced when the lever is in a particular position, such as a center position, a trial and error adjustment process is typically also required.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, what is sought is apparatus and a method for installing a sensor in connection with relatively movable members such as an axle assembly and a steerable wheel, which overcomes one or more of the disadvantages set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY Of THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the invention, apparatus and a method for installing a sensor in connection with relatively movable members for sensing relative position thereof, without requiring adjustment of the sensor, which overcomes many of the disadvantages set forth above, is disclosed. According to a preferred apparatus and method of the invention, the sensor includes a body or portion mountable in a predetermined position on a first of the members and an input or portion movable relative to the body or other portion, the sensor being operable for providing a signal representative of a position of the input relative to the body, including a predetermined signal representative of a predetermined position of the input. The invention utilizes a coupler adjustably connectable to a second of the members and connectable in predetermined relation to the input of the sensor for coupling the input to the second member. The coupler can be adjustably connected to the second member in a predetermined relation to the first member such that when the input of the sensor is connected to the coupler and the body is mounted in the predetermined position on the first member, the input and the body will be relatively positioned such that the sensor will provide the predetermined signal when the first and second members are in the predetermined relative position. The input of the sensor is connected in the predetermined relation to the coupler and the body is mounted in the predetermined position on the first member, such that when one or both of the first and second members are moved so as to be in different relative positions, the sensor will provide signals representative of the different relative positions, respectively, including the predetermined signal when the members are in the predetermined relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a result of using the installation method according to the invention, when the sensor is installed, it is in proper position and orientation relative to the second member for providing or outputting a signal representative of the predetermined relative position, which can represent a straight ahead orientation in the instance of a steering assembly, as well as predetermined signals representative of a range of relatively rotated positions of the members, which can, for instance, represent rotational positions of elements of the steering assembly, such as of a wheel and hub assembly relative to another structure such as an axle housing, supporting kingpin, or other related structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sensor input is preferably connected to the second relatively rotatable member via a pin or shaft, to allow the sensor to be positioned a desired distance away. The coupler can thus be placed on the pin or shaft and rotated thereabout to achieve a required rotational orientation to provide the required signals. Once oriented, the coupler can then be secured to the pin or shaft in any suitable manner to prevent relative rotation thereof, including using a common fastener such as a screw threadedly receivable in a threaded hole in an end of the shaft opposite the second member, a press fit, or the like. The coupler and the sensor input can include matingly engageable elements, such as, but not limited to, a hexagonal or other multifaceted male element receivable in a correspondingly faceted female receptacle for joint rotation. The sensor can be provided with the input positioned in a predetermined rotational orientation or position relative to the body, such that when the input is matingly engaged with the coupler and the body portion is mounted, all elements of the sensor will be properly positioned or oriented corresponding to the position or rotational orientation of the second member such that no positioning or other adjustment of the sensor is required.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION Of THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to the drawings, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, apparatus <b>10</b> of the invention for installing a sensor for sensing angular position of a wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> of the vehicle <b>14</b> about a generally vertical steering axis <b>16</b> extending through wheel hub assembly <b>12</b>, is shown. Wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> is a conventionally constructed and operable wheel hub assembly including a housing <b>18</b> to which is mountable a conventional wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on a mounting flange <b>22</b> using an array of lugs <b>24</b>. Housing <b>18</b> and wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b> are rotatable about a generally horizontal drive axis <b>26</b> extending therethrough and through wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> in the well known manner. Wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b> and housing <b>18</b> are additionally rotatable with wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> about steering axis <b>16</b>, also in the well known manner. Vehicle <b>14</b> shown is a conventionally constructed and operable tractor which is representative of a wide variety of other agricultural work machines, construction machines, mining machines, forestry machines, and the like, for which the present apparatus has utility. Here, it should be appreciated that although apparatus <b>10</b> and the method of installation according to the invention have utility for use with a wide variety of steerable wheel arrangements, including non-driven or powered wheels, apparatus <b>10</b> and the method of the invention are particularly advantageous for use with wheels of relatively heavy work machines and vehicles like vehicle <b>14</b>, due to the ability to install a rotational position sensor without adjustment, so as to be capable of providing accurate, reliable sensing of angular position of the wheel hub and thus the wheel mounted thereto relative to a desired or selected reference. Apparatus and the installation method of the invention also facilitate and allow removal and disassembly of apparatus <b>10</b> and also the components of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b>, and reinstallation and assembly, without requiring adjustment of the sensor. Apparatus <b>10</b> and the method of the invention also have utility for installation of sensors for a wide variety of other applications involving relatively movable members and thus are not to be considered to be limited to the embodiment set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> includes a C shape support frame <b>28</b> which supports housing <b>18</b> for rotation about drive axis <b>26</b>. Support frame <b>28</b> includes an upper arm <b>32</b> projecting in cantilever relation from the top of a central portion and a lower arm (not shown) projecting in cantilever relation from the bottom of central portion , thereby defining a space <b>36</b> therebetween in which is located an axle housing end <b>34</b>. Upper arm <b>32</b> has a passage <b>38</b> therethrough coaxial with steering axis <b>16</b>, in which an upper kingpin <b>40</b> is fixedly mounted. The lower arm includes a similar passage therethrough which receives a lower kingpin (also not shown). Upper kingpin <b>40</b> and the lower kingpin connect wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> to axle housing end <b>34</b> for relative rotation or steering movement about steering axis <b>16</b>. The steering movements of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> and the wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b> mounted thereto about steering axis <b>16</b> are effected by longitudinal movements of a tire rod <b>42</b>, connected at one end to wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> and at an opposite end to a conventional steering input device (not shown) on vehicle <b>14</b>, which input device can be manually controlled, typically by a steering wheel, and/or automatically controlled by an automatic guidance system connected to apparatus <b>10</b> for receiving steering angle information therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, upper kingpin <b>40</b> includes an axial passage <b>44</b> therethrough extending between a lower axial opening <b>46</b> on a bottom axial end portion <b>48</b> of kingpin <b>40</b>, and an upper opening <b>50</b> on a top surface <b>52</b> thereof. By the usage of the term “axial” in connection with passage <b>44</b> herein, it is meant that steering axis <b>16</b> extends through passage <b>44</b>, but not necessarily that passage <b>44</b> has a central axis coincident with steering axis <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Bottom axial end portion <b>48</b> of upper kingpin <b>40</b> is received in a bearing assembly <b>54</b> including an inner bearing ring <b>56</b> which mounts to bottom axial end portion <b>48</b> for rotation therewith relative to an outer bearing ring <b>58</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, outer bearing ring <b>58</b> is receivable in an axial counter bore <b>60</b> forming a bearing seat in axle housing end <b>34</b>. Beneath counter bore <b>60</b> is an open space <b>62</b> within axle housing end <b>34</b>. An annular grease seal <b>64</b> is receivable in counter bore <b>60</b> to form a sealed condition around kingpin <b>40</b> above bearing assembly <b>54</b>, for preventing or limiting passage of grease upwardly around the kingpin as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A grease retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is positionable on and fixedly mounted to a lower shoulder <b>68</b> of axle housing end <b>34</b> around counter bore <b>60</b> beneath outer bearing ring <b>58</b>, for preventing passage of grease therebelow into space <b>62</b>. Retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A is preferably fixedly mounted to shoulder <b>68</b> using an adhesive sealant such as commonly available under the Loctite tradename. Retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A thus defines a lower periphery of a lubricant cavity <b>70</b> which has an upper periphery enclosed by seal <b>64</b> around kingpin <b>40</b>. Thus, it is evident that axial passage <b>44</b> through kingpin <b>40</b> extends between top surface <b>52</b> of kingpin <b>40</b> and lubricant cavity <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Kingpin <b>40</b> is mounted in passage <b>38</b> of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> in a predetermined orientation about steering axis <b>16</b> and in predetermined relation to a first reference associated with wheel hub assembly <b>12</b>, such as drive axis <b>26</b> or an associated element such as a surface of flange <b>22</b> of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> against which wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b> is or will be mounted and which establishes the direction of rotation of wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b>, using a plurality of bolts <b>72</b> threadedly received in threaded holes <b>74</b> in upper arm <b>32</b> at predetermined spaced angular locations around passage <b>38</b> and steering axis <b>16</b>. One or more shims <b>73</b> can be disposed between kingpin <b>40</b> and the surface of arm <b>32</b> as required for height adjustment. With bottom axial end portion <b>48</b> of kingpin <b>40</b> received in inner bearing ring <b>56</b>, and inner bearing ring <b>56</b> received in outer bearing ring <b>58</b> mounted in counter bore <b>60</b> of axle housing end <b>34</b>, and with a similar lower kingpin arrangement on the bottom, wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> is connected to and can support axle housing end <b>34</b>, and is rotatable about steering axis <b>16</b> relative thereto in the well known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A sensor <b>76</b> is provided for determining or sensing the rotational or steering position of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> about axis <b>16</b> relative to a second reference, which is associated with vehicle <b>14</b>. Sensor <b>76</b> can be, for instance, but is not limited to, a well known, commercially available Hall effect type sensor or a potentiometer, including circuitry which when powered is operable for sensing or detecting a rotational position or orientation of an input element <b>78</b> which is preferably supported for rotation in or extends into or through a body portion <b>80</b> of sensor <b>76</b>. According to the invention, body portion <b>80</b> is fixedly mountable in a predetermined position on top surface <b>52</b> of kingpin <b>40</b> in a predetermined angular orientation about steering axis <b>16</b> relative to the first reference associated the wheel such as drive axis <b>26</b> or the associated element such as the outer surface of flange <b>22</b> of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> against which wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b> is mounted. This can be accomplished in a suitable manner, such as using screws <b>82</b> threadedly receivable in threaded holes <b>84</b> located at predetermined locations in top surface <b>52</b> relative to the first reference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Because the positions of threaded holes <b>74</b> in upper arm <b>32</b> of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> relative to the first reference such as drive axis <b>26</b> are known, and the positions of threaded holes <b>84</b> in kingpin <b>40</b> to the first reference are known, when kingpin <b>40</b> is installed in the predetermined orientation on upper arm <b>32</b>, and body portion <b>80</b> of sensor <b>74</b> is installed on kingpin <b>40</b>, body portion <b>80</b> will be in a known relation to the first reference, and, when the first reference is in a particular position, for instance, a straight ahead position, body portion <b>80</b> will be in known relation to that position. As a result, when hub assembly <b>12</b> and kingpin <b>40</b> are rotated about steering axis <b>16</b> relative to axle housing end <b>34</b> from the known rotational position, body portion <b>80</b> of sensor <b>76</b> and drive axis <b>26</b> are correspondingly rotated relative thereto, and, by holding or fixing input element <b>78</b> of sensor <b>76</b> to axle housing end <b>34</b>, sensor <b>76</b> would be caused to change state corresponding to the relative rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, apparatus <b>10</b> includes a pin <b>86</b> for connecting axle housing end <b>34</b> to input element <b>78</b> of sensor <b>76</b> through axial passage <b>44</b> of kingpin <b>40</b>. Pin <b>86</b> has an upper end <b>88</b> and an opposite lower end <b>90</b>. Discussing lower end <b>90</b> first, that end is fixedly mountable or connected in a suitable manner to grease retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A, which is modified for that purpose, and, in turn, is fixed to lower shoulder <b>68</b> in counter bore <b>60</b> of axle housing end <b>34</b> as explained above. As a result, when wheel hub <b>12</b> is rotated about steering axis <b>16</b> relative to axle housing end <b>34</b>, kingpin <b>40</b> and sensor body <b>80</b> will correspondingly rotate about pin <b>86</b>. Pin <b>86</b> can be fixedly mounted or connected to retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A in any suitable manner. For instance, here, retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A is modified to include an axial hole <b>94</b> therethrough adapted for receiving lower end <b>90</b> of pin <b>86</b>, which is threaded for threadedly receiving a nut <b>92</b>. A flanged sleeve <b>96</b> is insertable from above into an axial hole in retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A and includes hole <b>94</b> therethrough for receiving end <b>90</b> of pin <b>86</b>. Pin <b>86</b> is thus securable to retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A by threaded engagement with nut <b>92</b>. An advantage of this construction is that it allows pin <b>86</b> to be installed after kingpin <b>40</b> and retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A are installed, and without positioning or aligning of either retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A and/or pin <b>86</b> about steering axis <b>16</b> to a reference such as drive axis <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Kingpin <b>40</b> additionally preferably includes a lateral passage <b>98</b> therethrough extending between an external opening <b>100</b> and axial passage <b>44</b>. A cap or grease fitting <b>102</b> can be threadedly or otherwise disposed in external opening <b>100</b>. This provides a path for introduction of lubricant, such as grease, into axial passage <b>44</b>, through which the lubricant can flow into lubricant cavity <b>70</b>, for lubricating bearing assembly <b>54</b>. To contain and prevent passage of lubricant upwardly through passage <b>44</b> around pin <b>86</b>, pin <b>86</b> of the invention preferably includes an O-ring groove <b>104</b> therearound, for receiving an O-ring <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), for forming a sealed condition with the inner surface of passage <b>44</b> around pin <b>86</b> when installed therein. Other means, such as a grease seal, could also be provided between pin <b>86</b> and kingpin <b>40</b> at a location above lateral passage <b>98</b>, as required or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Sensor <b>76</b> is operable for outputting a signal representative of a state thereof, such as, but not limited to, a relative rotational position of input element <b>78</b> and body portion <b>80</b>, over a suitable conductive path, such as a wire of a wiring harness <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for the purposes of the present application, it is desired that this signal be representative of a rotational or steering position of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> and wheel and tire assembly <b>20</b>, represented by drive axis <b>26</b>, relative to a selected second reference such as, but not limited to, a centerline of axle housing end <b>34</b>, denoted by line A; a centerline of vehicle <b>14</b>, denoted by line B, and/or another reference such as a centerline of rear axle of vehicle <b>14</b>, denoted by line C. It is also desired that sensor <b>76</b> be installable so as to accurately output this information without requiring adjustment or repositioning.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Apparatus <b>10</b> of the invention achieves this capability by providing a coupler <b>110</b> which is mountable on upper end <b>88</b> of pin <b>86</b> in a required rotational position about axis <b>16</b> relative to the first reference associated with wheel hub assembly <b>12</b>, such as drive axis <b>26</b> or the mounting surface of mounting flange <b>22</b>. Coupler <b>110</b> is cooperatively engageable in a predetermined, non-relatively rotatable manner, with input element <b>78</b> of sensor <b>76</b>, for connecting element <b>78</b> to axle housing end <b>34</b>. Thus, with coupler <b>110</b> mounted on upper end <b>88</b> of pin <b>86</b> in predetermined relation to the first reference, element <b>78</b> in a predetermined rotational position relative to body portion <b>80</b>, and body portion <b>80</b> in predetermined relation to the first reference, when powered, sensor <b>76</b> will output a signal accurately representative of the rotational or steering position of wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> relative to vehicle <b>14</b>. For instance, if wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> is in a predetermined steering position, such as the straight ahead position, sensor <b>76</b> when powered will output a predetermined signal representative of that position, and different predetermined signals when wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> is rotated relative to axle housing end <b>34</b> to different steering positions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Coupler <b>110</b> preferably has an outer surface having a predetermined shape which is cooperatively receivable in a correspondingly shape receptacle <b>112</b> of element <b>78</b> of sensor <b>76</b>, for locking coupler <b>110</b> and element <b>78</b> together when the sensor is installed. Coupler <b>110</b> is preferably of tubular construction or includes an axial hole <b>114</b> therethrough (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for cooperatively receiving upper end <b>88</b> of pin <b>86</b>. This allows coupler <b>110</b> to be placed on upper end <b>88</b> in a predetermined orientation or relationship to a selected reference, which can be, for instance, the first reference discussed above associated with wheel hub assembly <b>12</b>. This can be done in any suitable convenient manner such as using a jig or tool, and/or a laser alignment device, and/or one or more lines, surfaces or marks on the components, if any. When coupler <b>110</b> is in the required position, it can be secured in place by a screw <b>116</b> insertable through hole <b>114</b> and threadedly receivable in a threaded hole <b>118</b> in upper end <b>88</b>, such that coupler <b>110</b> and pin <b>86</b> will be locked together. In this regard, upper end <b>88</b> and hole <b>114</b> in coupler <b>110</b> can have outer and inner surfaces, respectively, which are optionally tapered and relatively sized such that coupler <b>110</b> will be press fit on upper end <b>88</b> as screw <b>116</b> is threaded therein and/or as body portion <b>80</b> is screwed onto surface <b>52</b> of the kingpin. Coupler <b>110</b> shown includes a hexagonal outer surface <b>120</b> which matingly engages a corresponding hexagonal inner surface <b>122</b> in receptacle <b>112</b> of element <b>78</b> of sensor <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) when received therein, for locking pin <b>86</b>, coupler <b>110</b> and element <b>78</b> together when sensor <b>76</b> is installed on kingpin <b>40</b>. Thus, one or more of the flat surfaces of outer surface <b>120</b> could be used for the alignment. Alternatively, coupler <b>110</b> and receptacle <b>112</b> can have other mating shapes, such as, but not limited to, shapes having one or more flat sides such as a D shape (illustrated by alternative coupler <b>110</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As a general rule, for more precision in the alignment, coupler <b>110</b> would have a greater number of flat sides. As another alternative, it is contemplated that a receptacle <b>112</b> could be provided on coupler <b>110</b> and element <b>78</b> could include a projection receivable in receptacle <b>112</b> on coupler <b>110</b>, if desired. Before or when sensor <b>76</b> is installed, element <b>78</b> will be oriented in a predetermined position in body <b>80</b> so as to be operable for outputting a signal having a predetermined value for the position corresponding to the aligning marks on element <b>78</b> and body <b>80</b>, such that element <b>78</b> and body <b>80</b>, and thus hub assembly <b>12</b>, will be in known relation to the selected reference.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> can be installed in a normal manner on axle housing end <b>34</b>, and sensor <b>76</b> can be simply installed without adjustment by inserting pin <b>86</b> into axial passage <b>44</b> and connecting it to retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A, mounting coupler <b>110</b> in the required orientation on upper end <b>88</b> of pin <b>86</b>, and then mounting body <b>80</b> of the coupler on kingpin <b>40</b> with element <b>78</b> in a predetermined position in body <b>80</b> and matingly connected to coupler <b>110</b>. As an example, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> can be positioned such that drive axis <b>26</b> is aligned or parallel with the centerline A of axle housing end <b>34</b>, or in some other known relation thereto. Coupler <b>110</b> can be positioned such that a flat side of hexagonal outer surface <b>120</b> is in predetermined relation to axis <b>26</b>, such as perpendicular thereto, as shown. Screw <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) can then be inserted in and threadedly engaged with threaded hole <b>114</b> in upper end <b>88</b> of pin <b>86</b>, for holding coupler <b>110</b> in position. Sensor <b>76</b>, with input element <b>78</b> oriented in predetermined relation to body <b>80</b> as shown, can then be installed on top surface <b>52</b> of kingpin <b>40</b> using screws <b>82</b> threadedly engageable in holes <b>84</b>, such that coupler <b>110</b> is matingly received in receptacle <b>112</b> of element <b>78</b> to lock element <b>78</b>, coupler <b>110</b> and pin <b>86</b> together with retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As a result, rotation of kingpin <b>40</b> with wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> will correspondingly rotate body <b>80</b> of sensor <b>76</b> relative to element <b>78</b>, such that sensor <b>76</b> will output a signal representative of the rotation. Subsequently, if removal of sensor <b>76</b> and/or wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> from axle housing end <b>34</b> is required, reinstallation or replacement of sensor <b>76</b> is accomplished in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a flow diagram <b>124</b> showing steps of installing a sensor such as, but not limited to, sensor <b>76</b>, without adjustment according to the present invention, is shown. Prior to the installation, wheel hub assembly <b>12</b> is installed on axle housing end <b>34</b> in the normal manner, such that retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A is in position on shoulder <b>68</b> and kingpin <b>40</b> is mounted on wheel hub assembly <b>12</b>, all as explained above. As a first step, as denoted by block <b>126</b>, pin <b>86</b> is installed on retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A, in connection with axle housing end <b>34</b>, by insertion into and through passage <b>44</b> of kingpin <b>40</b>, through hole <b>94</b> of retainer <b>66</b> or <b>66</b>A, and threaded engagement with nut <b>92</b>. As denoted at block <b>128</b>, coupler <b>110</b> is placed on upper end <b>88</b> of pin <b>86</b> and aligned with a reference, such as, but not limited to, mounting flange <b>22</b> of hub assembly <b>12</b>, by aligning a flat surface portion of outer surface <b>120</b> with flange <b>22</b>. Coupler <b>110</b> is then secured in the aligned position on end <b>88</b> with screw <b>116</b>, as denoted by block <b>1</b>. Sensor <b>76</b>, with element <b>78</b> in predetermined position in body <b>80</b>, can then be installed on surface <b>52</b> of kingpin <b>40</b> with screws <b>82</b>, as denoted by block <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here, it should be noted that the apparatus and method of the invention are adapted for use in a wide variety of other applications in addition to that set forth above. For instance, the apparatus and method of the invention are adapted for use in installing a sensor such as sensor <b>76</b> on a lower kingpin of the construction set forth herein in the same manner as set forth above. The apparatus and method of the invention are also adapted for constructions wherein the kingpin is fixedly mountable on the axle end and the wheel hub is rotatable relative thereto, such that pin <b>86</b>, coupler <b>110</b> and element <b>78</b> will rotate relative to body <b>80</b> of the sensor.</p>
