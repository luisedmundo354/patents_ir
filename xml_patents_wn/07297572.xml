<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This specification describes techniques for manufacturing an electronic system module. The module includes flexible multi-layer interconnection circuits with trace widths as narrow as 5 microns or less. A glass panel manufacturing facility, similar to those employed for making liquid crystal display, LCD, panels is preferably used to fabricate the interconnection circuits. A multi-layer interconnection circuit is fabricated on the glass panel using a release layer. A special assembly layer is formed over the interconnection circuit comprising a thick dielectric layer with openings formed at input/output (I/O) pad locations. Solder paste is deposited in the openings using a squeegee to form wells filled with solder. IC chips are provided with gold stud bumps at I/O pad locations, and these bumps are inserted in the wells to form flip chip connections. The IC chips are tested and reworked. The same bump/well connections can be used to attach fine-pitch cables. Module packaging layers are provided for hermetic sealing and for electromagnetic shielding. A blade server or supercomputer embodiment is also described.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to connections between components, and more particularly to connection arrays where each connection in the array includes a bump inserted into a well containing bonding material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The number of input/output (I/O) connections required by integrated circuit (IC) chips is increasing, to several hundred for recent microprocessor chips. As verification of complex designs becomes an increasing portion of the total design activity, it is desirable to increase the I/O count further, to provide access to more internal nodes for testing. Flip chip assembly methods have helped to provide more I/O connections because they provide an area array of connections across the entire face of an IC chip, rather than just at the perimeter as with wire bonding. However, even with flip chip assembly it continues to be desirable to reduce the pad pitch, the distance between bonding pad centers, in order to achieve more I/O connections per unit area of IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A recent advance in flip chip assembly capability has been the introduction of stud bumping machines that can provide gold stud bumps on IC chips with pad pitches of less than 100 microns. However, to take advantage of this capability, the system board or package that receives the bumped devices must have fine traces in order to route all of the signals in the space available with not too many layers, plus it must support bonding pad pitches less than 100 microns. The most recent packaging technology to be commercially introduced is called land grid array, LGA. It builds up the wiring layers by plating a base layer of copper that has been patterned with photo resist. The external terminal pitch claimed for this packaging method is “less than 0.5 mm”. This is not sufficient for direct bonding of IC chips; in fact none of the available printed circuit board technologies can support direct mounting of bumped devices at a pitch of 100 microns or less. The current invention is capable of pad pitches of less than 100 microns without using any redistribution wiring layers; it also includes a viable method for reworking defective IC chips at this bonding density.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Indium-based solders have been developed that form reliable bonds with gold structures such as stud bumps. An example is Indalloy 290 available from Indium Corporation of America, Utica, N.Y. This alloy contains 97% indium and 3% silver and melts at 143° C. Since the solubility of gold in this solder is very low, brittle inter-metallic compounds are not a significant problem, and the integrity of a gold stud bump can be maintained through multiple rework cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For many years the minimum trace width available from printed circuit board vendors has been around 100 microns using glass epoxy laminates. Recently, Unitive, Inc. of Research Triangle Park, N.C., USA, has produced interconnection circuits using a spin-on dielectric called BCB (benzocyclobutene) having a copper trace width of 12 microns and a space between traces of 13 microns. The current invention preferably uses aluminum conductors and BCB dielectric and is capable of achieving trace widths of 5 microns or less, together with a trace pitch of 10 microns or less. These fine aluminum traces are well suited for low power and low frequency applications. Higher current applications may use thicker and wider traces, and may substitute copper for aluminum. High frequency applications can employ the methods described herein if additional effort is applied to form traces with controlled impedance; for example, if differential pairs and ground reference planes are employed the frequency range may be extended to the order of 1 GHz, depending on trace lengths and other specifics of the application.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One way to achieve fine line interconnection circuits is to employ a semiconductor fabrication facility and to build the interconnection circuit on a silicon wafer; hence the term, wafer level packaging, WLP. The precision of the associated photolithographic methods, the clean room environment with low particulate count, and the advanced substrate handling equipment of such a facility can all contribute to high-density interconnection circuits. However, the application of IC chip manufacturing facilities to this problem is more than what is required. An intermediate alternative is to apply the manufacturing resources of a glass panel fabrication facility, where the minimum feature sizes are 10 to 20 times larger than for IC chips (but still adequate for the most advanced assembly processes), and the manufacturing cost per unit area is less than 5% of the cost per unit area of IC chips. In addition, the glass panel fabrication facility can produce system boards of any size up to around two meters on a side for the latest panel fabrication facilities, whereas the largest wafers produced have a diameter of 300 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to avoid the rigidity and weight of the glass substrate, and to provide better thermal access to the heat producing components for cooling them, it is usually preferable to discard the glass carrier after most of the processing is done.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Typically, the fine trace capability of WLP has been used to create redistribution circuits that map from the fine pitch available with flip chip bonding to the coarser pitch of a printed circuit board. The current invention eliminates the redistribution circuits because the printed circuits produced (termed interconnection circuits) include fine features that easily accommodate the fine pitch of the flip chip bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Power supply voltages and signal voltage swings are reducing with each new generation of IC chip technology. To achieve the necessary noise margins during testing it is generally necessary to connect test points to test circuits using short leads. This is typically achieved by employing a test head that is located close to the test points. The test head provides a set of pin electronics for each signal tested; the pin electronics typically include high-speed sampling circuits and comparator circuits, along with matrix switches and relays to map test points to test pins. Providing test chips on the motherboard (system board) is another way to achieve high speed functional testing. The test chip or chips can be placed close to system buses for sampling signal activity at high speed, and this test method is recommended for electronic modules of the current invention. Said test chips incorporate high speed sampling circuits and comparators; they work in concert with a test support computer that is cabled to the system and communicates with the test chips and the system at relatively low data rates. More accurate and complete testing of components is provided when they are tested in their real system environment rather than being tested as individual components using test vectors that represent a simulation of the system environment. The system environment is preferably created with the actual system running a test version of the system's application code, programmed in the language of the application rather than a special test language. This way, the system architects can also be the test architects. This can lead to improvements in test development time, test effectiveness and cost, compared with the conventional approach that includes a test program in a specialized test language, simulated test vectors, and a general-purpose tester. This test method provides focus on the system level requirements, as opposed to component level requirements. If the system level requirements are satisfactorily met, then the minutiae of component level characteristics become irrelevant. Alternatively stated, only the functions relevant to proper system function are tested; this is a much more manageable set of requirements than the total set of functions that all the assembled components are capable of performing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">If necessary, multiple IC chips may be employed to test the entire range of digital, analog, and RF functions of a particular product. Adding these chips to the system using the current invention is not as expensive as in the past because the test chips will be manufactured in volume and will have low unit costs, and the packaging and assembly cost will be minimal, as will be further discussed. In summary, a mini-tester may be included with every module produced, but the cost of this tester may be well justified by the system level assembly and performance benefits, and the reduction in system development time.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Module verification can be performed at an elevated temperature by heating the glass carrier underneath the module (circuit assembly or assembled system board). By providing a pre-determined test temperature to the entire circuit assembly, a speed grade can be associated with the module, as has been done in the past at the component level. Greater emphasis can be placed on environmental stress testing at the module level. Accelerated life testing can also be performed early in the life cycle of a product, and lessons learned about particular components can be incorporated into the module level test.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">R. K. Traeger, “Hermeticity of Polymeric Lid Sealants”, Proc. 25<sup>th </sup>Electronics Components Conf., 1976, p.361, has documented the water permeabilities of silicones, epoxies, fluorocarbons, glasses and metals. Traeger's data shows that, in terms of providing a barrier to water, a layer of metal that is 1 micron thick is approximately equivalent to a layer of glass that is 1 mm thick, and also equivalent to a layer of epoxy that is 100 cm thick. Hermetic packaging techniques and electromagnetic shielding techniques can be applied at the module level to improve both performance and manufacturing cost. The current invention describes a method for fabricating a metal envelope that encloses almost the entire module, substantially attenuating the interference from individual components and the wiring between them. Cost can be reduced because hermeticity and shielding are provided with a simple process applied once to the entire system, rather than being addressed individually at each of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Such a complete module or system fabrication process can be achieved if a panel fabrication facility is applied to the complete set of module manufacturing steps, including high-density cables and connectors and back-end processing for hermeticity and shielding. Sub-processes for the following structural elements are included: multi-layer interconnection circuits; a special assembly layer that may be required for direct attachment of IC chips (wells filled with solder at each I/O pad); module access ports (arrays of test points and system interconnects having wells filled with solder at each I/O pad); module access cables or test fixtures for connecting between the module access ports and external systems; and the back end module layers that provide both hermeticity and electromagnetic shielding.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Usually structures for direct chip attach require an epoxy under-layer between direct mounted IC chips (flip chips) and the package or circuit board. The purpose of the under-layer is to provide mechanical strength to withstand repeated thermal cycling without developing cracks in the area of the flip chip bonds. The thermal stress typically arises because of differences in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) between the IC chip material and the board material. Gelatinized solvents have been used to dissolve the epoxy during rework of defective chips; they typically leave a residue that must be cleaned off. The process of cleaning off the epoxy and the residue has often resulted in damage to the fine pitch bonding leads, to the point where they cannot be reliably re-bonded. This under-layer is unnecessary with the current invention because mechanical strength is provided at each bond by the physical structure of a stud bump mated with a well filled with solder. Also the final interconnection circuit is flexible so that thermally induced stresses are substantially eliminated in the region of the flip chip bonds. Without the thermally induced stress, no cracking will occur. Thermal stresses are still present during assembly (because the carrier/interconnection circuit is rigid at this point), but are avoided during operation in the field (when the carrier is removed and the interconnection circuit is flexible). The number and extent of thermal cycles endured during assembly are more predictable and controllable than thermal cycles arising from operation in the field. Stress testing in the laboratory can be used to quantify the acceptable temperature limits, and assure crack-free circuit assemblies. However, using the proposed flip chip assembly method, it may be necessary to limit the maximum size of IC chips assembled, to limit the maximum strain induced by thermal mismatch during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Replacement of defective chips (rework) is much easier if there is no epoxy under layer to be removed. Also, in the preferred embodiment there are no delicate traces to be damaged during rework because each I/O pad is provided with a well filled with solder, as will be further described. Attaching IC chips onto flexible substrates is referred to in the art as “compliant packaging”.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A glass substrate for 5<sup>th </sup>generation fabrication of LCD circuits is typically 1100 by 1250 mm in area, and 0.7 mm or 1.1 mm thick, which can be used in carrying out the present invention. However, the glass carrier of the current invention can be of any size. The unit manufacturing costs of interconnection circuits and related circuit structures of the current invention are lower if larger glass panels are used. The glass or other rigid carrier provides mechanical support for all of the fabrication, component assembly, cable assembly, test, and rework process steps, and also has excellent dimensional stability. This dimensional stability transfers to the multi-layer interconnection circuits that are built up as a series of films on top of the glass. This transferred dimensional stability is a primary reason that fine line features such as trace width and space of 5 microns are possible with the current invention. It is also important however, that the final version of the interconnection circuit be flexible, because this flexibility allows the use of an epoxy under layer to be avoided, leading to more robust rework processes for removing and replacing defective chips. The flexibility also allows system boards to be folded in compact devices such as cellular phones. Folding requires that the chips be arranged in rows, and the clear area between rows becomes a potential folding line.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A release agent is applied to a glass panel substrate, except for a clear region near the edges. The clear region is characterized by high adhesion between the glass and the polymer base layer to be subsequently formed on the glass. The high adhesion region provides an anchor that firmly attaches the polymer to the glass around the perimeter of the panel. The release layer creates low adhesion between glass and polymer, so that after a circuit assembly has been built on top, it can be readily peeled off.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternate layers of metal interconnect and dielectric such as a photo-definable polymer are built up on the base layer. Two-level contacts are formed between adjacent metal layers, and stacked contacts are provided between groups of adjacent layers. Preferably each input/output (I/O) pad of an assembled IC chip is a tested node of the multi-layer interconnection circuit. At the center of each I/O pad a stacked contact is preferably created, with stubs at every metal layer, for convenient routing of traces. The base polymer layer, the dielectric layers and the metal layers are flexible, and when the multi-layer interconnection circuit is subsequently removed from the glass panel, it too is flexible. Attached IC chips are usually not flexible (unless thinned down by lapping), but if a folding line on the interconnection circuit is kept clear of IC chips, then the circuit assembly can be folded at the folding line.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">While the multi-layer interconnection circuit is still attached to the glass carrier and before it is divided (singulated) into individual circuits, it may be convenient to form a special flip chip assembly layer that includes wells filled with solder at each I/O pad. Each well is designed to accept a stud bump of an attached component. Preferably, gold stud bumps are formed at I/O pads of all IC chips to be assembled. One method of creating the wells employs a thick layer of polymer that is applied on top of the interconnection circuit. Openings in this layer (wells) are formed at each I/O pad (bonding site). The cured polymer layer forms a mask with openings. A squeegee is used to wipe solder paste over the mask to fill the openings, thus forming a well filled with solder at each of the I/O pads. An alternative method for creating the wells is to take advantage of the surface depressions that are associated with stacked contacts, to provide a stacked contact at each I/O pad, and to fill the wells so formed with solder paste using a squeegee.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The glass carrier may be diced with a diamond saw to separate individual circuit assemblies from one another, providing a more convenient form for component assembly, cable assembly, test, and rework. The interconnection circuit must itself be tested, before any assembly is done. This test is preferably performed using a test fixture that connects through a module access port to an external tester. The module access port may include I/O pads (module access pads) for every node of the multi-layer interconnection circuit. The assembly and rework steps require that IC chips and other surface mounted components are precisely located in order that the flip chip placement tool can accurately align bonding sites on the components with corresponding bonding sites on the interconnection circuit. Accordingly, the circuit assembly remains attached to the glass carrier, and its dimensional accuracy is maintained until these steps are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A module cable with high-density interconnections is preferably attached to each circuit assembly while the attached carrier provides dimensional stability. Each circuit assembly is then separated from its glass carrier by peeling the base substrate away from the carrier. A low adhesion force is provided in these regions so that separation can be accomplished without damaging the interconnection circuits or the attached components.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The methods for fabricating interconnections and bumps and wells can be applied to cables as well as to circuit boards, as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Module level coatings including dielectric and conductive layers are applied to the tested circuit assembly to create a circuit module that is hermetically sealed and electro-magnetically shielded. To effectively cool the dense circuit module, it may be bonded to a heat sink, and the heat sink may be cooled with a circulating fluid.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a corner fragment of a glass carrier <b>1</b>. Photo resist has been patterned on the carrier, so that a border of resist, <b>2</b>, having a width of approximately 20 mm, surrounds the perimeter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows that a film of release layer, <b>3</b>, has been applied over the entire surface of the glass carrier. A suitable material for the release layer is a fluorinated silicone such as F065 manufactured by Gelest, Inc., in Morrisville, Pa., USA. This material is a single part gel. It can be applied as a fog or fine spray, or using the spin-on method. A suitable thickness is 2-5 microns after curing, with 2 microns preferred. A typical curing cycle is 125° C. for 25 minutes. This release material has a silane component that bonds well to glass surfaces, yet presents a fluid-like interface to polymeric materials like the base layer to be subsequently applied. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows the result of lifting the resist to pattern the release layer, using a developer or resist stripper to swell the resist; border <b>4</b> is clear of release material. A base layer <b>5</b> is then applied. Base layer <b>5</b> is preferably a polymer, and is applied in liquid form with a metering roll, an extrusion coater, or using a spin-on or spraying method. A suitable polymer is Cyclotene, a polyimide manufactured by Dow Chemical, also known as BCB (benzocyclobutene). No adhesion promoters are used. After curing, a suitable thickness of base layer <b>5</b> is 40-80 microns, with 50 microns preferred. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is a cross-sectional view of section DD of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, and shows the relation between glass carrier <b>1</b>, release layer <b>3</b>, and base layer, <b>5</b>. Surface region <b>6</b> is characterized by high adhesion between the base layer and the carrier, and surface region <b>7</b> is characterized by low adhesion between the base layer and the release layer. Base layer <b>5</b> may later be peeled off of surface region <b>7</b> without damage to the base layer or to circuits built thereon. An alternative method for providing the base layer to serve as the substrate for the interconnection circuits is to laminate a preformed sheet of polymeric material onto the glass carrier, providing a combination of adhesives to effect strong adhesion in surface region <b>6</b> for anchoring the edges of the sheet, and weak adhesion in surface region <b>7</b> for facilitating later release.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a glass carrier <b>1</b> with a width, W, of 1250 mm, typical of 5<sup>th </sup>generation LCD panels. A recent facility has been announced that will handle substrates 1870 mm×2200 mm. Although any size glass carrier can be used to carry out the present invention, larger sizes result in lower costs for the associated interconnection circuits, including special flip chip assembly layers that may be required. Materials other than glass can be used for the carrier, providing they are rigid and dimensionally stable. Glass is preferred in the current invention because it is well characterized as a substrate material, and it is used with mature panel manufacturing methods such as for LCD fabrication. Individual multi-layer interconnection circuits <b>20</b> are arrayed across the glass carrier. In this example, interconnection circuits <b>20</b> measure 4 inches by 2 inches, and 220 copies are arrayed on the carrier. Multi-layer interconnection circuits <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> have different sizes representing other circuits to be manufactured. Border region <b>23</b> corresponds to surface region <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and is a region of high adhesion between base layer <b>5</b> and glass carrier <b>1</b>. When glass carrier <b>1</b> is diced into interconnection circuits <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>22</b>, it can be seen that the resulting circuits include only regions of low adhesion, for easily peeling away the individual glass carriers of interconnection circuits <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>22</b>. An alternative version of the layout represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes streets of high adhesion provided between each of the interconnection circuits, included for improved dimensional stability of the individual circuits such as <b>20</b>, and these streets are removed during the dicing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> represents the preferred method for forming thin film layers of multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b> on base layer <b>5</b>. The preferred method and materials contained herein are better suited to low power electronic modules such as cell phones than high performance circuits that may require copper conductors at greater trace thickness. The aluminum conductors may be arranged as transmission lines for high frequency operation, requiring controlled horizontal spacing between traces as well as controlled vertical spacing between traces and reference planes (not shown), as is known in the art. The metal layers of multi-layer circuit <b>20</b> are preferably aluminum, deposited by sputtering in a vacuum chamber. A suitable thickness range is 1-2 microns, with 1 micron preferred. The metal layers are masked using conventional photolithographic methods known in the art, and are preferably dry etched using plasma etching processes, also known in the art. The patterning of each layer typically includes coating with photo resist, exposing with light through a mask or reticule, developing the resist to form openings where the material is to be removed, and etching of the layer through the openings in the resist. Alternative metals may be used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> a patterned trace of metal <b>31</b> is shown on base layer <b>5</b>. For example, this trace has a width of 5 microns and a thickness of 1 micron. In between each layer of patterned metal is a layer of patterned dielectric, to provide isolation in the vertical direction between the metal traces. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the substrate and metal traces have been coated with a planarizing layer <b>32</b> of a photo-definable polymer as the inter-layer dielectric. A suitable photo-definable polymer is photo BCB, benzocyclobutene, a photosensitive form of Cyclotene. The term “photo-polymer” shall be used hereinafter for this material. The photo-polymer is applied in liquid form to planarize the surface. A suitable thickness of photo-polymer layer <b>32</b> is 2-4 microns after curing, with 2 microns preferred. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> a masked region of photo-polymer is exposed to light where the material is to remain. The effect of light on the photo-polymer is to form cross-linked molecules that become solidified (polymerized) and are not dissolved in the subsequent development step. Polymer material that is not exposed to light does not develop cross-links and is removed by the development step. This is the same mechanism that occurs when patterning a negative photo-resist, and is referred to as negative image development. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows the result of developing the polymer. The masked illumination of the exposure process causes photons to penetrate the surface of the polymer. The photons spread laterally as they penetrate to lower depths, causing cross-linking as they spread. The net result is a patterned polymer layer having tapered contact windows with an angle, θ, of approximately 45°, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Typically, contact windows have a curved profile that is approximated by the straight line shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows the result of depositing and patterning the next layer of metal, <b>34</b>, to form the two-layer contact, <b>33</b> between traces <b>31</b> and <b>34</b>. Because the contact window is tapered rather than vertical, and because sputtering from a large area target provides multiple deposition angles, good metal coverage is achieved at the contact walls. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> shows the addition of the next photo-polymer layer <b>35</b>, and patterning of the next metal layer as metal trace <b>36</b>. The foregoing description teaches the formation of multi-layer interconnection circuits, with alternating patterned metal and patterned polymer layers, by repeating the foregoing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an example multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b> of the present invention, introduced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Base polymer layer <b>5</b> is shown. Conductive trace <b>41</b> of first layer metal is shown, with width, w, of 5 microns or less, spacing, s, of 5 microns or less, and thickness, t, of approximately one micron in the preferred embodiment. It may be desirable to arrange conductors on alternate layers to be generally orthogonal as in the figure, as is common practice for layout efficiency. A planarizing layer of photo-polymer, <b>42</b>, has been applied over the first layer metal pattern with a preferred thickness of two microns after curing. A trace of second layer metal, <b>43</b>, forms a two-level contact with a trace <b>44</b> of first layer metal. The next photo-polymer layer <b>45</b> again has a preferred thickness of 2 microns, and covers second layer metal <b>43</b> with a thickness of 1 micron. Photo-polymer layer <b>45</b> provides a planar surface for deposition and patterning of a third layer metal such as trace <b>46</b>. Trace <b>47</b> is fourth layer metal and connects using a two-level contact to a trace <b>48</b> of third layer metal as shown. Additional layers are built up in the same manner, as required, and in principle any number of metal layers can be provided. In the figure, trace <b>49</b> is on the eighth metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows an expanded cross-sectional view of a stacked contact <b>50</b> at an input/output (I/O) pad. Metal traces on alternate layers are preferably orthogonal as shown. A trace <b>51</b> of first layer metal is shown with a suitable trace width of 8-12 microns in this contact structure, with 10 microns preferred. Planarizing layers of photo-polymer such as <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> are used between each metal layer, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Trace <b>54</b> of second layer metal contacts trace <b>51</b> as shown. A contact stack of all metal layers is built up layer by layer, with stubs provided for connecting metal traces at any level. Stubs are short metal traces that are provided to establish points of access at each metal layer. Most of them will never connect to anything else. However, some of them will be extended into circuit traces of the interconnection circuit. Trace stubs <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>57</b>, are on metal layers <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b>, respectively. Similarly, at 90 degrees rotation from these stubs, the odd numbered metal layers also have similar stubs (not shown). Finally I/O pad <b>58</b> connects with the contact stack as shown. It may be convenient to build a stacked contact like <b>50</b> at all of the I/O pads. The width of I/O pad metal is approximately 85 microns in the preferred embodiment, providing ample space for such a stacked contact. It is convenient for the circuit board layout designer to know that every node in the circuit is available at all metal layers (using the stubs), and at a known location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a reduced plan view of the stacked contact of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, excluding I/O pad <b>58</b> to reveal the locations of the stubs. The location of stubs on even-numbered metal layers is shown <b>59</b>, and odd-numbered metal layers <b>60</b>. The common area <b>61</b> of the stacked contact is also shown.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Stacked contact <b>50</b> is necessarily larger in horizontal area than two-level contact <b>33</b>, because of the long sloping contact walls. The trace pitch for parallel runs of metal is a critical parameter for densely packed interconnection circuits. Parallel runs of metal generally require contacts to traces on other layers for effective trace routing of a multi-layer interconnection circuit. To achieve minimum trace pitch for such parallel runs, it is desirable to use contacts of minimum size. This can be accomplished if contacts that are formed at locations other than at the I/O pads are limited to two-level contacts. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Horizontal traces such as <b>64</b> are on an even-numbered metal layer. Vertical traces such as <b>65</b> are on an adjacent odd-numbered metal layer. Contact windows <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> are for two-level contacts; they are closely spaced but staggered, and have a minimum contact area. The trace pitch p is consistent at 10 microns or less in both directions, and not increased for traces with contacts. This enables dense wiring patterns with predictable space requirements for trace routing programs. The close trace spacing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is suitable for low speed signals. Higher speed signals may require wider spacing to avoid cross-talk issues.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Having explained the details of building a high density interconnect structure in the form of a flexible multi-layer interconnection circuit, we shall now focus on assembly and testing of IC chips on the interconnection circuit, to form a circuit assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows circuit assembly <b>80</b> with multiple IC chips such as <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>, and other surface-mounted components such as <b>84</b> on multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b>.Components <b>81</b>-<b>83</b> are preferably attached by the flip chip assembly method, including stud bumps and wells filled with solder as described herein. Alternatively, surface-mount components may be attached using known solder re-flow techniques. Module access port <b>84</b> provides an array of module access pads (I/O pads) for connection to external signals and power, as well as for connection to internal nodes of the interconnection circuit for testing purposes, as will be further described. IC chip <b>85</b> is a special-purpose test chip in the preferred embodiment. For testing different circuit types, such as digital, analog, and radio frequency (RF), it may be desirable to assemble more than one special-purpose test chip. Alternatively, all forms of testing may be accomplished using external testers, accessed through module access port <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> represents a cross-sectional view of section XX of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Circuit assembly <b>80</b> is supported on release layer <b>3</b> on top of glass carrier <b>1</b>. It includes interconnection circuit <b>20</b> plus attached components. IC chip <b>81</b> is attached using flip chip connections such as <b>86</b>, which will be further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> shows a sequence of steps describing a first method of the current invention for creating a flip chip bond (direct chip attachment). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows that an IC chip <b>71</b> has been prepared for assembly by forming gold stud bumps such as <b>91</b> at I/O bonding pads such as <b>92</b>. Stud bumps <b>91</b> can be created using a Kulicke and Soffa 8098 bonder, using the application of heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy, as is known in the art. The process for forming the ball portion of the stud bump is the same as for a ball bonder (conventional wire bonder). If an 18-micron diameter gold wire is used, the bonder can be configured to make stud bumps such as <b>91</b> with a ball diameter of 50 microns and an overall height of 50 microns. The “beard” <b>93</b> is created by accurately shearing the gold wire, and according to Kulicke and Soffa, the tips of the beards can be coplanar within ±2.5 microns across a 200 mm field. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows I/O pads <b>58</b> as shaped for stacked contacts, as previously described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Interconnection circuit <b>20</b> is attached to glass carrier <b>1</b> via release layer <b>3</b>, and glass carrier <b>1</b> is providing the necessary dimensional stability during assembly. The depression at a stacked contact may be used as a well for assembly purposes. A metallization <b>95</b> is patterned over each I/O pad <b>58</b> as shown, to prevent diffusion of solder materials or dissolved gold into multi-layer circuit <b>20</b>, to provide an oxidation barrier, and also to provide a solder-wetting surface. An acceptable sequence of layers for metallization <b>95</b> is an adhesion layer of aluminum, a solder diffusion layer of nickel, and an oxide prevention layer plus solder wettable layer of copper. This sequence is known in the art as under bump metallization, UBM. Multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b> is further prepared for IC chip assembly by filling the wells with solder paste, thus creating a well filled with solder <b>94</b> at each I/O bonding pad <b>58</b>. Solder paste <b>96</b> is applied using the wiping action of a squeegee over the exposed surface. In the preferred embodiment, using a large glass panel as the carrier, several million wells are typically created with one pass of the squeegee. Solder paste <b>96</b> is laterally confined by the wells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> shows a completed flip chip bond <b>86</b> of the current invention, with stud bump <b>91</b> inserted into well <b>94</b>. Since the height variation of the stud bumps is held to approximately ±2.5 microns, and since the beard is a ridge of small cross-section, and since gold is a soft and malleable material, a small amount of pressure applied to an IC chip will result in the tips of the beards conforming to and making uniform contact with the bottoms of the wells. The depth of well <b>94</b> and the softness of the solder paste provide a vertical compliance during flip chip assembly, thus avoiding broken chips. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> solder paste <b>96</b> has been melted and cooled to form solder <b>97</b>, thus creating a permanent electrical and mechanical bond. Solder <b>97</b> forms a strong mechanical bond with the beard and the underside of the stud bump, as well as a low resistance contact. Since the stacked contacts are patterned photo lithographically they are accurately placed within a few microns and their size and shape are repeatable, leading to high yield assemblies. The pitch, P, is 95 microns in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, and is preferably in the range of 60-200 microns. Solder paste <b>96</b> is preferably an indium-based material such as Indalloy 290 comprising 97% In and 3% Ag, with a melting point of 143° C. This material is designed to solder gold electrodes with minimal dissolution of the gold, and without forming undesirable inter-metallic compounds that could impair the mechanical integrity of flip chip bond <b>86</b> or degrade the ability to perform rework. It also solidifies in a semi-rigid form, providing some additional mechanical compliance compared with Pb:Sn solders. Additionally, it does not contain Pb which is an environmental contaminant. The melting point of 143° C. is lower than that of all common production solders. This is good for rework:less heating is required to melt the solder and a smaller overall temperature excursion results in less thermal stress during each rework cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The sequence of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> represents a cost-effective method of creating the wells filled with solder <b>94</b>, because the well shapes are already provided by the stacked contacts at each I/O pad. Thus a separate process is not required to fabricate the wells. However, some manufacturers may prefer not to use stacked contacts, and some interconnection circuits may not include enough layers to create sufficiently deep wells. For these cases a second method is proposed for fabricating the wells, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> interconnection circuit <b>20</b> is shown, including flat I/O pads <b>100</b>, coated with metallization <b>95</b> as previously described. Again, glass carrier <b>1</b> is present for dimensional stability. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> a planarizing layer <b>101</b> of non-photo-definable polymer such as BCB is formed on top of interconnection circuit <b>20</b>, at a thickness of approximately 15 microns when cured. Polymer layer <b>101</b> is masked and etched using known dry etching techniques to create openings (wells) <b>102</b> above the pads. The diameter of the wells is approximately 34 microns in the preferred embodiment. The openings preferably have vertical walls as shown, providing maximum resistance to shear forces in the final assembly (with chips attached). Vertical walls are not generally producible using photo-defined polymers such as photo BCB, and this is why dry etching is used, preferably with an anisotropic etching characteristic as is known in the art. Polymer layer <b>101</b> forms the solder paste mask and is typically not removed, i.e., it remains a part of the finished circuit assembly. This special assembly layer is numbered <b>102</b>. Solder paste <b>96</b> is wiped over the exposed surface using a squeegee and is laterally confined by openings <b>103</b>. By this means, a second preferred embodiment of wells filled with solder <b>104</b> is created as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, and a second embodiment of bonded connection <b>105</b> including a gold stud bump <b>91</b> mated with a well filled with solder, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>. A strong mechanical bond is formed between gold stud bump <b>91</b> and I/O pad <b>100</b> because solder <b>97</b> adheres strongly to stud bump <b>91</b> and to metallization <b>95</b> (which in turn is strongly bonded to I/O pad <b>100</b>), and solder <b>97</b> is well contained and structurally supported by openings <b>103</b>. There are no fragile leads exposed to the assembly process, because fragile signal traces (not shown) are terminated in I/O pads <b>100</b> such that the traces are a short distance away from flip chip attachment <b>105</b>; this means that a direct attached component can be reworked (replaced) without danger of damaging the signal traces. I/O pad pitch, P, is shown at 95 microns, enabled by the photolithographic precision employed for patterning the various layers, plus the small lateral dimension of gold stud bumps (approximately 50 microns for the stud bumps shown), and the dimensional stability of the underlying carrier. A range of I/O pad pitch from 60-200 microns is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is a primary goal of the current invention to provide flip chip assemblies that can be reworked when a defective chip needs replacement. The process should be simple and effective, and robust enough to perform as many times as may be necessary. Consequently, it is important to choose a solder composition that does not significantly dissolve the stud bump material, does not form brittle intermetallic compounds, and for which the melting point is not significantly increased during assembly or rework cycles. Gold is the preferred material for the stud bumps. As previously described, an example of a solder material that is compatible with gold stud bumps and the flip chip bonding methods proposed herein is indium-based solder Indalloy #290, obtainable from Indium Corporation of America, Utica, N.Y. The amount of paste in a well is approximately 1.5×10<sup>−8 </sup>gm in the second preferred embodiment, at a material cost of approximately US$3.48 per gram. For either method of fabricating the wells, the cost of filling the wells is low when large glass carriers are used because typically several million wells are filled in parallel. Preferably, a squeegee is used to wipe solder paste over the mask (or over the I/O pad indentations provided at stacked contacts in the first embodiment) to deposit the paste in the wells. The cost per stud bump using a Kulicke and Soffa 8098 bonder is approximately 0.03 cents, based on data provided by Kulicke and Soffa for 200,000 bumps on an 8-inch wafer. Consequently, the cost of each flip chip connection in the current invention, including the stud bump and the corresponding well, is estimated at less than 0.05 cents or US$0.0005. This compares with current costs per connection of approximately 0.3 cents for wire bonds in a comparably similar circuit assembly, and typically higher costs for other flip chip attachment methods. Such a low cost for the current invention may mean that additional test points can be included within a satisfactory overall test cost.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The rework process for replacing a defective IC chip on a circuit assembly of the current invention is as follows. Heat is applied using a hotplate under glass carrier <b>1</b>, typically bringing the carrier to a temperature below the solder melting point. For the preferred solder, Indalloy 290, this temperature may be approximately 118° C. Hot inert gas is applied to the backside of the chip; the gas is directed and confined so as to melt the solder of a single component, avoiding neighboring components. When the solder melts at around 143° C., the defective component is removed by withdrawing the stud bumps from the wells. The surface around the affected wells is inspected. Touchup may include cleaning of the surface area around the wells and addition of more solder paste into the wells; the board is then ready for a replacement component.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The bump/well connection method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can be applied to fabricating a connection between any pair of electronic components. It only requires that bumps be formed on one part (the male part) and corresponding wells be formed on the other part (the female part). Accordingly, IC chips and other components may be provided with either wells or bumps, as long as the matching structure is fabricated on the mating part.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> represents an example of a module access port <b>84</b> with individual module access pads such as <b>110</b> arrayed as shown. The module access pads provide a means for electrical connection from interconnection circuit <b>20</b> or from circuit assembly <b>80</b> to other electronic assemblies or devices, and include provision for data signals, control signals, and power. As will become apparent, the bump/well bonding structures described for these pads are similar or identical to those described for the pads of IC chips.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An external tester that is connected to assembly <b>80</b> through module access port <b>84</b> may be used to validate the integrity of the interconnection circuits prior to assembling IC chips and other components. It may be advantageous to provide a module access pad for every node on the interconnection circuit, to provide 100% test coverage. If a module cable of the current invention is used, as further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, module access pads <b>110</b> can have a pitch of less than 100 microns, just like flip chip bonds <b>86</b> and <b>105</b>. If an interconnection circuit has 50,000 nodes corresponding to a medium-complexity system board, then the area occupied by the module access port is only 5 square centimeters at a bonding pitch of 100 microns (2.24 cm on a side). Testing for short circuits is typically provided between all of the nodes, and testing for open circuits may also be performed on critical nets (distributed nodes). This is similar in concept to a “bed-of-nails” test that is typically performed on conventional printed circuit boards. In some cases, repair of defective interconnection circuits may be appropriate, perhaps using focused ion beams, FIB, for cutting traces, or other types of beams for building new ones.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It may be advantageous to apply the bump/well assembly method to the problem of aligning a pair of components. In this case, stud bumps are provided on a face of one of the components, and a matching set of wells is provided on a face of the other component. A two-step alignment procedure is preferred for precise alignment. In the first step, alignment within a few microns is achieved by the inherent precision of locating the stud bumps in the wells. In the second step, the alignment may be fine-tuned to within a fraction of a micron displacement error and small angular errors by monitoring an alignment-sensitive parameter of the combined pair, and optimizing the alignment using this parameter while the solder is molten. This procedure could be used to align optical assemblies for example, and signal to noise ratio of a light beam traversing the combined assembly may be a suitable parameter to monitor while optimizing the alignment. The bumps and wells could be located sufficiently far from the light path so as not to interfere. It may also be desirable to form the wells in a hard material, for greater rigidity and precision.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A circuit assembly such as <b>80</b> will typically require several different working voltages for operation. Preferably, power at the highest working voltage will be delivered through module access port <b>84</b> (preferably using multiple pins, in a distributed fashion), and local converters and regulators that are implemented on one or more IC chips will provide other working voltages as required. The converters and regulators may be programmable in order to adjust the working voltages for testing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The layout of circuit assembly <b>80</b> is so dense, both in the fine line traces and in the fine pitch assembly, that conventional connectors and cables are not well suited for interconnecting modules of this type; they would occupy a large fraction of the total module space. Consequently, part of the current invention is to provide an effective means for connecting circuit assemblies to testers, and circuit modules to other circuit modules or to other electronic systems employing different manufacturing methods. It is proposed that the same methods used to fabricate circuit assembly <b>80</b> can also be used to fabricate test fixtures and module cables.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, a test fixture <b>111</b> is shown connecting to module access port <b>84</b> of circuit assembly <b>80</b>. A redistribution of the module access pads <b>112</b> is provided on glass substrate <b>113</b>, so as to connect conveniently to an external device using a low cost cable <b>114</b> having relatively large features. For small arrays of module access pads, a single layer of aluminum may be patterned on glass substrate <b>113</b>, with a one-to-one connection between module access pads in the module access port, and corresponding pads in the redistributed array. This can be accomplished (with no signal crossovers) if redistributed array <b>112</b> is a scaled mirror image of the module access pad array. For larger arrays, a multi-level interconnection circuit may be required. As previously described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for forming stud bumps on IC chips, so stud bumps may be formed at I/O pads on test fixture <b>111</b>. They may be provided at a pad pitch of 100 microns or less at the small end containing the module access port, to mate with wells filled with solder at each of the module access pads. A conventional flexible circuit may be employed to connect an external device (such as a tester) to pads in redistributed array <b>112</b>. Such a flex circuit may have copper conductors, and may include bumps that connect by contact pressure with pads of redistributed array <b>112</b>. These pads may be enlarged for ease of alignment and robustness with respect to unmatched CTEs. They may also be plated with gold for a low-resistance contact. A primary purpose of test fixture <b>111</b> is to provide connection means for verifying the integrity of the multi-layer interconnection circuits before any components are assembled. Secondary purposes may include testing of the circuit assembly <b>80</b>. If test chips are provided on the module, then test fixture <b>111</b> may be used to connect these chips to an external tester for verification. Connections to the module access port can be unmade in the same way that defective IC chips can be reworked, by heating the solder and withdrawing the stud bumps. Heat is applied using a hotplate under the glass carrier supporting circuit assembly <b>80</b> and hot inert gas is applied to a localized region on the topside of glass substrate <b>113</b>. The hot gas is directed and confined so as to melt the solder associated with the targeted connector, and not the solder of neighboring components. After withdrawing the stud bumps from the wells the surface is inspected. Touchup may include cleaning of the area around the wells and addition of more solder paste to the wells. Then another connection to the module access port can be made for the same or a different purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Before permanently assembling a module cable to the circuit assembly, it is desirable to coat the top surface with a dielectric layer and a metal layer, as part of the process to create a hermetic or semi-hermetic module. The dielectric layer prevents shorting of components when the metal layer is subsequently applied. The metal layer provides a shield at the top surface, except for small holes at the module access pads, as will be further described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a cross-sectional view like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> except that some module level coatings have now been applied to evolve circuit assembly <b>80</b> into circuit assembly <b>120</b>. At the edges of components, where vertical faces meet interconnection circuit <b>20</b>, fillets <b>121</b> are shown. They provide support for dielectric coating <b>122</b> which is a thin passivating layer of Parylene in the preferred embodiment. The material of fillet <b>121</b> is silicone rubber or other inert material. It is applied by extruding a bead of the material, then following with a narrow spatula to shape the bead into a triangular cross-section. The fillet material is then cured, and dielectric film <b>122</b> and metal film <b>123</b> applied. Metal film <b>123</b> is the first topside module-level metal film. It provides a conductive coating in the region of the module access port, except for small openings at the module access pads. This area will not be covered by second module-level topside metal, because when that coating is deposited a module cable will be connected at the module access port and will block the deposition path, as will be further described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. Metal film <b>123</b> is preferably aluminum with a thickness of approximately one micron. Other metals and thicknesses can be used. One micron of aluminum provides good hermetic protection plus some electromagnetic shielding, at reasonable cost. Depending on the severity of the electromagnetic environment, it may be desirable to substantially increase the thickness for effective shielding performance.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13C</figref> show how the first topside module-level metal film is patterned near the module access pads of circuit module <b>120</b>; they also show the similarity between flip chip connections <b>86</b> and <b>105</b> already described for attaching IC chips and module access port connections such as <b>131</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b> on release layer <b>3</b> on glass carrier <b>1</b>. A flat I/O bonding pad <b>100</b> is shown, which in this case is a module access pad of module access port <b>84</b>. Alternatively, if stacked contacts are provided at each I/O pad of module access port <b>84</b>, then the indentations already provided by the stacked contacts may be employed for the wells, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Metallization <b>95</b> is shown over bonding pad <b>100</b>, as previously described. The pitch between wells filled with solder <b>104</b> is 95 microns in the figure, with a preferred range of 60-200 microns. Module-level packaging layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> are also shown. Layer <b>122</b> is a passivating layer of Parylene, and layer <b>123</b> is a hermetic and shielding layer of metal as previously described. Opening <b>103</b> is patterned and filled with solder paste <b>96</b> to form well <b>104</b> as previously described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> shows an enlarged portion of a module cable <b>132</b> inverted over the wells; it is attached to glass carrier <b>136</b> for dimensional stability during assembly. Gold stud bumps <b>91</b> are bonded to metal pads <b>133</b> that sit on interconnection circuit <b>134</b> on top of release layer <b>135</b>, on top of glass carrier <b>136</b> (inverted in the figure). Referring to the shape and size of multi-layer circuit <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and understanding that a common manufacturing process may be used to fabricate circuit assemblies like <b>80</b> and module access cables like <b>132</b>, it can be seen that <b>132</b>, <b>135</b>, and <b>136</b>, may actually be the same as <b>22</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>1</b>, respectively. The path <b>137</b> for water to migrate into interconnection circuit <b>20</b> is shown. The surfaces surrounding the wells are coated with dielectric <b>122</b> and metal layer <b>123</b> to provide a barrier to water at the module access pads, in the area surrounding but not including the wells. The solder in the wells also provides an effective water barrier, leaving just a narrow entry point for water, and a long path <b>137</b> through polymer layer <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. Polymer layer <b>101</b> provides a weak barrier to water. Thus the module access pads are semi-hermetic. Since the area of the module access port is typically small compared with the total surface area of the module, the total exposure to water is limited to a semi-hermetic portion of small extent.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the assembly and test sequence of the electrical components such as IC chip <b>81</b> will now be discussed. Before assembling any components, a test fixture such as <b>111</b> is temporarily attached to module access port <b>84</b>, with the other end connected to a tester. Multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b> is tested for opens and shorts, and rejected if defective. The first chip to be assembled may be test chip <b>85</b>. This chip is itself verified by an external tester with capabilities suitable for testing both its functional and parametric specifications. If defective, test chip <b>85</b> is replaced using the rework sequence previously described. Once installed and verified, the test chip is capable of testing the remaining components at circuit speed. Alternatively, a completed flip chip assembly like <b>80</b> may be tested using an external tester, connected using test fixture <b>111</b>. If desired, testing can be performed at an elevated temperature applied to the entire circuit assembly, using a heater under the glass carrier. After the circuit assembly has been completely assembled and tested, the test assembly is removed so as not to obstruct the coating of an additional top surface metal layer, as further described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. The overall sequence for creating a tested circuit assembly is presented as a flow graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a conventional RF sputtering chamber <b>140</b>, used for vacuum deposition of metal layers. Vacuum chamber <b>141</b> has an inlet port for a sputtering gas such as argon, and an exit port connected to a vacuum pump as shown. Chamber <b>141</b> includes a top electrode <b>142</b> that is connected to an RF source (not shown), and a counter electrode <b>143</b>. The part to be coated <b>144</b> normally sits directly on counter-electrode <b>143</b>. During sputtering, a plasma <b>145</b> of ionized gas is formed between the top electrode and the counter-electrode as shown. These details are provided as background for a modification to this apparatus, further described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, wherein the counter-electrode is modified to include a pedestal.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows module cable <b>132</b> of the present invention, in plan view. It is connected to circuit module <b>120</b>, before glass carrier <b>1</b> is removed to apply the bottom side metal.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows module cable <b>132</b> with an array of module access pads at each end of the bottom surface (made visible in the figure for descriptive purposes). On the top surface, a scribe line <b>161</b> has been scored in the glass surface with a scribing tool, marking the place where the glass carrier will later be cracked into two separate pieces. Alternatively, scribe line <b>161</b> may be a shallow cut with a diamond saw, positively defining the location of the break to be made, while leaving enough glass thickness to provide adequate strength for handling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> shows the sequence for connecting one end of module cable <b>132</b> to circuit assembly <b>120</b>. To maintain the necessary dimensional stability, it is critical that a glass carrier be present on both sides of the connection interface while the bond sites on both sides are aligned and the. bonds are permanently created. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, module cable <b>132</b> includes glass carrier <b>1</b> with release layer <b>3</b> as previously described, and a single or multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>20</b> with stud bumps <b>91</b> attached at each bonding pad of an array of module access pads. A similar array of stud bumps <b>172</b> is shown at the other end of module cable <b>132</b>. Interconnection circuit <b>20</b> connects between I/O pads of the two arrays in a one-to-one relationship. A cover or sheath <b>173</b> protects the unused end of module cable <b>132</b>, including the second array of gold stud bumps <b>172</b>, until module <b>120</b> is connected to another circuit module, or to another electronic system. Module cable <b>132</b> can be envisaged in a more complex form, including three or more arrays of module access pads, with each array connecting to a circuit module, or to an electronic system other than a circuit module. One or more of the arrays of module access pads may be redistributed with a larger pad pitch for greater ease of connection to a particular piece of electronic equipment, as was described for test fixture <b>111</b>. As previously described, when correct alignment has been achieved heat is applied to form permanent bonds between stud bumps on module cable <b>132</b> and corresponding wells filled with solder on circuit assembly <b>120</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows module cable <b>132</b> attached to circuit assembly <b>120</b>. This stud bump/well connection is preferably as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows that a bending force has been applied, to crack the glass carrier into two pieces at scribe line <b>161</b>. Crack <b>174</b> is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, one portion of glass carrier <b>1</b> has been removed by peeling the glass piece away from interconnection circuit <b>20</b>, leaving behind interconnection circuit <b>20</b> attached to circuit assembly <b>120</b> at each of the module access pads. A module cable that is connected at one end is labeled <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is desired to create a continuous metal envelope around the circuit assembly including the interconnection circuit and the attached components, with only a small opening at each of the module access pads. For hermeticity and effective electromagnetic shielding it is critical that the top and bottom metal layers form an overlapping seam of continuous and void-free metal at the edge of the circuit assembly. A preferred method for achieving this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> shows counter-electrode <b>143</b> previously described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>; for convenience the other parts of RF sputtering chamber <b>140</b> are omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18B</figref>. Normally, a part to be coated in a sputtering chamber requires deposition on the top surface only and is placed directly on the counter electrode. In the current invention, counter electrode <b>143</b> is modified to include a pedestal <b>181</b> that provides an air gap of a few millimeters between circuit assembly <b>182</b> and the opposing surface of the counter electrode. The effect of this arrangement is that the second top layer metal film <b>183</b> will also coat around the edge of the circuit assembly with a thickness that tapers to zero, <b>184</b>, underneath circuit assembly <b>182</b>. Circuit assembly <b>182</b> corresponds to section YY of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. The preferred metal film <b>183</b> is aluminum, with a thickness of one micron, that adds to the first module-level metal film <b>123</b>, also with a thickness of one micron. Module cable <b>175</b> is folded to create a minimum footprint blocking the path of deposited metal to circuit assembly <b>182</b>. After the second top layer metal film <b>183</b> has been deposited, the circuit assembly is flipped on pedestal <b>181</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. A cutout <b>185</b> is provided in pedestal <b>181</b> to store module cable <b>175</b>, in a manner that leaves the edges of circuit module <b>182</b> exposed for coating. After deposition of bottom side metal <b>186</b>, circuit assembly <b>182</b> becomes circuit module <b>187</b>, with the name “module” implying a complete envelope of conductive material. Again, the coating extends around the edges, <b>188</b>. The net result is a continuous metal film covering the topside, the bottom side, and the edges, to form a complete envelope around the circuit assembly. An alternative method for creating a metal layer with a coating that extends around the edge like <b>188</b> is to use a vacuum evaporator. In this case the circuit assembly is held on a carousel, and the carousel executes a planetary motion with respect to the evaporation source to effect coating of a substrate from many different angles, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows system module <b>187</b> of the current invention after withdrawal from the sputtering chamber, with all processing completed. The interconnection circuit and attached components of module <b>187</b> have been thoroughly tested as an integrated system. Module <b>187</b> includes a conductive envelope <b>190</b> comprised of multiple overlapping coatings. Conductive envelope <b>190</b> continuously covers the module except for small openings at the module access pads. Module cable <b>175</b> is attached using fine pitch connections. Conductive envelope <b>190</b> provides a hermetic seal. It also provides an effective electrical screen for reducing electromagnetic interference between the module and other electronic components. It reduces electromagnetic radiation, EMR, produced by the module and also reduces electromagnetic susceptibility, EMS, by reducing the effect of external electromagnetic waves on circuits within the module. With its carrier removed module <b>187</b> is flexible except that it may be constrained by assembled components that are rigid.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A-20C</figref> show various cables of the current invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> is a simple cable comprising an interconnection circuit having multiple traces <b>201</b> connected at one end to port <b>202</b> and at the other end to port <b>203</b>. Interconnection circuit <b>201</b> may have a single layer of conductors, or multiple layers as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Port <b>202</b> may be an input port comprising all of the input signals to the cable, and port <b>203</b> may be an output port comprising a matching set of output signals from the cable. Signals may also be bi-directional in some applications, so that a port may consist of mixed input and output signals. Also the ports can be implemented with either gender on the cable side; all that is required is that there are bumps on one side of the connection and wells on the other side, and this is generally true for all of the cables of the current invention. Within a single cable, some ports may consist of bumps and other ports of wells. The wells can be fabricated as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> shows a cable <b>204</b> wherein port <b>205</b> has been expanded using a redistribution array similar to the redistribution array described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, to allow greater spacing between the I/O pads. This may simplify the task of attaching to an external component or system having a different set of pad spacing requirements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> shows a cable <b>206</b> with multiple fingers <b>207</b>, each finger having one or more ports.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a summary in the form of a flow chart of the aforementioned process for constructing a circuit assembly of the present invention. If adequate depressions are formed by making stacked contacts at each I/O pad, then a separate step for fabricating the solder wells may not be required.</p>

A single large interconnection circuit <b>231</b> contrasts with the array of smaller interconnection circuits <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Processing groups of IC chips <b>232</b> are arrayed as shown, including individual IC chips such as <b>233</b>. Each processing group may include processor chips, memory chips, and bus-interface chips, for example. The dense interconnection circuits and assembly methods of the current invention provide for a large computational capability on circuit assembly <b>230</b>. A module access port <b>234</b> similar to <b>84</b> is shown, for connecting to other systems, including test systems. A group of special-purpose programmable test chips is provided, <b>235</b>, and also a maintenance group of IC chips <b>236</b>, for maintenance of the blade server. For example, any failure occurring in a processing group may be automatically detected by a background process running on maintenance group <b>236</b>, which will reconfigure blade server component <b>230</b> to bypass the defective group for any further operations.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, circuit assembly <b>230</b> has been converted into circuit module <b>240</b> by application of module-level coatings, as previously described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows an edge fragment of circuit module <b>230</b> coupled with a heat sink <b>241</b>. Circuit module <b>240</b> includes multi-layer interconnection circuit <b>242</b> which may differ from interconnection circuit <b>20</b> because it is configured for high-speed operation using differential signal pairs, for example. IC chips such as <b>243</b> are preferably attached using flip chip bonds such as <b>105</b>, previously described. Similarly, module-level coatings including dielectric layer <b>191</b> and conductive envelope <b>192</b> are fabricated using the same methods as previously described for circuit module <b>190</b>. Circuit module <b>240</b> is attached to heat sink <b>241</b> at the faces of chips such as <b>233</b>, using a layer of thermal material <b>243</b> at each attached IC chip. Material <b>243</b> may be thermal grease or a conductive epoxy, and may be applied by printing as a thick film onto the top surface of module <b>240</b>. Heat sink <b>241</b> preferably contains a re-circulating coolant fluid, to extract heat effectively using a heat sink of small volume. Circuit module <b>240</b> and heat sink <b>241</b> may be combined to form a blade server component that can be inserted into a server chassis, with appropriate provisions for electrical and plumbing connections. The thermal path from active transistor junctions on IC chips such as <b>233</b> to heat sink <b>241</b> has low thermal impedance. It includes only one layer of non-conducting material, which is preferably a thin layer of Parylene 191 in the current invention. This means that IC chips of blade server module <b>240</b> can operate at high power levels, without exceeding their maximum junction temperature specifications.</p>
