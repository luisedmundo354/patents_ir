<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A simple method to produce Aluminum Metal Matrix Nanocomposite with 2 to 35 volume percent of nano Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>reinforcement phase without adding nano Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particles in a direct step of the metal matrix. The initial necessary material is an aluminum powder with nanoscale surface oxide. The volume percent of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is determined by the particle size distribution and the thickness of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer. The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layers or shells are broken up and are uniformly distributed throughout the nanocomposite after the powder consolidation into billet and the hot and/or cold metal working of the billet.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the method of low cost production of aluminum metal matrix nanocomposites. More particularly, the present invention relates to the method of manufacturing nanoscale aluminum oxide particulate reinforced aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aluminum Metal Matrix Nanocomposites reinforced by nanoscale aluminum oxide particulates (Al-MMNC) is one type of nanocomposite. A conventional particulate reinforced Aluminum Metal Matrix Composite (Al-MMC) usually has an aluminum or aluminum alloy phase and a ceramic reinforcement phase composed of micron scale particles. Most Al-MMCs material systems in use today are reinforced with aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C) and silicon carbide (SiC) particles. Ingot metallurgy (I/M) and powder metallurgy (P/M) are common methods to produce Al-MMCs. Al-MMCs have higher yield strength, stiffness and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than those of the monolithic matrix alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the properties of Al-MMCs are controlled by the particle size, particle distribution in the matrix and volume fraction of the reinforcement as well as the matrix alloy properties. It is found that an Al-MMC reinforced with ceramic particles possessing fine particle size have improved strength, fatigue resistance and machineability composed of Al-MMCs reinforced with coarse ceramic particles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Optimum mechanical properties of an Al-MMC can be obtained when stable nano ceramic particulate is uniformly distributed in the aluminum matrix. This new composite is considered to be an aluminum metal matrix nanocomposite (Al-MMNC). The I/M Al-MMC manufacturing process can produce a MMC with a ceramic particle size of minimum about 20 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Finer particles are different to wet and distribute uniformly in the metal matrix resulting in microporosity and poor fatigue and fracture toughness. The P/M Al-MMC process can deal with finer particles, but ceramic particles finer than 1 micron are difficult to be distributed uniformly during the mixing process resulting in particle agglomeration.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To create a uniform distribution of the nano ceramic particles, the aluminum matrix alloy powder should have a particle size close to that of the nano ceramic particle. Otherwise, the large aluminum particles are surrounded by very fine ceramic particles. Additionally, the very fine ceramic particles will also agglomerate. These agglomerations are extremely difficult to break-up during blending once they are formed and subsequent thermo-mechanical work of the resultant MMC will cause the agglomerates form “stringers” that will act as crack initiation sites in the material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Creating a homogenous mixture of two different nano powders or one nano powder with one micron powder is extremely difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">High-energy ball mills as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,557,893 and 4,623,388 to Jatkar et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,500 to Zendalis et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,751 to Akechi can mix micron and submicron powders uniformly. They can also mix nano powders uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, high-energy ball mills have very low efficiency and are very difficult to scale up for large volume production. This blending technique adds a high cost in addition to expensive nano metal powders and nano ceramic particulates.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To overcome the barrier of mixing two powders using conventional MMC processing methods, an in-situ method has been created. The reinforcing particles are synthesized in the metal matrix by chemical reactions between elements or between the element and compound during fabrication of the MMC.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A variety of in-situ processing techniques for producing a wide range of MMNCs have been developed. X. C. Tong and H. S. Fang, <i>Metall, Mater. Trans. A, </i>29, 893 (1998), described using an in situ method to produce TiC particulate reinforced Al-MMNC. The TiC particles formed in-situ have a size of about 100 nanometers (nm) and are uniformly distributed in the aluminum matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This processing requires a high cooling rate to reduce the particle size of reinforcement and to modify its distribution in the matrix. It is a major challenge to create uniformly distributed nano reinforcements via chemical reactions during MMNC production without difficult to maintain process control.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">There have been no in-situ processes that can produce Al-MMCs reinforced with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>4</sub>C or SiC, whether on a micronscale or nanoscale.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is a novel and unique method of manufacturing aluminum metal matrix, nanocomposites reinforced with nanoscale aluminum oxide particles.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is an object of the present invention to create a novel, unique, and simplified process for producing aluminum metal matrix nanocomposites reinforced with nanoscale aluminum oxide particles having a controlled volume fraction and uniform distribution in the aluminum matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the present invention is to provide such a technique that utilizes the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layers existing on all aluminum particles as the ceramic reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing Al-MMNC having unalloyed aluminum or an aluminum alloy as the metal matrix and having fine grain sizes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, it should be understood that such embodiments are by ways of example only and merely illustrative of but a small number of the many possible specific embodiments which can represent applications of the principles of the present invention. Various changes and modifications obvious to one skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the present invention as further defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The major sequential steps of the manufacturing method of this invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, including:</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Step 1. Preparing the Nano-Ceramic-Surface Aluminum Powder</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to understand the process of producing an aluminum powder with nano surface oxide, it is necessary to understand how conventional aluminum powder is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The aluminum and aluminum alloy powder can be produced by various processes including atomization, splat quenching, melt-spinning, and plasma method. Atomization, the most widely used process, can produce aluminum or aluminum alloy powder in a wide range of sizes from submicron to over 100 microns. The powder is classified into an average particle size from about 5 microns to 50 microns with normal distributions for industry applications.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The atomized aluminum particles can have shapes that go from spherical to flat particles depending on the cooling conditions. The aluminum powder for Al-MMC is usually spherical in shape. A nanoscale range of aluminum or aluminum alloy powders can be produced by the plasma method.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The aluminum or aluminum alloy powders always have an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer of certain thicknesses on all particles surface. All sizes of aluminum particles of the same production lot have the same thickness of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>on the particle surfaces. That is because the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer is formed due to the chemical reaction between aluminum and oxygen during the powder production process. The thickness of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer depends on the aluminum powder manufacturing process and not the particle size. Some aluminum powder applications such as rocket engine fuel minimize the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer by atomizing the aluminum powder in inert gas. Aluminum powder atomized in inert gas usually has an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layer of about 50 mm thickness compared to thickness of about under 100 nm for powder atomized in air.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The total percentage of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in aluminum powder with a spherical shape is a function of the average particle size of the powder and the thickness of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer. The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>volume percent can be calculated by equation [1]:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>vol %=100[1−(1−2T/D)<sup>3</sup>]%   [1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Where T is the thickness of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, D is the diameter of average aluminum powder particle size including the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For a given thickness of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, the smaller average particle size, the more total Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The volume percent of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in an aluminum powder of irregular shape is also a function of the average particle size of the powder and the thicknesses of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer. The relationship among percentage of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, particle size and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer thickness for irregular shape aluminum powder has to be established by experimental test procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Spherical shaped aluminum powder is preferred in this invention. A spherical shape has the largest surface to volume ratio, which provides the highest percentage of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>for the same volume particle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Aluminum powder producers usually discharge aluminum powder that has very fine particle size because of the relationship between the particle size and the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>percentage. For example, the total Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>volume percent is about 27% for aluminum powder that has a 2 micron average particle diameter and 100 nm thickness of surface Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The aluminum powder used in conventional Al-MMCs is about 25 micron average size with up to a 100 nm Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layer. It contains only up to about 2.4% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>according to the equation [1].</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This invention uses the equation [1] to control producing the aluminum powder with a nano surface oxide. This invention also controls the volume percent of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in the final Al-MMNC.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>volume percent is controlled to between about 2% and 45% for most structure applications although aluminum powder with higher percentage Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">There are three ways to control the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>volume percent in the aluminum powder:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0039">(1) For existing aluminum powder with a fixed thickness of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layer:
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0040">(a) Determining the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer thickness of aluminum powder produced by an aluminum powder manufacturer. The thickness can be indirectly measured. First to measure the total Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>percentage of aluminum with known average particle size. And then to calculate the thickness by equation [1].</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0041">(b) Using (1) again to calculate the average particle size needed for producing a composite with predetermined Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>vol %; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0042">(c) Classifying the aluminum power to have the average particle size the same as the calculated value.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0043">(2) For existing aluminum powder that have large average particle size:
    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0044">(a) Measuring the average particle size;</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0045">(b) Determining the existing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer thickness by the method in (1)(a);</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0046">(c) Determining the required thickness of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer by the equation (1) for a predetermined Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>vol %; and</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0047">(d) Increasing the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer thickness if the existing thickness is less than the required thickness.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">The simplest way is to heat treat the aluminum powder in an air at a temperature below aluminum's melting point. A flow bed furnace is an efficient method for increasing the thickness of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer. The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>thickness is controlled by the elevated temperature and the furnace time.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer needs to be thick for large average particle size. The thickness should be under 3 micron to assure that the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>shell is broken up during the powder consolidation and secondary processing steps. Aluminum powder with large average particle size should be limited to produce Al-MMNCs with low Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>volume percent loadings.
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0050">(3) Use plasma method to produce nano size ranges of aluminum powder that have high volume percent of aluminum oxide:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0051">Plasma is an efficient method to produce nano aluminum powder. Because of very small average particle size, nano aluminum with a very thin Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layer can have very high percentages of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. For example, Tetronics Limited in the United Kingdom has produced the nano aluminum powder that has a particle size in the range of 90 nm to 100 nm and contains 33 weight % (˜30 vol %) of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0052">Both atomization and plasma methods are able to produce unalloyed aluminum powder and aluminum alloy powder of Aluminum Association 2000, 6000 and 7000 series as well as other special alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0053">The aluminum powder with nano surface oxide layer for producing the Al-MMNCs has a preferred average particle size from about 20 nm to 50 microns with a normal particle size distribution.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(2) Step 2. Preparing Aluminum Alloy Matrix Mixture</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0054">The aluminum matrix is the aluminum alloy that is chosen as the most appropriate for a given Al-MMC or Al-MMNC application. There are two routes to prepare the aluminum matrix alloy.
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0055">(1) Aluminum alloy powder with nano surface oxide:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">By following the procedure in Step 1, the aluminum alloy powder with predetermined percentage nano surface oxide can be produced by using a desired aluminum alloy ingot. Such aluminum alloy powder is ready for the consolidation step.
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0057">(2) Mixing alloy elemental powders with an unalloyed aluminum powder with nano surface oxide:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0058">Step 2(1) is the simplest way. However, most aluminum powder producers are manufacturing unalloyed aluminum powder only. The powder metallurgy method of creating aluminum alloy is employed when the unalloyed aluminum powder with nano surface oxide is used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0059">The unalloyed aluminum powder and alloy elemental powders are mixed by using a blender, jet mill or ball mill. The alloy powders need to be reasonably uniformly mixed with unalloyed aluminum powder because the alloy elements defuse in the matrix to form the aluminum alloy during the hot consolidation process. The aluminum matrix is alloyed uniformly when such diffusion controlled-alloying is taking place.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0060">The alloy elemental powders are selected from the group consisting of magnesium, copper, iron, zinc, manganese, nickel, cobalt, silicon, titanium, alloys and combination thereof. It is preferred to have average particle sizes of alloy powders in the particle size range of the unalloyed aluminum powder.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0061">The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>volume percent should be adjusted according to the percentage of additional alloy powder being used.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Step 3. Consolidating the Powder Mixture</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0062">The powder mixture is loaded into a billet tool and is pressed at room temperature to form a compacted mixture that has between about 50% and 95% of theoretical density. The billet tool size can be very small or sized for compacting quantities approaching about 1000 kg (2,200 lb) of powder.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0063">There are various powder metallurgy methods that can be employed to consolidate the compacted mixture. The following are typical processes:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0064">(1) Vacuum/Inert-gas/Air Hot-Pressing:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0065">Under vacuum, inert-gas or air, the compacted mixture is heated to a degassing temperature range and then is held at this range for more than about one-half hour for degassing purposes. The degassing temperature range depends on the matrix metal and is typically from between about 230° C. (450° F.) and less than the lowest eutectic melt temperature of the compacted mixture. The main function of degassing is to remove H<sub>2</sub>O from the metal matrix mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0066">After the degassing period, the temperature is raised to the consolidation temperature, which is the highest eutectic melt temperature of the compacted mixture. The consolidation temperature is lower than the aluminum melting point. The consolidation temperature is typically between about 230 and 615° C. (450 and 1145° F.). While the consolidation temperature and vacuum, inert-gas or air environment is maintained, the degassed, compacted mixture is pressed to full density resulting in a composite billet.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0067">In the case of a thin Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, consolidation of the powder should take place under vacuum or inert gas to prevent additional oxidation.
<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0068">(2) Cold Isostatic Press/Sinter:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0069">In the Cold Isostatic Press (CIP)/Sinter process, the matrix mixture is compacted at room temperature in Step 3 to about 85% to 95% of theoretical density. Pressing the powder mixture to high density at room temperature requires pressures between about 50,000 psi and 85,000 psi. Typically, a Cold Isostatic Press is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0070">The compacted mixture is then sintered in vacuum, in inert-gas, or in air. The compacted mixture is heated to the degassing temperature range and then is held at this temperature range for more than about one-half hour to be degassed. After degassing, the degassed compacted mixture is heated to a sintering temperature that is the highest eutectic melt temperature of the compacted mixture so that sintering of the matrix takes place to form the composite billet. This sintered composite billet has a density that is still approximately that of the starting compacted mixture, between 85% and 95% of the theoretical density, but is sealed by the sintering process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0071">This sealing is needed to avoid internal oxidation of the billet during subsequent hot working. The composite will have 98% to 100% of the theoretical density after following metal working.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0072">In the case of aluminum powders with a thin Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, sintering should take place under vacuum or inert gas to prevent additional oxidation.
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0073">(3) Cold Compacting/Hot Press:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0074">In the case of aluminum powder with a thick Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, the matrix mixture can be consolidated without degassing since the thick Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer prevents additional oxidization that is detrimental to the resultant composite.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0075">The mixture is loaded into a billet tool and is pressed at room temperature to form a compacted mixture that is between about 50% and 95% of the theoretical density.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0076">The compacted mixture is heated to the consolidation temperature in vacuum, inert-gas or in air. While the consolidation temperature and vacuum, inert-gas, or air environment continues to be maintained, the compacted mixture is hot pressed to approximately 98 to 100% of theoretical density to produce the composite billet.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Step 4. Metal Working the Composite Billet</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0077">Most of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layers are broken up during billet consolidation due to the brittle nature. Unaffected Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>surface layers are broken up during cold, hot metal work, or die casting or any combination of these steps.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0078">The cold work can be cold extrusion, cold forging, cold rolling or any combination of these steps. During hot metal working, the composite billet is plastically deformed at a temperature between about 230 and 615° C. (450 and 1145° F.), which is below the melting point of aluminum. The hot metal work can be hot extrusion, hot forging or hot rolling or any combination of these steps.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0079">The die casting can be pressureless die casting or pressure casting. Unlike boron carbide or silicon carbide particles in conventional P/M Al/MMCs, aluminum oxide particles do not react with molten aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0080">The metal working can be incorporated as part of fabrication processes for producing final Al-MMNC products.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0081">After the consolidation and metal working, the Al<sub>2</sub>O surface layers of nano thickness are broken into a nano Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particulate reinforcement phase which is uniformly distributed in the aluminum matrix resulting in a homogenous aluminum metal mixture nanocomposite.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0082">The nano Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particles also act as grain refiners that minimize the grain sizes of the aluminum alloy in the composite. As a result, the Al-MMNCs are highly ability of work hardenable to achieve higher yield strength than conventional aluminum alloys and conventional Al-MMCs.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0083">Unlike adding reinforcing ceramic particles that contribute to impurities in the metal matrix, there are few impurities in the Al-MMNC made by the method of this invention because there is no reinforcement particle added to the aluminum matrix. Therefore, there is excellent bonding between the aluminum matrix phase and the nano Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>reinforcement phase.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0084">The nano Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, excellent chemical bonding, and lower impurities in the metal matrix all contribute to a near perfect composite with significantly improved fatigue and creep resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0085">The nano aluminum oxide is less abrasive than coarse ceramic particle reinforcements. Therefore, the Al-MMNCs have better machineability than conventional Al-MMCs. The Al-MMNC is as weldable as conventional Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particulate reinforced Al-MMCs since Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>does not react with the aluminum metal matrix to produce brittle components that weaken the weld zone. The Al-MMNC can be heat-treated when the matrix aluminum alloy is heat-treatable.</p>
