<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a nationalization of PCT/SE04/000922 filed Jun. 14, 2004 and published in English.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the field of washing jet engines, particularly using washing liquids such as water and detergent or water only, and more specifically to a system, and devices for collecting and treating the waste water from engine washing operations and a mobile cart comprising such a system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A gas turbine engine installed as an aircraft engine comprises a compressor compressing ambient air, a combustor burning fuel together with the compressed air and a turbine for driving the compressor. The expanding combustion gases drive the turbine and also result in thrust used for propelling the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Air breathing machines like jet engines consume large quantities of air. Air contains foreign particles in form of aerosols or larger particles which then enters the engine with the air stream. The majority of the particles will follow the gas path through the engine and exit with the exhaust gases. However, there are particles with properties of sticking on to components in the engine's gas path changing the aerodynamic properties of the engine and more particularly reducing engine performance. Typical contaminants found in the aviation environment are pollen, insects, engine exhaust, leaking engine oil, hydrocarbons coming from industrial activities, salt coming from nearby sea, chemicals coming from aircraft de-icing and airport ground material such as dust.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The contaminants sticking on to components in the engine gas path cause fouling of the engine. The consequence of gas path fouling is an engine operating less efficient. With the reduction in efficiency follows that the engine is less economic to operate and has higher emissions. Fouling will result in more fuel having to be burnt for achieving the same thrust as for the clean engine. Further, an environmental drawback is found with the higher fuel consumption in form of increased carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, more fuel being burnt results in higher temperatures in the engine's combustor. With this follows high temperature exposure to engine hot section components. The higher temperature exposures will shorten the life time of the engine. The higher firing temperature results in increased formation of NOx which is yet another environmental drawback. In summary, the operator of a fouled engine suffers from reduced engine lifetime, unfavourable operating economics and higher emissions. The airline operators have therefore a strong incentive keeping the engine clean.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has been found that the only reasonable way to combat fouling is to wash the engine. Washing can be practised by directing a water jet from a garden hose towards the engine inlet. However, this method has limited success due to the simple nature of the process. An alternative method is pumping the wash liquid through a manifold with special nozzles directed towards the engine inlet face. The manifold would be temporarily installed on the engine cowl or on the engine shaft bullet during the wash operation. Simultaneously with spraying the washing liquid towards the engine inlet, the engine shaft is cranked by the use of its starter motor. The shaft rotation enhances the wash result by the mechanical movements. The shaft rotation allows the wash liquid to move over greater surface area as well as enhancing liquid penetration into the interior of the engine. The method is proven successful on most gas turbine jet engines types such as turbojets, turboprop, turboshaft and mixed or un-mixed turbofan engines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A proper wash operation of a gas turbine engine can be confirmed by an observation that the wash liquid exits the engine at the engine outlet. At the engine outlet the wash liquid has become a waste liquid. The waste liquid may leave the engine outlet as a stream of liquid pouring to the ground. Alternatively may the waste liquid be carried with the air stream as fine droplets where the air stream is the result of the rotation of the engine shaft. This air borne liquid can be carried a significant distance before falling to the ground. It is shown from actual wash operations that waste liquid will be spread on a large surface area, typically more than 20 meters downstream of the engine outlet. It is not desired to spread waste liquid on the ground. It is the purpose of this invention to provide a method and apparatus to collect the waste liquid exiting the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The waste liquid exiting the engine at washing consists of the wash liquid entering the engine together with released fouling material, combustion solids, compressor and turbine coating material, and oil and fat products. This waste liquid may be hazardous. As an example, analysis of water collected from actual turbine engine washing operations showed to contain cadmium. The cadmium comes from compressor blade coating material released during washing operation. Cadmium is environmentally very sensitive and can not be allowed to be disposed to the effluent. This waste liquid would have to undergo treatment for separation of hazardous components before being disposed in a sewer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Gas turbine aircraft engines can be of different types such as turbojets, turboprop, turbo-shaft and mixed or un-mixed turbofan engines. These engines cover a large performance range and may comprise of different design details by different manufactures. Aircrafts types for a defined service may be offered from different aircraft manufacturers thus the design of the aircraft and its engines may vary. Further, the aircraft manufacturer may offer different engine options for the same aircraft type. The large combined possibility of engines on aircraft types and from different aircraft manufacturers result in a practical problem in designing a system for collecting and treating of waste wash liquid that is generally applicable to most winged aircraft. U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,217 to Testman, Jr. discloses an engine wash recovery system that is limited to small and particularly turboprop engines as the container used in the invention is not applicable to the air flows emanating from e.g. large turbo-fan engines.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Collecting waste water from engine washing may be accomplished by hanging canvas like collectors under the engine nacelle. However, any operation resulting in anything being hooked on to an engine has the disadvantage that it may be subject to engine damage</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, it is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus enabling collecting and treating waste water from engine washing for a large range of aircraft types including the largest aircraft types.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for removing hazardous components from the waste water before disposing it.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for collecting and treating waste water from engine washing having no physical contact between the collector device and engine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for enabling clean engine operations.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other objects are achieved according to the present invention by providing devices and systems having the features defined in the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for collecting and treating waste liquid from engine washing. The system comprises a collecting device for collecting waste liquid during a washing operation of an engine, wherein the collecting device comprises liquid separating means having an inlet face and an outlet face arranged to separate washing liquids from the air stream entering the inlet face, which air stream emanates from the engine during the washing operating of the engine; and liquid collecting means for collecting separated liquid from liquid separating means and liquid exiting the engine resulting from the washing operation. Furthermore, the system comprises a treatment device for treating waste liquid collected during the washing operation, wherein the treatment device comprises filter means arranged to remove particles and ions from the liquid, wherein the treatment device is connected to the collecting device such that waste liquid is directed from the liquid collecting means to the treatment device for treatment in the filter means.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a collecting device for collecting waste liquid during a washing operation of an engine, wherein the collecting device comprises liquid separating means having an inlet face and an outlet face arranged to separate washing liquids from the air stream entering the inlet face, which air stream emanates from the engine during the washing operating of the engine; and liquid collecting means for collecting separated liquid from liquid separating means and liquid exiting the engine resulting from the washing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a treatment device for treating waste liquid collected during a washing operation, wherein the treatment device comprises filter means arranged to remove particles and ions from the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mobile cart for serving a engine during a washing operation of the engine comprising a chassis provided with wheels. The cart comprises a system according to the first aspect of the present invention arranged on the chassis; adjusting means for adjusting the position of the liquid separating means and/or liquid collecting means and/or the liquid storage means relative the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The solution according to the present invention provides several advantages over the existing solutions. One advantage is that hazardous particles, substances, or other types of content, such as released fouling material, combustion solids, compressor and turbine coating material, heavy metals and oil and fat products, can be removed or separated from the waste liquid resulting from a washing operation in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another advantage is the inventive devices and systems can be used with different types and designs of gas turbine aircraft engines, such as turbojets, turboprop, turbo-shaft and mixed or un-mixed turbofan engines, and, moreover, with different aircraft types and designs from different manufactures because the devices and systems can be accurately adjusted to a specific engine or aircraft. Accordingly, the present invention provides for a very high degree of flexibility since one system can be used for all types of engines and aircrafts, i.e. the present invention provides for a collecting and treating of waste wash liquid generally applicable to most winged aircraft. This also entails cost savings because one and the same system or mobile cart including the system can be used for all types of engines and aircrafts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further advantage is that there is no physical contact between the collector device and the engine, which entails that any damages of the engines can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be discussed below by means exemplifying embodiments.</p>

Similar parts are shown with the same reference numbers as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. shows a side view of engine <b>1</b>. Engine <b>1</b> is an “under-wing engine” installed under wing <b>21</b> with support <b>22</b> where wing <b>21</b> is part of aircraft <b>2</b>. A manifold (not shown) for injecting washing liquid is installed in the engine inlet <b>10</b> of engine <b>1</b>. The manifold holds a plurality of nozzles <b>24</b> in position upstream of the fan. A wash pump unit (not shown) pumps a washing liquid through nozzles <b>24</b> forming sprays <b>25</b> directed toward the fan and core engine air inlets. The liquid cleans the gas paths of the fan and the core engine. To enhance the cleaning effect the engine shafts are cranked by the use of the engine's starter motor. Cranking of the shafts enables the liquid to move around inside the engine for achieving enhanced cleaning effect. The rotation of the shafts results in an airflow carrying the liquid towards the engine outlet hence liquid will exit the engine at the rear. Liquid exiting the engine is waste liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Liquid will exit the engine in at least five different ways as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The first liquid category, stream <b>201</b>, will exit the core engine outlet <b>12</b> as airborne droplets. The droplets that make up stream <b>201</b> are generated inside the engine by the motion of the compressor and turbines blades. Stream <b>201</b> comprises of droplets with a large size range where the different droplet sizes have different characteristics. The smallest droplets, i.e. droplets less than 30 microns will typically quickly evaporate in the ambient air as of their small size. Droplets less than 30 microns are therefore not so much of concern in the waste water collection process for reason of the evaporation and that they represent only a small volume of the waste liquid. The largest droplets in stream <b>201</b> are droplets in the size of raindrops, e.g. 2000 um size. These droplets are heavy and will not evaporate but fall to the ground by gravity. Droplets greater than 30 microns but less than 2000 microns will be carried with the air stream and fall by gravity to ground <b>23</b> typically up to 20 meters behind the engine outlet. The second liquid category, stream <b>202</b>, consists of strings of liquid and other large chunks of liquid. Stream <b>202</b> quickly falls to the ground <b>23</b> by gravity. The third liquid category, stream <b>203</b>, is liquid pouring as a solid stream out of the core engine outlet <b>12</b>. This liquid pours typically vertically to ground <b>23</b>. The fourth liquid category, stream <b>204</b>, is liquid pouring out from the fan duct outlet <b>11</b>. This liquid falls basically vertically to ground <b>23</b>. The fifth liquid category, stream <b>205</b>, is liquid dropping or pouring from the bottom of the engine nacelle. The source for this liquid is for example the combustor drain valves being open. According to the invention a method and apparatus is disclosed for collecting waste liquid exiting the engine as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show a side view of engine <b>1</b> and how waste liquid is collected during washing according to the invention. Similar parts are shown with the same reference numbers as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Collector <b>3</b> consist of a droplet separator <b>31</b>, a trough <b>36</b> and a chute <b>302</b>. Liquid exiting the engine as stream <b>201</b> is separated from the carrier air in droplet separator <b>31</b>. Liquid exiting the engine as stream <b>202</b>, stream <b>203</b>, stream <b>204</b> and stream <b>205</b> are collected by chute <b>302</b>. The liquid emanating from droplet separator <b>31</b> and chute <b>302</b> is collected in trough <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Droplet separator <b>31</b> consists of a frame enclosing droplet separator profiles. Droplet separator <b>31</b> has an inlet face <b>32</b> directed towards air stream <b>201</b> and an outlet face <b>33</b> opposite to inlet face <b>32</b>. Stream <b>201</b> enters the droplet separator at inlet face <b>32</b> and exits the droplet separator at outlet face <b>33</b>. The liquid is trapped in separator <b>31</b> so that stream <b>301</b> is essentially free from liquid after passing through droplet separator <b>31</b>. Droplet separator <b>31</b> consists of vertically arranged separator profiles (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in a frame. The separator profiles deflect the air stream. As a result the momentum of the droplets causes them to impinge onto the profile surface. The droplets coalesce together and form a liquid film. The influence of gravity on the film causes the liquid to drain to the bottom of the profile and exit the droplet separator at face <b>34</b> as stream <b>35</b>. Waste liquid stream <b>35</b> falls by gravity into trough <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Droplet separator <b>31</b> consists of a frame enclosing droplet separator profiles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> show the technique for separating air borne droplets with the use of separator profiles. The direction of the air stream is shown by arrows. The droplet separator profiles are arranged in parallel allowing for an air flow through the separator. The droplet separator profiles are arranged standing vertical allowing for liquid on the profile surface to find its way downwards by gravity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a cross section of three droplet separator profiles looking from above and downwards. Droplet separator profile <b>81</b> is shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At about the middle distance from the leading edge to the tail edge of the profile, a liquid trap <b>82</b> is formed as a pocket for collecting liquid on the surface of profile <b>81</b>. Droplets <b>84</b> are carried with the air stream in between the droplet separator profiles. Inside the separator the air is deflected as the result of the geometry of profile <b>81</b>. The air flow deflection is rapid enough to not allow the droplets to follow with the air. The inertia of droplets <b>84</b> then allows the droplets to travel un-deflected and impinge on profile <b>81</b> at point <b>83</b>. As liquid continues to build up on the profile surface a liquid film <b>85</b> is formed where the air stream shear forces will carry liquid <b>85</b> into liquid trap <b>82</b>. In liquid trap <b>82</b> the liquid will build up and pour downwards by gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows chute <b>302</b> installed under engine <b>1</b>. Chute <b>302</b> will collect liquid <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>205</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Chute <b>302</b> has a front end <b>39</b> and a rear end <b>38</b> where front end <b>39</b> is positioned vertically higher than rear end <b>38</b>. As front end <b>39</b> is higher than rear end <b>38</b>, the chute is inclined. The inclination of chute <b>302</b> will allow liquid in the chute to flow from the left to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Rear end <b>38</b> is positioned above trough <b>36</b> so that liquid will pour out of chute <b>302</b> into trough <b>36</b> as stream <b>37</b>. According to an alternative embodiment, chute <b>302</b> is incorporated in trough <b>36</b> and tank <b>302</b>, thereby forming one single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The liquid that exits the engine during washing contain water, detergent and foreign matter. The foreign matter is in form of solids and ions dissolved in the water. What comes out of the engine at a specific wash occasion depends on a number of issues such as when washing was last conducted, the environment in which the engines operates, etc. Further, the waste liquid may at one wash occasion contain a high amount of solids while at another wash occasion be low on solids. Similarly, the waste liquid may at one wash occasion contain a high amount of ions while at another wash occasion be low on ions. This results in that the waste water treatment system must be flexible in its design so that the most appropriate treatment can be conducted at each occasion. The waste water treatment system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>shows the components and processing according to one treatment scheme. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>shows the same components yet a different treatment scheme. The scheme in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>are example of two possible schemes where anyone skilled in the art can design additional schemes and yet remain within the objectives of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">There may be wash occasions where the waste water is non-hazardous. In such a case processing for removal of hazardous components would be unnecessary. The non-hazardous waste liquid may then be directly disposed off into a sewer. To enable the operator of the unit to decide if the waste water should undergo further treatment before disposal or to be disposed off directly, the operator may conduct a test. A possible test for this purpose is to measure the water electric conductivity. This test allows for an on-the-spot decision for direct disposal to a sewer or allow for further processing of the waste water. A small portable and battery powered conductivity meter may be used. According to this embodiment, the test procedure would then include sticking the measurement probe into the waste water and record the conductivity reading. The recorded values would then be compared to a table of acceptable and not acceptable values representing experience gained from laboratory analysis of waste waters from engine washings. The use of a conductivity meter for measuring the electric conductivity is an example only. Depending on the engine type and the environment in which the engine operates the operator may find alternative test methods to be more appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, a trough <b>36</b> collects the waste liquid streams as stream <b>401</b>. From an opening at the bottom of trough <b>36</b> the waste liquid enters tank <b>303</b>. The waste liquid in tank <b>303</b> is allowed to settle for some time, typically less than 30 minutes. Particles that have a higher density than water will sediment to bottom <b>406</b> of tank <b>303</b>. Particles that typically will sediment to the bottom are fuel solid residues, coked hydrocarbons, compressor fouling material, and alike. Particles with less density than water will float to surface <b>407</b> of the waste liquid. Particles that typically will float to the surface are oils, fats, pollen, insect residues, residues from bird strikes and alike. In between the bottom sediment and the surface materials the waste liquid may contain metal ions and very small particles that will not sediment to the bottom or float to the surface.</p>

The liquid will then continue to filter <b>47</b>. Filter <b>47</b> is a sediment type filter of a commercially available type. This filter will separate coarse and very fine particles. After filtration in filter <b>47</b> the liquid continues in conduit <b>48</b> to filter <b>49</b>. Filter <b>49</b> is a filter for separation of metal ions. Filter <b>49</b> can be a filter consisting of bed of metal particulate material matter. The metal particulate matter is chosen from metals having favourable redox potentials relative the redox potential of the waste water metal ions to establish conditions for spontaneous oxidation and reduction reactions with the metal ions. The metal particulate type filter is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,192. After filtration in filter <b>47</b> and filter <b>49</b> the waste liquid is now depleted from particles and metal ions. The waste liquid continues in conduit <b>403</b> for disposal in a sewer or to a tank (not shown) for later disposal in a sewer.</p>
