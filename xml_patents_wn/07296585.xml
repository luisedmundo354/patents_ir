<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A reduced component wear valve is comprised of a valve body having a passage therethrough and a disc attached to a rotatable shaft. The disc is utilized with a seal forming a gap between the disc and the seal proximate to the rotational axis of the disc. When the disc is in the open position, the seal major axis is greater then the disc diameter and they do not touch. As the disc rotates to near closure, the disc perimeter engages the minor axis of the seal (which is smaller than the disc diameter), and the disc stretches the seal in the minor axis direction thus decreasing the major axis such that the gap is closed. The seal can be pre-formed in an elliptical shape or it can be formed into an elliptical shape by a retaining mechanism. The seal may be a single-piece or a multi-piece assembly press-fit into the valve body. Zero or light disc to seal contact during the majority of the valve disc rotation minimizes valve seal wear and rotational friction.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to rotary or “butterfly” valves and methods for fabricating them, and more particularly to reducing valve friction and improving the valve sealing and wear characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Rotary valves, commonly referred to as “butterfly” valves, are typically provided with a disc which is rotationally drivable between an open position and a closed position about a central axis diametrically extending through the interior of a generally annular valve body. In the open position, the disc permits fluid flow through the valve body. Upon rotation of the disc to the closed position, a peripheral edge of the disc operatively engages an annular seal member portion of an annular seal cartridge structure supported within the valve body, to prevent fluid flow through the valve and associated piping sections.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rotary valves are often utilized in applications requiring “bi-mode” operations, i.e. where the valve is either open or closed, such as a safety shut-off valve that generally remains open but must close, and disable the flow, during an emergency condition, such as a fire or chemical spill. Another application of rotary valve usage is throttling which regulates the amount of fluid flow per unit of time in a process. Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, by way of example, typically incorporate throttling rotary valves to deliver precise quantities of the chemical components constituent to a product batch. A sophisticated process control system, such as the pharmaceutical process described above, may further control the throttling rotary valve to regulate the fluid flow in a time varying or cyclical manner. Applications such as these often result in the disc and the seal member remaining in constant sliding contact in relation to one another throughout the control process resulting in increased wear on both components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the use and operation of rotary valves in fluid throttling and shut-off applications is well known in the art, the valves are still subject to several well-known problems, limitations, and disadvantages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate a prior art circular disc or circular seal rotary valve, wherein a portion of the circular valve seal along the rotational axis of the valve stem is continually in contact with a portion of the circular disc adjacent to the valve shaft resulting in continuous wear on the valve seal adjacent to the valve shaft. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a prior art circular rotary valve <b>206</b> in a partially open position disposed within a passage <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross section of circular valve from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> taken along the section line <b>10</b>-<b>10</b>. The circular rotary valve <b>206</b> includes a valve stem <b>202</b> rotatable along an axis <b>200</b>. By rotating the valve stem <b>202</b> along the axis <b>200</b>, in the direction indicated by an arrow <b>211</b>, the circular disc <b>203</b> comes into contact with a circular valve seal <b>209</b> to close off a passage <b>204</b>. A wear area <b>205</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), located proximate to the axis <b>200</b> of the valve stem <b>202</b>, is in continual engagement with the circular valve seal <b>209</b> as the circular disc <b>203</b> rotates in relation to the circular valve seal <b>209</b>. As a result of continual engagement between the circular disc <b>203</b> and the circular valve seal <b>209</b>, wear occurs either on the disc <b>203</b> or on the circular valve seal <b>209</b> at the wear area <b>205</b> adjacent to valve stem <b>202</b>. As the distance d between the circular disc <b>203</b> and the centerline of the valve seal <b>209</b> decreases, the wear area <b>205</b> between the circular disc <b>203</b> and the circular valve seal <b>209</b> increases, thereby increasing the total associated wear. Stated another way, the prior art rotary valve <b>206</b> when utilized for actively throttling fluid flow to provide a small percentage of total flow capacity, incurs significant wear as a result of the wiping motion of the circular disc <b>203</b> relative to the circular valve seal <b>209</b>. The presence of abrasive particulates suspended within the fluid may accelerate the wear experienced by the valve seal <b>209</b> and disc <b>203</b> at the contact area <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The wear inherent to this type of circular disc/seal interface often results in reduced seal integrity leading to an inability to completely retard the fluid flow through the rotary valve. The loss of accurate fluid flow control attributable to worn seals may cost a manufacturer substantial sums of money in either lost process control or valve services. As a result, a worn valve must be either repaired or replaced which may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in material and/or process downtime. For example, shutting down a nuclear reactor to replace a valve or replacing a ruined batch of pharmaceutical product caused by a malfunctioning control valve, can result in significant losses due to lost productivity or product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem associated with by the prior art rotary valves is overcoming the “break away” friction of the valve, i.e. overcoming the static friction of the ball or disc required to open, close, or adjust the valve. Typically “high performance” rotary valves, which generally have a large break away friction, require a large initial force to overcome the static friction which can cause valve positioning instability because the large initial force is considerably greater than the force required to overcome the dynamic friction and hence an actuator will likely overshoot the desired setting. It would therefore be desirable to provide a “frictionless” rotary valve that would solve such valve control problems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem associated with the prior art rotary valves is the complicated centering and adjustment procedures required to position the disc relative to the valve seal. Because the periphery of the disc is used as the seal contact surface for the valve, it is critical to proper seal performance that the disc be precisely centered within the valve body. Numerous structures have been incorporated into the prior art rotary valve assemblies to address this problem and permit the installed disc to be adjusted within the valve body in a manner effecting this necessary disc centering. This centering adjustment, of course, must be carefully and accurately performed to achieve the desired sealing effectiveness. Adjustment error, on the other hand, can seriously reduce the valve's sealing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another problem associated with the prior art rotary valves is the complicated manner in which an actuator, a motorized device used to rotate the disc between its open and closed positions, is operatively mounted on the valve body. Typical rotary valves include an actuator base structure integrally formed or joined to the valve body and projecting radially outwardly from the valve body. An adaptor structure affixed to the outwardly projecting base structure provides a platform for mounting the actuator to the valve body. This complex mounting and adaptor structure undesirably adds to the overall manufacturing cost and complexity of assembly of the prior art rotary valve.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As highlighted by the foregoing discussion, a need exists for an improved rotary valve assembly, and the fabrication methods associated therewith, to eliminate or substantially reduce the above-mentioned problems, limitations, and disadvantages typically associated with rotary valves of conventional construction. It is desirable to provide a rotary valve having an effective mechanism for providing extended service life. It is a further desirable to reduce the wear between the disc and the sealing surface of the valve over a relatively large range of rotational distances. It is further desirable to provide a rotary valve having enhanced controllability, and substantially no seal engagement and wear until the disc provides substantial closure of the valve passageway, and to provide a simplified mechanism for the mounting of actuators to a valve body.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment a rotary valve includes a generally annular valve body and a seal structure, carried by the valve body, for forming an elliptical disc and elliptical seal interface. A disc is rotatably supported within the valve body and has an elliptical periphery rotatable into and out of sealing engagement with an elliptical sealing surface. The elliptical disc periphery has a generally conical shape which creates an entrance angle on the disc seating surface that provides a variety of operational advantages, such as a reduction in the torque required to overcome the break away friction and unseat the disc from the associated seal structure, and a reduction in the wear experienced by both the disc periphery and the sealing surface. Further, the reduced torque requirement, a smaller valve actuator and associated hardware may be used to seat and unseat the disc relative to the sealing surface. Still further, the elliptical seal and the disc cooperate to provide a wedging effect that allow broader manufacturing tolerances to be employed while improving the overall sealing efficiency of the rotary valve.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment of the rotary valve provides for the reduction of wear experienced by the individual valve components. The rotary valve includes a valve body and sealing structure, carried within the valve body, for forming a disc and seal interface which in operation may cooperate to prevent fluid flow through the valve body. The disc is adapted to cooperate with the elliptical seal to form a gap between the disc and the seal proximate to a rotational axis of the round disc. In the open position, the major axis of elliptical seal is greater than the round disc diameter insuring little or no contact between the two components. As the disc rotates to near closure, an elliptical face formed on the disc perimeter engages the minor axis of the elliptical seal (which is smaller than the generally circular disc diameter), and the disc distorts the elliptical seal along the minor axis thereby forcing a corresponding decrease along the major axis such that the gap is closed bringing the elliptical seal into sealing contact with the disc proximate to the rotational axis of the disc. The elliptical seal may be pre-formed in an elliptical shape or it may be formed into an elliptical shape by a retaining mechanism. Because the disc and seal are not in contact (or are in very limited contact) through the majority of the valve's range of uses the wear and break away friction are minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment of the rotary valve has the seal structure including a retaining mechanism having two facing annular seal cartridge members, and a resilient annular seal member secured there-between. The facing annular seal cartridges formed to create an elliptical cavity sized to engage and receive a portion of the seal member such that the seal member is deformed and held in an elliptical configuration. The elliptical seal member having a radially inner annular portion, protruding from the facing annular seal cartridge members, into the valve body interior for operative sealing engagement by the disc periphery. Alternatively, the seal member may be formed from a metallic material and received in the elliptical seal cavity between the seal cartridge members.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another embodiment of the rotary valve has the elliptical seal cavity formed in at least one of the facing annular seal cartridge members by resiliently deforming a circular cartridge member to an elliptical shape and holding the deformed cartridge member in such elliptical shape while at least a portion of the seal cavity is formed on a side of the cartridge member in a circular pattern circumscribing its central axis. The elliptically deformed cartridge member is then released, to thereby permit it to return to its original circular shape. This, in turn, deforms the originally circular seal cavity portion to an elliptical shape conforming to the elliptical shape of the disc periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the rotary valve has a press-fit seal assembly or annular, one-piece seal providing an interference with a reverse-flow side recess formed within the valve body. The press-fit seal assembly or one-piece seal may further be constructed to include a retaining ridge. The retaining ridge cooperating with the reverse-flow side recess to provide redundant retention in the event of a catastrophic valve failure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another embodiment of the rotary valve has the disc precisely centered with respect to the valve body and the seal structure, in automatic response to installation of the disc within the valve body using two guide members having an inserted part inwardly inserted through a pair of suitable openings in diametrically opposite flat portions on the outer periphery of the annular valve body.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The guide members may have an abutment portion on the extended end of the inserted parts corresponding to a disc abutment portion which cooperate to automatically center the disc within the valve body. The positions of the abutment portions relative to the guide members are precisely controlled by external flange portions which abut the diametrically opposite flat portions on the exterior periphery of the valve body. Illustratively, an inner end of one of the guide members is rotatably received in a mounting structure carried on the disc, and a longitudinal portion of a disc-rotating shaft is rotatably extended through the other guide member and is rotationally locked to the mounting portion of the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another embodiment of the rotary valve includes an actuator support structure secured to the valve body such that the motor-driven actuator may be cheaply and easily coupled to the outwardly projecting disc rotating shaft. Generally, the actuator support structure is of a one-piece construction that is removably secured to the valve body and is directly connectable to a selected actuator. More particularly, the annular valve body may have a circumferentially spaced pair of flat areas formed on the external periphery of the valve body on opposite sides of a longitudinal drive shaft portion projecting radially outwardly from the valve body periphery. Another embodiment of the rotary valve includes a one-piece actuator support structure configured generally inverted U-shaped with a closed outer end portion to which a valve actuator may be directly secured, and a spaced pair of leg portions each having a free end portion. The free end portions being removably secured to the flat area formed on the valve body, thereby securing the actuator and support structure to the valve body.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a rotary valve <b>10</b>, commonly referred to as a “butterfly” valve, including a generally annular metal body portion <b>12</b>, a metal closure disc <b>14</b> rotatable between a closed position and an open position (respectively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) about an axis <b>16</b> extending diametrically through the body portion <b>12</b>, and an annular seal cartridge structure <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the disc <b>14</b> in the closed position cooperating with the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> to prevent fluid flow through the interior of the body portion <b>12</b> and the piping sections (not shown) operatively connected to its opposing sides. Alternatively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the disc <b>14</b> in the open position, such that fluid flow through the interior of the valve body <b>12</b>, and piping operatively coupled to the valve body <b>12</b>, is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8B</figref>, the disc <b>14</b> has a body portion with a front or outer side <b>20</b>, a rear or inner side <b>22</b>, and a peripheral sealing edge portion <b>24</b>. A diametrically spaced pair of attachment bosses <b>26</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) extend outwardly from the rear side <b>22</b> and have aligned, circularly cross-sectioned bores <b>28</b> extending through oppositely facing outer side surfaces <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the bosses <b>26</b> (as illustrated better in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>). The outer side surfaces <b>26</b><i>a </i>are equidistant from the centerline of the body portion of the disc <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates exemplary embodiment of the disc <b>14</b> having a centerline <b>30</b>, and formed (by appropriately machining its outer edge) as a segment of a cone <b>32</b> having an axis <b>34</b> tilted at a relatively small angle A relative to the disc body centerline <b>30</b>. The angle of the cone <b>32</b>, by way of example, is approximately 34°, and the machining tilt angle A is approximately 8°. This machining of the body of the disc <b>14</b> as a segment of the cone <b>32</b> gives the peripheral sealing edge portion <b>24</b> of the disc <b>14</b> an elliptical shape in which the major rear side diameter D of the circular disc body, which extends transversely to the disc rotational axis <b>16</b>, is greater than the minor rear side diameter of the disc <b>14</b> which extends parallel to the disc rotational axis <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The machining of the disc <b>14</b> as a segment of the cone <b>32</b> results in portions of the disc periphery <b>24</b> adjacent opposite ends of the major diameter D having different slope angles from the rear side <b>22</b> of the disc body to the front side <b>20</b> of the disc body. Representatively, an upper portion of the disc periphery <b>24</b> (as viewed in FIG. <b>7</b>) slopes outwardly and radially inwardly at an angle B of approximately 15°, and a lower portion of the disc periphery <b>24</b> (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) slopes outwardly and radially inwardly at an angle C of approximately 31°. A bore centerline <b>36</b> of the attachment bosses <b>26</b> may be offset a small distance E from the rotational axis <b>16</b> of the disc <b>14</b> to effect a “camming” action with respect to the disc as it moves between the closed and open positions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> illustrate the disc <b>14</b> rotatably mounted within the annular valve body <b>12</b> and automatically centered using a cylindrical shaft <b>38</b> and upper and lower cylindrical guide members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. The cylindrical shaft <b>38</b> has a pair of flats <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> formed on upper and lower end portions thereof (illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The upper guide member <b>44</b> is of a hollow tubular configuration and has an upper body portion <b>48</b>, a reduced diameter lower body portion <b>50</b> having a lower end <b>52</b>, and an elongated transverse mounting flange <b>54</b> disposed at the junction of the body portions <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. The lower guide member <b>46</b> has a cylindrical upper body portion <b>56</b> with an upper end <b>58</b>, an enlarged diameter cylindrical lower body portion <b>60</b>, and an elongated transverse mounting flange <b>62</b> at its bottom end. An upwardly facing annular shoulder <b>64</b> is defined at the juncture of the upper and lower body portions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> further illustrate the annular valve body portion <b>12</b> having an upper flat portion <b>66</b> formed diametrically opposite a lower flat portion <b>68</b>, and having circular bores <b>70</b> formed there-through and spaced apart along the disc rotation axis <b>16</b>. The upper and the lower flat portions <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are positioned on the valve body <b>12</b> such that they are equal radial distances away from the centerline of the body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The disc <b>14</b> is mounted within the interior of the valve body <b>12</b> by placing the bosses <b>26</b> within the interior of the valve body <b>12</b> and inserting the tubular lower end portion <b>50</b> of the upper guide member <b>44</b> downwardly through an annular gasket <b>72</b>, the upper circular bore <b>70</b> and into the interior of the valve body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Contemporaneously with the mounting of the upper guide member <b>44</b>, the upper end portions of a pair of threaded studs <b>74</b> pass upwardly through a corresponding pair of mounting holes disposed in opposing ends of the flange <b>54</b>. When the flange <b>54</b> bottoms out on the upper flat area <b>66</b>, a pair of nuts <b>76</b> are threaded onto the studs <b>74</b> to secure the flange <b>66</b> adjacent to the upper valve body flat area <b>66</b>. The lower end portion of the shaft <b>38</b> is slidable through the upper guide member <b>44</b> and the bore <b>28</b> of the upper disc boss <b>26</b>, and is adapted to be secured in place within the upper disc boss <b>26</b> by a set screw <b>77</b> threaded into a corresponding opening in the upper disc boss <b>26</b> and forced against the lower shaft flat area <b>42</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the lower end <b>52</b> of the lower body portion <b>50</b> of the upper guide member <b>44</b> abutting the upper side surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the upper disc boss <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The upper end portion <b>56</b> of the lower guide member <b>46</b> is passed upwardly through an annular gasket <b>78</b> and the lower valve body circular bore <b>70</b> into the circular bore <b>28</b> disposed in the lower disc boss <b>26</b> until the lower guide member flange <b>62</b> abuts the lower flat area <b>68</b> formed into the annular valve body <b>12</b>. The flange <b>62</b> is secured to the flat area <b>68</b> via a pair of bolts <b>80</b> extended upwardly through corresponding holes in the flange <b>62</b> and threaded into aligned holes in the valve body <b>12</b>. The mounting of the upper and the lower guide members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> in this manner supports the disc <b>14</b> within the valve body <b>12</b> for rotation relative thereto about the rotational axis <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The above-described mounting of the upper and the lower guide members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> serve to automatically center the disc <b>14</b> within the valve body <b>12</b> relative to the annular seal cartridge structure <b>18</b>. The centering is accomplished without the necessity of subsequent adjustments to the installed disc <b>14</b> relative to the valve body <b>12</b> or the annular seal cartridge structure <b>11</b>. In practice, automatic disc centering may be achieved by axially configuring the upper and lower cylindrical guide members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> in such a manner such that they are operatively secured to the valve body <b>12</b> as described above, and the distance between the lower end <b>52</b> of the upper guide member <b>44</b> and the annular flange portion <b>64</b> of the lower guide member <b>46</b> is precisely identical to the distance between the oppositely facing outer sides <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the disc bosses <b>26</b> (which are representatively equidistant from the centerline of the disc body). In this manner, because the distances between the valve body upper and lower flat areas <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are identical, the disc <b>14</b> is automatically centered within the valve body <b>12</b> by the abutments <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b> and <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b> between the guide members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and the disc bosses <b>26</b>, when the guide member flanges <b>54</b>, <b>62</b> respectively abut the valve body flat areas <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The shaft <b>38</b> extends upwardly through an annular packing structure <b>82</b> (illustrated for clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) received within the upper body portion <b>48</b> of the upper guide member <b>44</b>. Shaft <b>38</b> also passes upwardly through and beyond a tubular packing retainer member <b>84</b> telescoped within the upper body portion <b>48</b> and having a transverse flange portion <b>86</b> on its upper end. The studs <b>74</b> pass upwardly through corresponding holes in the outer ends of the flange <b>86</b>, with the packing retainer member <b>84</b> being held in place with nuts <b>88</b> threaded onto the upper ends of the studs <b>74</b>. An upper end portion of the shaft <b>38</b> is operatively connected to a conventional motorized actuator <b>90</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) operatively associated with the valve body <b>12</b> via a one-piece actuator support bracket <b>140</b>. The actuator <b>90</b> may be selectively utilized to rotate the shaft <b>38</b> about the disc rotation axis <b>16</b> to thereby rotate the disc <b>14</b> between its <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> closed position and its <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> open position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6A</figref> illustrate various aspects of the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the seal cartridge structure is complimentarily and removably received within an annular recess <b>92</b> (illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) formed in a side <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the valve body <b>12</b> and is captively retained within the recess <b>92</b> by means of a snap ring <b>94</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) removably received in an annular groove <b>96</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the valve body recess <b>92</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further illustrates the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> including a flat annular metal seal support member <b>98</b>, a flat annular metal seal retaining member <b>100</b>, and an annular seal member <b>102</b> sandwiched between the members <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the annular seal member <b>102</b> is substantially identical to the seal member <b>24</b> illustrated and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,005,848 to Eggleston and comprises an annular TEFLON® body having (as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) an annular, radially inner sealing portion <b>104</b>; an annular, radially outer peripheral portion <b>106</b>; an annular, axially inwardly projecting flexible web portion <b>108</b>; and an annular, axially outwardly projecting lip portion <b>110</b>. An annular resilient garter spring member <b>112</b> outwardly circumscribes the annular sealing portion <b>104</b> and exerts thereon a radially inwardly directed resilient biasing force.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, the seal member <b>102</b> is held by the balance of the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> to cause the sealing portion <b>104</b> of the seal member <b>102</b> to assume an elliptical shape corresponding to the elliptical configuration of the peripheral edge <b>24</b> of the disc <b>14</b> to provide substantially improved valve sealing performance as later described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In order to hold the originally round annular seal member <b>102</b> in an elliptical configuration the seal support member <b>98</b> is retained in a suitable clamping structure and is subjected to diametrically opposite, radially inward directed clamping forces <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that resiliently deform opposite edge portions of the seal support member <b>98</b> radially inward, while at the same time correspondingly and resiliently deforming the member <b>98</b> radially outwardly in directions <b>116</b> transverse to the clamping forces <b>114</b>, thereby giving the seal support member <b>98</b> an elliptical configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the seal support member <b>98</b> is being held in this resiliently deformed elliptical configuration, a circular seal receiving depression <b>118</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is suitably machined on one side of the deformed seal support member <b>98</b>. The temporarily clamped seal support member <b>98</b> is then released to permit it to return to original circular configuration, thereby causing the circular depression <b>118</b> to assume an elliptical configuration in the finished inner seal support member <b>98</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, the seal retainer member <b>100</b> is placed in the clamping structure and subjected to diametrically opposite, radially inwardly directed clamping forces (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that resiliently deform opposite edge portions of the seal retaining member <b>100</b> radially inwardly, while at the same time correspondingly and resiliently deforming the member <b>100</b> radially outwardly in directions <b>122</b> transverse to he clamping forces <b>120</b>, thereby giving the seal retaining member <b>100</b> an elliptical configuration. A circular depression <b>124</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is formed in the side of the seal retaining member <b>100</b> which will face the seal support member <b>98</b> while the seal retaining member <b>100</b> is held in this elliptical configuration. The seal retainer member <b>100</b> is then released from the clamping structure to return to its original circular configuration, thereby causing the circular depression <b>124</b> to assume an elliptical configuration in the finished inner seal support member <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Suitable marks (not shown) are placed on each of the completed seal support and retainer members <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> so that when the seal member <b>102</b> is operatively sandwiched therebetween, the elliptical depressions <b>118</b>, <b>124</b> may be precisely aligned. When the seal member <b>102</b> is operatively sandwiched between the seal support and retainer members <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the seal portion <b>108</b> is received in the elliptical depression <b>118</b>, the seal portion <b>110</b> is received in the depression <b>124</b>, and the seal portion <b>106</b> is clamped between facing portions of the seal support and retainer members <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>, with an inner peripheral portion of the seal member sealing portion <b>104</b> projecting radially inwardly beyond the inner peripheries of the seal support and retainer members <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>. The annular seal member <b>102</b> is installed within the elliptical depressions <b>118</b> and <b>124</b>, by slightly deforming the seal member <b>102</b> from its originally round configuration to an elliptical configuration which geometrically matches the elliptical shape of the periphery <b>24</b> of the disc <b>14</b>. The resulting assembled seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> retains the inwardly projecting periphery of the seal member sealing portion <b>104</b> in the desired elliptical configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With the seal support and retainer members <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> rotationally aligned with one another, the completed seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> is installed in the valve body side recess <b>92</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) in a manner such that aligned holes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the seal support and retainer members <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> are aligned within an underlying hole <b>130</b> in the axially inner surface of the valve body seal cartridge recess <b>92</b> to thereby align the major axis of the now elliptical seal portion <b>104</b> with the major axis of the elliptical disc periphery <b>24</b> when the disc is rotationally driven to its <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> closed orientation. To retain the installed seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> in this operative orientation, a retaining pin <b>132</b> is operatively positioned in the aligned holes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, and <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the disc <b>14</b> is rotationally driven between its open and closed positions, as indicated by the directional arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the elliptical disc periphery <b>24</b> is driven through the rotational arc <b>134</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-8B</figref> to cause the indicated portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the disc periphery <b>24</b> to be selectively wedged into sealing engagement with the radially inner periphery of the resilient seal portion <b>104</b> (illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and then be disengaged therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The exemplary mating of the elliptical disc <b>14</b> and the seal surfaces <b>104</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in the valve <b>10</b>, result in a number of advantages such as reducing the torque required to seat and unseat the disc <b>14</b> from the associated seal element when compared to the conventional torque requirements of a round disc seating against a round seal element. Additionally, there is less wear on the disc and seal element. Further, the reduced operational torque requirements, the parts carrying the actuation load may be smaller, and a smaller actuator may be used to seat and unseat the valve disc against the seal. Still further, broader manufacturing tolerances may be utilized in conjunction with the disc and seal due to the compensation and wedging effects provided by the elliptical seal and disc interface.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B-6E</figref> illustrate alternate embodiments of the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> and the complementary annular seal member <b>102</b> and retainer member <b>100</b> assembled without the need for a separate snap ring <b>94</b>, as described above. The alternate embodiments of the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b> provide for a press-fit seal assembly <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>340</b>, and <b>360</b> positioned within a reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>manufactured in the valve body <b>12</b>. The reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>and the alternate embodiments, discussed below, may be formed in a variety of shapes to provide an elliptical seal. For example, the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>may be formed having an elliptical shape such that a round seal, when position within the recess, is forced to assume the elliptical profile; alternatively, the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>may be formed circular, as previously described, and the seal may be formed with an elliptical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the press-fit seal assembly <b>300</b> pressed into the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>such that an interference is created between the outer diameter <b>302</b> of the press-fit seal retainer <b>304</b> and the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a</i>. The interference may be created by manufacturing the outer diameter <b>302</b> of the press-fit seal retainer <b>304</b> slightly larger (generally between three and six thousandths of an inch, 0.003″-0.006″) than an inner diameter of the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a</i>. The press-fit seal retainer <b>304</b>, generally having the larger outer diameter, may be mechanically forced into the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>such that the smaller inner diameter of the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a </i>slightly compresses the press-fit seal retainer <b>304</b>. In this manner, the press-fit seal retainer <b>304</b> and an associated seal member <b>306</b> may be locked into position within the reverse-flow side recess <b>92</b><i>a</i>. The assembly of the press-fit seal assembly <b>300</b> is accomplished from the reverse flow side of the rotary valve <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a seal cartridge structure <b>18</b><i>a </i>including a deformable annular metal seal element <b>136</b> having a generally U-shaped cross-section around its periphery.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In constructing the seal cartridge structure <b>18</b><i>a</i>, the support member <b>98</b><i>a </i>may be left in its original flat angular configuration, and the seal retainer member <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be resiliently deformed to an elliptical shape, by clamping it at diametrically opposite portions as previously described for the seal retainer member <b>100</b>. At this time, a circular depression <b>138</b> is machined into the inner side surface of the seal retainer member <b>100</b><i>a </i>on a radially inner peripheral area thereof. When the resiliently deformed seal retainer member <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unclamped, it springs back from an elliptical configuration to its original circular configuration to thereby reconfigure the circular depression <b>138</b> in a manner such that its outer peripheral surface <b>138</b><i>a </i>has an elliptical shape. An annular metal seal <b>136</b> is captively retained in the depression <b>138</b> of the assembled seal cartridge structure <b>18</b><i>a</i>, such that forcible engagement of the seal portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>by the disc periphery <b>24</b> deforms the seal <b>136</b> into the elliptical shape bounded by the elliptical recess surface <b>138</b><i>a</i>, thereby providing the valve <b>10</b> with the elliptical disk/seal interface. The modified seal cartridge structure <b>18</b><i>a </i>provides advantages similar to those discussed above in conjunction with the flexible TEFLON® seal structure <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6F-6H</figref> illustrate alternate embodiments of the annular metal seal <b>136</b> generally indicated by the numerals <b>380</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>420</b>. An annular, one-piece metal seal <b>380</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>420</b> may be interchangeable with the press-fit seal assemblies <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>340</b>, and <b>360</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B-6E</figref>. The one-piece metal seal <b>380</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>420</b> utilize a press-fit assembly, as described above, to insure that continuous contact is maintained between the one-piece metal seal <b>380</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>420</b> and the valve body <b>12</b>. The one-piece metal seal <b>380</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>420</b> includes a base portion <b>382</b>, <b>402</b> and <b>422</b> pressed into contact with the valve body <b>12</b> to provide an interference. The one-piece metal seal <b>380</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>420</b> further includes a flexible arm portion <b>384</b>, <b>404</b> and <b>424</b> in sliding contact with the disc <b>14</b>. The flexible arm portion <b>384</b>, <b>404</b> and <b>424</b> may be manufactured in a variety of configurations and materials to provide constant contact between the one-piece metal seal <b>380</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>420</b> and the disc periphery <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">During operation of the valve <b>10</b>, the one-piece metal seals <b>380</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>420</b> may be contained by the either of the guide members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and the valve body <b>12</b>, depending the direction of fluid flow and the pressure gradient, through the valve body <b>12</b>. Further, the metal seals <b>400</b> and <b>420</b> may incorporate the remaining ridge member <b>406</b> and <b>426</b> to provide redundant retention against slippage or other movement in the event of a catastrophic failure of the metal seals <b>400</b> and <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, in addition to illustrating the self-centering disc support and elliptical disc and seal interface features, also illustrate a structure for substantially simplifying and reducing the cost of the rotational driving interconnection between the motor-driven actuator <b>90</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the shaft <b>38</b> and thus the disc <b>14</b>. The one-piece actuator support bracket <b>140</b>, generally described above, is removably securable to the valve body <b>12</b> and may be customized to operatively mount motor-driven actuators of a variety of types and configurations and permit them to be drivingly coupled to the shaft <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The actuator bracket <b>140</b> has a generally inverted U-shaped configuration with a top end support plate portion <b>142</b>, and a pair of substantially parallel leg plate portions <b>144</b> each having an outwardly angled foot portion <b>146</b> that may be removably secured, with suitable fasteners such as bolts <b>150</b>, to a pair of flat portions <b>148</b> located on opposite sides of the top flat portion <b>66</b> on periphery of the valve body <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the actuator bracket <b>140</b> may be welded to the valve body <b>12</b>, or otherwise suitably anchored thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The top plate <b>142</b> is suitably drilled, as illustrated at openings <b>152</b> and <b>154</b>, to accommodate the particular motor-driven actuator (for example, the actuator <b>90</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) used in conjunction with the balance of the valve <b>10</b>. Accordingly, a single actuator bracket may be used as a universal mount structure to operatively couple a variety of differently configured actuators to a given rotary valve <b>10</b>. The actuator <b>90</b>, by way of further example, is operatively mounted atop the top end plate <b>142</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a rotational output portion <b>90</b><i>a </i>(as better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the actuator <b>90</b> extends downwardly through the central upper end plate opening <b>152</b> and is drivingly coupled to the upper end of the shaft <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The actuator support structure feature described above eliminates the need to supply and utilize additional intermediate bracket structures between a base support structure, formed integrally with the valve body <b>12</b>, and the selected actuator. This component reduction simplifies the valve body <b>12</b> design allowing it to be produced from various materials, depending on the valve flow media, without changing the bracket material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are illustrative of the rotary valve <b>206</b>, specifically a “butterfly” valve, having reduced component wear and reduced breakaway fraction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the rotary valve <b>206</b> including the valve body <b>208</b> and the disc <b>210</b> to close the passage in the valve body <b>208</b>. The disc <b>210</b> has a sealable surface on plug periphery <b>226</b> and when plug <b>210</b> rotates with the shaft <b>216</b> it engages the seal <b>212</b> only upon closing the passage. In an exemplary embodiment a round disc <b>210</b> and an elliptical seal <b>212</b> are utilized, wherein a gap <b>217</b> is present between the disc <b>210</b> and the seal <b>212</b> proximate to the rotational axis <b>224</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) of the disc <b>210</b> and a “greater than normal” interference is present in interference area <b>219</b>. Thus, when the disc <b>210</b> is in the open position, a major axis <b>232</b> of the elliptical seal <b>212</b> (oriented parallel to the rotational axis <b>224</b> of the shalt <b>216</b>) is greater than a minor axis <b>238</b> of the disc <b>210</b> and the seal <b>212</b> does not touch or only lightly contacts the disc <b>210</b>. As the disc <b>210</b> rotates to near closure, the disc periphery <b>226</b> engages a minor axis <b>234</b> of the elliptical seal <b>212</b> (which is smaller than the disc diameter <b>230</b>), and the disc <b>210</b> stretches the seal <b>212</b> in the minor axis <b>234</b> direction thereby decreasing the major axis <b>232</b> such that the gap <b>217</b> is closed and seal <b>212</b> engages the disc <b>210</b> proximate to the rotational axis <b>224</b> of the disc <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Another embodiment of the rotary valve <b>206</b> includes the valve seal <b>212</b> formed in a “more elliptical shape” than the disc <b>210</b>, where again the major axis <b>232</b> of the seal <b>212</b> is dimensionally greater than a major axis <b>236</b> of the disc <b>210</b> proximate to the shaft <b>216</b>. Thus, the disc <b>210</b> would be less elliptical than the seal <b>212</b>. As described above, when the disc <b>210</b> rotated towards the “closed position” the disc periphery <b>226</b> engages and stretches the seal <b>212</b> perpendicular to the shaft <b>216</b> and dimensionally shrinks seal major axis <b>232</b> reducing a gap area <b>260</b> to zero gap. The gap area <b>260</b> between the seal <b>212</b> and the disc <b>210</b> is reduced to an interference with the disc <b>210</b> such that the seal <b>212</b> conforms to the periphery <b>226</b> of the disc <b>210</b> (the seal <b>212</b> is not illustrated in the stretched configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). As a result of this configuration, the disc <b>210</b> does not engage the seal <b>112</b> (as illustrated) until the passage is substantially obstructed by the disc <b>210</b> and the seal <b>212</b> only provides substantial contact pressure on the disc periphery <b>226</b> when the disc <b>210</b> substantially closes the passage.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the rotary valve <b>206</b> having a valve body <b>203</b> constructed from a metallic material. Polymer based housings may also be utilized for specific applications. The specific diameter of an inlet <b>220</b> and an outlet <b>222</b> may be selected eased upon the desired fluid flow through the valve. The inlet <b>220</b> and the outlet <b>222</b> may be connected a plurality of associated piping <b>223</b> by respective flanges or threads (not shown). It is contemplated, however, that a variety of inlet and outlet connections may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The volume of fluid flowing through the valve <b>206</b> is regulated by the radial tilt or positioning of the disc <b>210</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the disc <b>210</b> is shaped generally as a circular planar disc described by the diameter <b>230</b>. It is contemplated that other embodiments of the disc <b>210</b> could be a hemisphere or any other sealable shape. For example, the disc <b>210</b> could be an elliptical shape ball of any degree and not depart from the scope of the described embodiments. Butterfly valves, their assembly, applications, and functionality are well known by those having skill in the art, thus, the variety of different features, optional shapes and configurations of components for rotary valves will not be discussed in detail herein although many different valve designs may be utilized with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The disc major axis <b>236</b> may be mounted substantially perpendicular to the shaft <b>216</b>. The disc major axis <b>236</b> engages the seal <b>212</b> in interference area <b>219</b>. The sealable surface on the disc periphery <b>226</b> is typically manufactured smooth such that when the disc periphery <b>226</b> engages with the seal <b>212</b>, a leak proof valve <b>206</b> is accomplished. The seal <b>212</b> may be formed from a variety of ductile materials. A metallic material, such as stainless steel, is typically preferred, however, the seal <b>212</b> may be manufactured to utilize many different materials. The seal material selection largely depends on the type of fluid that will come into contact with the seal <b>212</b>. A corrosive fluid will require a corrosion resistant seal. Likewise, a high temperature fluid will require a high temperature seal. Most importantly, the seal <b>212</b> should be flexible and have spring like or resilient qualities such that the seal <b>212</b> is deformable, yet robust enough to withstand sliding contact with the disc <b>210</b> as the disc <b>210</b> cycles through rotations and/or opens and closes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In another embodiment the seal <b>212</b> fits in a seat <b>214</b>. The seat <b>214</b> may be formed by a recess in the valve body <b>208</b>. The seat <b>214</b> may be machined, forged, welded threaded or cast into valve body <b>208</b>. Typically, the seal <b>212</b> has a retaining mechanism such as the seal support member <b>93</b> and the flat annular metal seal retaining member <b>100</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> are cross-sectional views of sealing and seal retention/forming embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> like elements have like reference numerals. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> grooves or recesses are typically utilized to appropriately secure, shape or form the seal <b>212</b> with the help of a retaining mechanism such as a snap ring <b>94</b> or the seal support member <b>98</b> and the flat annular metal seal retaining member <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Formation of the seal <b>212</b> into an elliptical shape within the body can be accomplished by many methods. The seal <b>212</b> may be manufactured in an oval shape (elliptical) or it may be manufactured in round shape. The seal <b>212</b> may have a circular outside shape or circumference and an elliptical inner shape or circumference. When seal <b>212</b> is manufactured in a round inner shape, the seal <b>212</b> must be elliptically deformed as it is inserted into the valve seat <b>214</b> of valve body <b>208</b>. Deformation of the seal <b>212</b> to an elliptical shape can also be accomplished for example, by an elliptically shaped valve seat previously identified as <b>92</b>, and <b>92</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the inside circumference of seal remains relatively constant, but its shape is distorted elliptically.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Many methods of seal retention and formation are available and known to those having skill in the art and would not part from the scope of the present invention. The disc <b>210</b> may include a slight chamfer to improve sealable surface long the disc periphery <b>226</b>, vary the rate of engagement, and reduce possible damage to seal. A chamfer or radius on the sealable surface along the disc periphery <b>226</b> provides a larger seating area between the disc <b>210</b> and the seal <b>212</b> upon passage closure by the disc <b>210</b>. A greater sealing surface area provides a more robust seal.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The “inner” circumference of the seal <b>212</b> is slightly smaller than the “outer” circumference of the disc <b>210</b>. This provides an interference fit between the disc <b>210</b> and the seal <b>212</b> which is typically between fifteen and thirty-five thousands of an inch (0.015″-0.035″) measured at an infinitesimal sector or arc. Constructing a valve <b>206</b> that incorporates this tolerance profile is well known in the art, although due to the configuration of the disclosed embodiments the amount of the interference is not uniform around the periphery to the disc <b>210</b> prior to closure.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">During closure, the seal minor axis <b>234</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is elongated by the disc <b>210</b>, and the seal major axis <b>232</b> is reduced much like pulling on two ends of an annual rubber band. Thus, in the open position the seal minor axis <b>234</b> has a greater than normal interference with the disc major axis <b>236</b>, and as the plug major axis <b>236</b> approaches closure and contacts the seal <b>212</b>, the seal <b>212</b> elongates along the minor axis <b>234</b> and contracts along the major axis <b>232</b> to conform to the disc <b>210</b> shape. When the disc <b>210</b> substantially closes the passageway, the contact between the valve seal major axis <b>232</b> and the disc minor axis <b>238</b> forces more seal to disc <b>210</b> contact until contact between the valve seal major axis <b>232</b> and the disc minor axis <b>238</b> substantially seals the passage. For example, when the disc <b>210</b> is within approximately three degrees (3°) of closure, measured from the axis of the seal <b>212</b>, the valve seal <b>212</b> may still provide clearance, and as the disc <b>210</b> engages the seal <b>212</b> approximately two degrees (2°) from closure, the seal <b>212</b> substantially engages the disc <b>210</b> proximate to the shaft <b>216</b> and at zero degrees (0°) seals around the entire circumference of the disc <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The present invention also provides for frictionless operation between the disc <b>210</b> and the seal <b>212</b> when the valve <b>206</b> is used for throttling and operating at more than, for example, 5% flow capacity. Since the seal <b>212</b> does not contact the disc <b>210</b> there is no resulting friction in the “typical” operating range. Thus, an actuator (not shown) will not be affected by breakaway friction.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The foregoing detailed description is to be clearly understood as being given by way of illustration of the preferred embodiments of this invention. Various modifications and additions can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. For example, a flat plate disc is shown, but other shapes and sizes of discs, such as cylinders, voids, or hemispherical plates can be substituted where appropriate. Further, the seal structures described herein may be manufactured from PTFE or a variety of reinforced PTFE materials, including but not limited to: carbon filled PTFE, glass filled PTFE, PEEK filled PTFE, DYNEON™, TFM™ and polyethylene (ultra high modular weight). Likewise, each of the components described herein can be constructed as a fixed portion of the valve easing or can be made adjustable and removable. Accordingly, this description is meant to be taken only by way of example and not to otherwise limit the scope of the invention. The spirit and scope of the present invention are limited solely by the claims.</p>
