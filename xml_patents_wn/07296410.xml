<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the generation of power from solar energy, and, in particular, relates to a solar power system having both trough and tower solar absorption devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2) Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two conventional solar power generation systems are the trough- and tower-type solar-powered electrical generation plants. In a trough solar power plant <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pump <b>12</b> circulates a heat transfer fluid such as hydrocarbon or synthetic oil through a fluid circuit <b>14</b> including a plurality of pipes <b>16</b> and trough receivers <b>18</b>. Each trough receiver <b>18</b> includes an absorber tube for circulating the heat transfer fluid and an evacuated glass cylinder that surrounds, and thereby insulates, the tube. Parabolic sun-tracking mirrors <b>20</b>, referred to as collectors, are configured to reflect sunlight toward the receivers <b>18</b> to heat the fluid therein. The heated fluid is then delivered to a steam generator <b>22</b>, in which thermal energy is exchanged from the heat transfer fluid to water circulating in a separate fluid circuit <b>24</b>. The heat transfer fluid is thereby cooled in the steam generator <b>22</b> and can then be re-circulated to the receivers <b>18</b> for reheating. The water heated in the steam generator <b>22</b> forms steam that is circulated to a turbine generator <b>26</b>, i.e., a turbine <b>28</b> coupled to an electrical generator <b>30</b>. The steam expands and rotates the turbine <b>28</b> and the generator <b>30</b> and thus produces electricity. The steam can be passed through a condenser <b>32</b> that, in conjunction with a cooling tower <b>34</b>, condenses the steam to form hot water that is further heated in a preheater <b>33</b> and can be circulated back to the steam generator <b>22</b> by a pump <b>36</b> for re-use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pipes <b>16</b> and receivers <b>18</b> of the circuit <b>14</b> containing the heat transfer fluid lose thermal energy to the environment. The loss of energy generally increases as the temperature of the heat transfer fluid is increased beyond the ambient temperature. Thermal losses from the fluid circuit <b>14</b> can be reduced by insulating the pipes <b>16</b> and coating the receivers <b>18</b> with a selective coating, i.e., a material characterized by a low emissivity that maintains high thermal absorptivity. However, conventional selective coatings are destroyed by prolonged exposure to excessive temperatures. To avoid destruction of the selective coating, the heat transfer fluid in a trough solar power plant <b>10</b> is typically only heated to a maximum temperature of about 750° F. or less, thereby limiting the temperature of the steam generated to about 700° F. The maximum operation temperature is also limited according to the oil or other heat transfer fluid that is used, as conventional oil fluids break down or undergo phase changes at temperature above about 750° F. Turbine generators operate at higher efficiencies at higher operating temperatures, and typically operate at an efficiency of about 32% for the typical operating temperature of a trough solar power plant.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Higher operating temperatures can be achieved in a tower-type solar power plant <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in which the heat transfer fluid is circulated to a tower <b>42</b> that includes an absorption device, also referred to as a receiver <b>44</b>. The receiver <b>44</b> of the tower <b>42</b> includes serpentine tubes that receive the heat transfer fluid. A plurality of heliostats <b>46</b> are configured to reflect sunlight toward the receiver <b>44</b>, thereby heating the fluid within. Each heliostat <b>46</b> is a sun-tracking mirror configured to change position according to the direction of the sun <b>106</b> so that the heliostats <b>46</b> reflect solar energy onto the receiver <b>44</b> despite the continuous movement of the sun <b>106</b>. The heat transfer fluid is delivered from the tower <b>42</b> to a steam generator <b>48</b>, where thermal energy is exchanged to water, forming steam and generating electricity as described above using a turbine <b>50</b> and electrical generator <b>52</b>. The steam is then condensed in a condenser <b>54</b> with the use of a cooling tower <b>56</b>, and the water is preheated in a preheater <b>55</b> and re-circulated to the steam generator <b>48</b>. Pumps <b>58</b> can be used to circulate the heat transfer fluid and the water in the respective fluid circuits, and tanks <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> can be used to store the heat transfer fluid before and after heating by the receiver <b>44</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The surface area of the receiver <b>44</b> of the tower solar power plant <b>40</b> is typically significantly less than the surface area of the receivers <b>18</b> of the trough solar power plant <b>10</b>. Thus, the receiver <b>44</b> of the tower-type solar power plant <b>40</b> generally suffers less heat loss than the receivers <b>18</b> of the trough solar power plant <b>10</b>, even without the use of low emissivity coatings, and despite operation at higher temperatures to about 1050° F. Further, since the tower <b>42</b> can typically heat the heat transfer fluid to higher temperatures, steam can be heated to about 1000° F. The heat transfer fluid can be a molten salt, which is chemically stable to temperatures of 1100° F. and has a high boiling point. However, such salts generally have freezing temperatures greater than those of oils typically used in trough solar power plants. Therefore, if sufficient solar power is not available for heating the molten salt, the fluid is typically electrically heated or drained from the receiver <b>44</b> to prevent the salt from solidifying therein.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The higher steam temperature associated with the operation of the tower solar power plant <b>40</b> allows the turbine <b>50</b> and electrical generator <b>52</b> to operate at a higher efficiency than that achieved with the lower temperatures associated with the trough solar power plant <b>10</b>. Thus, the tower solar power plant <b>40</b> can achieve a higher overall efficiency, but the trough solar power plant <b>10</b> costs less to operate at low operating temperatures, i.e., up to about 750° F.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, there exists a need for an improved solar-powered power generation system. Preferably, the system should be capable of heating a transfer fluid to high operating temperatures typically associated with tower solar power plants. The system should also provide inexpensive heating of the transfer fluid, as is associated with typical trough solar power plants.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a solar-powered power generation system and an associated method. The system includes at least one trough solar absorption device for heating a heat transfer fluid, such as a molten salt, to a first temperature, and a tower solar absorption device for further heating the transfer fluid to a second temperature. Thus, the generation system can cost effectively and efficiently heat the transfer fluid to high temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment of the present invention of the solar-powered power generation system, each trough solar absorption device has a receiver defining a passage for receiving the heat transfer fluid and a solar collector, such as a parabolic mirror, configured to direct solar radiation toward the receiver to heat the heat transfer fluid therein. The tower solar absorption device, which is configured to receive the heat transfer fluid from the trough solar absorption devices, also includes a receiver for receiving the heat transfer fluid and a solar collector, such as one or more heliostats, configured to direct solar radiation toward the receiver to heat the heat transfer fluid. The fluid can be received from the tower solar absorption device by a power generator that removes thermal energy from the heat transfer fluid, thereby cooling the heat transfer fluid. For example, the power generator can include a steam generator that uses thermal energy from the heat transfer fluid to generate steam. The steam can be used to rotate a turbine and an electrical generator to generate electricity. In one embodiment, the heat transfer fluid is a molten salt, which can be heated to a first temperature in the trough devices, e.g., between about 650° F. and 850° F., then to a second, higher temperature in the tower device, e.g., between about 850° F. and 1100° F., before being cooled in the power generator to a third temperature, e.g., between about 450° F. and 650° F. The power generation system can also include storage tanks configured to receive the transfer fluid from and/or deliver the transfer fluid to the trough receivers, the tower receivers, and the power generator.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also includes a method of generating power using solar energy. According to one embodiment, the method includes delivering a heat transfer fluid through at least one trough solar absorption device, reflecting solar energy toward a receiver of the trough solar absorption device to heat the heat transfer fluid therein to a first temperature, delivering the heat transfer fluid from the trough solar absorption device to a tower solar absorption device, and reflecting solar energy toward a receiver of the tower solar absorption device to heat the heat transfer fluid therein to a second, higher temperature. The heated fluid is delivered to a power generator where the heat transfer fluid is cooled, e.g., to generate steam using thermal energy from the heat transfer fluid. The steam can be used to rotate a turbine and generate electricity. In one embodiment of the present invention, the trough solar absorption device can heat the fluid to a temperature of between about 650° F. and 850° F., the tower solar absorption device can heat the fluid to a temperature of between about 850° F. and 1100° F., and the power generator can cool the fluid to a temperature of between about 450° F. and 650° F.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, this invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the figures and, in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a solar-powered power generation system <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>100</b> generally includes a fluid circuit <b>102</b> for circulating a heat transfer fluid through at least one trough solar absorption device <b>108</b> and subsequently through a tower solar absorption device <b>120</b>, so that the heat transfer fluid is heated in at least a two-stage operation. It will be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> can define a variety of configurations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrating only one exemplary configuration. The fluid circuit <b>102</b> can be formed of a network of pipes, tubes, or other passage-defining components, and the system <b>100</b> can include components in addition to those shown, e.g., reservoirs, valves, and other devices for accommodating and controlling the flow of the heat transfer fluid. For example, one or more pumps <b>104</b> can be provided at various positions in the system <b>100</b> for fluidly circulating the heat transfer fluid. Valves <b>103</b> or other flow regulation devices can be used to control the flow of fluid through the various portions of the fluid circuit <b>102</b>. Further, the operation of the system <b>100</b> can be controlled by a controller, such as a computer, programmable logic controller, or other electrical processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various types of heat transfer fluids can be used with the system <b>100</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the heat transfer fluid is a molten salt and, in particular, a nitrate salt including about 60% sodium nitrate and about 40% potassium nitrate. This nitrate salt is generally useful in a temperature range of about 450° F. to 1100° F. At temperatures below about 450° F., the salt begins to solidify, increasing the resistance to flow. At temperatures above about 1100° F., the salt begins to react chemically to form nitrites, which are generally more corrosive than the nitrate salt. Within the range of 450° F.-1100° F., the nitrate salt generally exists as a single phase, i.e., a liquid, such that density of the fluid is substantially uniform throughout the operation of the system <b>100</b>. Alternative heat transfer fluids include other liquid salts as well as oils and other fluids. The heat transfer fluids can be selected according to the desired and anticipated temperature variation of the fluid in the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fluid is circulated through the circuit <b>102</b> from a cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b> to a plurality of trough solar absorption devices <b>108</b>. Any number of the trough devices <b>108</b> can be provided, and the trough devices <b>108</b> can be arranged in parallel and/or series configurations so that the heat transfer fluid is heated contemporaneously and/or consecutively in the different devices <b>108</b>. The trough devices <b>108</b>, which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, are configured to collect solar energy and reflect the solar energy to be absorbed by the heat transfer fluid. For example, each trough device <b>108</b> includes a receiver <b>110</b> that defines a passage <b>114</b> for receiving the heat transfer fluid as the fluid is circulated through the system <b>100</b>. Each of the trough devices <b>108</b> also includes a solar collector <b>116</b> that is configured to direct solar radiation toward the receiver <b>110</b> to heat the heat transfer fluid therein. For example, the solar collector <b>116</b> can include one or more mirrors, such as the parabolic mirrors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, that reflect light from the sun <b>106</b> toward the receivers <b>110</b>. The solar collectors <b>116</b> can be adjustable in position and configuration so that the solar collectors <b>116</b> can follow the sun <b>106</b> during the sun's relative movement so that solar energy from the sun <b>106</b> is reflected toward the receivers <b>110</b> regardless of the relative position of the sun <b>106</b>. For example, each solar collector <b>116</b> can be rotatably mounted on a stationary base <b>117</b> or other structure and rotatably adjusted by one or more motors or other actuation devices in response to a detector or sensor that tracks the relative position of the sun <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the solar collectors <b>116</b> can be adjusted according to a preprogrammed algorithm or otherwise predetermined schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other embodiments of the present invention, the trough devices <b>108</b> can include other types of solar collectors <b>116</b>. For example, the solar collectors <b>116</b> can include a lens, such as a fresnel lens, in addition or alternative to the parabolic mirror. Further, each solar collector <b>116</b> can include secondary parabolic mirrors, and the secondary parabolic mirrors and/or the lenses can be configured to heat the receivers <b>110</b> at varying rates for preheating the receivers <b>110</b> before the fluid is circulated and/or thawing solidified fluid in the receivers <b>110</b>. Solar collection devices that include multiple mirrors, lenses, and combinations of mirrors and lenses are described further in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/731,951, titled “Solar Collector and Method,” filed number for the missing information concurrently herewith and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and the contents of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The receivers <b>110</b> of the trough devices <b>108</b> typically include an absorber tube <b>112</b> or other fluid reservoir or conduit, which is surrounded by a glass tube <b>118</b> that extends concentrically around the absorber tube <b>112</b>. A space <b>119</b> is defined between the inner surface <b>111</b> of the glass tube <b>118</b> and the outer surface <b>113</b> of the absorber tube <b>112</b>, and the space <b>119</b> can be evacuated to increase the effective insulation of the glass tube <b>118</b> by reducing conduction to the glass tube <b>118</b> and convection from the outer surface <b>113</b> of the absorber tube <b>112</b>. Solar radiation reflected from each solar collector <b>116</b> is transmitted through the glass tubes <b>118</b> to impinge on the absorber tubes <b>112</b>. The evacuated space <b>119</b> and, hence, the glass tubes <b>118</b>, reduce the loss of heat from receiver <b>110</b> to the ambient environment. Further, the absorber tubes <b>112</b> can be painted or otherwise coated to increase the absorption of solar radiation. For example, the absorber tubes <b>112</b> can be spray painted with flat black or other dark high temperature paint to increase the thermal absorptivity of the receivers <b>110</b>. Further, selective coatings can be applied to outer surfaces <b>113</b> of the absorber tubes <b>112</b> for increasing the absorptivity and reducing the emissivity or radiation loss of the receivers <b>110</b>; however, such selective coatings are typically stable only to temperatures of about 750° F. In some embodiments of the invention, the receivers <b>110</b> can be provided without the glass tubes <b>118</b> or with other insulating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, the trough solar absorption devices <b>108</b> are structured to heat the heat transfer fluid circulated therethrough. For example, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the heat transfer fluid enters the trough solar absorption devices <b>108</b> at a temperature between about 450° F. and 650° F., such as about 550° F., and exits the trough devices <b>108</b> at a temperature between about 650° F. and 850° F., such as about 800° F. In some embodiments, the trough devices <b>108</b> can heat the fluid by about 250° F. or more.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the heat transfer fluid flows from the trough solar absorption devices <b>108</b> to the one or more tower solar absorption devices <b>120</b>. Typically, the heat transfer fluid exits the trough solar absorption devices <b>108</b> heated to a temperature that is higher than the ambient conditions and higher than the temperature of the fluid in the cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b>. An intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b> can be provided in fluid connection with the trough and tower solar absorption devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> so that the intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b> can receive heated fluid from the trough devices <b>108</b> and hold the fluid until such time as when circulation to the tower device <b>120</b> is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tower solar absorption device <b>120</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, includes a tube-type receiver <b>124</b>, which can be formed of a tube, reservoir, or other conduit defining a passage for receiving and circulating the heat transfer fluid. The receiver <b>124</b> is supported by an elevated tower structure <b>121</b>, which can be several hundred feet high. The receiver <b>124</b> can be configured according to the particular fluid and heating specifications of the solar-powered power generation system <b>100</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the receiver <b>124</b> in the tower <b>120</b> is fluidly connected by pipes <b>122</b> or other fluid conduits that provide a single fluid circuit extending from an inlet <b>123</b> at the bottom of the tower structure <b>121</b> to the receiver <b>124</b> at the top of the structure <b>121</b> and then to an outlet <b>125</b> at the bottom of the structure <b>121</b>. The pipes <b>122</b> can extend in a relatively direct path between the receiver <b>124</b> and the inlet <b>123</b> and outlet <b>125</b>, while the tube of the receiver <b>124</b> can be configured in a circuitous or serpentine path to provide a greater surface area for receiving radiation directed thereto. In some embodiments of the present invention, the receiver <b>124</b> and/or the pipes <b>122</b> can provide multiple fluid paths in series and/or parallel configurations. The size of the receiver <b>124</b> can also correspond to the flow and heat requirements of the system <b>100</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the receiver <b>124</b> can be formed of tubes that are less than about 1 inch in diameter. The tubes of the receiver <b>124</b> can be formed of a variety of materials, preferably a material that can be operated for extended periods of time at temperatures of at least about 750° F. and, in some cases, about 1100° F., such as a high carbon, super alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tower solar absorption device <b>120</b> also includes at least one solar collector <b>126</b> configured to direct solar radiation toward the receiver <b>124</b>. For example, the solar collectors <b>126</b> can be heliostats arranged proximate to the tower structure <b>121</b>. Hundreds or thousands of heliostats or other collectors <b>126</b> can be positioned to reflect solar radiation for heating fluid in the tower device <b>120</b>. Each heliostat can include a planar or curved mirror <b>127</b> for reflecting solar radiation toward the receiver <b>124</b> in the tower device <b>120</b>, and each heliostat can be independently adjustable in response to the relative position of the sun <b>106</b>. For example, the heliostats can be arranged in arrays, the heliostats of each array being controlled separately or in combination with the other heliostats of the array by one or more control devices configured to detect and track the relative position of the sun <b>106</b>. Thus, the heliostats can adjust according to the position of the sun <b>106</b> to reflect sunlight onto the receiver <b>124</b>, thereby warming the heat transfer fluid in the receiver <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The tower solar absorption device <b>120</b> is structured to heat the fluid to a temperature higher than the temperature of the fluid in the trough devices <b>108</b>. For example, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the heat transfer fluid enters the tower device <b>120</b> from the trough devices <b>108</b> or the intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b> at a temperature between about 650° F. and 850° F., such as about 800° F., and exits the tower device <b>120</b> at a temperature between about 850° F. and 1100° F., such as about 1050° F. In some embodiments, the tower device <b>120</b> can heat the fluid by about 250° F. or more. Advantageously, the tower device <b>120</b> can heat the fluid to a temperature at which thermal energy in the fluid can be efficiently converted to electrical energy. For example, if the fluid temperature is increased to about 1050° F., the fluid can be cooled to about 550° F. and electricity can be produced by a conventional turbine generator with an efficiency of about 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, the heat transfer fluid can be heated in a multi-stage operation, first being heated in one or more of the trough devices <b>108</b> and then heated to a higher temperature in one or more of the tower devices <b>120</b>. As noted above, each of the solar absorption devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> can be configured to heat the heat transfer fluid to various temperatures depending on the available solar energy, the desired minimum or maximum operation temperatures of the heat transfer fluid and the system devices, the total desired thermal energy in the heat transfer fluid, and the efficiency of each of the system devices. For example, the trough devices <b>108</b> can be operated in a temperature range at which the trough devices <b>108</b> can most economically convert solar radiation to thermal energy in the heat transfer fluid. The tower device <b>120</b> can most efficiently then further heat the heat transfer fluid to achieve a desired temperature, such as a temperature at which the thermal energy of the heat transfer fluid can be converted to electrical energy or otherwise used as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The heat transfer fluid flows from the exit <b>125</b> of the tower device <b>120</b> to a hot thermal storage tank <b>150</b>. When required, the heat transfer fluid is pumped from the hot thermal storage tank <b>150</b> to a power generator <b>160</b>. The power generator <b>160</b> can include a variety of devices for removing or otherwise using the thermal energy of the heat transfer fluid. For example, the power generator <b>160</b> can be a conventional steam generator for transferring thermal energy from the heat transfer fluid to a separate fluid circuit holding water to thereby generate steam from the water. The steam can be delivered to a turbine <b>162</b> to rotate the turbine <b>162</b> and an electrical generator <b>164</b> coupled to the turbine <b>162</b>. A condenser/preheater and cooling tower (not shown) can be used downstream of the turbine to condense and cool the steam for recirculation, as is known to those skilled in the art. Thus, the thermal energy of the heat transfer fluid can be converted to electrical energy that can be transmitted and distributed, e.g., by conventional electrical transmission devices and a distribution grid. Alternatively, the power generator <b>160</b> can be a heat exchanging device that generates a hot working fluid, such as steam, that can be delivered for heating purposes, such as for heating buildings or for industrial process heating. For example, the steam can be used as a heat source for conventional manufacturing processes or for water desalination.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The heat transfer fluid is cooled in the power generator <b>160</b> to an acceptable temperature before entering the cold storage tank <b>130</b> and subsequently the heat transfer fluid enters the trough solar absorption devices <b>108</b>, e.g., between about 450° F. and 650° F. such as about 550° F. The heat transfer fluid can be circulated back to the cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b> and/or the trough devices <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid is delivered from the power generator <b>160</b> to the trough devices <b>108</b> without passing through the cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b>, such that the heat transfer fluid can be reheated directly. In other embodiments, the heat transfer fluid can be stored in the cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b> before being reheated and re-circulated though system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each tank <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> is insulated to minimize thermal losses to the environment. Some thermal energy will be lost to the environment, though the change in the temperature of the fluid due to such losses will be minimal unless the fluid is stored for extended periods of time. In one embodiment of the present invention, the heat transfer fluid is heated and delivered to the intermediate and hot storage tanks <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> and stored in the tanks <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> for subsequent power generation or reheating. For example, if sufficient solar radiation is available for heating fluid from the trough devices <b>108</b> and/or the intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b>, the fluid can be heated in the tower device <b>120</b>. The tower device <b>120</b> is designed to heat more fluid than that which is necessary for generating the desired amount of power in the power generator <b>160</b>, and this excess fluid is stored in the hot thermal storage tank <b>150</b>. Subsequently, if the tower device <b>120</b> is unable to heat fluid for generating the desired power in the power generator <b>160</b>, i.e., during nighttime, cloud cover, and the like, the hot fluid from the storage tank <b>150</b> can be delivered to the generator <b>160</b>. Thus, the hot thermal storage tank <b>150</b> allows the timing of power generation to be shifted from the time of the absorption of solar energy, thereby allowing power to be generated during night or other periods of relative darkness, during maintenance of the system components, and the like. Additionally, power can be generated according to the need for or current market value of electricity, or according to other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similarly, heat transfer fluid that is heated in the trough devices <b>108</b> can be stored in the intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b> for subsequent circulation through and/or heating in the tower device <b>120</b>. For example, if the trough devices <b>108</b> are operating and the tower device <b>120</b> is not operational, if the trough devices <b>108</b> are heating more fluid than the tower device <b>120</b>, or if subsequent nonoperability of the trough devices <b>108</b> is anticipated during a period of planned operation of the tower device <b>120</b>, some or all of the fluid from the trough devices <b>108</b> can be delivered to the intermediate storage tank <b>140</b>. The use of the intermediate storage tank <b>140</b> is optional; however, a loss in plant operability as described previously may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b> can also be used to receive fluid from the power generator <b>160</b> even if the trough and/or tower devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> are not being operated. For example, if heat transfer fluid from the hot thermal storage tank <b>150</b> is used for operation of the power generator <b>160</b> when the trough and tower devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> are not operated, such as at night or during maintenance of the devices, as described above, the fluid can be delivered from the power generator <b>160</b> to the cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, the operation of the power generator <b>160</b> need not be restricted to those times when solar energy is available for heating the fluid. Therefore, the system <b>100</b> is characterized by improved dispatchability, i.e., increased flexibility to dispatch power therefrom according to a desired schedule. In some embodiments, the trough and tower devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> have sufficient capacity to heat enough fluid during a daytime when solar energy is available such that the fluid can be used to operate the power generator <b>160</b> during nighttime when solar energy is not available. Thus, the system <b>100</b> can be operated continuously during daytime and nighttime. In other embodiments, the power generator <b>160</b> can be operated to generate power when power is required or when power prices are high, and operation can be slowed or stopped when power is not needed or when power prices are low. For example, the system <b>100</b> can operate to heat the fluid according to the availability of sunlight, with power being generated according to a current or anticipated desire for or market value of electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If there is insufficient solar radiation for heating the heat transfer fluid in the trough and/or tower solar absorption devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b>, such as at night or other times of darkness, the fluid can continue to circulate through the devices or the fluid can be drained therefrom. To reduce heat loss and preclude freezing, for example, the heat transfer fluid can be drained from the tower device <b>120</b> to the hot thermal storage tank <b>150</b> and/or the intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b>. The fluid in the trough devices <b>108</b> can be drained to the intermediate thermal storage tank <b>140</b> and/or the cold thermal storage tank <b>130</b>. Depending on the size and configuration of the tower and trough devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b>, the fluid can be drained within a relatively short time. For example, in some embodiments, the fluid can be drained from the trough devices <b>108</b> in a few minutes and from the tower device <b>120</b> in less than a minute. The devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> can also be drained at other times when the devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> are not heating the fluid, such as during times of maintenance, poor weather, and the like. Alternatively, during periods when the trough and/or tower solar absorption devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> are not heating the fluid or not substantially heating the fluid, the fluid can continue to circulate through the devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b>. For example, if solar radiation is not available due to cloud cover or other weather or atmospheric conditions, the circulation of fluid can be continued until solar radiation is again available or a decision is made to interrupt operation. Further, heaters can be provided for heating the fluid in the storage tanks <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, and components of the absorption devices <b>108</b>, <b>120</b> to maintain minimum operating temperatures throughout the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The operations for generating power using solar energy according to one embodiment of the present invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It is understood that some of the illustrated operations can be omitted from the method and additional operations can be performed without departing from the scope of this invention. As shown in Block <b>200</b>, the heat transfer fluid is delivered through at least one trough solar absorption device. Solar energy is reflected toward the receiver to heat the heat transfer fluid to a first temperature. See Block <b>210</b>. Thereafter, the heat transfer fluid is delivered to a tower absorption device. See Block <b>220</b>. Solar energy is reflected toward the receiver of the tower solar absorption device to heat the heat transfer fluid to a second temperature, which is higher than the first temperature. See Block <b>230</b>. Next, the heat transfer fluid is delivered from the tower solar absorption device to a power generator. See Block <b>240</b>. For example, the power generator can include a steam generator in which thermal energy from the heat transfer fluid is used to generate steam. See Block <b>250</b>. The heat transfer fluid can be returned from the power generator to the trough solar absorption device to complete a closed fluid cycle. The steam can be used to rotate a turbine and generate electricity or other purposes, as discussed above. See Block <b>260</b>. Subsequently, the steam from the turbine can be condensed and returned as water to the steam generator to complete a closed fluid cycle.</p>
