<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a motor, a control circuit member of the motor and a manufacturing method of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A motor of, for example, a power window system includes a motor main body, a speed reducing unit and a control circuit member. The motor main body generates a rotational force. The speed reducing unit includes a speed reducing mechanism, which is received in a gear housing and decelerates a rotational speed of the motor main body. The control circuit member includes electrical circuit components (e.g., an IC), which control the rotation of the motor main body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of one such motor, the motor main body and the speed reducing unit are assembled together to form an intermediate assembly of the motor main body and the speed reducing unit, and the control circuit member is installed into the gear housing through a receiving hole, which is formed in the gear housing (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,245,258). Various types of control circuit members, each of which has a different set of electrical circuit components, can be installed to the intermediate assembly (without the control circuit member) of the motor main body and the speed reducing unit. More specifically, the intermediate assembly (without the control circuit member) of the motor main body and the speed reducing unit is made as a universal component (a versatile component), and various types of motors (each having the different set of the electrical circuit components) can be made with such a universal component by simply changing the control circuit member. As a result, the manufacturing costs can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the above motor, the connector arrangement is provided in the control circuit member. The external connector is fitted to the connector arrangement of the control circuit member, and the electrical circuit components of the control circuit member are electrically connected to a power source through the connector arrangement and the external connector. When the connector arrangement is provided to the control circuit member, the position of the connector arrangement is limited by the securing position of the control circuit member. The securing position of the control circuit member is, in turn, limited by various factors due to the fact that the control circuit member needs to be installed into the gear housing. Thus, in some cases, the connector arrangement cannot be placed to a desired position. For instance, a normal motor (i.e., a motor without the control circuit member) is often used as a drive source of the power window system and is secured to a securing member of a vehicle door. In one type of normal motor, the connector arrangement is provided on a lateral side of a connection between a yoke housing of the motor main body and the gear housing at a location adjacent to a brush holder. When this type of normal motor needs to be replaced with the above type of motor having the control circuit member with the connector arrangement, the above type of motor cannot be simply installed to the preexisting securing member of the vehicle door. That is, the securing member also needs to be replaced with a corresponding one. Furthermore, the securing position of the control circuit member (the securing structure, such as the receiving hole) is limited by the position of the connector arrangement. Thus, in some cases, the control circuit member cannot be placed to the desired position (e.g., a dead space in the gear housing).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention addresses the above disadvantages. Thus, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a motor, which includes a control circuit member and provides more freedom with respect to a position of a connector arrangement. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a control circuit member of such a motor. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a manufacturing method of such a motor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the objectives of the present invention, there is provided a motor having a motor main body and a speed reducing unit. The motor main body includes a brush holder. The brush holder has a connector arrangement that is directly connectable with an external connector to receive electric power. The brush holder holds a plurality of power supply brushes. The speed reducing unit includes a gear housing, a speed reducing mechanism and a control circuit member. The gear housing is connected to the motor main body and includes a circuit member installation opening. The installation opening opens in a direction away from the brush holder. The speed reducing mechanism is received in the gear housing and decelerates rotation of the motor main body. The control circuit member is installed in the gear housing through the installation opening of the gear housing. The control circuit member controls the rotation of the motor main body and is electrically connected to the connector arrangement and the power supply brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the objectives of the present invention, there is also provided a control circuit member for a motor, which includes a motor main body and a speed reducing unit. The motor main body includes a connector arrangement and a plurality of power supply brushes, and the connector arrangement is connectable with an external connector to receive electric power. The control circuit member includes an elongated base, a plurality of connection terminals and a plurality of electrical circuit components. The connection terminals are secured to the base. At least one of the plurality of connection terminals is electrically connectable to the connector arrangement, and at least another one of the plurality of connection terminals is electrically connectable to at least one of the plurality of power supply brushes. The electrical circuit components are secured to the base and control rotation of the motor main body. The plurality of electrical circuit components includes a rotation sensor that senses the rotation of the motor main body. The rotation sensor is displaced away from the rest of the plurality of electrical circuit components in a direction perpendicular to a plane of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the objectives of the present invention, there is also provided a method for manufacturing a motor. According to the method, a brush holder is installed to a motor main body. The brush holder has a connector arrangement that is directly connectable with an external connector to receive electric power, and the brush holder holds a plurality of power supply brushes. The motor main body and a speed reducing unit are assembled together. A control circuit member is installed into a gear housing of the speed reducing unit through a circuit member installation opening of the gear housing, which opens in a direction away from the brush holder. Each of a plurality of connection terminals of the control circuit member is connected to a corresponding one of the power supply brushes and the connector arrangement.</p>

Furthermore, the brush holder <b>7</b> has a holder main body <b>7</b><i>a</i>, a protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b </i>and a connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>, which are formed integrally. The holder main body <b>7</b><i>a </i>is formed to be substantially received in an opening of the yoke <b>4</b>. A bearing <b>9</b> is secured in a central hole of the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a</i>. A distal end of a rotatable shaft <b>10</b> of the armature <b>6</b> is rotatably supported by the bearing <b>9</b>. The brushes <b>8</b> are slidably held by corresponding portions of the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a</i>, which are located inside the yoke <b>4</b>. The brushes <b>8</b> are urged against a commutator <b>11</b> of the armature <b>6</b>, which is secured to the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. The protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b </i>is made in a form of a flange, which extends radially outward from the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>is provided to a distal end of the protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>is formed in one end of the protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b</i>, which extends in s direction parallel to a flat surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>(a surface that is parallel to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b>) of the yoke <b>4</b>. An external connector (not shown) is connectable to the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>in a direction perpendicular to the flat surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>(i.e., the direction, which is perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b> and which extends into the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b> from the front side of the plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> and connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b> are insert molded into the brush holder <b>7</b>. The brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> extend from corresponding portions of the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a</i>, which are located inside the yoke <b>4</b>, to the protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b</i>. The distal ends of the brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> form internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>.

The brushes <b>8</b> are electrically connected to the base ends of the brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> by pigtails, respectively. The connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b> extend from the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>to the protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b</i>.

The base ends of the connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b> are exposed at the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>and form external connection terminals <b>13</b><i>b</i>. When the external connector is connected to the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>, the external connection terminals <b>13</b><i>b </i>are electrically connected to corresponding terminals of the external connector. A choke coil C, which is received in the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>, is interposed between the internal connection terminals <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the external connection terminals <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b> of the present embodiment. The internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>are arranged parallel to one another in the direction (the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) perpendicular to the flat surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>(or a plane of a worm wheel <b>23</b> described below), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Since the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>are arranged parallel to one another in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, only one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the brush holder <b>7</b>, the outer peripheral surface of the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a</i>, the protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the connector arrangement (the portion that corresponds to the choke coil C) <b>7</b><i>c </i>are covered with a waterproof member <b>14</b>, which is made of elastomer, except the portion of the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>where the external connection terminals <b>13</b><i>b </i>are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The speed reducing unit <b>3</b> has a gear housing <b>21</b>, a worm shaft <b>22</b>, the worm wheel <b>23</b>, a clutch <b>24</b>, a control circuit member <b>25</b> and a cover <b>26</b>. In the present embodiment, the worm shaft <b>22</b> and the worm wheel <b>23</b> constitute a speed reducing mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The gear housing <b>21</b> is made of a resin material. The gear housing <b>21</b> has a fixing portion <b>21</b><i>a</i>, a worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>and a circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fixing portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>has a shape, which corresponds to a flange <b>4</b><i>b </i>that is formed around the opening of the yoke <b>4</b>. The fixing portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the flange <b>4</b><i>b </i>by screws <b>27</b>. The protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the brush holder <b>7</b> is clamped between the fixing portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the flange <b>4</b><i>b </i>via the waterproof member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>is formed into a cylindrical body, which extends along an imaginary extension line of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. The worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>rotatably supports the worm shaft <b>22</b> therein. The clutch <b>24</b> is provided to the motor main body <b>2</b> side in the interior of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The clutch <b>24</b> couples between the worm shaft <b>22</b> and the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> to transmit a driving force. The clutch <b>24</b> transmits the driving force of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> to the worm shaft <b>22</b>. However, the clutch <b>24</b> is operated to lock the worm shaft <b>22</b> and thereby to limit transmission of the drive force from the worm shaft <b>22</b> to the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. Thus, the clutch <b>24</b> is provided to limit the rotation of the motor <b>1</b>, which is caused by the force transmitted from the load side (e.g., the window glass) of the power window system. Furthermore, a sensor magnet <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided to the clutch <b>24</b> to rotate integrally with the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>.</p>

Furthermore, the worm wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>rotatably supports the worm wheel <b>23</b> therein. The interior of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>and the interior of the wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>are communicated to each other at a connection therebetween. The worm shaft <b>22</b> and the worm wheel <b>23</b> are meshed with each other in that connection. The wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>is formed on the opposite side (i.e., the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b>) of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>, which is opposite to the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>. A flat surface <b>21</b><i>e </i>of the wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>is parallel to the plane of the worm wheel <b>23</b>, which is perpendicular to a rotational axis of the worm wheel <b>23</b>. Furthermore, the flat surface <b>21</b><i>e </i>of the wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>is also parallel to the flat surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the yoke <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the gear housing <b>21</b> is viewed as a whole, a plane, which extends parallel to the flat surface <b>21</b><i>e </i>(the plane of the worm wheel <b>23</b>), serves as a flat surface or a plane of the gear housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>is positioned to correspond to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>are disposed inside the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d</i>. More specifically, the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>is placed on the opposite side of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d</i>, which is opposite to the wheel receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>is located between the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>and the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>. The interior of the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>is communicated with a portion (specifically, a portion that corresponds to the sensor magnet <b>24</b><i>a</i>) of the interior of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>, which is located on the motor main body <b>2</b> side of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>has a receiving hole (or a receiving space) <b>21</b><i>f</i>, into which the control circuit member <b>25</b> is insertable in a direction (an installing direction) parallel to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> to place the control circuit member <b>25</b> in the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d</i>. The receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>has a circuit member installation opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>. In the gear housing <b>21</b>, the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>opens in a direction away from the brush holder <b>7</b>. In this particular example, an outer edge of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>extends linearly. A direction (hereinafter, simply referred to as an opening direction of the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>), which is perpendicular to the linear outer edge of the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>, is slanted, i.e., is angled relative to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> (i.e., of the motor main body <b>2</b>) and is also relative to the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, when viewed in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface or plane of the gear housing <b>21</b>, the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>extends linearly and smoothly without forming a step along an imaginary straight line that connects between the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>and the distal end of the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>(the end opposite to the motor main body <b>2</b>). The internal connection terminal <b>12</b><i>a </i>of each brush side electrical conductor <b>12</b> and the internal connection terminal <b>13</b><i>a </i>of each connector side electrical conductor <b>13</b> are positioned to be visible through the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>when viewed from the outside of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>in the opening direction of the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>. An engaging claw <b>21</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is formed in the outer flat surface of the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d</i>. The control circuit member <b>25</b> is substantially received in the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3A</figref> to <b>3</b>C, the control circuit member <b>25</b> includes a base <b>31</b>, a heat sink <b>32</b>, a molded IC <b>33</b>, a capacitor <b>34</b>, a Hall element (a rotation sensor) <b>35</b> and a plurality of connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). In the present embodiment, the molded IC <b>33</b>, the capacitor <b>34</b> and the Hall element <b>35</b> are formed as electrical circuit components. The base <b>31</b> is made of a resin material and is formed into a plate shape. The molded IC <b>33</b> of a generally plate shape is secured to one side surface (the left side surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>3</b>B) of the base <b>31</b> through the heat sink <b>32</b> of a plate shape. The capacitor <b>34</b> of a generally a cylindrical shape is secured to the other side surface (the right side surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) of the base <b>31</b>. In the present embodiment, the heat sink <b>32</b> and the molded IC <b>33</b> are joined together by adhesive, bond or any other joining material. The Hall element <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) is secured to a portion of the one side surface (the left side surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>3</b>B) of the base <b>31</b>, which is positioned to correspond with the sensor magnet <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), which are electrically connected to the molded IC <b>33</b> or the like, are partially insert molded in a portion of the other side surface (the right surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>3</b>B) of the base <b>31</b>, which corresponds to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> and the internal connection terminals <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b>. In the present embodiment, the control circuit member <b>25</b> does not have a relay, which serves as a drive circuit part. Instead, the molded IC <b>33</b> internally includes a power MOSFET, which serves as the drive circuit part. The molded IC <b>33</b> forms a control circuit for controlling a pinching limiting operation. In the pinching limiting operation, when it is determined that an object is pinched by the window glass of the vehicle power window system based on, for example, a rotational speed of the sensor magnet <b>24</b><i>a </i>(the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>), which is measured through the Hall element <b>35</b>, the control circuit supplies reverse electric current to the brushes <b>8</b> (the motor main body <b>2</b>) to rotate the motor main body <b>2</b> in the reverse direction and thereby to lower the window glass for releasing the pinched object from the window glass. In the present embodiment, each connection terminal <b>36</b><i>a </i>has a relatively large width, which corresponds to the internal connection terminal <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the corresponding brush side electrical conductor <b>12</b>. Furthermore, each connection terminal <b>36</b><i>b </i>has a relatively small width, which corresponds to the internal connection terminal <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the corresponding connector side electrical conductor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a control circuit member installation step, the control circuit member <b>25</b> is installed into the gear housing <b>21</b> (the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d</i>) in the installing direction through the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>in the assembled state where the motor main body <b>2</b> and the speed reducing unit <b>3</b> are assembled together. At this time, the control circuit member <b>25</b> is press fitted into the gear housing <b>21</b>. More specifically, at the time of installation of the control circuit member <b>25</b>, lateral edges of the base <b>31</b> (the left and right lateral edges of the base <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) of the control circuit member <b>25</b> tightly and slidably contact opposed inner lateral walls of the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f</i>, which are spaced from one another in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this way, the position of the control circuit member <b>25</b> in the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>is stabilized after the installation of the control circuit member <b>25</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>is positioned to be electrically connectable to, i.e., is engaged with the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b> of the brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> (the brushes <b>8</b>) and the internal connection terminals <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b> (the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>). In this state, similar to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>is positioned to be visible through the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>when viewed from the outside of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>in the opening direction. Furthermore, in this state, similar to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>are arranged parallel to one another in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e </i>or the plane of the worm wheel <b>23</b>) of the gear housing <b>21</b> (the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the present embodiment, in a connecting step, each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, which are visible through the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>when viewed from the outside of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>in the opening direction, is laser welded to the corresponding one of the internal terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>to form an electrical connection therebetween. Here, it should be noted that the width of the internal connection terminal <b>12</b><i>a </i>of each brush side electrical conductor <b>12</b> is made smaller than the width of the corresponding connection terminal <b>36</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, to facilitate the laser welding for connecting therebetween. Furthermore, in this state, the molded IC <b>33</b> is positioned such that a flat surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the molded IC <b>33</b> extends in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b> (the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Also, in the present embodiment, in this state, a portion of the control circuit member <b>25</b> (a portion of the capacitor <b>34</b>) is disposed outside of the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>(the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A cover <b>26</b>, which is made of a resin material, is secured to the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>to close the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>upon the installation of the control circuit member <b>25</b>. The cover <b>26</b> is shaped to receive the portion of the control circuit member <b>25</b> (the portion of the capacitor <b>34</b>) and has an opening, which corresponds to the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>. The cover <b>26</b> has an engaging recess <b>26</b><i>a</i>, which is engaged with the engaging claw <b>21</b><i>h</i>. That is, when the cover <b>26</b> is installed in the axial direction, the engaging recess <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>26</b> is engaged with the engaging claw <b>21</b><i>h</i>, so that the cover <b>26</b> is held by the gear housing <b>21</b>. Furthermore, the cover <b>26</b> has an elastic seal member <b>26</b><i>b</i>, which seals a space between the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>(the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>) and the opening of the cover <b>26</b>. The seal member <b>26</b><i>b </i>is made of butyl rubber and is arranged along the entire perimeter of the opening of the cover <b>26</b>, which corresponds to the opening <b>21</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the assembled state where the motor main body <b>2</b> and the speed reducing unit <b>3</b> are assembled together, the control circuit member <b>25</b> is insertable in the gear housing <b>21</b> through the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>(the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>). Thus, in the motor <b>1</b>, various types of control circuit members <b>25</b>, each of which has a different set of electrical circuit components, can be installed to the intermediate assembly (having no control circuit member <b>25</b>) of the motor main body <b>2</b> and the speed reducing unit <b>3</b>. More specifically, the intermediate assembly (without the control circuit member <b>25</b>) of the motor main body <b>2</b> and the speed reducing unit <b>3</b> is made as a universal component, and various types of motors (each having the different set of the electrical circuit components) can be easily made through use of such a universal component by simply changing the control circuit member <b>25</b>. As a result, the management of the components is eased, and the manufacturing costs can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The motor <b>1</b> of the power window system is placed between an inner panel and an outer panel of a vehicle door, and the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the motor <b>1</b> is secured in opposed relationship to the inner panel. In this state, the external connector, which is connected to a power source (e.g., a vehicle battery), is installed to the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>(the external connection terminals <b>13</b><i>b</i>) from a door trim side through a connector hole of the inner panel. At this time, the connector hole is sealed by the portion of the waterproof member <b>14</b>, which corresponds to the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>. Thus, intrusion of liquid (e.g., water) to the door trim side through a space between the inner panel and the outer panel is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, characteristic advantages of the above embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(1) The connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>is provided to the brush holder <b>7</b> rather than to the control circuit member. Thus, the position of the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>is not limited by the securing position of the control circuit member <b>25</b>. More specifically, the securing position of the control circuit member <b>25</b> is often limited because of the fact that the control circuit member <b>25</b> is installed in the gear housing <b>21</b>. However, according to the present embodiment, the position of the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>can be set without being limited by this fact. Thus, the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>can be placed in a desired position. In this embodiment, this position is located on the lateral side of the connection between the yoke <b>4</b> and the gear housing <b>21</b> and is adjacent to the brush holder <b>7</b>. As a result, it is easy to replace the normal motor (i.e., the motor without the control circuit member), which has the connector arrangement that is located on the lateral side of the connection between the yoke and the gear housing and that is adjacent to the brush holder. More specifically, the normal motor can be replaced with the motor <b>1</b> of the present embodiment by simply installing the motor <b>1</b> to the preexisting inner panel (the securing member) without a need for changing the inner panel. Furthermore, the securing position (the securing structure) of the control circuit member <b>25</b> can be set without being limited by the position of the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>. Specifically, as in the present embodiment, the control circuit member <b>25</b> can be easily positioned in a dead space of the gear housing <b>21</b> between the worm receiving portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>and the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>. As a result, for example, downsizing of the motor <b>1</b> is possible. The control circuit member <b>25</b> has the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, which are electrically connected to the brushes <b>8</b> and the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>(the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>) after installation of the control circuit member <b>25</b> into the gear housing <b>21</b>. Thus, the brushes <b>8</b> and the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c </i>are easily connected to the electrical circuit components (e.g., the molded IC <b>33</b> and the like) of the control circuit member <b>25</b> in the installed state where the control circuit member <b>25</b> is installed into the gear housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(2) The cover <b>26</b>, which is made of the resin material and closes the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f</i>, includes the seal member <b>26</b><i>b </i>that seals between the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>(the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>) and the opening of the cover <b>26</b>. Thus, the control circuit member <b>25</b> (the electrical circuit components) is protected from the water.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(3) Similar to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>are arranged parallel to one another in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b>, i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>do not cause an increase in a size of the motor in the direction parallel to the flat surface of the gear housing <b>21</b>. Furthermore, due to the parallel arrangement of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, the connecting step, which is carried out through use of the laser welding, can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(4) The flat surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the molded IC <b>33</b> extends in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b>, i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, the molded IC <b>33</b> does not cause an increase in the size of the motor in the direction parallel to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The opening direction of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>(i.e., the direction that is perpendicular to the linear outer edge of the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>) of the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>is slanted, i.e., is angled relative to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> and also relative to the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. Similar to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>is positioned to be visible through the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>when viewed from the outside of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>in the opening direction of the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>. In this way, the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>is made into the simple shape having no step, and therefore it is relatively easy to visually check the operation of the laser welding of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and to visually check the connection made by the laser welding. The seal member <b>26</b><i>b </i>can be provided to the smooth part having not step around the opening of the cover <b>26</b>, and thereby the manufacturing of the seal member <b>26</b> is eased.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The above embodiment can be modified as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the above embodiment, the molded IC <b>33</b> is secured to the base <b>31</b> through the heat sink <b>32</b> of the plate shape. Alternatively, the cover can have a heat releasing portion, which, for example, contacts the control circuit member (the molded IC <b>33</b>) to release the heat at the outside of the cover. In this way, the thermal damage of the control circuit member (the electrical circuit components) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the above embodiment can be modified in a manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In contrast to the above embodiment, in a control circuit member <b>41</b> of this example, a molded IC <b>43</b> is secured to a base <b>42</b>, and a heat sink <b>44</b> is secured to the molded IC <b>43</b> by the adhesive, bond or any other joining material. Furthermore, a cover <b>45</b> is made of a metal material. The cover <b>45</b> has a resilient urging piece <b>46</b>, which is made of the metal material and serves as a contacting portion and a resiliently engaging portion. The urging piece <b>46</b> is urged against the molded IC <b>43</b> of the control circuit member <b>41</b> through the heat sink <b>44</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the urging piece <b>46</b> in a state before the urging (before the installation) is indicated by a solid line, and the urging piece <b>46</b> in the urged state is indicated by a dot-dot dash line. In this example, all of the cover <b>45</b> and the urging piece <b>46</b> cooperate together to form the heat releasing portion. In this way, the surface area of the heat releasing portion besides the heat sink <b>44</b> is increased. Thus, the thermal damage of the control circuit member <b>41</b> (the electrical circuit components) can be further reduced. Particularly, in the case where the electrical circuit components of the control circuit member <b>41</b> include the molded IC <b>43</b> that has the power MOSFET (serving as the drive circuit part), it is possible to reduce the damage of the power MOSFET, which is sensitive to the heat. Thus, the durability (reliability) of the molded IC <b>43</b> can be further improved. Furthermore, as described above, the heat releasing portion includes the urging piece <b>46</b>, which has the resiliency and is urged against the molded IC <b>43</b> through the heat sink <b>44</b>. Thus, the heat releasing portion can be easily and reliably engaged with the control circuit member <b>41</b> (specifically, the heat sink <b>44</b>) without requiring high dimensional accuracy and high assembling accuracy (i.e., allowing occurrence of some errors in the dimensional accuracy and/or in the assembling accuracy). Furthermore, the urging piece <b>46</b> can be resiliently deformed to follow the control circuit member <b>41</b>. Thus, even when the control circuit member <b>41</b> is vibrated, it is possible to limit damage to the control circuit member <b>41</b>, and also it is possible to maintain the engagement (heat radiating function) of the heat releasing portion to the control circuit member <b>41</b>. Since the cover <b>45</b> and the urging piece <b>46</b> are both made of the metal material, the heat radiation is effectively performed. Therefore, the above described thermal damage can be further reduced. Furthermore, it should be understood that the urging piece <b>46</b> can be eliminated. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cover <b>45</b> can be replaced with a cover <b>51</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The cover <b>51</b> is made of a metal material (a steel plate, such as an SPCC steel plate) and is secured to the gear housing <b>21</b> by point crimping (a point crimping portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>that is crimped against the gear housing <b>21</b>). The gear housing <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is slightly changed from the gear housing <b>21</b> of the above embodiment (the change including, for example, elimination of the engaging claw <b>21</b><i>h</i>). Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a case where the urging piece <b>46</b> is eliminated, the cover (the contacting portion of the cover) may be modified to directly contact the control circuit member (the molded IC). Even with this modification, rattle movement of the control circuit member can be reduced. Furthermore, the heat sink <b>44</b> may be eliminated, and the urging piece <b>46</b> may be directly urged against the molded IC <b>43</b>. Furthermore, each of the cover <b>45</b> and the urging piece <b>46</b> can be made of any other appropriate material (e.g., a resin material) other than the metal material. Furthermore, the urging piece <b>46</b> can be replaced with any other suitable type of resiliently engaging portion (e.g., a wave washer or a rubber component), which is urged against the control circuit member <b>41</b> (the molded IC).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the above embodiment, the seal member <b>26</b><i>b</i>, which seals the space between the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>(the opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>) and the opening of the cover <b>26</b>, is provide to the cover <b>26</b> that closes the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f</i>. Alternatively, the seal member may be provided to the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>(the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>of the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f</i>). Any other suitable arrangement, which is different from the seal member, may be used to limit the intrusion and application of the water to the control circuit member (the electrical circuit components).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the above embodiment, the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>are arranged parallel to one another in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b>, i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>may be arranged parallel to one another in any other suitable direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the above embodiment, the flat surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the molded IC <b>33</b> extends in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b>, i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the flat surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the molded IC <b>33</b> may extend in any other suitable direction.</p>

However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the opening direction of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>(the direction perpendicular to the linear outer edge of opening <b>21</b><i>g</i>) of the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>may be changed to extend parallel to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the outer edge of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>is not required to extend linearly and may have a curved shape or any other appropriate shape, if desired. In the above embodiment, the control circuit member <b>25</b> is installed into the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>in the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the above embodiment may be modified such that the control circuit member <b>25</b> is inserted into the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>in a direction, which is slanted, i.e., is angled relative to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the above embodiment, when the control circuit member <b>25</b> is installed, each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>is positioned to engage with the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>(the brushes <b>8</b> and the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>) to allow the electrical connection therebetween. Thereafter, the connection between each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>is laser welded to form the electrical connection therebetween. Alternatively, any other suitable measures can be used to form such an electrical connection. For example, electron beam welding, TIG welding or brazing may be used to connect between each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The shapes of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>may be changed to corresponding shapes, which allow the achievement of the electrical connection between each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>only by the installation of the control circuit member <b>25</b> without a need for welding or bonding. For example, the shapes of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>may be changed to shapes that cause axial fitting or mechanical connection between each of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>at the time of the installation of the control circuit member <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the above embodiment, the rotatable shaft <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the worm shaft <b>22</b> are coupled through the clutch <b>24</b> to transmit the drive force from the rotatable shaft <b>10</b><i>a </i>to the worm shaft <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the clutch <b>24</b> may be eliminated, and the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> and the worm shaft <b>22</b> may be directly connected to each other, i.e., may be formed integrally.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the above embodiment, the sensor magnet <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided to the clutch <b>24</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to this.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the above embodiment, the choke coil C is provided to the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c</i>. Alternatively, similar to the capacitor <b>34</b>, the choke coil C may be provided as one of the electrical circuit components in the control circuit member. In this way, the intermediate assembly (without the control circuit member <b>25</b>) of the motor main body <b>2</b> and the speed reducing unit <b>3</b> can be made as a universal component, and various types of motors (each having a different type of choke coil) can be easily made by using such a universal component.

In such a case, the protruding portion <b>7</b><i>b </i>should be formed in one of the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the connector arrangement <b>7</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above embodiment, the gear housing <b>21</b> is made of the resin material. Alternatively, the gear housing <b>21</b> may be made of any other suitable material, such as aluminum, which shows high heat radiation characteristic. In this way, the heat radiation is effectively performed, and therefore the thermal damage, which is caused by the heat generated from the control circuit member (particularly the molded IC), can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A breathing hole(s), which communicates between the interior and the exterior of the gear housing <b>21</b> (the motor), can be formed in the above-described cover <b>26</b>, <b>45</b>, <b>51</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a breathing hole <b>26</b><i>c </i>may be provided to the cover <b>26</b>, which is made of the resin material. The breathing hole <b>26</b><i>c </i>penetrates through the cover <b>26</b> in the direction perpendicular to the flat surface (the flat surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>e</i>) of the gear housing <b>21</b>, i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> on the front side of the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to communicate between the interior and the exterior of the gear housing <b>21</b>. A breathing sheet (a mesh type sheet) is secured to a distal end of a pipe, which communicates between the interior and the exterior of the cover <b>26</b>. In this way, a change in the ambient pressure of the interior of the gear housing <b>21</b>, which is caused by the generation of the heat during the operation of the motor <b>1</b>, is reduced. Furthermore, the hot air can be discharged through the breathing hole <b>26</b><i>c </i>(the breathing hole <b>26</b><i>c </i>thus serving as a heat releasing portion). Thus, the release of the heat is effectively performed. As a result, the thermal damage, which is caused by the heat generated from the control circuit member (particularly, the molded IC), can be further reduced. Furthermore, in the case where the opening direction of the breathing hole <b>26</b><i>c </i>needs to be changed to install the motor <b>1</b>, for example, at a different orientation (in a different type of vehicle door) and thereby to achieve the better water proof structure, it is only required to change the cover <b>26</b> of the motor while using the rest of the motor without the cover <b>26</b> as a universal component. Thus, versatility of the gear housing <b>21</b> can be improved, and the manufacturing costs of the motor can be reduced.</p>

Similar to the brush holder <b>7</b> of the above embodiment, the brush holder <b>61</b> of this example includes a holder main body <b>61</b><i>a</i>, a protruding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>and a connector arrangement <b>61</b><i>c</i>, which are formed integrally. The protruding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the brush holder <b>61</b> has an axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d</i>. The axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d </i>supports the base ends (up to near the welded parts) of internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> and of the connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b>. In the protruding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the brush holder <b>61</b>, a contacting projection <b>61</b><i>e </i>is arranged on a rotatable shaft <b>10</b> side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d </i>to laterally extend continuously from the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d </i>in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the contacting projection <b>61</b><i>e </i>axially extends to an axial intermediate point of the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d</i>. In this example, a distal end surface of the contacting projection <b>61</b><i>e </i>forms a brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f</i>. A holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>is provided to a distal end of the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d </i>to project on a rotatable shaft <b>10</b> side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d</i>. The amount of projection of the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>is progressively increased from the distal end of the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d </i>toward the base end of the axially extending part <b>61</b><i>d</i>. A groove <b>61</b><i>h </i>is formed in the holder main body <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the brush holder <b>61</b> on a rotatable shaft <b>10</b> side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the contacting projection <b>61</b><i>e</i>. In this example, the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>and the groove <b>61</b><i>h </i>form brush holder side holding portions. Similar to the brush holder <b>7</b> of the above embodiment, even in this example, a waterproof member <b>63</b>, which is made of the elastomer, generally covers the outer peripheral surface of the holder main body <b>61</b><i>a</i>, the protruding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>and the connector arrangement <b>61</b><i>c</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a side view of the brush holder <b>61</b> (including the waterproof member <b>63</b>) seen from a connector arrangement <b>61</b><i>c </i>side (the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), showing the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the brush side electrical conductors <b>12</b> and of the connector side electrical conductors <b>13</b>, which are arranged parallel to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9A</figref> to <b>9</b>C, the control circuit member <b>62</b> includes a base <b>71</b>, a heat sink <b>72</b>, a molded IC <b>73</b>, a capacitor <b>74</b>, a Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> and a plurality of connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A control circuit member side contacting portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is formed in the base <b>71</b> to contact the brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in the axial direction. A holding recess <b>71</b><i>b </i>is formed in the base <b>71</b> to engage with the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g</i>. When the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>is fitted in the holding recess <b>71</b><i>b</i>, the movement of the control circuit member <b>62</b> in a direction opposite from the inserting direction of the control circuit member <b>62</b> is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> is provided to a distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b> of the control circuit member <b>62</b>, which is a leading end of the base <b>71</b> in the inserting direction of the control circuit member <b>62</b> and which is positioned to correspond to the sensor magnet <b>77</b> that is secured to the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> includes two Hall elements <b>75</b><i>a</i>, <b>75</b><i>b</i>. The Hall elements <b>75</b><i>a</i>, <b>75</b><i>b </i>are arranged one after another in a corresponding direction, which is parallel to a plane A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) of the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the elongated base <b>71</b> and which is perpendicular to a longitudinal direction (the top-bottom direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) of the base <b>71</b>. The Hall elements <b>75</b><i>a</i>, <b>75</b><i>b </i>are provided to enable sensing of a rotational direction of the sensor magnet <b>77</b>, i.e. a rotational direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b> based on a difference between the output of the Hall element <b>75</b><i>a </i>and the output of the Hall element <b>75</b><i>b</i>. It should be understood that the two Hall elements <b>75</b><i>a</i>, <b>75</b><i>b </i>may be replaced with two Hall ICs (not shown), respectively, or a single Hall IC having two Hall elements. Furthermore, in the above embodiment and modifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, the Hall element <b>35</b> is provided to the control circuit member <b>25</b>, <b>41</b>. However, it should be noted that the Hall element <b>35</b> may be replaced with the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b>, which includes the two Hall elements (or alternatively the Hall ICs) <b>75</b><i>a</i>, <b>75</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9C</figref>. Thus, in the present invention, at least one Hall element should be provided, and it is more desirable to provide two or more Hall elements to allow the sensing of the rotational direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. In the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9C</figref>, the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> is displaced away from the rest of the electrical circuit components (e.g., the molded IC <b>73</b> and the capacitor <b>74</b>) in a direction perpendicular to a plane B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) of the base <b>71</b>, more specifically the plane B of a main body <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the base <b>71</b>, which is generally planar and from which the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b> projects. Also, the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> is displaced away from the rest of the electrical circuit components (e.g., the molded IC <b>73</b> and the capacitor <b>74</b>) in the longitudinal direction (the top-bottom direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) of the base <b>71</b>. A tip of the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b> except the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> is configured to be fitted into the groove <b>61</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In this example, the holding recess <b>71</b><i>b </i>and the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>form control circuit member side holding portions.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The control circuit member <b>62</b> of this example is installed into the gear housing <b>21</b> (the circuit receiving portion <b>21</b><i>d</i>) through the receiving hole <b>21</b><i>f </i>in the control circuit member installation step. More specifically, the control circuit member side contacting portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the control circuit member <b>62</b> axially contacts the brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f</i>. At this time, the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>is engaged with the holding recess <b>71</b><i>b</i>, and the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the control circuit member <b>62</b> is fitted into the groove <b>61</b><i>h</i>. Thus, the control circuit member <b>62</b> is held by the brush holder <b>61</b> and therefore by the gear housing <b>21</b>. Through this installation, each of the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>is engaged with the corresponding one of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>to allow achievement of electrical connection therebetween. In the connecting step, each of the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b</i>, which are visible through the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>when viewed from the outside of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>in the opening direction, is laser welded to the corresponding one of the internal terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to form the electrical connection therebetween. In this example, the cover <b>51</b>, which is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Upon the installation, the brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f </i>and the control circuit member side contacting portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>are engaged with one another in the axial direction. Thus, the positioning of the control circuit member <b>62</b> relative to the brush holder <b>61</b> in the engaging direction (the axial direction) can be easily performed. Furthermore, as described above, the brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f </i>and the control circuit member side contacting portion <b>71</b> are engaged with each other. Thus, for example, after the manufacturing, even when the external force (shock) is applied to urge the control circuit member <b>62</b> toward the brush holder <b>61</b>, i.e., toward the top end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, application of stress to the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b</i>, which are connected to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, is limited. As a result, the appropriate connection between each of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding one of the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, as described above, the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>is fitted into the groove <b>61</b><i>h </i>of the brush holder <b>61</b>. Thus, accuracy in the positioning of the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b>, which is provided to the distal end <b>71</b><i>c</i>, is increased. This results in relatively high accuracy in the relative position between the sensor magnet <b>77</b> and the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> and thereby results in relatively high accuracy in the measurement of the rotational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, as described above, the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>is fitted into the groove <b>61</b><i>h</i>, and the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>is engaged with the holding recess <b>71</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the control circuit member <b>62</b> is held by the brush holder <b>61</b>, i.e., is held relative to the gear housing <b>21</b>. Therefore, handling of control circuit member <b>62</b> is eased. For example, it is possible to easily limit displacement of the connection point between each of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding one of the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>at the time of, for example, welding the connection point. More specifically, it is possible to eliminate or simplify a device, which maintains the relative position between the control circuit member <b>62</b> and the brush holder <b>61</b> (the gear housing <b>21</b>) until the time of connecting the connecting point, for example, by the welding. Furthermore, as described above, the control circuit member <b>62</b> is held by the brush holder <b>61</b>. Thus, for example, after the manufacturing, even when the external force (the shock) is applied to the control circuit member <b>62</b>, it is possible to prevent or reduce application of the stress to the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b</i>, which are connected to the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the appropriate connection between each of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding one of the connection terminals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Furthermore, in this example (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9C</figref>), the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>and the groove <b>61</b><i>h </i>form the brush holder side holding portions, and the holding recess <b>71</b><i>b </i>and the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>form the control circuit member side holding portions. Through use of these brush holder side holding portions and the control circuit member side holding portions, the control circuit member <b>62</b> is held by the brush holder <b>61</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to the above structures, and any other structures can be used to form the brush holder side holding portion and the control circuit member side holding portion to hold the control circuit member <b>62</b> relative to the brush holder <b>61</b>. For example, the groove <b>61</b><i>h </i>(i.e., the structure, in which the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>is fitted into the groove <b>61</b><i>h</i>) may be eliminated, and other two holding claws and corresponding two holding recesses may be provided to hold the control circuit member <b>62</b> relative to the brush holder <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, in the above example (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9C</figref>), the control circuit member <b>62</b> is held by the brush holder <b>61</b> to hold the control circuit member <b>62</b> relative to the gear housing <b>21</b>. Alternatively, the control circuit member <b>62</b> may be directly held by the gear housing <b>21</b> by, for example, a corresponding structure (e.g., a holding claw provided in the gear housing).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, in the above example (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9C</figref>), the control circuit member <b>62</b> (the control circuit member side contacting portion <b>71</b><i>a</i>) contacts the brush holder <b>61</b> (the brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f</i>) in the axial direction. Alternatively, the control circuit member <b>62</b> (the control circuit member side contacting portion <b>71</b><i>a</i>) may contact the brush holder <b>61</b> (the brush holder side contacting portion <b>61</b><i>f</i>) in any other direction other than the axial direction. For example, in a case where the control circuit member is installed into the circuit receiving portion in the direction, which is slanted, i.e., is angled relative to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft, the control circuit member may contacts the brush holder in the installation direction of the control circuit member.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The Hall element <b>35</b>, which is held by the control circuit member <b>25</b> of the above embodiment, may be alternatively provided to the holder main body <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the brush holder <b>7</b>. In such a case, the terminals of the electrical conductors of the Hall element may be arranged parallel to one another in a manner similar to that of the internal connection terminals <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, and connection terminals, which correspond to the terminals of the electrical conductors of the Hall element, may be arranged parallel to one another in a manner similar to that of the connection terminals <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the above embodiment, the sensor magnet <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided to the clutch <b>24</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the sensor magnet may be provided to the distal end (the lower end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the worm shaft <b>22</b>, and the Hall element may be provided to the position (the lower position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which is opposed to the sensor magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9C</figref>, the plane A of the projected distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b>, which is projected from the main body <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the base <b>71</b> and holds the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b>, is parallel to the plane B of the main body <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the base <b>71</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, depending oh the location, orientation and/or configuration of the sensor magnet <b>77</b>, the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b> may be oriented in any other appropriate direction and may be positioned in any other appropriate location. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the plane A of the projected distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b>, which is projected from the main body <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the base <b>71</b> and holds the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b>, may be oblique to the plane B of the main body <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the base <b>71</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the plane A of the distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b> may be perpendicular to the plane B of the main body <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the base <b>71</b>. Furthermore, in the cases of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the configuration of the opening <b>21</b><i>g </i>of the gear housing <b>21</b> and the installing direction of the control circuit member <b>62</b> into the gear housing <b>21</b> may be changed in an appropriate manner to allow installation of the projected distal end <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>71</b>, which holds the Hall element arrangement <b>75</b>, to a point that is adjacent to the sensor magnet <b>77</b>. Also, the structure of the control circuit member <b>62</b> and the structure of the brush holder <b>61</b> may be changed to allow such a change. Specifically, the holding claw <b>61</b><i>g </i>may be eliminated from the brush holder <b>61</b>, and the holding recess <b>71</b><i>b </i>may be eliminated from the base <b>71</b> in the cases of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> to allow the installation of the control circuit member <b>62</b> in, for example, the oblique installing direction, which is oblique to the axial direction of the rotatable shaft <b>10</b>. In such a case, the control circuit member <b>62</b> may be press fitted into the gear housing <b>21</b> or may be held in the gear housing <b>21</b> by any other appropriate way.</p>
