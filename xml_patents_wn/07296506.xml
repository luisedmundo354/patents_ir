<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to U.S. Provisional Application entitled VARIABLE VOLUME CHAMBER CANNON, Application No. 60/545,641, filed on Feb. 18, 2004, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to automatic cannon and more particularly to cannon wherein isolating certain electronic components from the affects of recoil is desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While cannon of only a few decades ago were largely mechanical devices in which the crew performed the breech locking and unlocking operation and the ammunition loading and unloading operations, modern cannon are much more automatic in operation. Such automatic operations are necessary to achieve the rapidity of fire that is desired in modern cannon. In order to effect this rapidity of fire, electric and electronic devices perform many of the operations that were previously manually performed by the cannon crew. A problem that has arisen however is isolation of the electric and electronic devices from the severe acceleration affects of recoil of the cannon that occurs during firing of munitions from the cannon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An exemplary modern cannon is disclosed in the related application noted above. This cannon requires electrical drives to raise the breech carrier and to operate the breech plug to both lock/unlock the breech plug and to translate the breech plug. The breech carrier and the breech plug lowers and raises for loading/unloading operations and then recoils aft when the cannon is fired. This creates two orthogonal axes of motion. The raising and lowering of the breech carrier is orthogonal with respect to the bore axis of the cannon. The recoil motion is parallel to or coincident with the bore axis of the cannon.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electric drive assemblies (typically gearboxes) necessary to raise and lower the breech carrier and to operate the breech plug cannot long survive accelerations generated by the recoil of the cannon. Accordingly, it is desirable that the electric motors of the electric drive assemblies be mounted to the non-recoiling gun mount of the cannon as distinct from the recoiling breech carrier. In order to provide such isolation for the electric motors, the electric motors must include a device that readily disconnects the electric motor from the respective drives that are mounted on the breech carrier. The disconnect must be operable both axially and radially in order to accommodate both the raising and lowering of the breech carrier and the recoil of the breech carrier during gun firing. After a disconnect, the electric motor and its associated drive mechanism must then be readily and repeatably mated again for successive operations of the cannon.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The make-break devices of the present invention substantially meet the aforementioned needs of the industry by effecting repetitive making and breaking or engagement/disengagement of the non-recoiling electric motors from the respective recoiling drive mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The make-break devices reliably transmit torque from the respective electric motor to its associated drive when engage therewith. The make-break device allows for both axial and radial disconnection of the electric motor from its associated drive in order to accommodate for the motion of recoil (axial) and for transverse breech carrier motion (radial). The make-break devices allow reconnection of the electric drive motors and the respective drive mechanisms while remaining accurately timed. Additionally, the make-break devices are designed to minimize backlash and to accommodate sufficient parallel and angular misalignment to accommodate manufacturing tolerances and carriage clearance and yet still reliably and repeatably re-engage. The make-break devices further accommodate including minimal controls and brakes for holding the position of input and output devices in order to minimize the affects of rotational misalignment. Additionally, the make-break devices accommodate gross rotational misalignment that might result from control failure without destroying the joint or adjacent components, thereby allowing the cannon to return safely to battery or the breech carrier to return safely to the firing position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The make-break devices of the present invention enable simple, efficient, automation of a large caliber cannon system and contribute to increased system reliability and effectiveness. Reliability is a key concern for automated cannon and high relates of fire are critical to future cannon system effectiveness. The present invention directly contributes to both reliability and to a high rate of fire, and hence, contributes to improve system effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is a make-break device that includes a first component having at least one engaging member, the engaging member presenting at least first and second orthogonally disposed edges, each edge being defined at the intersection of a respective pair of chamfered face and a second component having at least one engaging member, the engaging member presenting at least first and second orthogonally disposed edges, each edge being defined at the intersection of a respective pair of chamfered faces, where the first component first edge and the second component first edge cooperatively act to assist in facilitating radial meshing engagement of the first and second components and where the first component second edge and the second component second edge cooperatively act to assist in facilitating axial meshing engagement of the first and second components. The present invention is further a cannon employing the make-break device and a method of selectively coupling/decoupling respective stationary electric drive assemblies from associated shiftable driven assemblies during orthogonal operations.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An exemplary cannon imploring a plurality of make-break devices of the present invention is shown generally at <b>10</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is understood that other cannon, particularly automated cannon, could also utilize the make-break devices of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cannon <b>10</b> includes an elongated tubular barrel <b>12</b> having a centrally defined bored axis <b>14</b>. A chamber <b>16</b>, having a generally increased diameter relative to the diameter of the barrel <b>12</b>, is disposed proximate the breech end of the barrel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A breech assembly <b>18</b> is disposed rearward of the chamber <b>16</b>. The breech assembly <b>18</b> includes a breech plug <b>20</b> that is disposable and lockable at selected positions (depths) within the chamber <b>16</b> in order to vary the volume of the chamber <b>16</b>. In the minimum volume disposition, the rearward end of the breech plug <b>20</b> is substantially flush with the breech end of the chamber <b>16</b>. In the maximum volume disposition, the rearward end of the breech plug <b>20</b> projects substantially rearward relative to the breech end of the chamber <b>16</b> and only a relatively small portion of the breech plug <b>20</b> is disposed in the chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The breech assembly <b>18</b> further includes a load tube <b>22</b> that is disposed generally above the breech plug <b>20</b>. The load tube <b>22</b> is translatable up and down relative to the bore axis <b>14</b> in conjunction with the breech plug <b>20</b> for conveying munitions to the chamber <b>16</b> when in the lowered disposition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The breech plug <b>20</b> and load tube <b>22</b> are translatable up and down by being mounted on a suitable breech block <b>24</b>. The breech block <b>24</b> has a bore defined therein that is in registry with the bore of the barrel <b>12</b> when the breech block <b>24</b> is in the battery (raised) disposition.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An interrupted thread gear <b>21</b> is disposed on the outer margin of the breech plug <b>20</b>. A corresponding interrupted thread gear <b>26</b> is disposed on the inner wall of the bore defined within the breech block <b>24</b>. The thread gear <b>26</b> mates with interrupted threads <b>21</b> defined on the exterior margin of the breech plug <b>20</b> in order to lock the breech plug <b>20</b> into a desired (and variable) position relative to the chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The breech block <b>24</b> is actuated up and down by a pair of laterally spaced apart breech carrier gear racks <b>28</b>. Each of such gear racks <b>28</b> has a plurality of teeth defined thereon. The breech block <b>24</b> rides up and down within tracks defined within a stationary breech ring <b>25</b>. The breech ring <b>25</b> is fixedly mounted. The breech ring <b>25</b> neither translates up and down during loading operations, but the breech ring <b>25</b> does recoil with the barrel <b>12</b>, being affixed to the barrel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A breech carrier gear box <b>30</b> on either side of the breech assembly <b>18</b> is coupled to a respective breech carrier gear rack <b>28</b>. The gears of the breech carrier gearbox <b>30</b> are meshed with the respective gear rack <b>28</b> for positively driving the breech block <b>24</b> between the lower load disposition and the raised, closed disposition.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there are two further gear assemblies mounted proximate the top of the breech assembly <b>18</b>. The first such gear assembly is a locking gear assembly <b>34</b>. The locking gear assembly <b>34</b> has a depending shaft <b>35</b> that is coupled to a worm gear <b>36</b>. The worm gear <b>36</b> is engaged with a locking gear <b>37</b>. The locking gear <b>37</b> is preferably coupled to the breech plug <b>20</b>. Rotational actuation of the locking gear <b>37</b> by the locking gear assembly <b>34</b> acts to rotate the breech plug <b>20</b> to either engage or disengage the interrupted threads <b>21</b> on the exterior margin of the breech plug <b>20</b> with the interior interrupted threads <b>26</b> of the breech block <b>24</b>, thereby locking and unlocking the breech plug <b>20</b> in the chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A second gear assembly located proximate the top of the breech assembly <b>18</b> is the translate gear assembly <b>38</b>. The translate gear assembly <b>38</b> has a depending shaft <b>39</b> coupled to a pinion gear <b>40</b>. The pinion gear <b>40</b> is designed to mesh with the interrupted threads on the external margin of the breech plug <b>20</b>. The actuation of the pinion gear <b>40</b> translates the breech plug <b>20</b> axially with respect to the chamber <b>16</b> to clear the breech plug <b>20</b> rearwardly of the chamber <b>16</b> and the breech assembly <b>18</b>. Once so cleared, the breech plug <b>20</b> can be lowered as noted above for loading ammunition by bringing the load tube <b>22</b> into alignment with the chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">All of the aforementioned gear assemblies are actuated by electric drive motors. Accordingly, on the exemplary cannon <b>10</b> there are four electric drive motors. The first two electric drive motors <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> drive the locking gear assembly <b>34</b> for locking/unlocking the breech plug <b>20</b> in the chamber <b>16</b> and the translate gear assembly <b>38</b> for translating the breech plug <b>20</b> relative to the chamber <b>16</b>, respectively. The second two electric drive motors <b>46</b> drive the respective breech carrier gear boxes <b>30</b>. Each of the four gearboxes, <b>34</b>, <b>38</b>, and the two breech carrier gear boxes <b>30</b>, recoils with the barrel <b>12</b> of the cannon <b>10</b> during firing operations of the cannon <b>10</b>. Each of the electric drive motors <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and both the electric drive motors <b>46</b> are fixed and do not translate with the barrel <b>12</b> of the cannon <b>10</b> under recoil in order to isolate the more delicate electric drive motors <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>46</b> from the accelerations imposed by the recoil of the cannon <b>10</b>. Accordingly, there is a need to repetitively engage and disengage the respective electric drive motors <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>46</b> with their respective gearboxes <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>38</b>. The make-break device <b>50</b> of the present invention provides such repetitive engage and disengage function both radially and axially.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>, the make-break device <b>50</b> is generally comprised of two members, a first member of the pair being a driving component <b>52</b> and a second member of the pair being a driven component <b>54</b>. The driving component <b>52</b> is operably coupled to one of the drive motors <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, or <b>46</b>. The driven component <b>54</b> is operably coupled to one of the gear assemblies <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, or <b>38</b>. The make-break device <b>50</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref> is a first embodiment of the present invention and is a gear type make-break type device <b>60</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the driving component <b>52</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> of the gear type make-break device <b>60</b> are identical. This need not be the case as one of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> could have more teeth <b>70</b> than the other component and the gear body <b>62</b> of each of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> could have different structural characteristics. The driving component <b>52</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> of the gear type make-break device <b>60</b> are axially offset when coupled with teeth <b>70</b> engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The driving component <b>52</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> of the gear type make-break device <b>60</b> each includes a gear body <b>62</b>. The gear body <b>62</b> has a tubular exterior margin and, in an embodiment, has a circlip groove <b>63</b> defined therein. An axial bore <b>64</b> extends through the gear body <b>62</b>. A keyway <b>66</b> is defined in the axial bore <b>64</b> for coupling the make-break device <b>60</b> to respective shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A gear head <b>68</b> extends radially outward from the exterior margin of the gear body <b>62</b>. The gear head <b>68</b> has a plurality of teeth <b>70</b> formed thereon. Each of the teeth <b>70</b> has a generally flat backside margin <b>72</b>. The teeth <b>70</b> are radially disposed with respect to a bore axis <b>74</b>. The structure of the teeth <b>70</b> is symmetrical about a plane including the bore axis <b>74</b> and the radius <b>76</b>, coincident with the axial leading edge <b>96</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, each of the teeth <b>70</b> is specially modified with respect to the teeth of a conventional spur gear. A sharp edge <b>80</b>, <b>96</b> each flanked by chamfered sides is presented both radially and axially to maximize the possibility of radial and axial engagement of the teeth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> with the teeth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>. Accordingly, the teeth <b>70</b> of the present invention lack the top land, face, and bottomland of a conventional spur gear.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As noted above, each of the teeth <b>70</b> has a radial leading edge <b>80</b>. The radial leading edge <b>80</b> is flanked by primary guide faces <b>82</b> on either side thereof that are chamfered with respect to the radial leading edge <b>80</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the primary guide faces <b>82</b> are flat faces. The intersection can be blended rather than meeting at a sharp edge.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A clearance chamfer <b>84</b> extends outward from the maximum radial point of the radius leading edge <b>80</b> at an angle toward the flat back side margin <b>72</b>. The clearance chamfer <b>84</b> in a preferred embodiment forms a generally diamond shaped hexagon. In the preferred embodiment, the clearance chamfer <b>84</b> is a flat surface, but a curved surface could be employed as well. A curved generally U shaped tapering face <b>86</b> extends rearward from and at an angle to the front margin <b>87</b> of adjacent teeth <b>70</b> of the gear type make-break <b>60</b>. The curved tapering face <b>86</b> intersects the curved root <b>88</b> between the adjacent pairs of teeth <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An addendum <b>90</b> (the radial distance between two concentric circles on a gear, one being that whose radius extends to the top of the gear tooth, defined by the radial edge <b>80</b>, and the other being that which will roll without slipping on a circle on a mating gear) is a modified form of a conventional gear in that the addendum <b>90</b> is increased more than the addendum of a standard spur gear to create an edged tooth for smooth radial engagement, and the dedendum <b>92</b> (the difference between the radius of the pitch circle of the gear and the radius of the gear root circle) is decreased more than the dedendum of a standard spur gear to prevent interference at the root <b>88</b>. The addendum and the dedendum together preferably define an involute tooth surface <b>94</b>. When driving through the gear joint, involute tooth surface <b>94</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> and the meshed involute tooth surface <b>94</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> contact like a standard spur gear.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The exemplary gear type make-break devices <b>60</b> of the present invention have <b>14</b> teeth and four marginal for a 56-millimeter pitch diameter. It should be noted that the make-break device <b>60</b> is not constrained to these values.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the case of radial engagement (transverse engagement relative to the bore axis <b>14</b>) as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a space between adjacent teeth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> and a tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> are presented to each other with various degrees of misalignment. At extreme misalignment, the radial leading edge <b>80</b> of the engaging tooth <b>70</b> will slide along the chamfer extending radially inward from the radial leading edge <b>80</b> that is presented by the involute tooth surface <b>94</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> being engaged. This action causes the engaging teeth <b>70</b> and the respective components <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> to self align into proper mesh even when presented in a condition of misalignment. The design of teeth <b>70</b> as noted immediately above results in proper engagement whether a single tooth <b>70</b> on a first gear-type make-break device <b>60</b> is presented to a single tooth <b>70</b> on a second gear-type make-break device <b>60</b> or whether a tooth <b>70</b> on a first make-break device <b>60</b> is presented to a space on a second make-break device <b>60</b>. The geometry of the teeth <b>70</b> allows for an error equal to substantially one half the angular tooth spacing of the gear type make-break device <b>60</b> and will still engage properly. Such design facilitates the repeatable coupling necessary for rapid loading operations of the cannon <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For smooth axial engagement, the axial leading edges <b>96</b> of the two mating components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> face one another. The primary guide faces <b>82</b> on either side of the axial leading edges <b>96</b> act to guide the engagement of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and to avoid jamming. At the extreme misalignment for axial engagement, the axial leading edges <b>96</b> pass each other so that one gear's primary guiding face <b>82</b> slides along the mating gears primary guiding face <b>82</b>. The clearance chamfer <b>84</b> allows for clearance between the next pair of teeth <b>70</b> on both the engaging components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> before the engagement of the primary guide face <b>82</b> of the respective components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">During axial engagement, when the tooth <b>70</b> on the stationary gear type make-break <b>70</b> (the driving component <b>52</b>) is aligned with the center line of the space of the mating moveable gear type make-break <b>60</b> (the driven component <b>54</b>), the moveable mating gear type make-break <b>60</b> may be misaligned by an angle half as great as the angular tooth <b>70</b> spacing and still self align during coupling engagement. Substantially no orientation of the driven component <b>54</b> will allow jamming. For misalignment in excess of half the angular tooth <b>70</b> spacing, engagement will simply slip to the next tooth <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During axial engagement when the space on the driving component <b>52</b> is aligned with the center line of the space of the mating driven component <b>54</b>, the movable, driven component <b>54</b> may be misaligned up to <b>90</b> percent of the case noted above and still self align. An amount of misalignment very close to half the angular tooth <b>70</b> spacing may allow jamming. When misalignment is <b>10</b> percent beyond half the angular tooth spacing, the engagement will slip to the next tooth <b>70</b>. Such design facilitates the repeatable coupling engagement necessary for rapid firing operations of the cannon <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the driven component <b>54</b> is operably coupled to a brake <b>100</b>. The brake <b>100</b> is mounted on a centrally disposed splined shaft <b>102</b> so that the brake <b>100</b> can translate longitudinally with respect to the longitudinal axis of the splined shaft <b>102</b>. The brake <b>100</b> includes a brake pad <b>104</b> that is actuated by springs <b>106</b>. The brake pad <b>104</b> acts on the rotor <b>108</b> to impede rotation of the driven component <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">During recoil of the cannon <b>10</b>, the springs <b>106</b> cause the brake pad <b>104</b> to come into contact with the rotor <b>108</b> thus braking the driven component <b>54</b> in order to minimize any misalignment between the driven component <b>54</b> and the driving component <b>52</b> that may occur during recoil. As the gun is returned to battery at the completion of the recoil motion, the brake <b>100</b> is released just prior to coupling engagement of the driven component <b>54</b> with the driving component <b>52</b>. This allows the driven component <b>54</b> to rotate relative to the fixed driving component <b>52</b> in order that a misalignment between the driven component <b>54</b> and the driving component <b>52</b> maybe accommodated as noted above the description of the axial engagement of the teeth <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The make-break device <b>50</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-24</figref> is a second embodiment of the present invention and is a tang type make-break type device <b>61</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the driving component <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-20</figref>) and the driven component <b>54</b> (FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>23</b>) of the tang type make-break device <b>61</b> are not identical, the driving component <b>52</b> having a pair of spaced apart teeth (tangs) <b>70</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> having a single tooth (tang) <b>70</b> for being drivingly engaged in the space defined between the teeth <b>70</b> of the component <b>52</b>. The tangs <b>70</b> of the second embodiment <b>61</b> are functionally analogous to the teeth <b>70</b> of the first embodiment above and similar structural components are described using analogous reference numerals. With the driving component <b>52</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> of the tang type make-break device <b>61</b>, the longitudinal (bore) axes <b>74</b> of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are substantially coincident (axially aligned) when the respective tangs <b>70</b> are made or coupled (engaged) as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The driving component <b>52</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> of the tang type make-break device <b>61</b> each includes a gear body <b>62</b>. The gear body <b>62</b> has a tubular exterior margin and, in an embodiment, has a circlip groove <b>63</b> defined therein. An axial bore <b>64</b> extends through the gear body <b>62</b>. A keyway <b>66</b> is defined in the axial bore <b>64</b> for coupling the make-break device <b>61</b> to respective shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A gear head <b>68</b> extends radially outward from the exterior margin of the gear body <b>62</b>. The gear head <b>68</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-20</figref>) has two spaced-apart teeth (tangs and teeth used herein interchangeably) <b>70</b> formed thereon. Each of the teeth <b>70</b> project axially forward from the gear head <b>68</b> and has a generally rearwardly sloping backside margin <b>72</b>. The axial leading edge <b>96</b> of each of the teeth <b>70</b> is radially disposed with respect to a bore axis <b>74</b> of the driving component <b>52</b>. The structure of the teeth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> is assymetrical about a plane including the bore axis <b>74</b> and any point along the leading edge <b>96</b>. The teeth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> are mirror images of one another. Sharp edges <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, and <b>96</b> are each flanked by chamfered surfaces; edge <b>80</b> by surfaces <b>118</b>, the opposed edge <b>81</b> by surfaces <b>112</b>, and the orthogonally disposed edge <b>96</b> by primary guide faces <b>82</b>. Edges <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> are respectivlely presented in both radial directions, e.g. approaching the bore axis <b>74</b> and retreating from the bore axis <b>74</b> in order to facilitate radial engagement in both direction along a radius of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Accordingly, component <b>54</b> can either radially approach edges <b>81</b> of the teeth <b>70</b> of component <b>52</b> for radial engagement with component <b>52</b> or component <b>54</b> can radially approach edges <b>80</b> of the teeth <b>70</b> of component <b>52</b> for radial engagement with component <b>52</b>. Edge <b>96</b> is presented orthogonal thereto in order to facilitate axial engagement of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The gear head <b>68</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> (FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>23</b>) has a single tooth (tang) <b>70</b> formed thereon. The tooth <b>70</b> has a generally rearwardly sloping backside margin <b>73</b>. The tooth <b>70</b> is radially disposed with respect to a bore axis <b>74</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>. The structure of the tooth <b>70</b> is preferably symmetrical about a plane including the bore axis <b>74</b> and any point along the axial leading edge <b>96</b>.

Edges <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> are respectively presented in both radial directions (as described above with reference to component <b>52</b>) to minimize the effect of any misalignment that may exist between components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and to maximize the possibility of radial and axial engagement of the two teeth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> with the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>, as is discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As noted above, each of the teeth <b>70</b> of both the driving component <b>52</b> and the driven component <b>54</b> has an outer radial leading edge <b>80</b>.

A secondary clearance chamfer <b>85</b> extends inward from the minimum radial point of the radius leading edge <b>96</b> at a rearward directed angle on each tang <b>70</b> of both components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. The clearance chamfer <b>85</b> in a preferred embodiment forms a rectangle that may be diamond shaped. In the preferred embodiment, the clearance chamfers <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> are flat surfaces, but curved surfaces could be employed as well.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Rotational driving in either rotational direction through the joint effected between the two teeth <b>70</b> of component <b>52</b> and the tooth <b>70</b> of component <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) is effected through the interaction of the primary bearing surface <b>110</b> of a certain one of the two teeth <b>70</b> of component <b>52</b> and a certain one of the bearing surfaces <b>110</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of component <b>54</b>. On driving component <b>52</b>, bearing surfaces <b>110</b> are preferably flat and in opposing inward directed parallel disposition. Preferably, bearing surfaces <b>110</b> are not radial surfaces. One inward directed bearing surface <b>110</b> is on each tang <b>70</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When driving through the tang joint in the primary mode of operation (the tang joint being the disposition with the tang <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> disposed inside the space defined between the two tangs <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and the two axes <b>74</b> coincident), surface <b>110</b> of one tooth <b>70</b> of driving component <b>52</b> will contact the adjacent surface <b>110</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>, as a function of the direction of rotation. The non-bearing surface <b>110</b> of the other tooth <b>70</b> of driving component <b>52</b> will be slightly spaced apart from the adjacent, opposing surface <b>110</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>. This is the desired primary drive orientation with minimal backlash. Driving is in either rotational direction as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At extreme misalignment for proper axial engagement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), edge <b>96</b> of tooth <b>70</b> of driven component <b>54</b> will be slightly offset from edge <b>96</b> of driving component <b>52</b>. Both edges <b>96</b> are radial to the joint centerlines <b>74</b> of the respective component <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> so any jamming of the edges <b>96</b> is minimal and only occurs with parallel misalignment of the joint axes <b>74</b> of the respective components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. During engagement, face <b>82</b> of driven component <b>54</b> will slide past the inward directed face <b>82</b> of driving component <b>52</b> and the teeth <b>70</b> of the respective components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> will slide into driving engagement as depicted in the joint of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. During missing engagement, face <b>82</b> of a certain tooth <b>70</b> of driven component <b>52</b> will slide past face <b>82</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>, thereby placing face <b>112</b> of component <b>52</b> alongside face <b>110</b> of the certain tooth <b>70</b> of component <b>52</b> in driving engagement. In a preferred embodiment, joint geometry allows an error of approximately ±20 degrees of misalignment between components <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> for make.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At extreme misalignment for proper radial engagement on the near side of the joint axis edge <b>80</b> of a tooth <b>70</b> of driving component <b>52</b> will be slightly offset from edge <b>81</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>. During engagement, face <b>112</b> of driven component <b>54</b> will slide on the inside of edge <b>80</b>, toward face <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). During missed engagement, face <b>112</b> (mirror) of the driven component <b>54</b> will slide on the outside of edge <b>80</b>, toward face <b>118</b>, and eventually the tang will slide on face <b>118</b>. The joint (the meshed engagement of the tangs <b>70</b> of the components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) geometry allows an angular error on the double tang <b>70</b> driving component <b>52</b> of approximately ±18 degrees to engage properly in the primary mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At extreme misalignment for proper radial engagement on the far side of the joint axis <b>74</b>, edge <b>81</b> of a certain tooth <b>70</b> of driving component <b>52</b> will be slightly offset from edge <b>80</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b>. During engagement, edge <b>80</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> will slide on the inward directed edge <b>112</b> of a certain tooth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b>. During missed engagement, the face <b>118</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> will slide on edge <b>81</b> of a certain tooth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b>. An exemplary joint geometry allows an angular error on double tang <b>70</b> driving component <b>52</b> of approximately +/−26 degrees to engage properly in the primary mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the joint between components <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> does not engage properly, the tang type make-break device <b>61</b> will still transmit torque, but the alignment will be in the secondary orientation and backlash may be about 280 degrees. When the joint misaligns during engagement, surface <b>112</b> of a respective tooth <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b> will drive against an adjacent surface <b>110</b> of the tooth <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> (mirror image assumed when appropriate). Driving in the opposite rotation operates identically except that mirrored faces <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> of the respective tangs <b>70</b> are in contact.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As noted above, each of the tangs <b>70</b> on driving component <b>52</b> also includes a non-radial, bearing surface <b>112</b> (the outward directed one of the two chamfered surfaces <b>112</b> that flank the edge <b>81</b>). In the event that the tang <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> slides to the outside of either tang <b>70</b> on the driving component <b>52</b>, one of the bearing surfaces <b>110</b> of the tang <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> will be in engaging, parallel, bearing disposition with a respective secondary bearing surface <b>112</b> on the adjacent tang <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b>. Driving in either rotational direction may be effected in the secondary mode of operation, i.e. with the tang <b>70</b> of the driven component <b>54</b> outside the space defined between the two tangs <b>70</b> of the driving component <b>52</b>, although a rotation of the driven component <b>54</b> about 280 degrees relative to the driving component <b>52</b> may be required to bring the bearing surface <b>110</b> of the driven component into engagement with the required bearing surface <b>112</b> of the component <b>52</b> for the desired direction of rotational motion.</p>
