<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and circuits and, more particularly, to compliant contact pins and methods of fabrication for connecting electrical signals to integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor devices, from microprocessors to memory chips, are fabricated by performing a long series of processes and steps including etching, masking, depositing, and the like, on a semiconductor wafer or other bulk semiconductor substrate. Many integrated circuits may be fabricated on a single semiconductor wafer by placing them in arrays across the wafer. Ultimately, the individual circuits are singulated from the wafer and are either further processed, including packaging and additional testing, or discarded when they are determined to be undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to processing or other defects in the semiconductor wafer, certain ones of the integrated circuits may not function as designed. Such defects may be detected initially or may not become apparent until the integrated circuit has been in operation for a period of time. Therefore, it is important to test and electrically stress the integrated circuits to determine which circuits are operational and which ones are defective or are likely to become defective.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Semiconductor integrated circuits are typically subjected to a series of test procedures during the manufacturing process in order to verify functionality and reliability. Typical test approaches include wafer probe testing in which integrated circuits are individually tested to determine the operational characteristic of each before singulation from the semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventionally following initial testing, the integrated circuits are singulated into individual integrated circuit chips with the operational chips being further assembled into packages. The packaged devices are then “burned-in” by loading the packaged devices into sockets on burn-in boards and electrically operating the packaged devices at elevated temperatures for an extended testing period. Such elevated temperatures induce failure in marginally operative or nonoperative devices, which allows such devices to be screened-out and discarded before they are integrated into higher level assemblies or sold. Burning-in and testing of packaged devices are typically accomplished through the use of sockets suited for the burn-in conditions and high speed testing. Accordingly, conventional manufacturing and testing processes are expensive and time consuming because of the repeated handling and testing of individual devices; therefore, individually tested and handled devices that ultimately fail have wasted costly resources and time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A considerable advantage in cost and in process time could be attained by burning-in and testing a semiconductor wafer before it is singulated into discrete devices. Additional savings may be recognized by forgoing packaging of devices that ultimately fail once subjected to burn-in conditions. A considerable effort has been expended to develop effective methods for wafer level testing. One such approach utilizes cantilevered or spring-wire probes that are arranged on a contact or probe card for simultaneous contact to all of the devices on the semiconductor wafer. Such contactor cards are expensive to manufacture and result in undesirable electrical characteristics such as increased inductance along parallel wires.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is a need for providing a contact methodology that results in a highly economically manufacturable method of contacting individual semiconductor devices in a wafer-level testing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, individual dice generally need to be packaged into a higher assembly before they may be integrated into a system environment. These higher assemblies or packages generally need to accommodate or compensate for differences in thermal expansion between the individual die and the system level substrate. Therefore, there is a need for providing a contact methodology that mediates stresses between dissimilar materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A compliant contact pin assembly, card, and methods associated therewith are provided in various embodiments. In one embodiment of the present invention, a contact pin assembly includes a contact pin formed in place from a portion of a substrate. The contact pin is compliantly held suspended within the substrate by a compliant coupling structure. The suspension within the substrate results in a compliant deflection orthogonal to the plane of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for forming a contact pin assembly is provided. A location for the contact pin is defined on a substrate in a location that corresponds to a target contact pad on, for example, a wafer to be tested. The substrate around the location is thinned for approximately the length of travel of the contact pin on the side defined as the contact end side. The substrate is locally thinned to a depth of at least the length of the contact pin immediately around the location of the contact pin to form a void surrounding the contact pin. The void is filled with compliant coupling material and the opposite side of the substrate is thinned to release the contact pin from the remaining substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for forming a contact pin assembly wherein the substrate provides the compliant action for the contact pin is provided. The location for the contact pin is defined on the substrate and the substrate is thinned around the location. Further thinning around the contact pin forms a void. The opposite side of the substrate is thinned, but not all the way through to the void. Instead, the remaining substrate on the opposite side flexes when the contact end of the contact pin encounters and presses against a pad on a wafer or other device-under-test.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet a further embodiment of the present invention, a device assembly for coupling with a device to form an assembly for coupling with a substrate having a contact pad thereon includes a contact pin assembly and a device attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a contactor card for interfacing between a tester and a device-under-test is provided. The contactor card includes a substrate configured for attachment with a semiconductor tester. The substrate further includes at least one contact pin assembly aligned for compliantly coupling with a device-under-test, such as a wafer. In a further embodiment, a method for making a contactor card is provided. The method forms at least one contact pin assembly on the substrate of the contactor card.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet a further embodiment, a method of testing a semiconductor wafer is provided. The method aligns the contact pads on a semiconductor wafer with the corresponding contact pad assemblies of a contactor card and then mates the card together such that the contact pins compliantly mate with the contact pads. Test signals are applied and monitored through the contactor card. In still another embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor wafer testing system is provided and includes a contactor card as described and a tester for generating and analyzing test signals.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention, according to the various embodiments described, is drawn to compliant contacting structure and methods for providing electrically conductive contact pins formed from and within a generally planar substrate. The various views and diagrams are illustrated generally as cross-sectional views for clarity; however, the specific formed profiles and devices may be arranged across the surface of the substrate and with various orientations and geometries as are desirable, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, substrate <b>10</b> has defined thereon a location <b>12</b> for the formation of a contact pin. Substrate <b>10</b> may comprise a silicon wafer, a ceramic substrate, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, or other suitable material. At the location <b>12</b>, a mask layer <b>14</b> is placed on the top or contact end side of substrate <b>10</b>. The profile of mask layer <b>14</b> identifies the general cross-sectional geometry of an emerging contact pin to be formed at location <b>12</b>. Mask layer <b>14</b> may be thermally grown silicon oxide, CVD silicon oxide, or CVD silicon nitride. Substrate <b>10</b> preferably includes a crystal orientation allowing for selectively etching as an isotropic etch. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the silicon etch is stopped at a distance <b>16</b> corresponding to an approximate contact pin travel distance. The contact pin travel distance may be heuristically derived as a function of the elasticity or flexibility of the compliant coupling means described below. As illustrated, the etch is preferably an isotropic etch resulting in side walls <b>18</b> that exhibit an approximate orthogonal relationship to thinned contact end surface <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, additional mask layers <b>22</b> of the same general nature as mask layer <b>14</b> are placed on thinned contact end surface <b>20</b> for the formation of stops that regulate the travel distance of the contact pin under fabrication. It is noted that the stops may be discrete or generally continuous in circumscribing the emerging contact pin formed at location <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, substrate <b>10</b> has been further thinned or etched to form stops <b>24</b> that limit the distance of travel of the contact pin as well as provide a stand-off for particles or contaminants that may be present on the further thinned contact end surface <b>26</b> of substrate <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the maximum depth of the emerging contact pin <b>34</b> is defined through the formation of a void <b>28</b> surrounding the emerging contact pin <b>34</b>. Void <b>28</b> may be formed in one of several manners including a photo etch process, wherein other portions of the substrate <b>10</b> are masked and protected from the etching process. Alternatively, void <b>28</b> may be formed through laser ablation or machining. Laser machining may be performed by a micro machining laser such as the XCISE 200 available from XSTL Ltd. of Dublin, Ireland.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a thickness <b>30</b> of substrate <b>10</b> remains intact to support the emerging contact pin <b>34</b> through further manufacturing processes. If substrate <b>10</b> is comprised of a semiconductive or conductive material, an insulative layer <b>31</b>, such as an oxide layer, is formed on the sidewalls of void <b>28</b>. When substrate <b>10</b> is comprised of a nonconductive material, then an insulative layer is unnecessary. In one embodiment, the emerging contact pin <b>34</b>, in addition to the surfaces defining void <b>28</b>, are conductively coated by depositing a conductive material <b>32</b> generally over the emerging contact pin <b>34</b> and throughout the void <b>28</b>. In one particular embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, conductive material <b>32</b> is formed through a metallic plating process, which results in conductive surfaces on remaining substrate portions <b>36</b> and on emerging contact pin <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A compliant coupling structure couples emerging contact pin <b>34</b> with remaining substrate portions <b>36</b> of substrate <b>10</b>. By way of example and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> illustrates one such structure as compliant coupling material <b>38</b>. Compliant coupling material <b>38</b> at least partially fills void <b>28</b> and forms a resilient compliant interface between emerging contact pin <b>34</b> and remaining substrate portions <b>36</b> of substrate <b>10</b>. One suitable type of compliant coupling material includes conductive filled elastomers, for example, those available from A. I. Technology, Inc. of Princeton Junction, N.J., and conductive filled polymers such as, for example, E3114-5 conductive polymer available from Epoxy Technology of Billerica, Mass.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To enable compliant movement relative to the remaining substrate portions <b>36</b>, the contact pin is released from the remaining substrate portions <b>36</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, the back or opposite surface <b>40</b> of substrate <b>10</b> is thinned, either through an etching process or through a mechanical grinding process, for at least a thickness or distance <b>30</b> to release or free contact pin <b>42</b> from adjacent portions of substrate <b>10</b>. As illustrated, contact pin <b>42</b> is formed from a portion of substrate <b>10</b> and remains positioned at original location <b>12</b> through compliant coupling means, namely compliant coupling material <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a specific embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, contact pin <b>42</b> is further coated with additional conductive material <b>44</b> at a bottom or interconnect end <b>51</b> to encapsulate the contact pin with additional conductive material. Consistent with the formation of conductive material <b>32</b> about the contact end <b>29</b> of contact pin <b>42</b> and throughout void <b>28</b>, conductive material <b>44</b> may be formed through various processing steps including electroplating or other plating or coating techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a contact pin assembly <b>46</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A compliant axis <b>48</b> illustrates the axis of motion of contact pin <b>42</b> as a result of the resilient or elastic nature of compliant coupling material <b>38</b>′. Furthermore, in one exemplary embodiment, the compliant coupling material is electrically conductive and is illustrated as compliant coupling material <b>38</b>′. Electrical continuity exists from contact tip or contact end <b>50</b> of contact pin <b>42</b> to substrate <b>10</b> by way of conductive material <b>32</b> electrically coupled with electrically conductive compliant coupling material <b>38</b>′, which further is electrically coupled to a portion <b>52</b> of the conductive material affixed to the remaining substrate <b>10</b>. Routing of a signal detected at contact end <b>50</b> of contact pin <b>42</b> may be further routed via one or more conductive traces <b>54</b> to other desirable locations. Conductive trace <b>54</b> may be formed according to various interconnection techniques including masking, deposition, and etching techniques, the specifics of which are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, contact pin assembly <b>46</b> is illustrated in a compliant state responsive to a device-under-test <b>56</b>, for example, a semiconductor wafer, with a contact pad <b>58</b>. The mating or coupling of the device-under-test <b>56</b> causes the displacement of contact pin <b>42</b> along a compliant axis <b>48</b> as compliant coupling material <b>38</b>′ resiliently deforms or compliantly responds thereto. As illustrated, stops <b>24</b> restrict the distance of travel of contact pin <b>42</b> and further protect the device-under-test <b>56</b> and contact pin assembly <b>46</b> from damage due to contaminants, for example, particles between device-under-test <b>56</b> and further thinned contact end surface <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a contact pin assembly, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Contact pin assembly <b>46</b>′ includes a contact pin <b>42</b> compliantly retained in substrate <b>10</b> by way of a nonconductive compliant coupling material <b>38</b>″. Because of the nonconductive nature of compliant coupling material <b>38</b>″, electrical coupling must be provided from contact pin <b>42</b> to surrounding substrate <b>10</b>. In the present embodiment, a wire bond <b>60</b> is applied between contact pin <b>42</b> and conductive trace <b>54</b>. Wire bonding techniques are known by those of ordinary skill in the art and further discussion of such process is not contained herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a coupling of a device-under-test <b>56</b> having a contact pad <b>58</b> mating with contact pin assembly <b>46</b>′. As illustrated, contact pin <b>42</b> compliantly deflects along compliant axis <b>48</b> due to the resiliency of compliant coupling material <b>38</b>″. Also illustrated, wire bond <b>60</b> further deforms in response to the compliant motion of contact pin <b>42</b>, thereby maintaining electrical continuity between contact pin <b>42</b> and conductive trace <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref> illustrate yet another method of formation of a contact pin for use in a contact pin assembly, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, processing of substrate <b>10</b> follows preliminary processing steps according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>. Prior thereto, however, a bore <b>62</b> is formed entirely through substrate <b>10</b>, for example, centered within location <b>12</b>, and through the emerging contact pin. Boring techniques may include those utilized for the formation of voids <b>28</b>, namely etching and or laser ablating techniques. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, bore <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) is filled with a conductive material <b>64</b>, which may be formed using plating, sputtering, squeegeeing or other conductive fill techniques known by those of ordinary skill in the art. This may also be effected prior to the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, voids <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) are filled with compliant coupling material <b>38</b> according to techniques described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, an etching or abrasive process, such as mechanical grinding or abrasive planarization such as Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP), removes the back side of substrate <b>10</b> for at least a distance or thickness <b>30</b> to release the emerging contact pin to form contact pin <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> illustrates an alternative approach for releasing the emerging contact pin to form contact pin <b>67</b>. In the present embodiment of the present invention, contact pin <b>67</b> is released by isolating contact pin <b>67</b> from remaining substrate portions <b>69</b> of substrate <b>10</b> by forming voids <b>71</b> through one or more substrate removal processes previously described. Such processes include etching, laser machining, and mechanical routing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The ends of contact pin <b>66</b> are preferably conductively coated to further facilitate electrical coupling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrate various contact ends or tips that may be formed upon contact pins <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>, in accordance with respective embodiments of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a conductive material <b>68</b> is formed to provide electrical continuity with conductive material <b>64</b>. Conductive material <b>68</b> may be formed using plating or other deposition processes, which results in a conductive contact surface for mating with device-under-test <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a bump of conductive material <b>70</b> is formed on contact pin <b>66</b> for providing electrical continuity with conductive material <b>64</b>. In the present embodiment, conductive material <b>70</b> may be formed using solder bumping technology, such as that utilized in the formation of balls of a ball grid array (BGA) or by using a wire bond capillary to place a bump of conductive material <b>70</b>. The formation of such conductive bumps is known by those of ordinary skill in the art and is not further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> further illustrate the formation of one or more conductive traces <b>54</b> and the electrical coupling of conductive material <b>64</b> with a yet further conductive material <b>72</b> for providing electrical conduction with a compliant coupling material <b>38</b>. The embodiments as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> may also incorporate a wire bond <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) when nonelectrically conductive compliant coupling material is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a device assembly utilizing a contact pin assembly, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. While compliant coupling of a contact pin assembly for temporary interconnection with a device-under-test is illustrated herein, various embodiments of the present invention also find application when permanently coupled with one or more devices to form a device assembly for further integration or coupling with a substrate, such as a printed circuit board. A device assembly <b>112</b> includes a contact pin assembly <b>102</b>, formed in accordance with the one or more embodiments described herein, and one or more devices <b>104</b> permanently coupled thereto. The one or more devices <b>104</b> include one or more contact pads <b>108</b> that electrically interface with the one or more contact pins <b>106</b> of the contact pin assembly <b>102</b>.

Electrical coupling techniques for coupling devices <b>104</b> to substrate <b>114</b> via the contact pin assembly <b>102</b> are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art and therefore are not further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Coupling of one or more devices <b>104</b> to a substrate <b>114</b> via a contact pin assembly <b>102</b> finds application by providing an intermediary expansion medium, namely the contact pin assembly <b>102</b>, for mediating variations in the expansion between devices <b>104</b> and substrate <b>114</b> when operated over temperature variations.

Therefore, in the present embodiment, the redistribution of inner lead contact pads <b>118</b> to outer lead contact pads <b>110</b> is accomplished through coupling a contact pin assembly <b>122</b> to a device <b>104</b>.

Additional texturing or profiles may be developed for facilitating enhanced coupling by the contact pin, such as, for example, penetrating an oxide layer on an integrated circuit pad.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, substrate <b>10</b> has defined thereon a location <b>412</b> for the formation of a contact pin. At the location <b>412</b>, a mask layer <b>414</b> is placed on the top or contact end side of substrate <b>10</b>. The profile of mask layer <b>414</b> identifies the general cross-sectional geometry of an emerging contact pin. Mask layer <b>414</b> may be one of various masking compositions and is preferably a nitride mask, commonly known as a “nitride hard mask.” While mask layer <b>414</b> may completely mask the area of the substrate <b>10</b> at location <b>412</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> further illustrates another optional aspect of the invention wherein texturing or profiles may be formed using one or more openings or apertures within mask layer <b>414</b>, an example of which is illustrated as apertures <b>416</b>. When profiles are desired at the contact end of the contact pin, a first mask layer <b>414</b> is placed at location <b>412</b> to form any desired profile features, such as stops or self-limiting contacts. Substrate <b>10</b> may be etched under controlled conditions to obtain the fine profile features. A mask layer <b>414</b> may be placed over the entire location <b>412</b> including the formed-profiles. Substrate <b>10</b> is bulk etched using, for example, a KOH etch process to obtain a pyramidal-shaped etch plane.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the processing of apertures <b>416</b> results in the formation of profiles <b>418</b> configured for enhancing the penetration of, for example, oxide layers inhibiting direct contact with underlying conductive contacts or traces of an integrated circuit pad. By way of relative dimensioning, profiles <b>418</b> are relatively short in order to be self-limiting when subjected to a contact pad of a device-under-test. By way of example and not limitation, profiles <b>418</b> may be fabricated with a height of approximately 0.33 μm. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14G</figref> illustrate the formation of profiles <b>418</b>, the formation of the profiles <b>418</b> is optional.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the silicon etch is stopped at a distance <b>120</b> corresponding to an approximate contact pin travel distance. The contact pin travel distance may be heuristically derived as a function of the elasticity or flexibility of the compliant coupling means described, and, for one application, may be on the order of 75 μm. As illustrated, the etch is preferably an isotropic etch resulting in the side walls <b>422</b>, which exhibit an approximate pyramidal relationship to thinned contact end surface <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, the depth of the emerging contact pin is generally defined through the formation of a void <b>126</b> surrounding the emerging contact pin. Void <b>126</b> may be formed in one of several manners including a photo etch process wherein other portions of the substrate are masked and protected from the etching process. Alternatively, void <b>126</b> may be formed through laser ablation or machining, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, a thickness <b>128</b> of substrate <b>10</b> remains intact to support the emerging contact pin through further manufacturing processes. When substrate <b>10</b> is semiconductive or conductive, an insulating oxide layer <b>127</b> is formed within void <b>126</b> to insulate any electrical signals from becoming shorted or exhibiting cross-talk.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>, the emerging contact pin <b>432</b> in addition to the surfaces of void <b>126</b> are conductively coated by depositing a conductive material <b>130</b> generally over the emerging contact pin <b>432</b> and throughout the void <b>126</b>. Conductive material <b>130</b> may be formed through a metallic plating process, sputtering process, or other particle deposition process, which results in conductive surfaces on remaining substrate portions <b>134</b> and on emerging contact pin <b>432</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A compliant coupling structure couples emerging contact pin <b>432</b> with remaining substrate portions <b>134</b> of substrate <b>10</b>. By way of example and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> illustrates one such structure as compliant coupling material <b>136</b>. Compliant coupling material <b>136</b> at least partially fills void <b>126</b> and forms a flexible or compliant interface between emerging contact pin <b>432</b> and remaining substrate portions <b>134</b> of substrate <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref>, the back or opposite surface <b>138</b> of substrate <b>10</b> is thinned either through an etching process or through a mechanical grinding or abrasion process for at least a thickness or distance <b>140</b> to release or free contact pin <b>142</b> from adjacent substrate portions <b>134</b> of substrate <b>10</b>. As illustrated, contact pin <b>142</b> is formed from a portion of substrate <b>10</b> and remains positioned at original location through compliant coupling means, namely compliant coupling material <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref>, contact pin assembly <b>144</b> may further include a redistribution layer, such as conductive trace <b>146</b>, for electrically routing contact pin <b>142</b> to a separate location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref> further illustrates a via <b>148</b> that may further electrically couple conductive trace <b>146</b> to an opposite side <b>150</b> of substrate portions <b>134</b> of substrate <b>10</b> for further routing on opposite side <b>150</b> or for coupling with a probe <b>152</b> at a contact pad <b>154</b>. Additionally, contact pin <b>142</b> may be further coated with additional conductive material <b>156</b> at a bottom or interconnect end to encapsulate the contact pin <b>142</b>. Consistent with the formation of conductive material <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>) about the contact end of contact pin <b>432</b> and throughout void <b>126</b>, conductive material <b>156</b> may be formed through various processing steps including plating, sputtering, or other coating approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a cross-sectional view illustrating a compliant contact pin assembly, according to yet another embodiment of the present invention.
