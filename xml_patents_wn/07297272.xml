<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A separation apparatus and method are employed using a separation channel for rotation about an axis. Such channel includes radially spaced apart inner and outer side wall portions and an end wall portion. An inlet conveys fluid into the channel. A barrier is located in the channel intermediate of the inner and outer side wall portions. A first flow path communicates between upstream and downstream sides of the barrier. A collection region may be located downstream of the barrier for communication with the first flow path. An outer side wall section of the channel may be positioned radially outward of an upstream section thereof. The barrier may join the outer side wall portion along a substantial portion of an axial length of the channel. First and second exit flow paths may allow communication with the channel either upstream or downstream of the barrier or both.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to apparatus and methods for separating biological fluids, such as blood or blood components or other fluids, into one or more components.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The separation of biological fluid such as whole blood and blood components into its constituent components for various applications is well known. Many commercially available separation systems are based on principles of centrifugation, which separates the fluid components according to density. Various devices and systems are known that employ centrifugal separation of blood or blood components including the CS-3000®, Amicus® and ALYX® separators marketed by Baxter Healthcare Corporation of Deerfield, Ill., the Spectra® and Trima® separators by Gambro BCT of Lakewood, Colo., the AS104 from Fresenius Homecare of Redmond, Wash., and the V-50 and other models from Haemonetics Corporation of Braintree, Mass. Various centrifuge devices are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,325,775, Published PCT Application Ser. Nos. PCT/US02/31317; PCT/US02/31319; PCT/US03/33311 and PCT/US03/07944, and U.S. Published Patent Application Ser. Nos. 20020094927 and 20020077241. Each of these patent and patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although centrifugal blood separator devices are thus well known, efforts continue to develop devices that are smaller, lighter, more portable, versatile and/or efficient in the separation and collection of one or more different components of blood or other biological fluids.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention includes apparatus and methods for separation of a biological fluid, such as whole blood, and optional collection of at least one of the fluid components.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a separation channel is provided for rotation about an axis. The separation channel includes radially spaced apart inner and outer side wall portions and an end wall portion. The channel has an axial length relative to the axis. An inlet is provided to convey fluid into the channel and a barrier is located in the channel intermediate of the inner and outer side wall portions. The barrier includes both upstream and downstream sides and includes a first flow path which communicates between the upstream and downstream sides. The separation channel further includes a collection region which is located downstream of the barrier and in fluid communication with the first flow path. The collection region is defined at least in part by an end wall portion which is axially spaced from the end wall portion of the channel. Additionally, first and second openings communicate with the collection region so as to allow flow of one or more fluid components, such as blood components, from the collection region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the invention, a section of an outer side wall portion of the channel is located in the vicinity of a barrier and is positioned radially outward of the outer side wall portion that is upstream of such section.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment of the separation channel, a barrier extends to an outer side wall portion and joins the outer side wall portion along a substantial portion of the axial length of the channel. A first flow path allows fluid communication between the upstream and downstream sides of the barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet a further embodiment of the separation channel, a barrier may extend to a radial position which is inward of the radial location of an inner side wall portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An additional embodiment of the separation channel includes a first flow path which communicates between the upstream and downstream sides of a barrier and further includes first and second exit flow paths. The first exit flow path communicates with the channel upstream of the barrier while a second exit flow path communicates with the channel downstream of the barrier. The first and second flow paths join at a location radially inward of an inner wall portion of the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, another separation channel may provide that a plurality of exit openings from the channel are located downstream of a barrier. In this respect, the channel is free of an exit opening upstream of the barrier inasmuch as fluid components are not allowed to exit the channel at a location which is upstream of the barrier. A first fluid flow path allows communication between the upstream and downstream sides of the barrier but does not provide an exit flow path to outside of the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a still further embodiment of the separation channel, a barrier wall extends to a radially outer side wall portion of the channel. A first flow path communicates between the upstream and downstream sides of the barrier and is spaced from one of the opposed end wall portions of the channel. The separation channel further includes a second flow path which communicates between the upstream and downstream sides of the barrier, which second flow path is defined by a surface of the other end wall portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although described later in terms of certain preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the separation channels of the present invention are not limited to the identical structures shown. For example, a separation channel may comprise a reusable platen, bowl or rotor into which a disposable flexible, rigid or semi-rigid liner is placed so that blood flows through the liner and does not contact the reusable portion. In such case, the configuration of the channel platen, bowl or rotor defines the shape of fluid flow path and the disposable liner assumes a corresponding shape during operation. Examples of such may be seen in the CS-3000®, Amicus® and Spectra® centrifugal separation systems. Alternatively, the separation channel may be entirely disposable. For example, the channel may be formed of rigid plastic having a pre-formed shape through which the blood or other biological fluid is processed. Of course, the channel could be entirely reusable, in which case it would need to be cleaned and possibly sterilized between uses—an inconvenient and time consuming-procedure. It should be understood that the separation channel and methods described and claimed are intended to have a broad interpretation that includes all of the more specific structures, such as those mentioned above, in which it may find commercial application.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The separation channels or chambers described herein may be used for a variety of biological fluid separation and collection procedures. By way of example and not limitation, one of such separation methods comprises the steps of introducing a first fluid, such as whole blood, which comprises at least first and second components, e.g., blood components, having generally different density into a centrifugal field and allowing an interface to form between at least portions of the first and second components. The method includes removing a second fluid from one side of the interface and a third fluid from the other side of the interface, combining at least a portion of the second fluid with the first or third fluid and reintroducing the combined fluids into the centrifugal field, and removing at least one of the second or third fluid from the centrifugal field.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the above method is applied to whole blood (first fluid), the second fluid may substantially comprise plasma and the third fluid may substantially comprise red cells. The combined second and first or third fluid may have a hematocrit which is approximately between 20 and 40 percent. The portion of the plasma which is removed from one side of the interface may include substantial numbers of platelets.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another method of the present invention, the method includes introducing a first fluid, such as whole blood, which comprises first and second components having generally different density into a centrifugal field; allowing an interface to form between at least portions of the first and second fluid components; decreasing the force of the centrifugal field (such as by reducing the rotational field of separation chamber containing the fluid); and removing the first fluid component from the centrifugal field after the force of the centrifugal field is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some or all of the above steps of this method may be repeated to enhance efficiency. For example, the step of removing the fluid component may be repeated so as to provide several collection cycles. The above method may have particular application in the collection of platelets from whole blood wherein the first fluid component comprises plasma which includes platelets.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further method of the present invention provides for forming and reforming of the interface between the fluid components of different density. This method includes the steps of introducing a first fluid, such as whole blood which has at least first and second components of generally different density; allowing an interface to form between at least portions of the first and second components, such as between plasma and red cells of whole blood; sequentially and repeatedly removing fluid from the centrifugal field from one side of the interface and allowing the interface to reform.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the method is applied to whole blood, the fluid which is removed from the centrifugal field comprises plasma and platelets. In particular, the fluid may comprise plasma which is rich in platelet concentration. The method may be performed so that the step of removing the fluid from one side of the interface is repeated at least two times.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method may further include moving the interface radially inward so that the interface itself is in proximity with an aperture or opening, through which the plasma or platelets are removed. Where the step of removing is performed at least twice, it is contemplated that the interface may be returned to its initial location prior to moving it to proximity with the aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An additional method of the present invention includes a method for processing whole blood, which may serve to reduce the amount of time that the donor or other human subject or blood source is connected to the blood separation device. The method includes connecting a blood source to a separation device; introducing blood into a centrifugal field created by the device; and allowing an interface to develop between at least two blood components. The method further includes: removing a first blood component from the centrifugal field from one side of the interface; removing a second blood component from the centrifugal field from the other side of the interface; storing at least one of the first and second blood components; returning, at least in part, the other of the first and second blood components to the blood source; and withdrawing additional blood from the blood source. After the additional blood has been drawn, the blood source is disconnected, and the steps of introducing the blood into the centrifugal field and removing the first and second blood components are repeated. The first and second blood components that have been removed from the centrifugal field may be stored for later use as desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a liquid processing system <b>10</b> that embodies the features of the invention. The system <b>10</b> can be used for processing various fluids. The system <b>10</b> is particularly well suited for processing whole blood and other suspensions of biological cellular materials. Accordingly, the illustrated embodiment shows the system <b>10</b> used for this purpose.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. System Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The system <b>10</b> includes two principal components. These are: (i) a blood processing device <b>14</b>—shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a closed condition for transport and storage, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> in an opened condition for operation; and (ii) a liquid and blood flow set <b>12</b>, which interacts with the blood processing device <b>14</b> to cause separation and collection of one or more blood components—the set <b>12</b> being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> packaged in a tray <b>48</b> for transport and storage before use, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> removed from the tray <b>48</b> and mounted on the blood processing device <b>14</b> for use. Although portions of the system <b>10</b> will be described further, details of the system are described in one or more of the above-identified patents or patent applications which have been incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">A. The Processing Device</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The blood processing device <b>14</b> is intended to be a durable item capable of long term use. In the illustrated and preferred embodiment, the blood processing device <b>14</b> is mounted inside a portable housing or case <b>36</b>. The case <b>36</b> presents a compact footprint, suited for set up and operation upon a table top or other relatively small surface. The case <b>36</b> is also intended to be transported easily to a collection site.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The case <b>36</b> includes a base <b>38</b> and a hinged lid <b>40</b>, which closes for transport (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows) and which opens for use (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref> show). In use, the base <b>38</b> is intended to rest in a generally horizontal support surface. The case <b>36</b> can be formed into a desired configuration, e.g., by molding. The case <b>36</b> is preferably made from a lightweight, yet durable, plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A controller <b>16</b> is carried onboard the device <b>14</b>. The controller <b>16</b> governs the interaction between the components of the device <b>14</b> and the components of the flow set <b>12</b> to perform a blood processing and collection procedure selected by the operator. In the illustrated embodiment, the controller <b>16</b> comprises a main processing unit (MPU), which can comprise, e.g., a Pentium® type microprocessor made by Intel Corporation, although other types of conventional microprocessors can be used. The MPU can be mounted inside the lid <b>40</b> of the case <b>36</b>. A power supply with power cord <b>184</b> supplies electrical power to the MPU and other components of the device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Preferably, the controller <b>16</b> also includes an interactive user interface <b>42</b>, which allows the operator to view and comprehend information regarding the operation of the system <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the interface <b>42</b> is implemented on an interface screen carried in the lid <b>40</b>, which displays information for viewing by the operator in alpha-numeric format and as graphical images.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further details of the controller <b>16</b> can be found in Nayak et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,065, which is incorporated herein by reference. Further details of the interface can be found in Lyle et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,687, which is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shown, the lid <b>40</b> can be used to support other input/outputs to couple other external devices to the controller <b>16</b> or other components of the device <b>14</b>. For example, an Ethernet port <b>50</b>, or an input <b>52</b> for a bar code reader or the like (for scanning information into the controller <b>16</b>), or a diagnostic port <b>54</b>, or a port <b>56</b> to be coupled to a pressure cuff <b>60</b> worn by a donor to enhance blood flow rates during blood processing (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-45</figref> and <b>47</b>-<b>48</b>), or a system transducer calibration port <b>58</b>, can all be conveniently mounted for access on the exterior of the lid <b>40</b>, or elsewhere on the case <b>36</b> of the device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">B. The Flow Set</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The flow set <b>12</b>, is intended to be sterile, single use, disposable item. Before beginning a given blood processing and collection procedure, the operator loads various components of the flow set <b>12</b> in association with the device <b>145</b> (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show). The controller <b>16</b> implements the procedure based upon preset protocols, taking into account other input form the operator. Upon completing the procedure, the operator removes the flow set <b>12</b> from association with the device <b>14</b>. The portion of the set <b>12</b> holding the collected blood component or components are removed from the device <b>14</b> and retained for storage, transfusion, or further processing. The remainder of the set <b>12</b> is removed from the device <b>14</b> and discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The flow set includes a blood processing chamber <b>18</b>, a fluid actuated pump and valve cassette <b>28</b>, and an array associated processing containers <b>64</b> and flow tubing coupled to the chamber <b>18</b> and the cassette <b>28</b>. Several embodiments of the chamber <b>18</b> will be identified in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">1. The Blood Processing Chamber</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the illustrated embodiment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the flow set <b>12</b> includes a blood processing chamber <b>18</b> designed for use in association with a centrifuge. The processing device <b>14</b> includes a centrifuge station <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, which receives the processing chamber <b>18</b> for use (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show, the centrifuge station <b>20</b> comprises a compartment <b>24</b> formed in the base <b>38</b>. The centrifuge station <b>20</b> includes a door <b>22</b>. The door <b>22</b> opens (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> show) to allow loading of the processing chamber <b>18</b> into the compartment <b>24</b>. The door <b>22</b> closes (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref> show) to enclose the processing chamber <b>18</b> within the compartment <b>24</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The centrifuge station <b>20</b> rotates the processing chamber <b>18</b>. When rotated, the processing chamber <b>18</b> centrifugally separates a fluid, preferably whole blood which is received from a donor into component parts, principally, red blood cells, plasma, and intermediate layer called the buffy coat, which is populated by platelets and leukocytes. As will be described later, the configuration of the chamber <b>18</b> can vary according to the intended blood separation objectives. Several embodiments of the chamber <b>18</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">2. The Fluid Pressure-Actuated Cassette</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the illustrated embodiment, the set <b>12</b> also includes a fluid pressure-actuated cassette <b>28</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The cassette <b>28</b> provides a centralized, programmable, integrated platform for all the pumping and valving functions required for a given blood processing procedure. In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid pressure comprises positive and negative pneumatic pressure, although other types of fluid pressure can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, the cassette <b>28</b> is mounted for use in a pneumatic actuated pump and valve station <b>30</b>, which is located in the lid of the <b>40</b> of the case <b>36</b>. The pump and valve station <b>30</b> includes a door <b>32</b> that is hinged to move between an opened position, exposing the pump and valve station <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for loading and unloading the cassette <b>28</b>, and a closed position, enclosing the cassette <b>28</b> within the pump and valve station <b>30</b> for use (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The pump and valve station <b>30</b> includes a manifold assembly <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) located behind a valve face gasket when the cassette <b>28</b> is when mounted on the pump and valve station <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">3. Blood Processing Containers and Tubing</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referred back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the flow set <b>16</b> also includes an array of tubes and containers in flow communication with the cassette <b>28</b> and the chamber <b>18</b>. The arrangement of tubes and containers can vary according to the processing objectives. Representative blood processing procedures and the associated flow sets accommodating such procedures will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">An umbilicus <b>100</b> forms a part of the flow set <b>16</b>. When installed, the umbilicus <b>100</b> links the rotating processing chamber <b>18</b> with the cassette <b>28</b> without need for rotating seals. The umbilicus <b>100</b> can be made from rotational-stress-resistant plastic materials, such as Hytrel® copolyester elastomers (DuPont).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, tubes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> extend from the proximal end of the umbilicus <b>100</b>. The tube <b>102</b> conveys whole blood into the processing chamber <b>18</b> for separation. The tubes <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> convey, respectively, centrifugally separated red blood cells and plasma from the processing chamber <b>18</b>. The plasma can either be rich or poor in platelets, depending upon the processing objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, a fixture <b>108</b> gathers the tubes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> adjacent the umbilicus <b>100</b> in a compact, organized, side-by-side array outside the centrifuge station <b>20</b>. The fixture <b>108</b> allows the tubes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> to be placed and removed as a group in association with an optical sensing station <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>), which is located adjacent to the centrifuge station <b>20</b> outside the chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The optical sensing station <b>46</b> optically monitors the presence or absence of targeted blood components (e.g., red blood cells and platelets) in blood conveyed by the tubes <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. The sensing station <b>46</b> provides outputs reflecting the presence or absence of such blood components. This output is conveyed to the controller <b>16</b>. The controller <b>16</b> processes the output and generates signals to control processing events based, in part, upon the optically sensed events. Further details of the operation of the controller to control processing events based upon optical sensing have been described in one or more of the above-identified patent or applications, which have been incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>), the flow set <b>16</b> includes a phlebotomy needle <b>128</b>, through which a door can be coupled to the system <b>10</b> for blood processing. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the flow set <b>16</b> also includes a blood sampling assembly <b>110</b>. The blood sampling assembly <b>110</b> allows for the collection of one or more samples of the donor's blood at the commencement of a given blood processing procedure, through the phlebotomy needle <b>128</b>. A conventional manual clamp <b>114</b> (e.g., a Roberts Clamp) is provided to control blood flow into the sampling assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the flow set <b>16</b> can include an in-line injection site <b>112</b>. The injection site <b>112</b> allows a technician to introduce saline or another physiologic liquid or medication into the donor, if necessary, using the phlebotomy needle <b>128</b>, and without requiring an additional needle stick. An additional in-line manual clam <b>116</b> is desirably included upstream of the blood sampling assembly <b>110</b> and the injection site <b>112</b>. The flow set <b>16</b> may include an appropriate junction such as a T-site, Y-site, V-site or other connector arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The device further includes one or more weigh stations <b>62</b> and other forms of support for containers. The arrangement of these components on the device <b>14</b> can, or course, vary depending on the processing objectives. By way of example and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show collection containers <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and <b>172</b> for in-process (or whole blood), plasma, red blood cells, and leuko-reduced red cells respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> other reservoirs or containers <b>150</b>, <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> may contain various other fluids for use during the procedure such as, and not limited to anticoagulant, saline and a preservative or storage solution. As blood or liquids are received into and/or dispensed from the containers during processing, the weight stations <b>62</b> provide output reflecting weight changes over time. This output is conveyed to the controller <b>16</b>. The controller <b>16</b> processes the incremental weight changes to derive fluid processing volumes. The controller generates signals to control processing events based, in part, upon the derived processing volumes.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">C. The Centrifuge Station</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The centrifuge station <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) includes a centrifuge assembly <b>68</b>. The centrifuge assembly <b>68</b> is constructed to receive and support the molded processing chamber <b>18</b> and umbilicus <b>100</b> for use.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the centrifuge assembly <b>68</b> includes a frame or yoke <b>70</b> having bottom, top, and side walls <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. The yoke <b>70</b> spins on a bearing element <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) attached to the bottom wall <b>72</b>. An electric drive motor <b>80</b> is coupled to the bottom wall <b>72</b> of the yoke <b>70</b>, to rotate the yoke <b>70</b> about an axis <b>82</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the axis <b>82</b> is essentially horizontal (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), although other angular orientations can be used. The motor <b>80</b> is capable of rotating the yoke <b>70</b> in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions, depending upon commands issued by the controller <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A carrier or rotor plate <b>84</b> spins within the yoke <b>70</b> about its own bearing element <b>86</b>, which is attached to the top wall <b>74</b> of the yoke <b>70</b>. The rotor plate <b>84</b> spins about an axis that is generally aligned with the axis of rotation <b>82</b> of the yoke <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, the top of the processing chamber <b>18</b> includes an annular lip <b>220</b>, to which the lid component <b>202</b> is secured. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> show, the rotor plate <b>84</b> includes a latching assembly <b>88</b> that removably grips the lip <b>220</b>, the secure the processing chamber <b>18</b> on the rotor plate <b>84</b> for rotation. Details of the latching assembly <b>88</b> can be found in one or more of the above-identified patents or patent applications which have been incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows, a sheath <b>144</b> on the near end of the umbilicus <b>100</b> fits into a preformed, recessed pocket <b>90</b> in the centrifuge station <b>20</b>. The pocket <b>90</b> holds the near end of the umbilicus <b>100</b> in a non-rotating stationary position aligned with the mutually aligned rotational axes <b>82</b> of the yoke <b>70</b> and rotor plate <b>84</b>. The tubes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> are placed and removed as a group in association with the sensing station <b>46</b>, which is also located within the pocket <b>90</b>, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Umbilicus drive or support members <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> and channels <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>) receive portions of the umbilicus <b>100</b>. The relative rotation of the yoke <b>70</b> at a one omega rotational speed and the rotor plate <b>84</b> at a two omega rotational speed, keeps the umbilicus <b>100</b> untwisted, avoiding the need for rotating seals. Further details of this arrangement are disclosed in Brown et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,120,449, which is incorporated herein by reference and in one or more of the above-identified patents or patent applications which have been incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">D. Interface Control by Optical Sensing</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In any of the above-described blood processing procedures, the centrifugal forces present within the processing chamber <b>18</b> separate whole blood into a region of packed red blood cells and a region of plasma (as diagrammatically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The centrifugal forces cause the region of packed red blood cells to congregate along the outside of radially outer or high-G wall of the chamber, while the region of plasma is transported to the radially inner or low-G wall of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">An intermediate region forms an interface between the red blood cell region and the plasma region. Intermediate density cellular blood species like platelets and leukocytes populate the interface, arranged according to density, with the platelets closer to the plasma layer than the leukocytes. The interface is also called the “buffy coat,” because of its cloud color, compared to the straw color of the plasma region and the red color of the red blood cell region.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It may be desirable to monitor the location of the buffy coat, either to keep the buffy coat materials out the plasma or out of the red blood cells, depending on the procedure, or to collect the cellular contents of the buffy coat. For that purpose, the system includes the optical sensing station <b>46</b>, which houses two optical sensing assemblies is, also diagrammatically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The first sensing assembly <b>146</b> in the station <b>46</b> optically monitors the passage of blood components through the plasma collection tube <b>106</b>. The second sensing assembly <b>148</b> in the station <b>46</b> optically monitors the passage of blood components through the red blood cell collection tube <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The tubes <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are made from plastic (e.g. polyvinylchloride) material that is transparent to the optical energy used for sensing, at least in the region where the tubes <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are to be placed into association with the sensing station <b>46</b>. The fixture <b>108</b> holds the tubes <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> in viewing alignment with is respective sensing assembly <b>148</b> and <b>146</b>. The fixture <b>108</b> also holds the tube <b>102</b>, which conveys whole blood into the centrifuge station <b>20</b>, even though no associated sensor is provided. The fixture <b>108</b> serves to gather and hold all tubes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> that are coupled to the umbilicus <b>100</b> in a compact and easily handled bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The first sensing assembly <b>146</b> is capable of detecting the presence of optically targeted cellular species or components in the plasma collection tube <b>106</b>. The components that are optically targeted for detection vary depending upon the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The presence of platelets in the plasma, as detected by the first sensing assembly <b>146</b>, indicates that the interface is close enough to the low-G wall of the processing chamber to allow all or some of these components to be swept into the plasma collection line (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). This condition will also be called an “over spill.”</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The second sensing assembly <b>148</b> is capable of detecting the hematocrit of the red blood cells in the red blood cell collection tube <b>104</b>. The decrease of red blood hematocrit below a set minimum level during processing indicates that the interface is close enough to the high-G wall of the processing chamber to allow all or some of the components in the interface and perhaps plasma on the other side of the interface to enter the red blood cell collection tube <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). This condition will also be called an “under spill.”</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">II. Embodiments of the Blood Processing Chamber</heading>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Several embodiments of the chamber are described herein. These chambers may be used with the flow set <b>12</b> in association with the device <b>14</b> and controller <b>16</b> to conduct various collection procedures.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">A. First Embodiment of the Blood Processing Chamber</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an embodiment of the centrifugal processing chamber <b>198</b>, which can be used in association with the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to perform a double unit red blood cell collection procedure as well as other procedures. The processing chamber <b>198</b> is fabricated in two separately molded pieces; namely, the base <b>201</b> and the lid <b>202</b>. The hub <b>204</b> is surrounded radially by inside and outside annular walls <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> that define a circumferential blood separation channel <b>210</b>. A molded annular wall <b>214</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) closes the bottom of the channel <b>210</b>. The lid <b>202</b> is secured to the top of the chamber <b>200</b>, e.g., by use of a cylindrical sonic welding horn.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The inside annular wall <b>206</b> is open between one pair of stiffening walls which form an open interior region <b>222</b> in the hub <b>204</b>. Blood and fluids are introduced from the umbilicus <b>100</b> into and out of the separation channel <b>210</b> through this region <b>222</b>. A molded interior wall <b>224</b> formed inside the region <b>222</b> extends entirely across the channel <b>210</b>, joining the outside annular wall <b>208</b>. The wall <b>224</b> forms a terminus in the separation channel <b>210</b>, which interrupts flow circumferentially along the channel <b>210</b> during separation.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Additional molded interior walls divide the region <b>222</b> into three passages <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, and <b>230</b>. The passages <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, and <b>230</b> extend from the hub <b>204</b> and communicate with the channel <b>210</b> on opposite sides of the terminus wall <b>224</b>. Blood and other fluids are directed from the hub <b>204</b> into and out of the channel <b>210</b> through these passages <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, and <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As the processing chamber <b>198</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is rotated (arrow R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the umbilicus <b>100</b> conveys whole blood into the channel <b>210</b> through passage <b>226</b>. The whole blood flows in the channel <b>210</b> in the same direction as rotation (which is counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Alternatively, the chamber <b>198</b> can be rotated in a direction opposite to the circumferential flow of the whole blood, i.e., clockwise, although a whole blood flow in the same direction as rotation is believed to be desirable for blood separation efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The whole blood separates as a result of centrifugal forces in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Red blood cells are driven toward the radially outer high-G wall <b>208</b>, while lighter plasma constituent is displace toward the radially under low-G wall <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows, a dam <b>244</b> projects into the channel <b>210</b> toward the high-G wall <b>208</b>. The dam or barrier <b>244</b> prevents passage of plasma, while allowing passage of red blood cells into a channel <b>246</b> recessed in the high-G wall <b>208</b>. The channel <b>246</b> directs the red blood cells into the umbilicus <b>100</b> through the radial passage <b>230</b>. The plasma constituent is conveyed from the channel <b>210</b> through the radial passage <b>228</b> into umbilicus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Because the red blood cell exit channel <b>246</b> extends outside the high-g wall <b>208</b>, being spaced further from the rotational axis than the high-g wall, the red blood cell exit channel <b>246</b> allows the positioning of the interface between the red blood cells and the buffy coat very close to the high-g wall <b>208</b> during blood processing, without spilling the buffy coat into the red blood cell collection passage <b>230</b> (creating an spill under condition). The recessed exit channel <b>246</b> thereby permits red blood cells yields to be maximized (in a red blood cell collection procedure) or an essentially platelet-free plasma to be collected (in a plasma collection procedure).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">B. Second Embodiment of the Blood Processing Chamber</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an embodiment of the centrifugal processing chamber <b>200</b>, which can be used in association with the system <b>10</b> shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> such as to perform a plasma collection procedure, yielding plasma that is free or essentially free of platelets, red blood cells, and leukocytes. The chamber <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> can also be used to perform a combined plasma/red blood cell collection procedure, which collects plasma and concentrated red cells separately, as well as other procedures such as platelet collection, which collects a concentrated platelet and plasma mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As previously described with respect to embodiment of a chamber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (with like parts being assigned like reference numerals), the processing chamber <b>200</b> is desirably fabricated as separately molded base component <b>201</b> and a lid component <b>202</b>, although other configurations may be employed for this and the other processing chamber embodiments as discussed above in the summary of the invention, without departing from the broader aspects of the present invention. The molded hub <b>204</b> is surrounded radially by inside and outside side wall portions <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> that define a generally circumferential blood separation channel <b>210</b>. A molded wall <b>214</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) forms an end wall portion of the channel <b>210</b>. The lid component <b>202</b> forms another end wall portion of the channel <b>210</b> and may also be comprised of an insert <b>242</b>. While both opposed end wall portions are shown to be generally flat (i.e., normal to the rotational axis) and the side wall portions <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are shown as generally cylindrical, it should be appreciated that the boundaries can be tapered, rounded, V-shape, and the like. When assembled, the lid component <b>202</b> is secured to the top of the chamber <b>200</b>, e.g., by use of a cylindrical sonic welding horn.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the chamber <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the inner side wall portion <b>206</b> is open between one pair of stiffening walls. The opposing stiffening walls from an open interior region <b>222</b> in the hub <b>204</b>, which communicates with the channel <b>210</b>. Blood and fluids are introduced from the umbilicus <b>100</b> into and out of the separation channel <b>210</b> through this region <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a molded interior wall <b>224</b> is formed inside the region <b>222</b> that extends entirely across the channel <b>210</b>, joining the outer side wail portion <b>208</b>. The wall <b>224</b> forms terminus in the separation channel <b>210</b>, which interrupts flow circumferentially along the channel <b>210</b> during separation.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Additional molded interior walls divide the region <b>222</b> into three passages <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and <b>230</b>. The passages <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and <b>230</b> extend from the hub <b>204</b> and communicate with the channel <b>210</b> opposite sides of the terminus wall <b>224</b>. Blood and other fluids are directed from the hub <b>204</b> into and out of the channel <b>210</b> through these passages <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As the processing chamber <b>200</b> is rotated (arrow R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), an umbilicus <b>100</b> (not shown) conveys whole blood to the passage <b>226</b> which leads to channel <b>210</b>. The whole blood flows in the channel <b>210</b> in the same direction as rotation (which is counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Alternatively, the chamber <b>200</b> can be rotated in a direction opposite to the circumferential flow of whole blood, i.e., clockwise, although whole blood flow is the same direction as rotation is believed desirable for optimal blood separation.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The whole blood separates within the chamber <b>200</b> as a result of centrifugal forces in the manner showing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Red blood cells are driven toward the outer side wall portion or high-G wall <b>208</b>, while lighter plasma constituent is displaced toward the low-G wall <b>206</b>. The buffy coat layer resides between the inner and outer side wall portions <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Circumferentially spaced adjacent the terminus wall <b>224</b> nearly 360-degrees from the whole blood inlet passage <b>226</b> are the plasma collection passage <b>228</b> and the red blood cell collection passage <b>230</b>. In an upstream flow direction from these collection passages <b>228</b> and <b>230</b>, a barrier <b>232</b> projects into the channel <b>210</b> from the high-G wall <b>208</b>. The barrier <b>232</b> forms a constriction in the separation channel <b>210</b> along the inner side wall portion or low-G wall <b>206</b>. In the circumferential flow direction of the blood, the constriction leads to the plasma collection passage <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> show, a leading edge <b>234</b> of the barrier <b>232</b> is tapered toward an annular boundary of the channel <b>210</b> (which, in the illustrated embodiment, is the annular wall <b>214</b>) in the direction toward the terminus wall <b>224</b>. The tapered edge <b>234</b> of the barrier <b>232</b> leads to an opening <b>236</b>, which faces the annular boundary of the separation channel <b>210</b>. The opening <b>236</b> faces but is spaced axially away from the annular boundary closely adjacent to the high-G wall <b>208</b>. The opening <b>236</b> communicates with the red blood cell collection passage <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A ledge <b>238</b> extends an axial distance within the opening <b>236</b> radially from the low-G wall <b>206</b>. The ledge <b>238</b> constricts the radial dimension of the opening <b>236</b> along the radially outer or high-G wall <b>208</b>. Due to the ledge <b>238</b>, only red blood cells and other higher density components adjacent to the high-G wall <b>208</b> communicate with the opening <b>236</b>. The ledge <b>238</b> keeps plasma, which is not adjacent the high-G wall <b>208</b>, away from communication with the opening <b>236</b>. Due to the radial restricted opening <b>236</b> along the high-G wall <b>208</b>, the plasma has nowhere to flow except toward the plasma collection passage <b>228</b>. The plasma exiting the separation channel <b>210</b> is thereby free or essentially free of the higher density materials, which exit the separation channel <b>210</b> through the restricted high-G opening <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The ledge <b>238</b> joins an axial surface <b>240</b>, which is generally aligned with the low-G wall <b>206</b>. The axial surface <b>240</b> extends axially along the axis of rotation to the red blood cell collection passage <b>230</b>. By virtue of the barrier <b>232</b>, the ledge <b>238</b>, and other interior walls, the red blood cell collection passage <b>230</b> is isolated from the plasma collection passage <b>228</b> (as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> also best shows, plasma residing along the low-G wall <b>206</b> is circumferentially directed by the barrier <b>232</b> and ledge <b>238</b> to the plasma collection passage <b>228</b> and into the umbilicus <b>100</b>. The higher density fluid, contain red blood cells and may also contain the buffy coat components (platelets and leukocytes) depending on the procedure employed. Such higher density fluid resides closer to the high-G wall <b>208</b> and is directed axially along the tapered edge <b>234</b> of the barrier <b>232</b> toward an annular boundary and the restricted high-G opening <b>236</b>. From the high-G opening <b>236</b>, the red blood cells and buffy coat components comprising the higher density fluid are directed over the radial ledge <b>238</b> toward the low-G wall <b>206</b>, and axially into the red blood cell collection passage <b>230</b> and into the umbilicus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">C. Third Embodiment of the Blood Processing Chamber</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-22</figref>, the processing chamber is generally indicated at <b>300</b>. The chamber <b>300</b> may be used in association with the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to perform various collection procedures for various biological fluids, including, but not exclusively, for blood. The chamber <b>300</b> may be used to perform a platelet or platelet rich plasma (PRP) collection procedure—which collects a concentrated platelet and plasma mixture—, a combined red blood cell and plasma collection procedure—which collects plasma and concentrated red cells separately—, and a combined red blood cell and platelet collection procedure—which procedure collects concentrated red blood cells and concentrated platelets separately—, as well as other procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The chamber <b>300</b> includes a separately molded base component <b>301</b> having a hub <b>304</b> that is disposed along an axis A of the chamber. The base <b>301</b> of the chamber <b>300</b> includes radially spaced inner (low-g) and outer (high-g) side wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, respectively. The side walls are consistently referred to in this description as the radially inner (or low-g) wall and the radially outer (or high-g) wall. The inner and outer side wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> and opposed end wall portions <b>302</b> and <b>314</b> generally define a circumferential (which is not limited to circular) blood separation channel <b>310</b>. A first end wall portion <b>314</b> forms one axial boundary or bottom to the channel <b>310</b> and a second end wall portion or lid <b>302</b> (partially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) generally forms the other axial boundary or top of the channel <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Although the inner and outer wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> are shown as substantially circumferential, i.e., as generally vertical walls having a generally uniform radius relative to a common axis A, other orientations, shapes, axes and radii are also possible. Also, while the top and bottom end wall portions are shown to be generally planar, it is also possible that these end wall portions could have other shapes such as curved, arcuate and the like. The shape and orientation of the channel also may depend on whether the channel is formed of flexible, semi-rigid, or rigid structures. It should also be appreciated that the designation of the end wall portions as “top” or “bottom” are not meant to limit these structures. Such terms are meant to be arbitrary and are merely used to distinguish one end wall from the other end wall in the relationship shown in the drawings in order to facilitate understanding of these structures.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 20A</figref>, the upstream end of the channel <b>310</b> includes a pair of opposing interior radial walls <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>. The interior radial wall <b>324</b> joins the outer side wall portion <b>308</b> and generally separates the channel <b>310</b> between its upstream and downstream ends. The interior walls <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> extend radially outward from the hub <b>304</b> to define an inlet passageway <b>326</b> for a fluid, preferably whole blood, to enter the chamber <b>300</b>. The inlet passageway <b>326</b> is generally defined at or near the top of the chamber <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, and preferably is formed in part by a surface of the top end wall portion <b>302</b>. The inlet <b>326</b> includes an opening <b>325</b> which is preferably disposed at a radial location which is adjacent the outer or high-g side wall portion <b>308</b> and which opening <b>325</b> is defined by a surface thereof. A step or edge <b>323</b> of the interior radial wall <b>322</b> is disposed radially intermediate the inner and outer side wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> and also preferably defines a surface of the opening <b>325</b> through which fluid is directed into the channel <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">At the downstream end of the channel <b>310</b>, first, second and third exit flow paths <b>328</b>, <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> may define outlet paths for one or more fluid components from the channel <b>310</b>. A dam or barrier <b>336</b> is also located at the downstream end of the channel <b>310</b> and will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the first exit flow path <b>328</b> is defined between the barrier <b>328</b> and an interior radial wall <b>335</b> which extends radially outward from the hub <b>304</b>. Radially inward of the barrier <b>328</b>, from a junction <b>352</b>, the first flow path is defined between two interior radial walls <b>334</b> and <b>335</b>. The first exit flow path <b>328</b> includes an opening <b>327</b> through which fluid enters from the channel <b>310</b>. Such opening <b>327</b> is preferably located upstream of the barrier <b>336</b> at a radial location which is approximate to the radial location of the inner side wall portion <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">When the channel <b>310</b> is operating under normal conditions—i.e., not under spill or over spill conditions—fluid in the first flow path <b>328</b> preferably flows either radially inward of the junction <b>352</b> (and outside of the chamber <b>300</b>) or, alternatively, travels radial outward at the junction <b>352</b> into the second exit flow path <b>330</b>. By “normal conditions”, it is meant that the blood components in the channel <b>310</b> are separated into plasma, buffy coat and red blood cells and are preferably disposed in the relative radial locations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Normal conditions may also include where the blood components in the channel <b>310</b> are separated into platelet rich plasma and red blood cells and the interface between the plasma and red blood cells is disposed radially intermediate the inner (low-g) and outer (high-g) wall, similar to the radial location of the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the second exit flow path <b>330</b> is defined generally downstream of the first exit flow path <b>328</b> and, between the barrier <b>336</b> and the interior radial wall <b>334</b>. The second exit flow path <b>330</b> may allow fluid communication downstream of the barrier <b>336</b> between the first and third exit flow paths <b>328</b> and <b>332</b>. The second exit flow path <b>330</b> includes a first opening <b>329</b> which is preferably adjacent the junction <b>352</b> to fluidly communicate with the first exit flow <b>328</b> path although other locations are also possible. A second opening <b>331</b> of the second exit flow path <b>330</b> is preferably radially outward of the first opening <b>329</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Under normal conditions, the direction of the fluid flow (e.g. plasma flow) in the second exit flow path <b>330</b> is generally such that fluid flows radial inward of the junction <b>352</b> towards the opening <b>331</b>. The extent of the radial path traversed by the plasma in the second exit flow path <b>330</b> will depend on the radial location of the interface between the plasma and red blood cells. Preferably, plasma flows into the second exit flow path <b>330</b> from the first exit flow path <b>328</b> to fill the second exit flow path <b>330</b> radially inward of the interface but does not flow radially outward of the interface. Under normal conditions, the plasma from the first exit flow path <b>328</b> will predominantly flow out of the chamber <b>300</b> with some plasma flowing into the second exit flow path <b>330</b> to fill the area radially inward of the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Although the preferred flow pattern of the first and second exit flow paths <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> is discussed above, it is also possible that the fluid within the first and second exit flow paths may follow a different flow pattern. This flow pattern may depend on the position of the interface associated with one or more fluid components and the rate at which one or more fluid components are collected from the channel <b>310</b> as well as other factors. By way of example, and not limitation, if the interface between the plasma and red blood cells is moved radially inward to force an over spill condition, then the fluid in the second exit flow path <b>330</b> may flow radially outward through the opening <b>329</b> at the junction <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the third exit flow path <b>332</b> is defined between the interior radial walls <b>334</b> and <b>324</b> and includes an opening <b>333</b>. Such opening <b>333</b> is preferably located downstream of the barrier <b>336</b> and downstream of the first and second exit flow paths <b>328</b> and <b>330</b>. Fluid may enter the opening <b>333</b> into the third exit flow path <b>332</b> for removal from the channel <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref>, <b>20</b>A and <b>22</b>, the barrier <b>336</b> includes an upstream side <b>338</b> and a downstream side <b>340</b> each of which are generally perpendicular to the outer side wall portion <b>308</b>. The barrier <b>336</b> extends radially across the channel <b>310</b> generally between the radial locations which correspond to the inner and outer side wall portion <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the barrier preferably is disposed radially inward of the inner (low-g) side wall portion <b>306</b> and tapers along an angled wall <b>342</b> to the junction <b>352</b>. The barrier <b>340</b> also includes a taper or curve near to or adjacent the outer side wall portion <b>308</b>. Although the barrier is shown having a shape which tapers near the inner and outer side wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, this shape is shown by way of example and not limitation and it is realized that other shapes are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the upstream side <b>338</b> of the barrier <b>336</b> extends axially from the end wall portion <b>302</b> at the top of the channel <b>310</b> along a substantial portion of the axial length of the channel <b>310</b>. At the upstream side <b>338</b>, the axial location of the barrier <b>336</b> terminates at a location which is preferably spaced from the end wall portion <b>314</b>. At such axial location, a first flow path <b>344</b> allows communication between the upstream and downstream sides <b>338</b> and <b>340</b> of the barrier <b>336</b>. The first flow path <b>344</b> is preferably located at an intermediate axial location between the opposed end wall portions <b>302</b> and <b>314</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the first flow path <b>344</b> is shown closer to the end portion <b>314</b> and, more particularly, is shown at an axial location which is approximately located at the bottom half or third of the chamber <b>300</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, fluid entering through the inlet <b>326</b> and traveling to the first flow path <b>344</b> must traverse a substantial axial extent of the channel <b>310</b>. Other intermediate axial locations of the first flow path <b>344</b> are also possible, such as intermediate locations along the barrier <b>336</b>. It is also possible that the first flow path <b>344</b> may be located at an axial location which is near to or adjacent the bottom end wall portion <b>314</b> of the channel <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 20A</figref>, the first flow path <b>344</b> is defined along its outer radial surface by one or more of first and second radially outward sections <b>309</b> and <b>311</b> of the outer side wall portion <b>308</b>. The first section <b>309</b> tapers radially outwardly from a radial location of a more upstream section of the outer side wall portion <b>308</b>. The first section <b>309</b> is generally located upstream of the barrier <b>336</b> and joins a second section <b>311</b> downstream of the barrier <b>336</b>. Such second section <b>311</b> is also radially outward as compared to the radial location of the outer side wall portion <b>308</b> at a more upstream location of the channel <b>310</b>—i.e. upstream of the section <b>309</b>. The second section <b>311</b> is preferably disposed at the same radial location as the first section <b>311</b>. An opposed inner radial surface of the first flow path <b>344</b> is preferably disposed at a radial location which is approximate to the radial location of the more upstream section of the outer side wall portion <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 20A</figref>, a collection region, generally defined at <b>346</b>, is disposed downstream of the barrier <b>336</b> (shown in broken lines). A top surface of the collection region <b>346</b> is defined by the end wall portion <b>302</b> at the top of the channel <b>310</b>. The collection region <b>346</b> also includes an intermediate end wall portion <b>348</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) which defines at least a portion of the bottom surface of the collection region <b>346</b>. The intermediate end wall portion <b>348</b> is axially spaced from the end wall portions <b>302</b> and <b>314</b> at the top and bottom of the channel <b>310</b>. Although the intermediate end wall portion <b>348</b> is shown generally parallel to the end wall portion <b>314</b> of the channel <b>310</b>, other orientations are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the collection region <b>346</b> is also defined, in part, by the downstream side <b>340</b> of the barrier <b>336</b> and the interior wall <b>324</b> of the channel <b>310</b>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the collection region <b>346</b> is generally disposed between the radial locations corresponding to the inner and outer side wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> and preferably is defined between the radial locations of the inner side wall portion <b>306</b> and the section <b>311</b> of the outer side wall portion <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the collection region <b>346</b> includes an axially directed opening <b>347</b> formed in the intermediate end wall portion <b>348</b>. Fluid travels axially upwards from the first flow path <b>344</b> along the downstream side <b>340</b> of the barrier <b>336</b> to enter the bottom of the collection region <b>346</b> through the opening <b>347</b>. As previously described, the openings <b>331</b> and <b>333</b> (as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>) may also allow fluid communication of one or more fluid components into or out of the collection region <b>346</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the collection region <b>346</b> includes a radially outward edge <b>350</b> of the interior radial wall <b>334</b> which is positioned between the openings <b>331</b> and <b>333</b> to the second and third exit flow paths <b>330</b> and <b>332</b>. Such edge <b>350</b> is disposed at an intermediate radial location between the inner side wall portions <b>306</b> and the radially outward section <b>311</b> of the outer (high-g) wall portion <b>308</b>. The radial location of the edge <b>350</b> is preferably positioned closer to the radial location of the section <b>311</b>. Such edge <b>350</b> is preferably positioned so that during normal conditions the higher density fluid such as red blood cells may exit the third exit flow path <b>332</b> and so that the lower density fluid does not exit therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">During use, a fluid, such as whole blood, enters the inlet <b>326</b> and flows into the channel <b>310</b>. As the fluid first enters the channel <b>310</b>, the fluid is generally located at the top of the channel <b>310</b>. The axial extent of fluid flow at the opening <b>325</b> of the inlet passageway <b>326</b> may be initially confined at its lower axial extent at the inlet by a bottom floor <b>354</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). The axial location of the floor <b>354</b> may be disposed at an axial location which is approximate to that of the intermediate end wall portion <b>348</b> of the collection region <b>346</b> although other axial locations are also possible. After the fluid enters the channel <b>310</b>, the channel is preferably no longer constrained at its lower axial extent, although it is still constrained at its upper axial extent by the opposed end wall portion <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the channel <b>310</b>, the fluid may essentially follow a spiral pattern (shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) as it travels downstream so that the fluid generally increases in its axial extent although other patterns are also possible. Upstream of the barrier <b>336</b>, the axial extent of the fluid is preferably disposed from the top end wall portion <b>302</b> at the top of the channel <b>310</b> to at least the approximate axial location of the first flow path <b>344</b> or lower. By utilizing as much volume within the channel, it is believed that more efficient separation of the fluid components is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As the blood flows downstream, centrifugal force allows the components of the blood to separate radially according to density within the channel <b>310</b>. Further details of this separation are set forth in Brown, “The Physics of Continuous Flow Centrifugal Sell Separation,” Artificial Organ, 13(1):4-20 (1989).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows one example of the relative radial locations of the blood components upstream of the barrier <b>336</b> during normal conditions of the channel <b>310</b>. Plasma is primarily disposed towards the inner or low-g side wall portion <b>306</b>, and the red blood cells are primarily disposed towards the outer or high-g side wall portion <b>308</b>. Platelets and leukocytes, also known as the “buffy coat”, are primarily disposed at an interface between the plasma and red blood cells and are located at intermediate radial location. For a platelet collection procedure, further processing steps are preferably performed, as described in further detail below, to suspend at least a portion of the platelets in the plasma so as to form platelet rich plasma on one side of the interface between platelet rich plasma and red blood cells.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Upstream of the barrier <b>336</b>, at least one fluid component may be collected through the first exit flow path <b>328</b>. Such component may include platelet poor plasma PPP or platelet rich plasma PRP. Such component also may flow into the second exit flow path <b>330</b> at the junction <b>352</b>. Another fluid component, preferably, red blood cells, may flow into the first flow path <b>344</b> for removal through the third exit flow path <b>332</b>. If the platelets are primarily located in the buffy coat, at least a substantial portion of the buffy coat is sequestered at the upstream side <b>338</b> of the barrier <b>336</b>. In this regard, the barrier <b>336</b> may allow accumulation of platelets upstream of the barrier <b>336</b> at a certain point during the procedure, for example, where platelet poor plasma PPP is being removed from the channel <b>310</b>. Such procedures will be discussed in further detail below. Thus, the portion of the interface between the plasma and red blood cells downstream of the barrier <b>336</b> preferably contains substantially less or virtually no platelets as compared to the interface located between these components upstream of the barrier <b>336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Downstream of the barrier <b>336</b>, the interface is allowed to form between the red blood cells and plasma which may also be either platelet rich or platelet poor plasma. Under normal conditions, the interface between the plasma and red blood cells is located at an intermediate radial location—i.e. between the inner and outer wall portions <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>—. Such interface is preferably located radially inward of the first flow path <b>344</b> so that primarily red blood cells flow through the first flow path <b>344</b> during normal conditions. More preferably, the interface between the red blood cells and plasma is disposed at a radial location which is approximate to the edge <b>350</b>. Such radial location allows the red blood cells to be collected from one side of the interface into the third exit flow path <b>332</b> but allows substantially little or no flow of plasma from the other side of the interface into the third exit flow path <b>332</b>. Plasma and red blood cells primarily flow through the first and third exit flow paths <b>328</b> and <b>332</b>, respectively. The second flow path <b>330</b> preferably contains plasma or platelet rich plasma radially inward of the interface and red blood cells radially outward of the interface. Some flow of plasma or red blood cells may occur in the second exit flow path <b>330</b>, depending on the radial location of the interface, but such flow preferably does not change such location of the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Other flow patterns are possible and may depend on other radial positions of the interface. For example, during an over spill condition,—i.e., where red blood cells flow out of the channel through the first exit flow path <b>328</b> with the plasma or platelets—, the interface moves radially inward and the second exit flow path <b>330</b> may allow red blood cells to flow from the collection region <b>346</b> out of the channel <b>310</b>. During an under spill condition,—i.e., where plasma or platelets flow out of the channel through the third exit flow path <b>332</b> with red blood cells—the interface moves radially outward and the second exit flow path <b>330</b> may allow some plasma or platelets from the first exit flow path <b>328</b> to flow into the third exit flow path <b>332</b>.</p>

The first flow path <b>344</b>A may be defined by a surface of the end wall portion <b>314</b>A. In this regard, fluid flowing into the first flow path <b>344</b>A must increase in its axial extent essentially to the bottom of the channel <b>310</b>A.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, the barrier <b>426</b> joins the inner and outer side wall portions <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> along a substantial axial extent of the channel.

The inner edge <b>432</b>, in part, defines an exit opening <b>448</b> from the channel <b>418</b> through a first exit flow path <b>446</b>. The outer radial edge <b>434</b> of the barrier <b>426</b> is spaced from a pocket or section <b>415</b> of the outer side wall portion <b>414</b>.

A first flow path <b>440</b> is defined between such edge <b>434</b> and such section <b>415</b> and extends from the top end wall portion (not shown) to the intermediate end wall portion <b>460</b>. The radial location of the outer radial edge <b>434</b> of the barrier <b>426</b> is preferably approximate to the radial location of the outer side wall portion <b>414</b> at such upstream location.

Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the barrier <b>426</b> joins the inner and outer side wall portions <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> along a substantial portion of the length of the channel <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the barrier <b>426</b> also includes a radially inward or tail portion <b>436</b>.

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Two radially directed interior radial walls <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> define an inlet, generally at <b>514</b>, which extends outward from a hub <b>501</b>.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">As with previous embodiments, the channel <b>508</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> includes a barrier, generally indicated at <b>516</b>, having upstream and downstream sides <b>518</b> and <b>520</b>. The barrier <b>516</b> extends generally perpendicular to the outer side wall portion <b>504</b>.

An opening or outlet <b>532</b> to such path is disposed at the inner side wall portion <b>502</b> to allow flow out of the channel upstream of the barrier <b>516</b>. The second exit flow path <b>528</b> is disposed downstream of the barrier <b>516</b> and includes an opening <b>534</b>. The second exit flow path <b>528</b> is defined between the barrier <b>516</b> and the interior radial wall <b>512</b>.

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>, a collection region <b>538</b> is disposed downstream of the barrier.

The collection region <b>538</b> is in fluid communication with the first flow path <b>524</b>.

The opening <b>534</b> communicates with the collection region <b>538</b> to allow flow of one or more fluid components, preferably red blood cells, to exit through the exit flow path <b>528</b> and for removal from the channel <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>, the collection region <b>538</b> further includes a radial passageway <b>540</b> located to the right of the interior radial wall <b>512</b>.

The passageway <b>540</b> extends to the inner side wall portion <b>502</b> where it communicates through a non-radial passageway <b>544</b> with the portion of the channel <b>508</b> located to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>. The extension portion <b>542</b> terminates at a radial location which is intermediate the inner and outer side wall portions <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> and, preferably, terminates at a radial location which is radially inward of the edge <b>513</b>. The extension portion <b>542</b> thus locates the non-radial passageway <b>544</b> at a location adjacent the inner side wall portion <b>502</b>. Preferably, both radial and non-radial passageways <b>540</b> and <b>544</b> are axially defined between the top end wall portion (not shown) and the intermediate end wall portion <b>536</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>, the passageways <b>540</b> and <b>544</b> generally allow communication between the upstream and downstream ends of the channel <b>508</b>.

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">III. Use of the System to Perform a Concentrated Platelet Collection Procedure</heading>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Any of the above described embodiments may be utilized to perform various biological fluid collection procedures such as a plasma collection procedure, a double-red cell collection procedure, and a platelet collection procedure as well as other collection procedures. Such procedure may be conducted with the blood flow set <b>12</b> together with the device <b>14</b> and controller <b>16</b> previously described. The blood separation chamber in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-48</figref> will generally be referred to by reference number <b>18</b> which may include the structure of any of the previously described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Although several platelet collection procedures will be described below, it is understood that the above described embodiments may be used for other collection procedures and may employ more than one collection procedure. By way of example and not limitation, typical plasma and double-red collection procedures have been described in at least one of the above-identified patents or applications which have been incorporated by reference herein. In addition, any of the embodiments described herein may be employed to collect more than one blood component in quantities permitted by the relevant country. Although collection of platelet rich concentrate will be discussed in detail below, it is contemplated that any of these methods in its broadest interpretation may include other biological fluid components as well as other blood components.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">A. Recirculating For Platelet Collection</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-45</figref> schematically show a method for platelet collection. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, a fluid component, preferably whole blood, is pumped into the chamber <b>18</b>. The blood may flows into the chamber <b>18</b> either from a blood source, preferably a donor, or may flow from the in-process container <b>158</b> where the blood from the blood source is temporarily stored for subsequent processing by the chamber <b>18</b>. The whole blood WB is allowed to flow, such as by pumping of an in-process pump IPP, through an inlet flow line <b>102</b> into the chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Within the chamber <b>18</b>, separation of the fluid components occurs based on density as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As mentioned above, further detail of this separation is set forth in Brown, “The Physics of Continuous Flow Centrifugal Sell Separation,” Artificial Organ, 13(1):4-20 (1989). A higher density component such as red blood cells RBC is forced towards the outer or high-side wall portion and a lower density component such as platelet poor plasma is forced towards an inner or low-g side wall portion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the interface between the red blood cells and the plasma contains a buffy coat layer which includes at least a portion of platelets and white blood cells, although the components of the interface will vary based on the particular procedure employed.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">After sufficient time has passed to allow the interface to form, fluid may be collected separately from either side of the interface—or both sides thereof—through the respective outlet tube <b>104</b> or <b>106</b> depending on the requirements of the procedure. For example, some platelet poor plasma PPP may be collected radially inward of the interface through the outlet tube <b>106</b> and into the plasma collection container <b>160</b>. Some red blood cells RBC may be collected radially outward of the interface through the outlet tube <b>104</b> and flow into the red blood cell collection container <b>162</b>. The afore-described barriers in the above chambers preferably allow accumulation of platelets which are contained in the buffy coat during such plasma or red cell collection, but platelet collection is not yet initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Prior to collecting the platelets, it is preferred that an under spill condition is imposed upon the fluid components. The under spill condition is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The optical sensor <b>148</b> detects that a portion of the plasma is exiting the tube <b>104</b> which usually has red blood cells exiting therethrough. The under spill condition is empirically determined based on the optical transmissivity of light through the components in the outlet tube <b>104</b>. The optical sensor data is converted to a hematocrit. A decrease in hematocrit of the outlet tube <b>104</b> detects an under spill condition. Forcing an under spill condition allows the interface to be forced radially outward (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) as compared to the radial location of the interface during normal collection operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The under spill condition allows removal of red blood cells into the red blood cell collection container <b>162</b> until the resulting fluid in the chamber has a hematocrit of approximately in the range of 20 to 40 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Once a desired hematocrit level is achieved, the fluid in the chamber <b>18</b> is preferably kept within the desired hematocrit range. For example, the flow of plasma may be stopped to prevent flow to plasma collection container <b>160</b> and the flow of red blood cells from the chamber <b>18</b> may also be stopped. Such flow may be stopped by operation of the valve station <b>30</b> and/or stopping one or more pumps such as the plasma pump PP. The in-process pump IPP may continue to operate although it is preferably operated at a lower flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The method further includes the recombination of the separated fluid components within the chamber <b>18</b>. Recombination is preferably performed by rotation of the chamber in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Preferably, the chamber <b>18</b> is rotated alternately in clockwise and counterclockwise directions one or more times. The step of recombining preferably results in a uniform blood mixture which includes plasma, red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells having an approximate chamber hematocrit as previously described. The step of recombining preferably lasts approximately one to three minutes, although this time period may vary. The rotation of the chamber in either direction is preferably at a rate preferably greatly reduced than the rate of rotation during initial separation of the components and may be, for example, in the range of approximately 300 to 600 RPM, although other rates of rotation are possible. It is noted that the angular velocities used herein conventionally are two omega although one omega may also be used as well as some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">After a sufficient recombination period, the rotor is then restarted to rotate the chamber in a uniform direction so that the flow within the chamber is generally directed from the inlet tube <b>102</b> to the outlet tubes <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Although the specific speed of the rotor may vary, such speed may be 2500 RPM. The interface between the plasma and red blood cells is allowed to reform. Preferably, collection of the plasma and red blood cells from the chamber <b>18</b> is not initiated until the interface is allowed sufficient time to reform.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">After the interface has reformed, the plasma and in-process pumps are operated to draw off plasma from the radially inward side of the interface through the outlet tube <b>106</b> and red blood cells are drawn from the radially outward side of the interface through flow line <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, both components are diverted back through the inlet tube <b>102</b> for recirculation through the chamber <b>18</b>. During recirculation, no plasma or red blood cells are collected into their containers <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>. The platelet concentration in the plasma generally increases during recirculation with platelets from the interface becoming suspended in the plasma. Recirculation of both components continues until the optical sensor <b>146</b> detects platelet rich plasma which has a desired concentration of platelets and which is visually low in red blood cells. As discussed above, the hematocrit of the recirculated mixture is approximately between 20-40 percent. Recirculation may also be modified so as to recirculate only one of the components, either plasma or red blood cells, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">During recirculation, the preferred pump flow rate ratio of the in-process pump IPP and plasma pump PP is 60/40, although other pump rates may be used depending on the particular conditions of the system. Recirculation may also allow an increasing concentration of white blood cells to settle to the interface between the platelet rich plasma and the red blood cells. Such pump ratio has also been found to have a direct influence on the number of white blood cells WBC that contaminate the platelet rich plasma PRP and the overall platelet concentration collection efficiency. By way of example and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A and 45B</figref> show a collected fluid having a higher concentration of platelets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45A</figref>) and a lower concentration of white blood cells WBC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A and 45B</figref>, such fluid was collected from a chamber having approximately 120 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area, which was operated at a one omega speed of approximately 1250 RPM with a chamber hematocrit of approximately 25%. Other collection efficiencies may be developed for different chamber surface areas, centrifugal speeds and chamber hematocrits.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Recirculation of the platelet rich plasma PRP may continue for several minutes, preferably approximately two to four minutes although this range may very depending upon the particular procedure. After a sufficient recirculation period, the platelet rich plasma PRP is collected through the outlet tube <b>106</b> into the platelet concentrate PC container <b>161</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, platelet poor plasma PPP replaces the fluid volume lost within the chamber <b>18</b> due to collection of the platelet rich plasma PRP. Although the collection of platelet rich plasma PRP has been described above, this method may also employ collection of platelet poor plasma and/or red blood cells.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Various modifications to the above-described method are possible. One modification includes operating the in-process pump IPP between at least two different pumping rates to effect recombination of the blood components. For example, fluid may be pumped into the chamber <b>18</b> by the in-process pump IPP at a first flow rate while being rotated in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, and then the rotation in either direction is repeated at a second flow rate. The centrifugal force may be decreased, such as by decreasing the rotor speed, where more than one flow rate is used.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Another modification to includes operating the plasma pump PP during recombination. Plasma is collected through the outlet tube <b>106</b> and flows into the in-process container <b>158</b>. Simultaneously, the flow at the inlet tube <b>102</b> is reversed using the in-process pump IPP so that fluid from the chamber <b>18</b> also flows into the in-process container <b>158</b> through the inlet tube <b>102</b>. The fluid in the in-process container <b>158</b> is then allowed to flow back into the chamber <b>18</b> through the inlet tube <b>102</b>. Therefore, the fluid components are mixed together outside of the chamber <b>18</b> and then re-enter the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">It is further possible to modify the pump ratio between the in-process IPP and plasma pumps PP during the collection phase to different ratios at different times during the procedure. Another further modification to the method discussed above includes using a platelet additive solution to replace volume within the chamber <b>18</b> after the platelet rich plasma PRP has been collected.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In addition, the length of time of recirculation into and out of the chamber <b>18</b> may be modified. For example, lengthening the recirculation period may allow more white blood cells to be forced radially outward to the interface so that the collected platelet rich plasma PRP has a lower white blood cell count. By way of example and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45C</figref> shows platelet and white blood cell counts during recirculation of platelet rich plasma PRP. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45C</figref>, the first sample occurred 15 seconds after the plasma pump was restarted for recirculation with samples taken approximately every minute thereafter. Sample #<b>5</b> occurred 15 seconds after beginning collection of platelet rich plasma PRP into the platelet concentrate container <b>161</b>. The white blood cells concentration drops during recirculation, approximately halving with every sample during the first few minutes. As a result, the lengthening of the recirculation period allows more white blood cells to sediment out of the platelet rich plasma and thus produces a leuko-reduced platelet concentrate which has substantially less white blood cells than at the start of recirculation. Other modifications are also possible.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">B. Decreasing the Centrifugal Force for Platelet Collection</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Another method of platelet collection includes decreasing the centrifugal force in order to separate and collect a desired fluid from the chamber. Such fluid is preferably platelet rich plasma PRP which provides a combination of platelets and plasma having a high platelet concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Similar to the previously described method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-45</figref>, this method includes introducing a fluid, preferably whole blood, into any one of the previously described chambers. Centrifugal force is preferably applied by the rotation of the chamber about its axis which causes the separation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Platelets and white blood cells generally settle into the interface or buffy coat layer between the plasma and the red blood cells. Within the interface, at least some separation may occur between the platelets and white blood cells based on density. In this regard, a thin layer of platelets may lie adjacent the plasma. By way of example and not limitation, a rotational speed in the range of approximately 4,500 to 5,000 RPM preferably results a platelet layer within the interface, of approximately 1 to 3 mm thick, although other speeds are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">After initial separation, the centrifugal force is decreased. Such decrease in force is preferably performed by decreasing the rotational speed of the chamber. The decrease in centrifugal force is preferably sufficient to cause expansion of the platelet layer which resides in the interface, thereby also causing expansion of the interface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>. By way of example and not limitation, a rotation speed of preferably approximately 2,500 RPM provides a platelet layer which is approximately 4 to 6 mm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Upon thickening of the interface, it is desired to collect as many platelets as possible from the interface or buffy coat, as platelet rich plasma PRP. By way of example and not limitation, collection may be performed by moving the expanded interface radially inward toward the inner side wall portion or low-G wall to create an over spill condition, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this respect, the optical sensor <b>146</b> optically monitors the presence of platelets in the outlet tube <b>106</b>. At such point, when a sufficient concentration of platelets are detected within the outlet tube <b>106</b>, the fluid flow from the chamber <b>18</b> is allowed to flow into the platelet collection PC container <b>161</b>. Prior to such point, the fluid flow from the chamber <b>18</b> may flow into the plasma collection container <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Modifications to this method are also possible and such modifications are not limited by the specific structures shown and described herein. In addition, this method may be combined with any of the other methods described herein. Removal of platelets may be performed two or more times during the collection procedure. It is also possible to perform other collection procedures in combination with this method such as separate collection of platelet poor plasma and/or red blood cells.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">C. Repeatedly Forming the Interface for Platelet Collection</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">This method provides for collection of a fluid from one side of the interface and then allows the interface to reform preferably to perform another collection of such fluid. Similar to previous methods discussed above, this method preferably introduces whole blood into the chamber and separates the blood into components based on density, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The interface or buffy coat layer is located at an intermediate radial location between the plasma and red blood cells and contains platelets.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Collection of the platelets within the interface is performed by forcing an over spill condition whereby the interface is forced radially upward to the inner side wall portion or low-G wall, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As previously described, platelets are optically monitored in the outlet tube <b>106</b> by the optical sensor <b>146</b> and platelet rich plasma PRP is diverted to the platelet collection container <b>161</b> when the optical sensor <b>146</b> detects the presence of a sufficient concentration of platelets within the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">After a predetermined collection time period, collection is stopped and the interface is allowed to return to its previous intermediate radial location, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. At such location, the interface is allowed time to reform so that platelets which may have moved or diverged from the interface may settle back into the interface. After sufficient time has been allowed for reforming the interface, another over spill over condition is employed so as to allow the interface to move radially inward and to allow more platelet rich plasma PRP to be collected through the outlet tube <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In one modification, the step of removing platelet rich plasma may be repeated at least two times and the interface may be allowed to reform between each successive removal event. In a further modification, this method may be combined with any of the other methods discussed herein. By way of example and not limitation this method may be combined with decreasing the centrifugal force as described above. This method may also be combined with separate platelet poor plasma and/or red blood cell collection.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">IV. Use of the System to Perform a Combined RBC/Plasma Collection Procedure</heading>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Any of the previously described chambers may be further utilized to perform a combined red blood cell and plasma collection procedure—which collects red blood cells and plasma separately—instead or in addition to the collection of platelet concentrate collection procedures described above. As such, the system and its components may be modified, as necessary, to perform the steps of this procedure, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">A. First Draw Cycle</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, a blood source BS is fluidly connected so as to allow the blood to be processed by the blood separation device <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and its flow set <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>). Fluid entry of the blood into the flow set is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>. The blood source BS may be a donor or other human subject, as shown, or another blood source connected to the device. Such donor may be connected to the blood separation device, for example by insertion of the phlebotomy needle <b>128</b> into an arm of the donor. Whole blood may flow into the flow line <b>126</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) where it may be mixed anticoagulant through a respective flow line <b>152</b> from an anticoagulant reservoir <b>150</b>, as generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">After the blood source BS is connected to the device, whole blood WB preferably travels through the appropriate flow tubes as directed by the system to fill the chamber <b>18</b>. The chamber <b>18</b> presumably has been prepared for blood processing through one or more pre-collection procedures such as purging the chamber of air and priming the chamber with saline and/or other procedures as appropriate. The whole blood enters the chamber <b>18</b> through inlet flow line <b>102</b> until the chamber <b>18</b> is full. Whole blood is also drawn from the blood source BS and is temporarily stored in the in-process container <b>158</b> for subsequent processing by the chamber <b>18</b>. The volume of whole blood which is drawn from the blood source BS is measured such as by the weigh scales <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) of the system. Collection of whole blood from the blood source BS continues either until a certain predetermined volume of whole blood is reached or to allow a partial or full return cycle, as discussed below. By way of example and not limitation, the procedure may collect approximately 2 units or 800 ml of whole blood during a combined red cell and plasma collection procedure. Other whole blood collection volumes are possible and will depend on the targeted volume and type of components which are being collected.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Similar to previous methods discussed above, the whole blood within the chamber <b>18</b> is processed to allow separation into its components based on density, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. After sufficient processing time, a fluid is removed from each side of the interface. Plasma P is removed from one side of the interface. Red blood cells are removed from the other side of the interface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, plasma P exits the chamber <b>18</b> through the outlet tube <b>106</b> and red blood cell concentrate RBC exits the outlet tube <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The first and second fluid components, preferably plasma and red blood cells, are removed from the chamber into their respective collection containers <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>. The volume of each fluid component collected within the containers <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> is also measured throughout the collection cycle. Processing and collection of the components from the chamber <b>18</b> preferably continues until the volume within at least one of the fluid collection containers <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> reaches a predetermined minimum threshold, but before a targeted total volume of at least one fluid component is collected. When one of the volumes of the containers <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> reaches the predetermined minimum threshold, the device is configured to allow a full or partial return of at least one of the blood components.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">B. Return Cycle</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, a portion of at least one of the fluid components, preferably red blood cells RBC, is returned to the donor. During the return cycle, whole blood from the in-process container <b>158</b> flows into the chamber <b>18</b> and also is processed. Separation and collection of the components in the chamber <b>18</b> preferably continues although at least one of the components may be returned to the blood source, if desired. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, red blood cells RBC exiting the chamber <b>18</b> are returned to the donor. All or a portion of the red blood cells which are collected up to this point in the procedure may be returned to the donor, and the amount returned may depend on the specific procedure employed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows a more detailed account of a combined red blood cell and plasma procedure where all the red blood cells are return to the donor at a “Last Return” and all the plasma is stored within the system. While the volume of plasma within the plasma collection container <b>160</b> may be retained within the system, it is also possible that a portion of the plasma may be returned to the donor, depending on the requirements of the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">After the desired volume of at least one of the fluid components has been returned to the blood source, the return cycle terminates. Additional return cycles are preferably not commenced, as these would increase the time during which the blood source must be connected to the separation device.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">C. Second Draw Cycle</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">After the return cycle, additional whole blood is withdrawn from the blood source and processed, as previously described and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>. The amount of whole blood which is withdrawn from the blood source BS during the second draw cycle is based on a predicted value. Such value preferably depends on the volumes of plasma and red blood cells which are collected during the first collection cycle and the hematocrit of the red blood cells leaving the chamber <b>18</b>. The volumetric data of plasma in the container <b>160</b> and the volume of red blood cells in the container <b>162</b> are preferably monitored throughout the first draw cycle, such as by the weighing sensors, and are also measured at the end of the first draw cycle, prior to any return of such components to the blood source BS. The hematocrit of the chamber <b>18</b> is determined optically through the sensor <b>148</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) in the outlet tube <b>104</b>. The system uses the volumetric and hemacrit values to empirically calculate how much whole blood must be withdrawn from the blood source BS to achieve a targeted final volume of at least one of or both fluid components. In its calculation, the system also takes into account whether the volume of plasma or red blood cells which have already been collected will be retained or returned to the blood source BS.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the volume of plasma retained after the first collection cycle is approximately 160 ml. The volume of red blood cells retained is 0 ml or approximately zero. The targeted volume of plasma and red blood cells are approximately 400 ml and 240 ml, respectively. The additional whole blood to be drawn from the donor to achieve these targeted volumes is determined by the system as approximately 480 ml. Therefore, this is the volume of whole blood which must be drawn during the second collection cycle. Other volumes will be apparent with different volumetric and hemacrit values.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">D. Processing Cycle After Disconnection</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The blood source BS or donor may be disconnected from the device after the predicted volume of whole blood has been withdrawn. Processing of the whole blood is repeated as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> for the First Draw Cycle except with the blood source BS being disconnected from the device. Processing of the whole blood continues after disconnection of the donor, thus reducing the actual time that the donor needs to be connected to the device. The total amount of time elapsed during which the blood source BS is connected to the device is thus less than the total amount of time during which the whole blood undergoes collection and processing by the device.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">By way of example and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows collection procedure for approximately 800 ml of whole blood which has a total processing time of approximately 21 minutes. This procedure collects approximately 400 ml of plasma and approximately 240 ml (or 1 unit) of red blood cells—with the remaining red blood cells having been returned to the donor during the return cycle. The total time that the donor is connected to the device is less than the total processing time,—i.e., less than 21 minutes—since the donor may be disconnected after the last return. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the total time that the donor is connected to the device may be approximately 14 minutes. Other total processing times and donor connection times are possible and may depend on the procedure objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Preferably, at least two components such as plasma and red blood cells are removed and stored in their respective collection containers <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>, either until the total targeted volume of at least one blood component is reached or until all the blood has been processed. Further processing or separation may be employed in accordance with any of the above described methods or other collection procedures. For example, any one or more of the above methods may be employed to collect platelet concentrate. Platelet poor plasma may be used to resuspend platelets from the interface in accordance with any of the previously described methods. Alternatively, a platelet additive solution or PAS may be used for collecting platelet concentrate methods. Thus, this method may also be combined with any of the above-described to collect at least two blood components, plasma and red blood cells, as well as platelet concentrate. The amount of collection will vary depending on collection limitations set by the particular country.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">As can be seen from the above description, the present invention has several different aspects and features, which are not limited to the specific chamber shown in the attached drawings or to the specific procedures discussed. Variations of these features may be embodied in other structures for carrying out other procedures for blood separation, processing or collection.</p>
