<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a gas barrier film having superior gas barrier performance and a method for producing the same as well as an organic electroluminescence device (henceforth referred to as âorganic EL deviceâ) utilizing the gas barrier film. More precisely, the present invention relates to a gas barrier film suitable as a substrate of various kinds of devices and a method for producing the same, as well as a flexible organic EL device utilizing the gas barrier film.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, gas barrier films prepared by forming a thin film of metal oxide such as aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide or silicon oxide on a surface of a plastic substrate or film have been widely used in packaging of articles which require shielding of various gases such as water vapor and oxygen, and packaging use for preventing deterioration of food, industrial materials, medical supplies and so forth. In addition to the packaging use, gas barrier films are recently coming to be used also in liquid crystal display devices, solar cells, EL devices and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the course of development of image display devices such as liquid crystal display devices and EL devices in recent years, transparent base materials for forming these devices are required to satisfy highly sophisticated requirements in addition to suitability for production of lighter and larger devices, for example, they must have long term reliability and higher degree of freedom of the shape, they must enable display on a curved surface, and so forth. As a transparent base material that satisfies such sophisticated requirements, plastic base materials are beginning to be adopted as new base materials as an alternative to conventional glass substrates, which are heavy, readily broken and difficult to be formed with a larger size. Plastic base materials not only satisfy the aforementioned requirements, but also show more favorable productivity compared with glass substrates because a roll-to-roll system can be used for them, and therefore they are more advantageous also in view of cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, plastic base materials have a drawback that their gas barrier property is inferior to that of glass base materials. If a base material having poor gas barrier property is used, water vapor and air permeate the material to, for example, degrade liquid crystals in a liquid crystal cell, form display defects and thereby degrade display quality. In order to solve this problem, plastic films in which a metal oxide thin film is formed on a plastic film have been developed so far. Examples of such plastic films include those comprising a plastic film on which silicon oxide is vapor-deposited (Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 53-12953), those comprising a plastic film on which aluminum oxide is vapor-deposited (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (KOKAI) No. 58-217344) and so forth are known. These films have a water vapor barrier property of about 1 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day represented in terms of permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The gas barrier performance required for plastic film substrates used for recently developed large-sized liquid crystal displays, high precision displays and so forth is about 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day in terms of water vapor barrier property. Furthermore, development of organic EL displays, high precision color liquid crystal displays and so forth has recently progressed, and therefore required are transparent base materials usable for these having further higher barrier performance, in particular, barrier performance of less than 0.1 g/m<sub>2</sub>/day in terms of water vapor barrier ability, while maintaining transparency. In order to meet such a demand, recently studied is film formation by the sputtering method or CVD method as a means that can be expected to provide higher barrier performance, in which a thin film is formed by using plasma generated by glow discharge under a low pressure condition. Moreover, organic luminescence devices in which a barrier film having an alternate laminate structure of organic layers and inorganic layers is produced by the vacuum deposition method are proposed (e.g., International Patent Application Laid-open Publication in Japanese (KOHYO) No. 2002-532850 (claim 1, FIG. 1)).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in these methods for forming a thin film, an organic substance blown as a vapor of a high temperature condenses on a film and form a thin film, and the film is temporarily heated and causes partial deformation. As a result, the subsequent lamination step becomes uneven, and thus the methods have a problem that they cannot provide sufficient barrier ability. Moreover, in these methods for forming a thin film, the number of the lamination step increases, and thus they have a problem of high cost. Furthermore, when a surface of a plastic substrate showing high water absorption is treated, the absorbed moisture is vaporized, thus it requires long time to obtain vacuum, and therefore there is also a problem that the processing cost becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, as for heat resistance of base material films, for disposing TFT in the production of active matrix type image devices in recent years, heat resistance of a still higher level is required. For example, a method of forming a polycrystalline silicon film at a temperature of 300Â° C. or lower by plasma decomposition of a gas containing SiH<sub>4 </sub>is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (KOKAI) No. 7-81919 (claim 3, [0016] to [0020]). Moreover, a method of forming a semiconductor layer mixed with amorphous silicon and polycrystalline silicon on a polymer substrate at a temperature of 300Â° C. or lower by irradiation of an energy beam is disclosed in International Patent Application Laid-open Publication in Japanese No. 10-512104 [pages 14 to 22, FIG. 1, FIG. 7). Furthermore, a method of forming a polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer on a plastic substrate provided with a thermal buffer layer at a temperature of 300Â° C. or lower by irradiation of a pulsed laser beam is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 11-102867 (claims 1 to 10, [0036]).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, various methods of forming a polycrystalline silicon film for TFT at a temperature of 300Â° C. or lower have been proposed, and therefore it is useful that the base materials have heat resistance for a temperature of 250Â° C. or higher. On the other hand, such methods for forming a semiconductor layer as described above use complicated configurations and apparatuses and require high cost, and therefore heat resistance for a temperature of 300Â° C. to 350Â° C. or higher is desired for plastics substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,026 discloses a heat-resistant substrate having a barrier stack consisting of at least one inorganic layer and at least one polymer layer but it fails to show sufficient heat resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The polymers having a structure represented by the formula (1) or formula (2) used in the present invention may be used independently, and may be used as a mixture of two or more kinds of them. Moreover, they may be homopolymers or copolymers consisting of a combination of two or more kinds of the structures. When a copolymer is used, a known repeating unit not containing a structure represented by the formula (1) or (2) in the repeating unit may be copolymerized within such a degree that the advantages of the present invention should not be degraded. Copolymers more often have improved solubility and transparency compared with homopolymers, and such copolymers can be preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The polymers having a structure represented by the formula (1) or formula (2) used for the present invention preferably has a molecular weight of 10,000 to 500,000, more preferably 20,000 to 300,000, particularly preferably 30,000 to 200,000, in terms of weight average molecular weight. If the molecular weight is 10,000 or more, fabrication of the film becomes easier. On the other hand, if the molecular weight is 500,000 or less, it is easier to control the molecular weight during the synthesis, and handling becomes easier because of low viscosity of solution. The molecular weight may be determined on the basis of corresponding viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the present invention, as the resin used for the base material, curable resins (crosslinked resins) may be also preferably used so long as they have Tg of 250Â° C. or higher, which have superior solvent resistance and heat resistance, in addition to the aforementioned thermoplastic resins. As for the types of the curable resins, both of thermosetting resins and radiation-curable resins can be used, and those of known types can be used without particular limitations. Examples of the thermosetting resins include phenol resins, urea resins, melamine resins, unsaturated polyester resins, epoxy resins, silicone resins, diallyl phthalate resins, furan resins, bismaleimide resins, cyanate resins and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As for the method for crosslinking the aforementioned curable resins, any reactions that form a covalent bond may be used without any particular limitation, and systems in which the reactions proceed at room temperature, such as those utilizing a polyhydric alcohol compound and a polyisocyanate compound to form urethane bonds can also be used without any particular limitation. However, such systems often have a problem concerning the pot life before the film formation, and therefore such systems are usually used as two-pack systems, in which, for example, a polyisocyanate compound is added immediately before the film formation. On the other hand, if a one-pack system is used, it is effective to protect functional groups to be involved in the crosslinking reaction, and such systems are marketed as blocked type curing agents.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Known as the marketed blocked type curing agents are B-882N produced by Mitsui Takeda Chemicals, Inc., Coronate 2513 produced by NIPPON POLYURETHANE INDUSTRY CO., LTD. (these are blocked polyisocyanates), Cymel 303 produced by Mitsui-Cytec Ltd. (methylated melamine resin) and so forth. Moreover, blocked carboxylic acids, which are protected polycarboxylic acids usable as curing agents of epoxy resins, such as B-1 mentioned below are also known.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The radiation curable resins are roughly classified into radical curable resins and cationic curable resins. As a curable component of the radical curable resins, a compound having two or more radically polymerizable groups in the molecule is used, and as typical examples, compounds having 2 to 6 acrylic acid ester groups in the molecule called polyfunctional acrylate monomers, and compounds having two or more acrylic acid ester groups in the molecule called urethane acrylates, polyester acrylates, and epoxy acrylates are used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Typical examples of the method for curing radical curable resins include a method of irradiating an electron ray and a method of irradiating an ultraviolet ray. In the method of irradiating an ultraviolet ray, a polymerization initiator that generates a radical by ultraviolet irradiation is usually added. If a polymerization initiator that generates a radical by heating is added, the resins can also be used as thermosetting resins.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As a curable component of the cationic curable resins, a compound having two or more cationic polymerizable groups in the molecule is used. Typical examples of the curing method include a method of adding a photoacid generator that generates an acid by irradiation of an ultraviolet ray and irradiating an ultraviolet ray to attain curing. Examples of the cationic polymerizable compound include compounds containing a ring opening-polymerizable group such as epoxy group and compounds containing a vinyl ether group.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For the resin base material used for the present invention, a mixture of two or more kinds of resins selected from each type of the aforementioned thermosetting resins and radiation curable resins may be used, and a thermosetting resin and a radiation curable resin may be used together. Further, a mixture of a curable resin (crosslinkable resin) and a resin not having a crosslinkable group may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The aforementioned curable resin (crosslinkable resin) is preferably mixed in the base material used in the present invention, because solvent resistance heat resistance, optical characteristics, and toughness of the base material can be thereby obtained. Moreover, it is also possible to introduce crosslinkable groups into a resin used for the base material, and such a resin may have the crosslinkable group at any of end of polymer main chain, positions in polymer side chain and polymer main chain. When such a resin is used, the base material may be prepared without using the aforementioned commonly used crosslinkable resin together.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the gas barrier film of the present invention is used for liquid crystal displays and so forth, it is preferable to use an amorphous polymer as the resin in order to attain optical uniformity. Furthermore, for the purpose of controlling retardation (Re) and wavelength dispersion thereof, resins having positive and negative intrinsic birefringences may be combined, or a resin showing a larger (or smaller) wavelength dispersion may be combined.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the present invention, a laminate of different resins may be preferably used as the aforementioned resin base material in order to control retardation (Re) or improve gas permeability and dynamic characteristics. No particular limitation is imposed on preferred combinations of different resins, and any combinations of the aforementioned resins can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The resin base material used in the present invention may be stretched. Stretching provides advantages of improvement of mechanical strengths of the film such as anti-folding strength, and thus improvement of handling property of the film. In particular, a film having an orientation release stress (ASTM D1504, henceforth abbreviated as âORSâ) of 0.3 to 3 GPa along the stretching direction is preferred, because mechanical strength of such a film is improved. ORS is internal stress present in a stretched film or sheet generated by stretching.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Known methods can be used for the stretching method, and the stretching can be performed by, for example, the roller monoaxial stretching method, tenter monoaxial stretching method, simultaneous biaxial stretching method, sequential biaxial stretching method, or inflation method at a temperature of from a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the resin by 10Â° C. to a temperature higher than Tg by 50Â° C. The stretching ratio is preferably 1.1 to 3.5 times.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Although the thickness of the resin base material used in the present invention is not particularly limited, it is preferably 30 to 700 Î¼m. more preferably 40 to 200 Î¼m, still more preferably 50 to 150 Î¼m. The haze of the base material is preferably 3% or less, more preferably 2% or less, still more preferably 1% or less. Further, the total light transmission of the base material is preferably 70% or more, more preferably 80% or more, still more preferably 90% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The resin base material used in the present invention may be further added with resin property modifiers such as plasticizers, dyes and pigments, antistatic agents, ultraviolet absorbers, antioxidants, inorganic microparticles, release accelerators, leveling agents, inorganic layered silicate compounds and lubricants as required in such a degree that the advantages of the present invention are not degraded.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">&lt;Inorganic Layer&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the present invention, type and film formation method of the inorganic layer are not particularly limited, and known inorganic layers and film formation methods therefor can be used. The inorganic layer includes an inorganic oxide layer and a transparent conductive layer. Although the film formation method of the inorganic layer may be any method so long as a desired thin film can be formed, the sputtering method, vacuum deposition method, ion plating method, plasma CVD method and so forth are preferred. The film formation can be attained by, for example, the methods described in Japanese Patent No. 3400324, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 2002-322561 and 2002-361774.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although the components constituting the inorganic layer are not particularly limited, for example, oxides, nitrides, oxynitrides etc. containing one or more kinds of elements selected from Si, Al, In, Sn, Zn, Ti, Cu, Ce, Ta and so forth can be used. The thickness of the inorganic layer is not also particularly limited. The thickness of one inorganic layer is preferably in the range of 5 to 1000 nm, more preferably 10 to 1000 nm, particularly preferably 10 to 200 nm. When it is in the range of 5 to 1000 nm, generation of cracks due to bending stress can be avoided and the film can be uniformly distributed without generation of a dot pattern whereby water vapor barrier property is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, when two or more inorganic layers are contained, they may have the same composition or different compositions, and they are not particularly limited. In order to obtain both of water vapor barrier property and high transparency, it is preferable to use silicon oxide or silicon oxynitride in the composition of the inorganic layer. Silicon oxide is represented as SiO<sub>x</sub>. For example, when SiO<sub>x </sub>is used for the inorganic substance layer, x is desirably more than 1.6 and less then 1.9 (1.6&lt;x&lt;1.9) in order to obtain both of favorable water vapor barrier property and high light transmission. Silicon oxynitride is represented as SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>. As for the ratio of x and y, when improvement of adhesion property is emphasized, an oxygen rich film is preferred, and thus it is preferred that x is more than 1 and less than 2, and y is more than 0 and less than 1 (1&lt;x&lt;2, 0&lt;y&lt;1). When improvement of water vapor barrier property is emphasized, a nitrogen rich film is preferred, and thus it is preferred that x is more than 0 and less than 0.8, and y is more than 0.8 and less than 1.3 (0&lt;x&lt;0.8, 0.8&lt;y&lt;1.3).</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The âorganic layerâ referred to in this specification means a layer having a function of compensating defects of the inorganic layer (defect-compensating layer), and it includes an inorganic oxide layer and organic/inorganic hybrid layer formed by a sol-gel method.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After the hydrolysis, a basic compound such as inorganic bases and amines may be added to adjust pH of the solution to make it close to neutral so that condensation polymerization should be promoted. As the inorganic bases, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, ammonia and so forth can be used. As the organic base compounds, amines (ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, triethylamine, dibutylamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, tetramethylethylenediamine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, ethanolamine, diazabicycloundecene, quinuclidine, aniline, pyridine etc.) and phosphines (triphenylphosphine, trimethylphosphine etc.) can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, it is also preferable to use, after the hydrolysis with acids, in particular, the amines described in Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-110061. In such a case, the amines are suitably added in an amount of 1 to 100 moles, preferably 1 to 20 moles, per 1 mole of the acid.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, other sol-gel catalysts, for example, metal chelate compounds having Al, Ti or Zr as a center metal, organic metal compounds such as tin compounds, metal salts such as alkali metal salts of organic acids and so forth can also be used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The content of the sol-gel catalyst compound in the sol-gel reaction composition is 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50% by weight, more preferably 0.5 to 10% by weight, based on the alkoxysilane as a raw material of the sol solution.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Solvents used in the sol-gel reaction will be explained below. The solvents allow all ingredients in the sol solution to be uniformly mixed, thereby make it possible to prepare solid matter in the composition of the present invention and use various coating methods, and improve dispersion stability and storage stability of the composition. These solvents are not particularly limited so long as they can achieve the aforementioned objects. Preferred examples of the solvents include, for example, water and organic solvents showing high water-miscibility.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Examples thereof include tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, formic acid, acetic acid, methyl acetate, alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol), ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, acetic acid ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In order to adjust the sol-gel reaction rate, organic compounds that can constitute multidentate ligands may be added to stabilize the metal alkoxide. Examples thereof include Î²-diketones and/or Î²-ketoesters and alkanolamines. Specific examples of the Î²-diketones and/or Î²-ketoesters include acetylacetone, methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate, n-propyl acetoacetate, isopropyl acetoacetate, n-butyl acetoacetate, sec-butyl acetoacetate, tert-butyl acetoacetate, 2,4-hexanedione, 2,4-heptanedione, 3,5-heptanedione, 2,4-octanedione, 2,4-nonanedione, 5-methylhexanedione and so forth. Among these, ethyl acetoacetate and acetylacetone are preferred, and acetylacetone is particularly preferred. One kind of these Î²-diketones and/or Î²-ketoesters can solely be-used, or two or more kinds of these can be used as a mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the aforementioned metal chelate compounds are used as sol-gel catalysts, these compounds that can be multidentate ligands can also be used to adjust the reaction rate.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A method for coating a sol-gel reaction composition will be described below. A sol solution can be used to form a thin film on a transparent film by using a coating method such as curtain flow coating, dip coating, spin coating or roller coating. In this case, the timing of hydrolysis may be at any time during the production process. For example, there can be suitably used a method in which a solution having a required composition is hydrolyzed and partially condensed to prepare a desired sol solution beforehand, and then it is applied and dried, a method in which a solution having a required composition is prepared, applied and dried while being simultaneously hydrolyzed and partially condensed, a method in which, after a solution is coated and primarily dried, a water-containing solution necessary for hydrolysis is overlaid to attain the hydrolysis, and so forth. Further, various application methods can be used. When productivity is emphasized, a method in which the discharge flow rates of a lower layer coating solution and an upper layer coating solution are adjusted in a slide geeser having multiple discharge ports so that requited coating amounts of the solutions should be obtained, and the formed multilayer flows are continuously placed on a support and dried (simultaneous multilayer coating method) is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The temperature for drying after the coating of the sol-gel reaction composition is 150 to 350Â° C., preferably 150 to 250Â° C., more preferably 150 to 200Â° C. If the drying temperature after the coating is 150 to 350Â° C., a denser film can be prepared, and interactions with inorganic oxide interface can be promoted to improve the gas barrier ability.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In order to make the gas barrier film further denser after the coating and drying, an energy beam may be irradiated on the organic layer. Although type of the irradiation beam is not particularly limited, irradiation of ultraviolet rays, electron beams or microwaves can be preferably used in view of influence on deformation and degeneration of the base material. The irradiation intensity is 30 to 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably 50 to 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The irradiation temperature may be selected from the range of from room temperature to the temperature at which the substrate begins to deform without any particular limitation, and it is preferably 30 to 150Â° C., more preferably 50 to 130Â° C.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(2) Method of Coating or Vapor-depositing an Organic substance to form a layer and then curing the layer with an ultraviolet ray or electron beam</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Hereafter, use of an organic layer formed with a polymer obtained by crosslinking monomers as a main component will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although the monomers are not particularly limited so long as they have a group that can be crosslinked with an ultraviolet ray or electron beam, monomers having an acryloyl group, methacryloyl group or oxetane group are preferably used. As for such monomers, it is preferable to use, as a main component, for example, polymers obtained by polymerizing monomers of bifunctionality or higher functionality having acryloyl group or methacryloyl group such as epoxy (meth)acrylate, urethane (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylic isocyanurate, pentaerythritol (meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane (meth)acrylate, ethylene glycol (meth)acrylate, and polyester (meth)acrylate. A mixture of two or more kinds of these monomers of bifunctionality or higher functionality having acryloyl group or methacryloyl group may be used, or a monofunctional (meth)acrylate may be mixed and used. As for the monomers having oxetane group, those having the structures represented by the formulas (3) to (6) mentioned in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2002-356607 are preferably used. Arbitrary mixtures of these monomers may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">It is further preferable to use acrylic isocyanurate, epoxy acrylate or urethane acrylate, which has a particularly high crosslinking degree and Tg of 250Â° C. or higher, as a main component in view of heat resistance and solvent resistance required for use in displays.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the present invention, although the thickness of one organic layer is not particularly limited, it is preferably in the range of 10 nm to 5 Î¼m, more preferably 10 nm to 2 Î¼m, still more preferably 200 nm to 2 Î¼m. If the thickness of the organic layer is in the range of 10 nm to 5 Î¼m, it becomes easy to obtain uniformity of the thickness because structural defects of the inorganic layer are efficiently filled with the organic layer. Furthermore, generation of cracks in the organic layer by an external force such as bending forth can be avoided and improvement in barrier property is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Examples of the method of forming the organic layer in the present invention include an application method, vacuum film formation method and so forth. Although the vacuum film formation method is not particularly limited, vapor deposition, plasma CVD and so forth are preferred, and the resistance heating vapor deposition method is more preferred, in which film formation rate of organic monomers is easily controlled. Although the method of crosslinking the organic monomers of the present invention is not limited at all, crosslinking by means of an electron ray, ultraviolet ray or the like is desirable for the reasons that equipment for it is easily disposed in a vacuum chamber, and it rapidly provides a higher molecular weight by the crosslinking reactions. When the organic layer is formed by an application method, conventionally used various application methods such as spray coating, spin coating and bar coating can be used.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&lt;Functional Layer&gt;</p>

Examples include, for example, metal oxide films such as those of indium oxide, cadmium oxide, and tin oxide added with tin, tellurium, cadmium, molybdenum, tungsten, fluorine or the like as impurities, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and so forth added with aluminum as impurities. In particular, thin films of indium oxide containing 2 to 15 weight % of tin oxide (ITO) have superior transparency and conductivity, and therefore they are preferably used. Examples of the method of forming the transparent conductive layer include the vacuum deposition method, sputtering method, ion beam sputtering method and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The film thickness of the transparent conductive layer is preferably in the range of 15 to 300 nm. If the film thickness of the transparent conductive layer is 15 to 300 nm, the film becomes a continuous film, and sufficient conductivity, transparency and flexibility can be obtained.</p>

In view of adhesion to the base material, it is preferred that the inorganic layer and the organic layer should be laminated on the base material in this order. Further, it is preferable to further alternately laminate one or more inorganic layers and one or more organic layers on the aforementioned inorganic layer or organic layer, because the gas barrier performance is thereby increased.</p>

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In Example 1, a polyimide film (UPILEX-R, Ube Industries) having a thickness of 100 Î¼m (Tg: 285Â° C.) was used as a plastic base material for the present invention. In the comparative example, a polyethersulfone (PES) film having a thickness of 100 Î¼m (Tg: 220Â° C.) and a ZEONOA film having a thickness of 100 Î¼m (Tg: 160Â° C.) were used as a plastic base material.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">1. Preparation of Inorganic Oxide Layer</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an inorganic layer was prepared by using a roll-to-roll type sputtering apparatus <b>1</b>. This apparatus <b>1</b> had a vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, and a drum <b>3</b> for cooling a plastic film (base material) <b>6</b> by contact on the surface was disposed at the center of the chamber. Further, a feeding roller <b>4</b> and rolling-up roller <b>5</b> for winding the plastic film <b>6</b> were disposed in the aforementioned vacuum chamber <b>2</b>. The plastic film <b>6</b> wound around the feeding roller <b>4</b> was wound around the drum <b>3</b> via a guide roller <b>7</b>, and further the plastic film <b>6</b> was wound around a roller <b>5</b> via a guide roller <b>8</b>. As for a vacuum pumping system, the gas in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> was always evacuated by the vacuum pumps <b>10</b> from exhaust ports <b>9</b>. As for a film formation system, a target (not shown) was placed on a cathode <b>12</b> connected to an electric discharge power source <b>11</b> of the direct current system, which could apply pulse electric power. This electric discharge power source <b>11</b> was connected to a controller <b>13</b>, and this controller <b>13</b> was further connected to a gas flow control unit <b>14</b>, which supplied reactive gas to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> through a piping <b>15</b> while controlling the introduced gas volume. Further, the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> was designed so that an electric discharge gas could be supplied to the chamber at a constant flow rate (not shown). Hereafter, specific conditions will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Si was set as a target, and a DC power source of the pulse applying type was prepared as the electric discharge power source <b>11</b>. As the plastic film <b>6</b>, the polyimide film having a thickness of 100 Î¼m mentioned above was used, and this film was put on the feeding roller <b>4</b>, and led to the winding roller <b>5</b>. After the preparation of the base material in the sputtering apparatus <b>1</b> was finished, a door of the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> was closed, and the vacuum pump was operated to start evacuation and cooling of the drum. When the reached pressure became 4Ã10<sup>â4 </sup>Pa, and the drum temperature became 5Â° C., running of the plastic film <b>6</b> was started. Argon was introduced as the electric discharge gas, and the electric discharge power source <b>11</b> was turned on to generate plasma on the Si target at an electric discharge power of 5 kW and a film formation pressure of 0.3 Pa and thereby perform presputtering for 3 minutes. Then, oxygen was introduced as a reactive gas. After the discharge was stabilized, argon and oxygen gas volumes were gradually decreased to lower the film formation pressure to 0.1 Pa. After stability of the discharge at 0.1 Pa was confirmed, formation of a silicon oxide film was performed for a certain period of time. After completion of the film formation, the internal pressure of the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> was returned to the atmospheric pressure, and the film on which the silicon oxide film was formed was taken out.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in Table 1, when the polyimide having Tg of 250Â° C. or higher was used as the resin of the film base material (Films 1A to 1C), the oxygen permeability was lower than 0.15 mL/m<sup>2</sup>Â·dayÂ·atm, and the water vapor permeability was lower than 0.30 g/m<sup>2</sup>Â·day. On the other hand, when the polyethersulfon and ZEONOA having Tg lower than 250Â° C. was used (Films 1D to 1I), the oxygen permeability was higher than 0.20 mL/m<sup>2</sup>Â·dayÂ·atm, and the water vapor permeability became higher than 0.48 g/m<sup>2</sup>Â·day. Further, for the cases using the polyimide having Tg of 250Â° C. or higher, when a drying temperature for the organic layer of 150Â° C. or higher was used (Films 1B and 1C), the oxygen permeability and water vapor permeability were markedly improved compared with those obtained with the drying temperature lower than 150Â° C. (Film 1A). Furthermore, the films having only one of the organic layer and inorganic layer on the film base material (Films 1J and 1K) provided only high oxygen permeability and high water vapor permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">From the above, it can be seen that the gas barrier film of the present invention has superior gas barrier performance because it uses a film substrate having Tg of 250Â° C. and a combination of the inorganic layer and organic layer. Further, it can be seen that the gas barrier film of the present invention can have further superior gas barrier performance when the temperature of the drying step for the organic layer prepared by the sol-gel method is 150Â° C, or higher.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">From the results shown in Table 4, it can be seen that, in the present invention, a film in which a sol-gel layer is provided and then an inorganic oxide layer is vapor-deposited like Film 4A shows more superior gas barrier performance compared with Film 4B in which a sol-gel layer is not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In addition, gas permeability was also measured for a gas barrier film prepared in the same manner as Film 4A except that an organic layer was formed by the method of Example 2 on the film substrate instead of the sol-gel layer. However, such marked improvement effect as in Film 4A having a sol-gel layer could not be obtained.</p>
