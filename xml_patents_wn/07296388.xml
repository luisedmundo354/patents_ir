<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a skylight having a plastic frame.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Skylights have been used to allow light into residential and commercial buildings through an opening. The aesthetic value and possible health benefits of having sunlight in buildings have lead to an increasing demand for these structures. Ideally, a skylight will let light in while keeping other environmental elements out. However, since the installation of a skylight requires that an opening be cut in a roof, sealing such units has presented numerous challenges.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Popular skylight configurations include, for example, fixed skylights with flat or domed-shaped glass, ventilation skylights, egress skylights, and balcony skylights. In the fixed skylight configuration, the skylight functions essentially as a window that does not open. Ventilation skylights are similar, but may be opened a few inches to allow air circulation. Ventilation skylights may be opened by a pole or by a small electric motor. Egress roof skylights are capable of being opened by a sufficient amount for a person to move through. Balcony roof skylights which are usually installed on relatively steep roofs open to form a small balcony on which a person may stand.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the typical fixed skylight installation a rectangular opening is cut in a roof. This opening will go through the plywood sheets in the roof. A curb unit is then attached to the plywood sheets of the roof. The external curb surfaces are then flashed with either roof boards or metal sheets to provide a leak-tight seal between the curb and roof. The skylight frame is then attached to the top surface of the curb unit. The skylight frame will usually have one or more glass panels surrounded by an aluminum trim frame. The glass panels are separated by a spacer which seals the interior cavity between the panels. The configuration for the glass panels is the same as that typically used in insulated window constructions. Transparent plastic panels may be used instead of glass panels. Additionally, the panels may be domed-shaped if desired. Such curbs are usually made of wood with a metal flashing along the sides of the curb. Generally, these curbs are fabricated on-site during the installation of the skylight. For stationary skylights, a leak tight seal will be formed between the skylight and the curb. Over time this leak tight seal often degrades and leaks. Furthermore, the application of a sealant to the curb may cause complications with the skylight manufacture tolerances by leaving a space between the metal flashing along the sides of the curb and the top of the curb. Foamed tapes have been used in place of sealants. However, such tapes do not adhere as well as sealants. Gaskets have been applied to both seal the skylight frame to a curb and to file the space between the metal flashing and the curb. Such configurations tend to be expensive and require rather strict tolerances. Moreover, the gasket can not be modified on-site.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Skylights have been formed with components made by reaction injection molding (“RIM”). U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,531 (“the '531 patent”) discloses a framed insulating glass unit with an integral skylight frame and an integral curb made by the RIM process. In the framed insulating glass unit of the '531 patent, two glass plates are molded into a frame member by a polyurethane RIM process. RIM is a process of molding plastic parts using liquid monomers. It is capable of forming solid or foam parts that can vary from being flexible to extremely rigid. Polyurethanes are probably the most common plastics from which parts are made by the RIM process. RIM polyurethane is made by combining an isocyanate and a polyol.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the typical RIM process, the liquids are pumped into and combined in a mixer under a pressure between about 1,500 and 3,000 psi. The liquids are then introduced into the mold under a low pressure (about 1 atm). An exothermic chemical reaction occurs in the mold causing the liquid to solidify without heating or cooling. Parts fabricated by RIM offer several advantages over other molding processes. Although parts produced by RIM are similar to parts made by injection molding, RIM parts may be made with shorter production time and less cost. Furthermore, RIM does not require high temperatures or pressures typical of injection molding thereby making it possible to make the molds out of inexpensive materials such as aluminum. However, the RIM process presents a number of considerations that complicates part fabrication. For example, the processing temperature, pressure and viscosity must be accurately controlled since the polymerization of the monomers takes place in the mold. Furthermore, the mixing head must be completely purged after each part is formed to prevent clogging. Finally, the relatively protracted cycle times for forming larger parts and the limited choices of polymers (mostly polyurethanes) make RIM a somewhat undesirable process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved skylight that is inexpensive to fabricate with a minimal number of seamed junctions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention overcomes the prior art by providing a skylight frame-curb assembly adapted to receive at least two panels of glass. The skylight frame-curb assembly of the present invention comprises a quadrilateral frame and a stepped frame section that is integral to the quadrilateral frame. The stepped frame surface includes a lower step surface and an upper step surface. The lower step surface is adapted to receive a first glass panel so that a section of the first glass panel lies flush against the lower step surface. Similarly, the upper step surface is adapted to receive a second glass panel so that the second glass panel lies flush against the upper step surface. The first glass panel is characterized by a first length and a first width and the second glass panel is characterized by a second length and a second width, such that the first length is less than the second length and the first width is less than second width. The first and second glass panels are advantageously combined together in an insulated glass unit. The frame curb assembly further includes a curb section which is integral to the quadrilateral frame. The curb section includes a surface that is adapted to lie on a roof to which it is flashed in a leak tight manner by methods known to one skilled in the art of skylight installation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the invention, a skylight frame adapted to be attached to a curb is provided. The skylight frame includes a stepped frame section including a lower step surface and an upper step surface. Again, the lower step surface is adapted to receive a first glass panel so that a section of the first glass panel lies flush against the lower step surface. Similarly, the upper step surface is adapted to receive a second glass panel so that the second glass panel lies flush against the upper step surface. The first and second glass panels are advantageously combined together in an insulated glass unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment of the present invention, a skylight frame-curb assembly having a U-shaped trough with a mounting flange extending from one side of the U-shaped trough is provided. The skylight frame-curb assembly of this embodiment also includes the stepped frame section as described above. The trough of the present embodiment is filled with a foamed plastic in order to provide rigidity while reducing the weight of the skylight frame-curb assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment of the present invention, a skylight frame having one or more central support members is provided. The sides of the frame of this embodiment also include the stepped frame section described above. The one or more central support members include a lower step surface for receiving a lower glass panel. In this embodiment several lower glass panels are mounted between the lower step surfaces of the sides and the central support member. The upper glass surface in this design is a single glass panel which is received by the upper step surface of the sides. The upper glass panel also rests on the upper surface of the central support member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment of the present invention, a skylight frame-curb assembly fabricated by the RIM process is provided. In this embodiment, one or more glass panels are molded into the skylight frame section during formation of the skylight frame. The skylight frame assembly includes a frame section with slot adapted to hold one or more glass panels.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In still another embodiment of the present invention, an injection molded skylight curb unit is provided. The skylight curb unit includes four hollow sides that define a substantially rectangular or square opening. A flexible apron extends outwardly from the sides to provide a surface that is adapted to be placed on a rooftop. The side of the apron opposing the roof may be sealed to the roof and the entire apron flashed to a roof by methods known to those in the art of skylight installation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method of making a skylight frame is provided. The method of this embodiment comprises extruding a plastic channel with a stepped frame section integral to a lower curb portion. The frame section is similar to that set forth above. The plastic channel is then cut into four side sections which are then combined together to form the skylight frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference will now be made in detail to presently preferred compositions or embodiments and methods of the invention, which constitute the best modes of practicing the invention presently known to the inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment of the present invention, a skylight frame-curb assembly adapted to receive at least two panels of glass is provided. The skylight frame-curb assembly of the present invention comprises a quadrilateral frame with an integral stepped frame section. The quadrilateral frame is preferably substantially rectangular. The stepped frame surface includes a lower step surface and an upper step surface. The lower step surface is adapted to receive a first glass panel so that a section of the first glass panel lies flush against the lower step surface. Similarly, the upper step surface is adapted to receive a second glass panel so that the second glass panel lies flush against the upper step surface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a perspective view of a cross-section and a top view of the skylight frame-curb assembly of the present invention is provided. Skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> includes sides <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> which define opening <b>12</b>. Opening <b>12</b> is of appropriate size to line up with a skylight opening curb into a roof. Sides <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> each include stepped frame section <b>14</b> and curb section <b>16</b> which are integral to skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b>. Stepped frame section <b>14</b> includes lower step surface <b>18</b> and an upper step surface <b>20</b>. Lower step surface <b>18</b> is adapted to receive glass surface <b>22</b> of glass panel <b>24</b> and upper step surface <b>20</b> is adapted to receive glass surface <b>26</b> of glass panel <b>28</b>. Specifically, glass peripheral surface <b>30</b> opposes lower step surface <b>18</b> and glass peripheral surface <b>32</b> opposes upper stepped surface <b>20</b>. Glass panel <b>24</b> is characterized by a first length and a first width and glass panel <b>28</b> is characterized by a second length and a second width, such that the first length is less than the second length and the first width is less than second width. Preferably, glass panel <b>24</b> and glass panel <b>28</b> are combined together in insulated glass unit <b>34</b> with a spacer <b>36</b>. Alternatively, glass panel <b>24</b> and glass panel <b>28</b> are laminated together like an automobile windshield. Suitable laminates include, for example, polyvinylbutyral. Lamination of glass panels <b>24</b>, <b>28</b> provide added protection from glass breakage. Stepped frame section <b>14</b> corresponds in shape to the edge detail and thickness of the insulating glass unit (or the laminated glass unit) so that the insulating glass unit is mounted flush.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The skylight of the present design lends itself to a wide array of aesthetic appearances. The insulated glass units can be fabricated using colored glass to achieve a desired color and thermal properties. Alternatively, one or more surfaces of glass panels <b>24</b> and <b>28</b> may be coated with thin films to alter the appearance of the skylight or to provide solar control properties. For example, in northern climates a low E coating is applied to one or more of the glass surfaces. In southern climates, reflective coatings capable of rejecting 80-90% of the radiant energy could be utilized to minimize air conditioning costs. Furthermore, the color of the glass panel on the peripheral portion can be selected to provide the desired aesthetic appearance. Curb section <b>16</b> optionally includes a number of bolt holes <b>37</b> so that skylight frame curb assembly <b>2</b> may be attached to a roof. During installation, curb section <b>16</b> will be flashed to the roof by methods known to those skilled in the art of skylight installation. Skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> optionally includes trim strip <b>38</b> which can be provided at the overlap of insulated glass unit <b>34</b> and skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> may be formed from any suitable material which supplies suitable mechanical stiffness and resistance to deterioration from environment factors such as temperature, humidity, sun light, air, rain, snow, hail, and the like. Suitable materials include for example various plastics, wood, and metals. The preferred materials are plastics and in particular thermoplastic resins such as polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon. When a plastic is utilized to mold skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> a glass fiber reinforcement filler may be used in the plastic composition selected in order to minimize the thermal expansion of skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b>. Skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> may be formed by a number of different molding processes. For example, skylight frame-curb <b>2</b> may be formed by injection molding, vacuum molding, compression molding, or by RIM. The preferred molding process is chosen to improve strength and to minimize part weight and to provide optimum thermal insulation qualities. To this end, skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> optionally includes one or more hollow cores <b>39</b> that may be filled with foamed plastic <b>40</b>. Skylight frame-curb assemblies with hollow cavities may be made by gas assisted injection molding which uses a conventional injection molding press equipped with a spillover control and a mold equipped with gas injection and spillover points. Suitable gas assisted injection molding processes which may be used to form the skylight frame-curb assembly of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,019,918. The entire disclosure of this patent is hereby incorporated by reference. The foam material is then introduced through inlet holes after the frame is molded. Alternatively, the part can be molded utilizing a plastic foaming agent, the surface of the plastic part having a smooth uniform skin while the inner core contains a series of gas bubbles forming a rigid foam or sponge-like core. The skylight frame-curb assembly may also be made by compression molding using either sheet molding compound (“SMC”) or bulk molding compound.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Insulating glass unit <b>34</b> is bonded to stepped flange section <b>14</b> of skylight frame-curb assembly <b>2</b> utilizing adhesives in a manner similar to mounting a flush glazed windshield in an automobile. Preferably, glass surface <b>26</b> of the glass panel <b>28</b> has a peripheral edge painted to provide an aesthetic detail as well as improve the adhesion of the bond between the glass pane <b>28</b> and frame curb assembly <b>2</b>. Optionally, grooves <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be formed on lower step surface <b>18</b> and upper step surface <b>20</b> in order to provide a relatively thick bead of adhesive in order to accommodate some slight relative movement due to the differential thermal expansion of insulated glass unit <b>34</b> in order to further minimize the mold expansion problems.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cross-section of a skylight frame-curb assembly with an attached laminated glass sheet is provided. In this variation glass panel <b>24</b> and glass panel <b>28</b> are laminated together with laminate layer <b>50</b>. Glass panel <b>28</b> is slightly larger than glass panel <b>24</b>. Glass edge <b>30</b> opposes lower step surface <b>18</b> and glass edge <b>30</b> opposes upper stepped surface <b>20</b>. In this variation, height <b>52</b> must be of appropriate dimensions to allow an effective seal when an adhesive is applied to lower set surface <b>18</b> and upper step surface <b>20</b>. Generally, height <b>52</b> will be several millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of the present invention in which the stepped frame section is on a separate part from the curb is provided.

Glass panel <b>24</b> is characterized by a first length and a first width and glass panel <b>28</b> is characterized by a second length and a second width, such that the first length is less than the second length and the first width is less than second width. Preferably, glass panel <b>24</b> and glass panel <b>28</b> are combined together in insulating glass unit <b>34</b> or a laminated glass unit as set forth above. Frame <b>60</b> may be formed from the same materials and by the same molding processes as set forth above. Frame <b>60</b> is attached to curb <b>62</b>. This attachment may be accomplished by means known to one skilled in the art of skylight installation. Preferably, frame <b>60</b> is bolted to curb <b>62</b> by bolts <b>64</b>. Optionally, a sealant may be placed on one or more of seams <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> to reduce the possibility of water leaking from the skylight. The frame assembly of this embodiment allows insulated glass unit <b>34</b> and frame <b>60</b> to be replaced in the event a window is damaged during or after construction. This is to be contrasted with a damaged insulated glass unit for the design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, which would require replacement in a manner similar to the replacement of an automobile windshield. The two piece design of the present embodiment enables a less skilled person to do the window replacement by unbolting frame <b>60</b> and replacing the whole unit—frame <b>60</b> and insulated glass unit <b>34</b>. Moreover, insulated glass unit and frames can be made standard sizes and matched up with curbs of a selected height and thermal quality for the specific market.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cross-section of another embodiment of the present invention in which the frame curb assembly has a U-shaped trough with a mounting flange extending from one side of the U-shaped trough is provided.

As set forth above, stepped frame section <b>14</b> includes lower step surface <b>18</b> and upper step surface <b>20</b>. Again, lower step surface <b>18</b> is adapted to receive glass surface <b>22</b> of glass panel <b>24</b> and upper step surface <b>20</b> is adapted to receive glass surface <b>26</b> of glass panel <b>28</b>. Glass panel <b>24</b> is characterized by a first length and a first width and glass panel <b>28</b> is characterized by a second length and a second width, such that the first length is less than the second length and the first width is less than second width. Preferably, glass panel <b>24</b> and glass panel <b>28</b> are combined together in insulated glass unit <b>34</b> with a spacer <b>36</b>. Skylight frame-curb assembly include sides <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> which define trough <b>78</b>. Curb section <b>80</b> includes mounting flange <b>82</b> which extends from the bottom of side <b>72</b>. Ribs <b>84</b> extend from bottom surface <b>86</b> of mounting flange <b>82</b> to provide stiffness. Skylight frame-curb assembly <b>70</b> may be formed by the same molding processes as described above which include injection molding from thermoplastic resins or by RIM. After skylight frame-curb assembly <b>70</b> is molded, trough <b>78</b> is filled with foamed plastic <b>88</b> in a second operation. Foamed plastic <b>88</b> provides rigidity to skylight frame-curb assembly <b>70</b> as well as good thermal insulation. Glass panels <b>24</b>, <b>28</b> are installed in a similar manner to the installation of an automobile windshield. Accordingly, an adhesive is applied between glass edge <b>30</b> and lower step surface <b>18</b> and between glass edge <b>32</b> and upper stepped surface <b>34</b>.</p>
