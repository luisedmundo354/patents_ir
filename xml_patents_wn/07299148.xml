<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to methods and apparatus for measuring substantially correct parameter data for processing workpieces, more particularly, to processing workpieces for electronic device fabrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The processing of workpieces for the production of high value products requires accurate measurements of the process parameters for optimization and precise control of the processing steps. The accuracy and reliability of the parameter measurements are critical factors in determining the process capability and product yield.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Descriptions of some of the available technologies and sensor apparatuses for measuring process parameters are available in the technical and patent literature. Examples of some of the technologies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,945, U.S. Pat. No. 6,738,722, U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,068, U.S. Pat. No. 6,542,835, U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,121, U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,443, U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,922, U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,349, U.S. Pat. No. 5,967,661, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,907,820; all of these patents are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by this reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some of the available technologies use an electronics module that is coupled to the detectors on a support; the sensors and electronics module are part of a single unit that is exposed to the process conditions that are to be measured. The electronics module is necessary for a sensor apparatus with capabilities such as autonomous information processing capability, wireless communication capability, and other electronically controlled on-board capabilities. For some applications, the presence of the electronics module can produce distortions in the parameter measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Of course, the module distortion effect may be ignored if a high degree of measurement accuracy is unnecessary. However, some of the critical process steps required for processing high-value workpieces such as semiconductor wafers for electronic devices and optical devices and substrates for flatpanel display fabrication do indeed require high accuracy for the measurements of the process parameters. For such applications, measurements of a parameter such as temperature need to be extremely accurate, particularly for temperature uniformity across the area of the workpiece. Furthermore, applications involved with the manufacture, calibration, research, and development of process equipment for processing high value substrates require high accuracy measurements since the operation of the equipment can be limited by the accuracy of the measurements. Inaccurate data can result in the loss of millions of dollars of product in some instances. Alternatively, the inaccurate data can result in the production of products having poorer performance because the process conditions were optimized based on the inaccurate data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are numerous applications requiring high accuracy methods and apparatuses for obtaining data such as spatially resolved and/or time resolved process parameter measurements with low parameter distortion. An example of an important application is the uniform processing of workpieces such as semiconductor wafers, flatpanel displays, and lithography masks. Furthermore, there is a need for high accuracy methods and apparatus capable of collecting process data in a substantially nonperturbing manner on process equipment running realistic process conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention seeks to provide methods and apparatus that can improve the accuracy of measured parameter data used for processing workpieces. One aspect of the present invention includes methods of measuring process conditions with low distortion of the measurements caused by the measuring apparatus. The measurements include data for applications such as data for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing processes and process tools. Another aspect of the present invention includes apparatus for measuring substantially correct data for applications such as generating data for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing processes and process tools.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. In addition, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out aspects of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The operation of embodiments of the present invention will be discussed below primarily in the context of processes for electronic device fabrication such as those used for processing semiconductor devices, lithography masks, and flatpanel displays. In addition, much of the description is presented for the application of measuring temperature as the process characteristic. However, it is to be understood that embodiments in accordance with the present invention may be used for measuring process characteristics and generating response models for essentially any processing step involving a workpiece subjected to potential temporal and/or spatial variations in process conditions that may be a function of temperature. Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the measurement of temperature nor are they limited to applications of electronic device fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following description of the figures, identical reference numerals have been used when designating substantially identical elements or steps that are common to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where there is shown a block diagram for a sensor apparatus <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Sensor apparatus <b>100</b> is configured so as to be capable of measuring parameter data for processing a workpiece. Sensor apparatus <b>100</b> includes a base <b>110</b>, a sensor, preferably a plurality of sensors <b>120</b> supported on or in the base, and an electronics module <b>130</b>. Electronics module <b>130</b> includes electronic components <b>134</b> and an electronics module support structure <b>138</b>. In a preferred embodiment, electronic components <b>134</b> contain an information processor and additional electronic components that may be needed for the operation of the information processor. In general, electronics module <b>130</b> may contain a power source for the information processor. Electronics module <b>130</b> may also contain components for transmitting and receiving information such as, for example, components for wireless communication. Preferably, electronics module <b>130</b> comprises a printed circuit board for interconnecting the components of the electronics module and connecting the electronics module to the at least one sensor or sensors <b>120</b>. Sensors <b>120</b> are connected with the information processor so as to allow signals generated by sensors <b>120</b> to be provided as input to the information processor. In other words, one embodiment of the present invention is an electronics module obtained using a method of interconnecting the components of the electronics module and connecting the electronics module to sensors <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Optionally, for some embodiments of the present invention for semiconductor processing applications, base <b>110</b> comprises a semiconductor wafer. Similarly, for flatpanel display applications, base <b>110</b> may comprise a flatpanel display substrate; for lithography mask applications, base <b>110</b> may comprise a lithography mask substrate. In preferred embodiments, base <b>110</b> is a structure such as a semiconductor wafer, a lithography mask substrate, and a flat panel display substrate. Generally, based <b>110</b> is configured so as to substantially mimic the workpiece; more preferably, base <b>110</b> comprises the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Sensors <b>120</b> are designed to provide an electrical signal proportional to some basic, local process parameter that is representative of the process and process tool. Examples of process parameters of importance for applications such as semiconductor processing and flatpanel display processing include temperature, bow, stress/strain, etch rate, deposition rate, radio frequency (RF) field, plasma potential, thermal flux, ion flux, electromagnetic flux such as light, and any process parameter that is a function of temperature or is affected by temperature of the sensor apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Examples of typical sensor types include: Resistance Temperature Device (RTD) sensors for temperature measurement; thermistors for temperature measurement; defined area probes for measuring plasma potential and measuring ion flux; Van der Pauw crosses for measuring etch rate; isolated field transistors for measuring plasma potential; and current loops for measuring ion flux and measuring RF field. The numbers and types of sensors are selected based upon the specific application and process requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For the case of measuring temperatures using a sensor apparatus, the presence of the electronics module will distort the temperature field being measured. It is possible to reduce the distortion by reducing the amount of energy flow into the electronics module from base <b>110</b>, by reducing the thermal capacity of the electronics module and increasing the thermal resistance between base <b>110</b> and electronics module <b>130</b>. The reduction of thermal capacity of electronics module <b>130</b> can be implemented by a) using very small components in the electronics components <b>134</b>, thereby reducing module's overall size and hence thermal capacity, b) reducing the surface area and thickness of the electronics module support <b>138</b>, again reducing thermal capacity, c) providing for open sides in the electronics module support <b>138</b>, providing for no trapped gas and allowing convective heating of the exposed components. Additionally, convective heating of the electronic components <b>134</b> reduces the amount of energy drawn directly from base <b>110</b>. The increase of the thermal resistance between base <b>110</b> and electronics module <b>130</b> can be implemented by a) reduction of surface contact area and elimination of adhesives between electronics module support <b>138</b> and base <b>110</b>, b) reduction of the surface contact area between the electronic components <b>134</b> and the electronics module support <b>138</b>. In reality, the module distortion effect cannot be entirely removed. However, embodiments of the present invention provide methods and apparatus for minimizing the distortion effect.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment of the present invention, electronics module support structure <b>138</b> is configured so as to have a low thermal capacity and high thermal resistance relative to the base <b>110</b> for temperature equilibration for electronics module <b>130</b>. As a consequence, electronics module support structure <b>138</b> is configured so as to maximize the time constant for the temperature equilibration for electronic components <b>134</b>. Configuring electronics module <b>130</b> so as to have a low thermal mass minimizes the possible magnitude of the temperature distortion. Configuring electronics module <b>130</b> so as to have a longer time constant for temperature equilibration reduces the amplitude of the distortion and reduces the rate of heating of electronic components <b>134</b>. This means that by lengthening the time constant one can improve the sensor performance during the early transient heating phase, and typically conclude the entire measurement cycle before electronic components <b>134</b> have reached undesirably high temperatures. In other words, the impact of the temperature distortion is suppressed so as to leave the transient temperature or temperature related information substantially unperturbed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment of the present invention, electronics module support structure <b>138</b> is configured so that the support structure has at least one of: a thermal resistance so that the measurements are substantially unperturbed by the presence of the electronics module and the electronics module is substantially undamaged by heat transferred from the base to the electronics module; and a thermal mass so that the measurements from the sensors are substantially unperturbed by the presence of the electronics module. The electronics module is configured so as to have heat transfer properties and heat capacity properties sufficient to substantially prevent thermal distortion of measurements made by the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For some applications, there may be a consequence as a result of the high thermal resistance between base <b>110</b> and electronics module <b>130</b> caused by the increased time constant for temperature equilibration of electronic components <b>134</b>. More specifically, the electronics module may remain at temperatures that are different from those of the base. This temperature difference may be undesirable for some applications. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the properties of the electronics module are selected so that the electronics module reaches an equilibrium temperature that is substantially the same as the temperature of the base while exchanging a minimum amount of heat with the base. In one arrangement, the electronics module may draw heat by convection from surrounding gas.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For one embodiment of the present invention, electronic components <b>134</b> include a battery for providing power to the information processor and other electronic components needing power. Some commercially available batteries suitable for use in embodiments of the present invention are temperature sensitive. For example, some batteries cannot operate at high temperatures; the performance of some batteries is eroded by rapid temperature variations of the battery. Other elements of electronic components <b>134</b> may also be temperature sensitive. In other words, it is preferable in sensor apparatus technology to avoid high temperatures or rapid temperature excursions for electronics module <b>134</b>. Configuring electronics module <b>130</b> so as to have a long time constant for temperature equilibration helps to alleviate some of the problems with the temperature sensitivity of electronic components <b>134</b>; this benefit is achieved in addition to reducing the temperature distortion of the measurements as a result of the presence of the electronics module. This also means that a temperature sensitive battery is now only slowly heated and cooled, thus prolonging the battery lifetime and reducing the cost of ownership for the sensor apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where there is shown a top view of a sensor apparatus <b>140</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention.

Base <b>112</b> comprises a substantially whole semiconductor wafer such as a silicon wafer and such as a gallium arsenide wafer. Sensors <b>120</b> and electronics module <b>130</b> are supported on base <b>112</b>. Base <b>112</b>, sensors <b>120</b>, and electronics module <b>130</b> are essentially the same as those described for the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, electronics module <b>130</b> is configured so as to have a low thermal mass and a long time constant for temperature equilibration.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A variety of configurations may be used for the electronics module in embodiments of the present invention.

A diagram of a side view of a sensor apparatus <b>150</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Sensor apparatus <b>150</b> includes a base <b>112</b>, sensors <b>120</b>, and an electronics module that includes an electronics module support structure <b>152</b> and electronic components <b>155</b>. Electronics module support structure <b>152</b> is shown supporting electronic components <b>155</b> above base <b>112</b>. In other words, support structure <b>152</b> separates electronic components <b>155</b> from base <b>112</b>, and support structure <b>152</b> physically connects base <b>112</b> and electronics components <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For embodiments of the present invention, support structure <b>152</b> does not have the requirements of including electronic components like those of electronic components <b>155</b>. Consequently, it is preferred that support structure <b>152</b> is configured so that it has a low mass and a low specific heat capacity so as to provide a low heat capacity for the part of the electronics module that physically contacts base <b>112</b>. The rate of heat transfer from base <b>112</b> is reduced further by having support structure <b>152</b> configured so as to have a low thermal conductivity and configured so as to have a small area of contact with base <b>112</b> so as to yield a low rate of heat transfer. Preferably, support structure <b>152</b> is configured so as to have a high heat transfer contact resistance between support structure <b>152</b> and base <b>112</b>; the support structure is configured so as to have heat transfer properties and heat capacity properties sufficient to substantially prevent thermal distortion of measurements made by the plurality of sensors. In other words, a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes support structure <b>152</b> configured so as to have a low mass, a low specific heat capacity, a low thermal conductivity, a high thermal contact resistance, and a small contact area with base <b>112</b>.</p>

Sensor apparatus <b>160</b> includes a base <b>112</b>, sensors <b>120</b>, and an electronics module that includes electronic components <b>157</b> and an electronics module support structure <b>159</b>. Base <b>112</b> and sensors <b>120</b> are essentially the same as those described for the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the electronics module is separated into two parts. Electronics module support structure <b>159</b> is configured so that part of support structure <b>159</b> physically contacts the surface of base <b>112</b> and another part of support structure <b>159</b> extends away from the surface of base <b>112</b> so that the part of structure <b>159</b> that extends away from the surface of base <b>112</b> can support electronic components <b>157</b> away from the surface of base <b>112</b>. In a more preferred embodiment, support structure <b>159</b> and electronic components <b>157</b> have a hinge-like connection so that electronic components <b>157</b> can be put into an opened positioned as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or moved into a closed position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> where there is illustrated a side view of a sensor apparatus <b>162</b>. Sensor apparatus <b>162</b> includes a base <b>112</b>, sensors <b>120</b>, electronics module <b>157</b>, and an electronics module support structure <b>164</b>. For this embodiment, a hinge-like motion for electronic components <b>157</b> is achieved by configuring support structure <b>164</b> as a substantially flexible structure. In other words, support structure <b>164</b> is sufficiently flexible so as to allow electronic components <b>157</b> to be moved from a first position to a second position, such as back and forth from a closed position to an opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Part of support structure <b>164</b> is connected with the surface of base <b>112</b> and another part of support structure <b>164</b> extends away from the surface of base <b>112</b> so that support structure <b>164</b> holds electronic components <b>157</b> away from the surface of base <b>112</b>. In a preferred embodiment support structure <b>164</b> comprises a flexible circuit board such as commercially available flexible integrated circuit boards. Using a flexible circuit board for support structure <b>164</b> allows the electronics module to be configured so that the flexible circuit board provides physical support of electronic components <b>157</b> and also allows making electrical connections with metallization lines from sensors <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> wherein there is shown a perspective view of an embodiment of a sensor apparatus <b>175</b> according to the present invention. Sensor apparatus <b>175</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is essentially the same as sensor apparatus <b>175</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Sensor apparatus <b>175</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> with the electronics module in the opened position. Sensor apparatus <b>175</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes a base (the base is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The sensor apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes a support structure comprising support structure flexible circuit board <b>180</b>A and a ribbon cable <b>180</b>B. Also shown are a flexible circuit board <b>190</b>, an electronic component <b>192</b> such as a detachable battery, and an electronic component <b>194</b> such as an information processor. Electronic component <b>192</b> and electronic component <b>194</b> are attached to flexible circuit board <b>190</b>. Circuit board <b>190</b> also includes a port <b>196</b> having a window <b>198</b> therein; window <b>198</b> is configured so as to provide a low obstruction path for communication signals. As an option in a preferred embodiment, window <b>198</b> may comprise a thin sheet of polyimide. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also shows an induction coil <b>182</b> and a communication device <b>184</b> supported on circuit board <b>180</b>A. A latch mechanism <b>168</b> is also included as part of circuit board <b>180</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, sensor apparatus <b>175</b> is configured so that electrical connections between the electronics module and the sensors are made through solder connections with metallization lines electrically connected with the sensors. Preferably, the solder connections are the only rigid connection between the flexible portion of the electronics module and the base. In other words, it is preferred that no attachment means such as an adhesive is used to connect the electronics module to the base, and the connection uses a flexible portion of the electronics module, i.e., the wiring for the electronics module is soldered to the metallization lines connected to the sensors so that the electronics module is fixedly connected with the base. This arrangement provides a substantially flexible connection with the base that would be difficult to achieve using a rigid circuit board or a rigid housing for the electronics module. Consequently, the substantially flexible connection with the base reduces the amount of thermal stresses generated between the base and the electronics module. The reduced thermal stresses also reduce effects such as warpage of the base that could occur for a rigid electronics module for which the thermal expansion does not match that of the base. For embodiments of the present invention, the flexible connection with the electronics module can allow the electronics module to stretch so as to relieve possible thermal stresses, resulting in reduced failures caused by thermal stress.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A more preferred embodiment of the present invention is a sensor apparatus for measuring temperatures for processing silicon wafers. The sensor apparatus includes a substantially whole silicon wafer, a plurality of temperature sensors in physical contact with the silicon wafer so as to provide temperature measurements, and at least one electronics module mounted on the silicon wafer. The electronics module includes an information processor, a power supply, a flexible integrated circuit board comprising a material such as polyimide or another thermally stable polymer, and a support structure comprising a material such as polyimide or another thermally stable polymer. The information processor, the power supply, and the sensors are interconnected via the flexible circuit board so that the information processor can receive power from the power supply and signals from the sensors. The support structure is flexibly coupled to the flexible circuit board. The support structure has electrical circuits for transmitting signals from the sensors to the flexible circuit board. The support structure has a flexible portion for physical contact with the silicon wafer. The support structure is configured for suspending the information processor and the power supply away from the surface of the silicon wafer so as to provide a low rate of conductive heat transfer between the silicon wafer and the electronics module. The support structure includes a latch mechanism for holding the printed circuit board in a predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another embodiment, the support structure of the sensor apparatus is configured so as to provide a rate of conductive heat transfer between the silicon wafer or other base and the electronics module so that the temperature measurements from the sensors are substantially unperturbed by the presence of the electronics module and the electronics module is substantially undamaged by heat transferred from the base to the electronics module. In other words, the support structure is configured so that temperature sensitive components of the electronics module are not subjected to damaging temperatures during measurements, and the support structure is configured so as to have heat transfer properties and heat capacity properties sufficient to substantially prevent thermal distortion of measurements made by the plurality of sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Embodiments of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are configured so that at least two sides of the electronics module, when set in the closed position, do not have sidewalls. In other words, two facing sides are open, or two or more than two walls are open. This is a preferred configuration for some applications. For applications that involve a gas flow across the surface of a workpiece, the sides without walls can be oriented so as to minimize the disruption of gas flow across the surface of the sensor apparatus; as a result, the sensor apparatus will have surface gas flow dynamics that are more closely matched to the surface gas flow dynamics of a workpiece, which does not have an electronics module. A preferred configuration for a semiconductor wafer processing application with a gas flow between the center of the wafer and the edge of the wafer includes arranging the open sidewalls so that the direction of gas flow is substantially perpendicular to the open sides. In yet another embodiment, a round configuration is used for the electronics module and it is arranged so that there are substantially no walls.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In still another embodiment of the present invention, the electronics module has a middle section that comprises an elongated flexible circuit board or an elongated ribbon cable so that the top section can be disposed remotely from the base during operation. This embodiment could be used for high temperature applications (such as up to 250 or 300 C) for which standard electronics and the battery may not survive. This embodiment includes lengthening the connecting portion between the top section and the bottom section of the electronics module. In operation the electronic components could be kept at relatively lower temperature, by such means as by adopting special loading techniques suitable for the process chamber. More specifically, the middle section is long enough so that the top section can be held on a surface of the process tool within the process chamber during data collection. This configuration is desirable for applications where the process temperatures are too high for the electronic components when the electronic components are near the base of the sensor apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To further illustrate this embodiment, reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> where there is shown a diagram of a top view of a sensor apparatus <b>220</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention.

In preferred embodiments, flexible circuit board <b>226</b> includes electronic components that may be particularly sensitive to harsh process conditions for electronic components such as high temperatures. Consequently, preferred embodiments of the present invention are configured so that flexible circuit board <b>226</b> includes electronic components such as a battery for providing power, one or more electronic components needed for functions such as information processing, and one or more electronic components for communication and information transmission and receiving. The electronic components are attached to flexible circuit board <b>226</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Embodiments of the present invention can allow the measurement of highly accurate data. In other words, embodiments of the present invention allow the measurement of substantially correct temperature distributions over time and space for a workpiece in a manufacturing process that is substantially un-perturbed by the sensor apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Embodiments of the invention are particularly suited to applications such as characterizing bake plates used for heating semiconductor wafers and characterizing plasma chambers for processing semiconductor wafers. Embodiments of the present invention can allow such characterizations substantially without artifacts obscuring the behavior of the process and the process controllers such as temperature controllers. Embodiments of the present invention can be used to expand the characterization of process operations to real-time, transient behavior, and thus making the characterization much more relevant to the processing of actual workpieces such as semiconductor wafers for electronic devices and flatpanel display substrates for flatpanel displays.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As a specific example, embodiments of the present invention can allow determination of the behavior of photoresist under precisely measured transient process conditions such as process steps involving heat transfer. The information gained using embodiments of the present invention can be used to optimize the overall process for manufacturing products such as electronic devices. Embodiments of the present invention provide opportunities for determining and controlling critical parts of processes and process conditions used in the production of high-value products. In one test of an embodiment of the present invention, temperature measurements were obtained using a sensor apparatus designed according to the teachings of the present invention. The electronics module had such a low impact on the heat dynamics of the bake plate that the controller function was unaffected by the presence of the electronics module.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Embodiments of the present invention can be used to accurately identify workpiece temperature nonuniformities that may occur in electronic device manufacturing processes. Imperfections in components that are part of semiconductor process tools, components such as bake plates and such as plasma chamber chucks, can be localized using embodiments of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention can be used to analyze the transient temperature behavior of workpieces and thus to determine the impact of the imperfections on the process results for the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Embodiments of the present invention can also be used to obtain increased accuracy in “matching” process tools such as semiconductor wafer processing tools and flatpanel display processing tools. For some technologies, this methodology is referred to as chamber matching. Specifically, it is typically preferable for multiple process chambers performing the same process to provide substantially the same process results. This means that each chamber needs to produce substantially the same process conditions for workpieces. The high accuracy information that can be obtained using embodiments of the present invention allows for greater accuracy for chamber matching. In addition, embodiments of the present invention make it easier to incorporate steady state information and transient information in the chamber matching methodologies.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The examples given earlier describe the use of a sensor apparatus having a single electronics module. However, in some applications it may be necessary to have several electronics modules included with the sensor apparatus so as to achieve very high spatial resolution of the parameter measurements. In other words, high-resolution temperature measurements may require a large number of temperature sensors. Handling information from the large number of temperature sensors may require the use of multiple electronics modules. Embodiments of the present invention may also include use of a sensor apparatus having multiple electronics modules. The implementation of embodiments of the present invention for use with a sensor apparatus having multiple electronics modules is substantially analogous to that described for implementation with a single electronics module.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For some applications of embodiments of the present invention, there may be circumstances in which it is necessary to protect at least a portion of the sensor apparatus from the measurement environment.
