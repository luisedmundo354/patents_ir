<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority on Japanese patent applications No. 2004-44416, No. 2004-49344 and No. 2004-51774, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid ejection head that ejects a droplet by causing an electrostatic force to act on a solution in which charged particles are dispersed, and a method of producing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nowadays, a thermal-type ink jet head that ejects an ink droplet by means of an expansive force of an air bubble generated in ink through heating of the ink and a piezoelectric-type ink jet head that ejects an ink droplet by giving a pressure to ink using a piezoelectric element have been proposed as liquid ejection heads. In the thermal-type ink jet head, however, the ink is partially heated to 300° C. or higher, and a problem arises in that a material for the ink is limited. Also, when using the piezoelectric-type ink jet head, there occurs a problem in that its structure is complicated and an increase in cost is inevitable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a liquid ejection head that solves the problems described above, a system is proposed which uses ink containing a charged fine particle component and controls ejection of the ink by utilizing an electrostatic force through application of a predetermined voltage to each control electrode of the ink jet head in accordance with image data, thereby recording an image corresponding to the image data on a recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various ink jet recording apparatuses adopting the electrostatic ink jet recording system are known (see JP 10-230608 A, JP 09-309208 A, JP 10-76664 A, JP 11-105293 A, and JP 08-149253 A, for instance).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a conceptual diagram schematically showing an example of an outline construction of an ink jet head of an ink jet recording apparatus disclosed in JP 10-230608 A. This drawing conceptually shows the periphery of one ink guide serving as an ink ejection position of the ink jet head disclosed therein. An ink jet head <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> includes a head substrate <b>402</b>, an ink guide <b>404</b>, an electrical insulating substrate <b>406</b>, a control electrode <b>408</b>, a counter electrode <b>410</b> supporting a recording medium P, a bias voltage supply <b>412</b>, and a signal voltage supply <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ink guide <b>404</b> has a convex tip end portion <b>404</b><i>a </i>including an ink guide groove <b>420</b> obtained through cutting by a predetermined width and is arranged on the head substrate <b>402</b>. Also, in the insulating substrate <b>406</b>, a through-hole (ejection opening) <b>418</b> is established at a position corresponding to arrangement of the ink guide <b>404</b>. The ink guide <b>404</b> passes through the through-hole <b>418</b> and protrudes upwardly from a surface of the insulating substrate <b>406</b> on a recording medium P side. In addition, the head substrate <b>402</b> and the insulating substrate <b>406</b> are arranged so as to be spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance and a gap between these substrates <b>402</b> and <b>406</b> is defined as a flow path <b>416</b> of ink Q.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The control electrode <b>408</b> is provided in a ring manner for each through-hole <b>418</b> on the surface of the insulating substrate <b>406</b> on the recording medium P side so as to surround the periphery of the through-hole <b>418</b>. Also, the control electrode <b>408</b> is connected to the signal voltage supply <b>414</b> that generates a pulse voltage in accordance with image data, and the signal voltage supply <b>414</b> is grounded through the bias voltage supply <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the counter electrode <b>410</b> is arranged so as to be opposed to the tip end portion <b>404</b><i>a </i>of the ink guide <b>404</b> and is grounded. The recording medium P is arranged on a surface of the counter electrode <b>410</b> on an ink guide <b>404</b> side. That is, the counter electrode <b>410</b> functions as a platen that supports the recording medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At the time of recording, the ink Q containing colorant particles charged to the same polarity as a voltage applied to the control electrode <b>408</b> is circulated by an ink circulation mechanism (not shown) in the ink flow path <b>416</b> in a direction from the right side to the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Also, a high voltage of 1.5 kV for example is applied to the control electrode <b>408</b> by the bias voltage supply <b>412</b>. At this time, a part of the ink Q in the ink flow path <b>416</b> is supplied to the tip end portion <b>404</b><i>a </i>while passing through the ink guide groove <b>420</b> by a capillary phenomenon, surface tension, surface wetting, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, a DC voltage of 1.5 kV for example is applied to the control electrode <b>408</b> from the bias voltage supply <b>412</b> as a constant bias. When a pulse voltage of 500 V for example is applied from the signal voltage supply <b>414</b> to the control electrode <b>408</b> biased to the DC 1.5 kV as a signal voltage corresponding to an image signal, an ink droplet whose main ingredient is the colorant component, flies out from the tip end portion <b>404</b><i>a </i>of the ink guide <b>404</b>, is attracted by the counter electrode <b>410</b>, and adheres onto the recording medium P, thereby forming a dot of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a method of producing such an ink jet head, JP 10-230608 A discloses production of the ink guide through plastic molding.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, JP 09-309208 A discloses an ink jet head where no ink guide is provided, a meniscus having an approximately hemispherical shape is formed at an ink outflow opening by means of the pressure of ink flowing out from an ink supply path and the surface tension of the ink, and an ink droplet is ejected by utilizing an electrostatic force.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also, JP 10-76664 A discloses an image forming apparatus that is capable of performing high-speed drawing using a system that includes accommodation means for accommodating a recording liquid obtained by dispersing charged colorant particles in an insulating liquid, an ink flow path which has an opening arranged at a position spaced apart from an image formation target medium by a predetermined distance and in which the recording liquid is circulated, a first electrode provided in the ink flow path, a second electrode that is provided in the ink flow path so as to be opposed to the first electrode and has a tip end that extends until approximately the same height as the opening, supply means for supplying the recording liquid accommodated in the accommodation means to the opening, and voltage application means for applying voltages to the first and second electrodes in accordance with a predetermined image signal to thereby cause the colorant particles in the recording liquid supplied to the vicinity of the opening to gather and cause the gathering colorant particles to be separated and ejected from the insulating liquid for formation of an image on the image formation target medium.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">JP 11-105293 A discloses an ink jet head where like in the case of JP 10-76664 A, ink is caused to flow along a protrusion portion that is an ink guide member and a meniscus is formed at a protrusion of the protrusion plate. This protrusion is obtained by molding an alumina-made electrode base and sharpening a tip end thereof through grinding.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, in FIG. 12 of JP 08-149253 A, an ejection head is disclosed in which a conical protrusion that is thick at its base portion and narrows as the distance to the tip end thereof decreases is provided and the surfaces of the protrusion and an individual electrode are continuously covered with a conductive substance. Also, in FIG. 17 of this patent document, as a method of producing the conical protrusion, machining of Si or conductive Si with a semiconductor process is disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">By the way, in the ink jet head disclosed in JP 10-230608 A, the ink is caused to move upwardly until a sharply pointed portion by utilizing a capillary phenomenon. Therefore, there is a problem in that ink supply takes a long period of time and ink droplets having a stabilized size and colorant particle concentration cannot be successively ejected at a high ejection frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described above, it is impossible to increase the ejection frequency of ink droplets. There is a shortcoming in that high-speed drawing cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also, in the case of the ink jet head disclosed in JP 09-309208 A, the ejection opening needs to have a hole diameter with which clogging will not occur. Therefore, there is a problem in that it is difficult to cause a minute droplet to fly and a high voltage is required to cause droplet flying.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, in the case of the ink jet heads disclosed in JP 10-76664 A and JP 11-105293 A, it is difficult to obtain a two-dimensionally arrayed head structure. There is a problem in that ejection portions cannot be arranged at a high density and it is difficult to record a high-quality image at high speed. Still further, when the ink jet head disclosed in JP 11-105293 A is a line head where it is required to form nozzles at a high density, interferences between the nozzles occur and it is impossible to control the diameters of ink droplets. There is also a problem in that it is difficult to record a high-quality image.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, in the ink jet head disclosed in JP 08-149253 A, wiring exists in the flow path. Therefore, there is a problem in that electric field interferences occur and it is difficult to control ejection concentrations between channels.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Here, to perform image recording at a higher density, it is preferable that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ink jet head <b>12</b> have a multi-channel structure where ejection portions composed of the ink guides <b>34</b>, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, and the through-holes <b>38</b> are disposed in a two-dimensional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It should be noted here that in the ink jet head <b>12</b> according to the present invention, it is possible to freely select the number and physical arrangement and the like of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>. For instance, the present invention is not limited to the multi-channel structure in the illustrated example and may be a line head having one ejection portion row. Also, the present invention may be applied to a so-called full-line head having ejection portion rows corresponding to the entire region of the recording medium P or a so-called serial head (shuttle type) where scanning is performed in a direction approximately orthogonal to a nozzle row direction. Also, the ink jet head according to the present invention is capable of supporting both of monochrome recording and color recording.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Hereinafter, each portion of the ink jet head <b>10</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on a surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> on a through-hole substrate <b>32</b> side, one ink guide <b>34</b> and one ejection electrode <b>36</b> are provided for each ejection portion. The head substrate <b>30</b> is made of an electrical insulative material such as glass or SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, the head substrate <b>30</b> and the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> are arranged so as to be spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance and a gap therebetween serves as the ink flow path <b>44</b>. The ink flow path <b>44</b> is connected to the ink supply flow path <b>50</b> and the ink recovery flow path <b>52</b> and functions as an ink reservoir (ink chamber) for supplying the ink to each ejection portion. Also, at the time of image recording, the ink is circulated in the ink flow path <b>44</b> by the ink reflux mechanism <b>50</b> in a predetermined direction (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, from the right side to the left side in the drawing) at a predetermined speed (ink flow of 200 mm/s, for instance). Further, the ink used in this embodiment is a solution in which positively charged particles (ink particles) are dispersed together with a charge control agent, a binder, and the like in an electrical insulative solvent having resistivity of 10<sup>8 </sup>Ωcm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The ink guides <b>34</b> provided on the head substrate <b>30</b> have a polygonal pyramidal shape whose tip end has a sharply pointed convex shape. In the illustrated example, the ink guides <b>34</b> have an octagonal pyramidal shape. Meniscuses of the ink are formed between the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> and the through-holes <b>38</b> and the ink concentrates at the tip end portions of the ink guides. When a predetermined voltage is applied to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> under this state, ink droplets are ejected from the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this embodiment, the shape of the ink guides <b>34</b> is an octagonal pyramid. The present invention is not limited to this and the shape of the ink guides <b>34</b> may be changed to a polygonal pyramid except the octagonal pyramid, a cone, or an elliptical cone. Also, even when the shape of the ink guides <b>34</b> is not a pyramid or cone in its entirety, there occurs no problem so long as at least the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> have a sharply pointed shape. For instance, a shape may be used in which a cone or a polygonal pyramid, whose tip end is sharply pointed, is placed on a cylindrical column or a polygonal column.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the present invention, the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> are formed in a sharply pointed shape, and electric fields can concentrate at the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b>. As a result, it becomes possible to eject ink droplets with stability at a low voltage as compared with a conventional case. In addition, minute droplets can be ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this embodiment, it is preferable that the tip end angle of the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> be 60° or less and/or the radius of curvature of the tip end portions be 4 μm or less. In the present invention, it is not required to form the tip ends of the ink guides <b>34</b> at such a high sharply pointed degree when it is possible to eject droplets from the ink guide tip ends with stability at a desired ejection voltage, although in order to eject the ink with more stability at a lower ejection voltage, it is preferable that the tip end angle of the tip end portions of the ink guides be 60° or less and/or the radius of curvature of the tip end portions be 4 μm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Also, the surface of a partial region of each ink guide <b>34</b> including the extreme tip end portion may be coated with a conductive film made of a metal or the like. When such a conductive film is formed for the extreme tip end portion, a dielectric constant of the tip end portion is substantially increased. It is therefore easy to generate a strong electric field and possible to improve an ink droplet ejection property.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are arranged on the upper surface (surface on a side opposing the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>) of the head substrate <b>30</b> as ring-shaped circular electrodes surrounding the peripheries of connection portions between the ink guides <b>34</b> and the head substrate <b>30</b>. Also, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, the ink guides <b>34</b>, and the through-holes <b>38</b> are arranged so that they become substantially coaxial, that is, the centers thereof approximately coincide with each other. In this example, a construction has been described in which the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are formed on the surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> so as to be exposed to the ink flow path. The present invention is not limited to this and the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> may be formed inside the head substrate <b>30</b> in a positional relation where the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are substantially coaxial with the through-holes <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the case of the conventional ink jet head shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> where the ejection electrode is provided for the ejection opening substrate (through-hole substrate), when a drive voltage is applied to the ejection electrode, an electric field is generated not only from the upper surface of the ejection electrode but also from the lower surface of the ejection electrode. That is, an electric field directed from the through-hole to the head substrate acts on the ink circulating in the ink flow path. The electric field, generated from the lower surface of the ejection electrode in a direction orthogonal to the head substrate surface, acts so as to prevent the ink particles contained in the ink circulating in the ink flow path from moving toward the through-hole. Therefore, when the drive voltage is applied to the ejection electrode, concentration of the ink particles in the ejection opening (through-hole) is prohibited and a certain time is required before the ink particles are sufficiently concentrated in the through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Also, with the construction where the ejection electrode is provided for the through-hole substrate, warpage occurs to the through-hole substrate and a distance between the ink guide tip end portion and the ejection electrode changes. This distance change results in a situation where the distance between the ink guide tip end portion and the ejection electrode varies from ejection portion to ejection portion and ink droplets ejected from the ejection portions become nonuniform.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In contrast to this, in the ink jet head <b>12</b> according to the present invention, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are provided for the head substrate <b>30</b>. Therefore, it is possible to cause only electric fields generated from the upper surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> to act on the ink particles. That is, no electric field that prevents concentration of the ink particles exists at the through-holes <b>38</b>, and the ink particles can concentrate in the through-holes <b>38</b> swiftly.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, the multiple ink guides <b>34</b> and the multiple ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are formed integrally with the head substrate <b>30</b>. Thus, distances between the ink guides <b>34</b> and the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> become constant, which prevents the situation described above where the distance between the ink guide <b>34</b> and the ejection electrode <b>36</b> varies from ejection portion to ejection portion. Therefore, a drive voltage necessary for ejection is fixed from ejection portion to ejection portion and it becomes possible to eject multiple ink droplets at a high frequency with stability using a low drive voltage generally.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Here, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are preferably formed in, for instance, shapes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> where the circular electrodes are partially removed on an ink supply side (ink flow path upstream side). By thus partially removing the ejection electrodes <b>80</b> on the ink flow path upstream side or the ink supply side, a repulsive force exerted on the ink particles as a result of application of the drive voltage to the ejection electrodes <b>80</b> at the time of recording is reduced on the ink supply side. As a result, even at the time of recording, it becomes possible to supply the ink particles to the ink guide <b>34</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It should be noted here that the ejection electrodes are not limited to the ring-shaped circular electrodes and it is possible to use various electrodes in other shapes such as polygonal electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Also, it is preferable that a ratio between an inside diameter of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> and a distance from surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> to the tip ends of the ink guides <b>34</b> is in a range of 1:0.5 to 1:2, more preferably in a range of 1:0.7 to 1:1.7. That is, when the inside diameter of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> is referred to as “r” and the distance from the surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> to the tip ends of the ink guides <b>34</b> is referred to as “h”, it is preferable that at least one of the inside diameter of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> and the distance from the surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> to the tip ends of the ink guides <b>34</b> be adjusted so that “h/r” falls in a range of 0.5 to 2, more preferably in a range of 0.7 to 1.7. This is because when the ratio “h/r” exists in the range described above, the electric fields formed by the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are converged and the strongest electric fields are formed. Therefore, by arranging the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> that are ejection points at positions satisfying the range described above, even when the application voltage to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> is lowered as compared with the conventional case, it becomes possible to eject droplets from the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> with reliability. That is, it becomes possible to realize lowering of the application voltage to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> are made of a conductive material, such as a metal, and are provided so as to pass through the head substrate <b>30</b> at positions where the surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> on the ink flow path <b>44</b> side overlaps the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>. The back surfaces (surfaces on a side opposite to the ink flow path <b>44</b> side) of the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> contact the wiring portion <b>48</b> and the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> electrically connect the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> and the wiring portion <b>48</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The shape and arrangement position of the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> are not limited so long as the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> electrically connect the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> and the wiring portion <b>48</b> to each other. For instance, the whole of the surfaces of the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> on the ink flow path <b>44</b> side may be contained in a part of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Also, the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> are preferably provided so as to overlap a part of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> on the downstream side of the flow path in which the ink flows.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">With this construction where the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> are formed on the downstream side of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, no electric field is generated in a direction in which concentration of the ink to the ink guides <b>34</b> is prohibited, so the ink concentrates at the ink guides <b>34</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The wiring portion <b>48</b> is provided on the back surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> (surface opposite to the surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> on which the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are arranged) and connects the voltage application means <b>16</b> and the electrode drawing portions <b>46</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">By thus providing the wiring portion <b>48</b> for applying the voltage from the bias voltage supply <b>60</b> to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> on the back surface of the head substrate <b>30</b>, it becomes possible to uniformize the concentration of the ink in each ejection portion without exerting any influences on the ink in the ink flow path <b>44</b> and also uniformly form an electric field in each ejection portion. Therefore, ejection of ink droplets in each ejection portion can be performed with stability.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The through-hole substrate <b>32</b> is made of an electrical insulative material such as ceramics like Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2 </sub>or a resin like polyimide. Also, as described above, in the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>, the through-holes <b>38</b> are formed which supply the ink to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b>, with meniscuses being formed between the through-holes <b>38</b> and the ink guides <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the present invention, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are provided not for the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> but for the head substrate <b>30</b>, and the thickness of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> can be reduced as compared with the conventional case. Therefore, it becomes possible to reduce the length of the through-holes <b>38</b> as compared with the conventional case, which reduces the resistances between the ink and the inner walls of the through-holes <b>38</b> and makes it possible to eject the ink from the through-holes <b>38</b> swiftly. In addition, the ink is prevented to stay in the through-holes <b>38</b> depending on the speed of the ink flow.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Also, the shape of the through-holes <b>38</b> is independent of the shape of the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, so it is possible to form the through-holes <b>38</b> in various shapes, such as a circular shape, an elliptical shape, and a quadrilateral shape, in accordance with purposes such as an improvement in supply efficiency of the ink to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> and stabilization of the meniscuses.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, ink repellency giving processing is preferably performed on a surface of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> on a recording medium P side. Performing the ink repellency giving processing on the surface of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> makes it possible to form the meniscuses with stability and stabilize ejection of ink droplets. Here, the ink repellency means water repellency when the ink is water-based ink and means oil repellency when the ink is oil-based ink.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Also, it is sufficient that the surface of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> has the ink repellency, and the present invention is not limited to the ink repellency giving processing. For instance, the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> may be made of an ink repellent material, or an ink repellent material may be applied to the surface of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> on the recording medium P side. Even with one of such constructions, the meniscuses are formed with stability and ejection of ink droplets is stabilized like in the case of the construction described above.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The shield electrode <b>40</b> arranged on a surface of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> on a head substrate <b>30</b> side is provided at a position that is closer to the recording medium P than the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>. The shield electrode <b>40</b> is arranged so as not to shield from electric lines of force generated from each ejection electrode <b>36</b> toward the tip end portion of the ink guide <b>34</b> corresponding to the ejection electrode <b>36</b> and to shield from electric lines of force generated from each ejection electrode <b>36</b> toward the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> noncorresponding to the ejection electrode <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this embodiment, the shield electrode <b>40</b> is a sheet-shaped electrode, such as a metallic plate, which is common to the respective ejection portions and includes opening portions bored so as to respectively oppose the through-holes <b>38</b> established in a two-dimensional manner. The shield electrode <b>40</b> is held at a predetermined potential (including 0 V through grounding). In this embodiment, the shield electrode <b>40</b> is grounded and is set at 0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Here, it is not necessarily required to provide the shield electrode <b>40</b>. However, the shield electrode <b>40</b> is preferably provided because it is possible to shield each ejection portion from the electric lines of force generated from noncorresponding ejection electrodes <b>36</b> and form a stabilized electric field at the ejection portion with this construction.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It is sufficient that the shield electrode <b>40</b> is arranged between the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> and the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b>, and the arrangement position of the shield electrode <b>40</b> is not limited to the head substrate <b>30</b> side of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> and may be changed to the recording medium P side of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> or the inside of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Also, in this embodiment, the shield electrode <b>40</b> serves as a sheet-shaped electrode. The present invention is not limited to this and any other electrode may be used so long as it is possible to shield the ejection portion from the electric lines of force from the noncorresponding ejection electrodes <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Also, in this embodiment, the shield electrode <b>40</b> is provided on the ink flow path <b>44</b> side of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>, although it is possible to achieve the functions of both the shield electrode and the ink repellency giving processing by performing eutectoid-plating of a fluoride polymer and a metal on the surface of the through-hole substrate on the counter electrode side.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The 3-D barriers <b>42</b> are provided on the surface of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> on the recording medium P side so as to surround the through-holes <b>38</b>. The 3-D barriers <b>42</b> are thus arranged, so the meniscuses formed at the adjacent ink guides <b>34</b> are prevented from being connected with each other and are separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Here, in the present invention, it is not necessarily required to provide the 3-D barriers <b>42</b>. However, the 3-D barriers <b>42</b> are preferably provided because it becomes possible to separate meniscuses formed at the adjacent ink guides <b>34</b> from each other and maintain the respective meniscuses formed at the respective ink guides <b>34</b> with stability without being influenced by fluctuations of the meniscuses at the time of ejection of ink droplets from the adjacent ink guides <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In this embodiment, the 3-D barriers <b>42</b> are arranged in a lattice manner but the present invention is not limited to this. It is sufficient that the 3-D barriers <b>42</b> have a shape where the meniscuses formed at the respective ink guides <b>34</b> are prevented from being connected with each other and are separated from each other. For instance, 3-D barriers that respectively surround the through-holes may be provided separately from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Also, in order to separate the meniscuses formed at the adjacent ink guides <b>34</b> from each other with more reliability by preventing the ink from climbing the wall surfaces of the 3-D barriers <b>42</b>, at least the surfaces of the 3-D barriers <b>42</b> preferably have ink repellency.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The ink reflux mechanism <b>50</b> includes an ink tank and an ink pump (not shown), with a predetermined amount of ink being contained in the ink tank. In the ink tank, the concentrations of the charged particles, the charge control agent, the binder, and the like in the insulative solvent of the ink are constantly adjusted by a concentration adjustment mechanism (not shown) so as to fall within predetermined concentration ranges. The ink adjusted in concentrations by the concentration adjustment mechanism (not shown) in the ink tank is supplied from the ink pump of the ink reflux mechanism <b>50</b> to the ink flow path <b>44</b> of the ink jet head <b>12</b> through the ink supply flow path <b>52</b> at a predetermined pressure.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As described above, the bias voltage supply <b>62</b> applies the fixed voltage to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, and it becomes possible to set the drive voltage that the signal voltage supply <b>60</b> applies to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> as a low voltage, thereby reducing power consumption.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Next, an ink droplet ejection operation of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, in the ink jet head <b>12</b>, the ink containing charged particles which have a fixed concentration is circulated and meniscuses covering at least the tip end portions are formed on the surfaces of the ink guides <b>34</b>. Under this state, a voltage of 100 V is applied from the bias voltage supply <b>62</b> of the voltage application means <b>16</b> to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, and a voltage of −1 kV is constantly applied from the bias voltage supply <b>72</b> to the counter electrode <b>70</b>.

An ink jet recording apparatus <b>90</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> has the same construction as the electrostatic ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> except some portions. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the same construction element as in the above embodiment is given the same reference numeral and the description thereof will be omitted. Therefore, in the following description, points unique to the ink jet recording apparatus <b>90</b> will be mainly explained.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A head substrate <b>92</b> of an ink jet head <b>91</b> according to this embodiment is provided with convex portions <b>94</b> common to ejection portions adjacent to each other in a direction orthogonal to a flow path in which ink flows (from the right side to the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, from the lower side to the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Therefore, ink guides <b>34</b> and ejection electrodes <b>98</b> are provided on the convex portions <b>94</b>. Also, concave portions <b>96</b> having a predetermined depth are formed outside the ejection electrodes <b>98</b> in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path. That is, ejection portions adjacent to each other in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path are formed on the same convex portion <b>94</b> and the concave portions <b>96</b> are formed between the ejection portions adjacent to each other in the direction in which the ink flows.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Also, in this embodiment, the ejection electrodes <b>98</b> each have a shape where a part thereof on an ink supply side is removed like in the case of the ejection electrodes <b>80</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">With this construction, the convex portions <b>94</b> function as leading weirs, so it becomes possible to lead the ink in an ink guide <b>34</b> tip end direction and supply the ink to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Also, the concave portions <b>96</b> are provided, so it becomes possible to increase the area of the ink flow path <b>44</b>. As a result, the amount of the ink flowing in the ink flow path <b>44</b> increases and the ink can be supplied to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>34</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In this embodiment, the concave portions are formed in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path. The present invention is not limited to this and another shape in which the concave portions are formed parallel to the ink flow path, that is, the respective ejection portions are arranged on the respective convex portions, may be used. When the concave portions are provided parallel to the ink flow path in this manner, the area of the ink flow path is further increased and it becomes possible to supply a larger amount of ink into the ink flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Also, the shape of the convex portions is not specifically limited and various shapes are usable, such as a shape that traces the outside shape of the ejection electrodes and a shape where the side surfaces of the convex portions are inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Further, in this embodiment, the ejection portions are arranged in a lattice manner and the convex portions are formed in a straight line manner in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path. However, the ejection portions may be arranged in a staggered lattice manner and the convex portions may be provided in a staggered manner so as to correspond to the respective ejection portions. In this case, it becomes possible to supply the ink to the ejection portions with more efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Here, in the embodiment described above, explanation has been made using ink in which charged particles in a solution are positively charged, although ink in which charged particles are negatively charged may be used instead. In this case, it is sufficient that the polarities of the application voltages applied to the counter electrode and the ejection electrodes are reversed from those in the example described above.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The liquid ejection head according to the present invention is not limited to the head that ejects ink containing charged particles and any head that ejects a solution containing charged particles dispersed in a solvent can be used. There is no limitation on the type of the solution used.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Next, an ink jet head production method according to an embodiment (first embodiment) of the liquid ejection head production method according to a fourth aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7K</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Here, only one ejection portion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7K</figref>, although it is certainly possible to produce two-dimensionally disposed ejection portions at the same time using the production method in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In this embodiment, a glass substrate <b>100</b> is used as an example of a substrate that has an electrical insulation property and serves as a head substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, an electrode <b>102</b> serving as a wiring portion is formed on the glass substrate <b>100</b> by evaporating a metallic film onto the glass substrate <b>100</b>, producing a mask corresponding to an electrode pattern of the wiring portion on the metallic film using a lithography method for instance, and etching the metallic film using the mask. Here, a method for evaporating the metallic film is not specifically limited and it is sufficient that the metallic film is evaporated using a conventionally known technique such as sputtering or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a cylindrical column <b>104</b> serving as a convex portion, which is, for instance, around 5 μm in height and 200 μm in diameter, is formed by forming a circular mask having a diameter of around 200 μm for example at a position corresponding to a position, at which an ink guide is to be arranged, of a surface of the glass substrate <b>100</b> on a side opposite to the surface on which the electrode <b>102</b> has been formed, using the lithography method or the like, and etching the glass substrate <b>100</b> by a predetermined amount using the mask.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, a ring-shaped electrode <b>106</b> serving as an ejection electrode is formed around the cylindrical column <b>104</b> by evaporating a metallic film on the surface of the glass substrate <b>100</b> on which the cylindrical column <b>104</b> has been formed, producing a mask corresponding to the electrode pattern of the ejection electrode with a lithography method or the like so that only a ring-shaped portion of the metallic film surrounding the cylindrical column <b>104</b> is to be left, and etching the metallic film using the mask thus produced as an etching mask.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Here, by forming the mask in a shape where a part of a ring shape is removed and etching the metallic film using the mask as the etching mask, it is also possible to form the electrode whose part is removed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, a through-hole <b>108</b> is formed in the glass substrate <b>100</b> so that the electrode <b>102</b> and the ring-shaped electrode <b>106</b> form some portions of the inner wall surface of the through-hole <b>108</b>. By thus forming the through-hole <b>108</b>, the electrode <b>102</b> and the electrode <b>106</b> are partially exposed to the side surface of the through-hole <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">It is sufficient that the through-hole <b>108</b> is formed using a conventionally known technique such as sand blasting or laser beam machining.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, for continuity between the electrode <b>102</b> and the electrode <b>106</b> on both surfaces of the glass substrate <b>100</b>, a metallic film is evaporated onto the side surface of the through-hole <b>108</b>, thereby forming an electrode <b>110</b> on the side surface of the through-hole <b>108</b>. At this time, in order to prevent the metallic film from being evaporated on portions other than the side surface of the through-hole <b>108</b>, a resist layer serving as a mask may be formed on portions where the metallic film is not to be evaporated.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In addition, a metal is filled into the through-hole <b>108</b> by performing plating such as electroplating. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, a plated portion <b>112</b> serving as an electrode drawing portion is embedded in the through-hole <b>108</b>. Here, the metal used to perform the plating is not specifically limited and various metals are usable so long as they are metals that will never be corroded even through contact with the ink. For instance, it is preferable to use copper, nickel, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Next, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>, an Si substrate <b>114</b> is joined to a surface of the glass substrate <b>100</b> on which the cylindrical column <b>104</b> has been formed. As a joining method, various methods are usable, such as anode joining and a method based on an adhesive. Here, as the anode joining, it is possible to use a method with which after the Si substrate <b>114</b> is placed on the glass substrate <b>100</b>, a voltage of several hundred V is applied while performing heating, thereby generating an electrostatic attractive force between the glass substrate <b>100</b> and the Si substrate <b>114</b> and achieving the joining through covalent bonding. Also, as to the joining between the glass substrate <b>100</b> and the Si substrate <b>114</b>, it is sufficient that at least the cylindrical column <b>104</b> of the glass substrate <b>100</b> is joined with the Si substrate <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>, an oxide film <b>116</b> is formed on a surface of the Si substrate <b>114</b> that is not joined with the glass substrate <b>100</b>. The oxide film <b>116</b> is generally formed through film formation using SiO<sub>2 </sub>based on sputtering, CVD (chemical vapor deposition), or thermal oxidation or through oxidation before the joining with the cylindrical column <b>104</b> of the glass substrate <b>100</b>. Also, the surface of the Si substrate <b>114</b> on which the oxide film <b>116</b> has been formed is a &lt;100&gt; crystalline plane.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Next, a square resist pattern whose sides coincide with the &lt;110&gt; and &lt;1-10&gt; crystal orientations of the Si substrate <b>114</b>, is formed on the oxide film <b>116</b> using a lithography method or the like at a position corresponding to arrangement of the ink guide. Following this, the oxide film <b>116</b> is etched using the resist pattern as an etching mask. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7H</figref>, the oxide film <b>116</b> becomes a mask <b>118</b> having a shape corresponding to the shape of the square resist pattern, that is, a square shape whose sides coincide with the &lt;110&gt; and &lt;1-10&gt; crystal orientations of the Si substrate <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Next, the Si substrate <b>114</b> is immersed in, for instance, a 34 wt % aqueous solution of KOH heated to 70° C. and anisotropic etching of the Si substrate is performed. In this etching step, the Si substrate <b>114</b> is anisotropically etched using the square mask <b>118</b> as an etching mask. During this etching, undercut progresses from the square portion of the mask <b>118</b> and the etching is continued until the mask <b>118</b> is separated from the surface of the Si substrate <b>114</b>. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7I</figref>, a pyramidal structural member <b>120</b> that is formed by inclined surfaces of a high-order polyhedron and serves as the tip end portion of the ink guide having a sharpened tip end whose tip end angle is 60° or less and/or whose radius of curvature is 4 μm or less, is formed in a part of the Si substrate <b>114</b>. Here, even after the anisotropic etching of the Si substrate <b>114</b> is performed, the Si substrate <b>114</b> is left by a predetermined thickness. The pyramidal structural member <b>120</b> is formed on the Si substrate <b>114</b> having the predetermined thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7J</figref>, a mask <b>122</b> resistant to Si etching is formed using SiO<sub>2</sub>, a metal, or the like for the pyramidal structural member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Next, the Si substrate <b>114</b> is etched through Deep-RIE using the mask <b>122</b> as an etching mask, thereby forming a columnar structural member <b>124</b>, which has the pyramidal structural member <b>120</b> in its tip end portion and serves as a base portion of the ink guide, on a surface of the cylindrical column <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7K</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">With the method described above, it is possible to produce a head-substrate-side structural body including the ink guide whose tip end is sharply pointed, the ejection electrode provided on the head substrate so as to surround the ink guide, the electrode drawing portion for establishing connection with voltage application means for applying a voltage to the ejection electrode, and the wiring portion provided on a surface opposite to the surface on which the ejection electrode of the head substrate has been arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In addition, it is possible to produce an ink jet head through assembling where a through-hole substrate including through-holes at positions corresponding to ejection portions is placed at a position spaced apart from the head substrate of the head-substrate-side structural body produced in the manner described above by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Here, in this embodiment, the pyramidal structural member serving as an ink guide is produced using an Si substrate. The present invention is not limited to this and it is sufficient that a single crystal substrate made of InP, GaAs, or the like on which anisotropic etching can be performed is used.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">By thus manufacturing the liquid ejection head using, for instance, lithography and dry etching of a semiconductor manufacturing method, an ink guide can be produced and an ejection electrode having high reliability and high accuracy. As a result, it becomes possible to produce an ink jet head at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Also, by producing the ink guide in the manner described above, an ink guide having a sharply pointed tip end can be produced with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Next, another embodiment (second embodiment) of the liquid ejection head production method according to the second aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">It should be noted here that the production method in this embodiment is the same as that in the embodiment described above based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7K</figref> except for the ink guide production method. Different points will be mainly described in the following explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">First, like the production method described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7K</figref>, an electrode <b>102</b> serving as a wiring portion is formed for a glass substrate <b>100</b>, a cylindrical column <b>104</b> serving as a convex portion is formed on a surface opposite to the surface on which the electrode <b>102</b> has been formed, at a position corresponding to arrangement of an ink guide, an electrode <b>106</b> serving as an ejection electrode is formed so as to surround the cylindrical column <b>104</b>, a through-hole is formed so that the electrode <b>102</b> and the electrode <b>106</b> constitute some portions of the inner wall of the through-hole, a metallic film is evaporated onto the side surface of the through-hole, and a plated portion <b>112</b> serving as an electrode drawing portion is produced by performing plating so as to fill the through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Then, a product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> that has the same structure as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref> is produced by joining the glass substrate <b>100</b> to an Si substrate <b>114</b> through anode joining or bonding using an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a mask <b>130</b> is formed at a position corresponding to the arrangement of the ink guide.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Then, by anisotropically etching the Si substrate <b>114</b> using this mask <b>130</b> as an etching mask, a pyramidal structural member <b>132</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> whose tip end is sharply pointed and which serves as the ink guide, is formed on a surface of the cylindrical column <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Even with this method, it is possible to produce a head-substrate-side structural body including the ink guide whose tip end is sharply pointed, the ejection electrode provided on the head substrate so as to surround the ink guide, the electrode drawing portion for establishing connection with voltage application means for applying a voltage to the ejection electrode, and the wiring portion provided on a surface opposite to the surface on which the ejection electrode of the head substrate has been arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Even in this case, like in the above case, it is possible to produce an ink jet head through assembling where a through-hole substrate including through-holes at positions corresponding to ejection portions is placed at a position spaced apart from the head substrate of the head-substrate-side structural body produced in the manner described above by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Adjusting the shapes of the masks, etchant, and the like, makes it possible to eliminate limitation to an ink guide including a tip end portion having a pyramidal structure and a base portion having a columnar structure and produce ink guides having various shapes such as an ink guide having a pyramidal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The liquid ejection head according to the first aspect of the present invention and the liquid ejection head production method according to the fourth aspect are fundamentally constructed in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Next, a liquid ejection head according to a second aspect of the present invention and a liquid ejection head production method according to a fifth aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 17G</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Here, an ink jet recording apparatus <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b> has the same construction as the electrostatic ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> except some portions. Accordingly, in this second aspect, each same construction element as in the first aspect is given the same reference numeral and the detailed description thereof will be omitted. Therefore, in the following description, points unique to the ink jet recording apparatus <b>300</b> will be mainly explained.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The ink jet recording apparatus <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes an ink jet head <b>302</b>, ink circulation means <b>14</b>, voltage application means <b>16</b>, and recording medium supporting means <b>18</b> arranged at a position opposing the ink jet head <b>302</b>.

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">That is, the ink guides <b>304</b> of the ink jet head <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref> according to an embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention differ from the ink guides <b>34</b> of the ink jet head <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> according to an embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention only in shape and arrangement. That is, the ink guides <b>34</b> are each an ink guide that has an octagonal pyramidal shape and is directly attached onto the surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> but the ink guides <b>304</b> are each a metal-made ink guide that has a quadrilateral pyramidal shape and is attached to the surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> through the metallic layer <b>308</b> and the insulation layer <b>306</b> on the metallic layer <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Accordingly, construction elements of the ink jet head <b>302</b> other than the ink guides <b>304</b>, that is, the head substrate <b>30</b>, the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>, the ejection electrodes (control electrodes) <b>36</b>, the shield electrode <b>40</b>, and the 3-D barriers <b>42</b> of the ink jet head <b>302</b> are the same as those of the ink jet head <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, so the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In addition, since the ink circulation means <b>14</b>, the voltage application means <b>16</b>, a counter electrode <b>70</b>, and a bias voltage supply <b>72</b> of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>300</b> are the same as those of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Hereinafter, the ink guides <b>304</b> of the ink jet head <b>302</b> and their related portions will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, on a surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> on a through-hole substrate <b>32</b> side, that is, on the upper surface thereof, the metallic layers <b>308</b> and the insulation layers <b>306</b> are stacked in this order for respective ejection portions and the metal-made ink guides <b>304</b> are provided on the insulation layers <b>306</b> stacked on the metallic layers <b>308</b>. Here, the metallic layers <b>308</b> and the insulation layers <b>306</b> have a shape that is approximately the same as the quadrilateral shape of the bottom surfaces of the quadrilateral pyramidal metal-made ink guides <b>304</b>.

At this time, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are spaced apart from the ink guides <b>304</b>, the metallic layers <b>308</b>, and the insulation layers <b>306</b> by a predetermined distance, thereby preventing contact therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">By providing the ink guides <b>304</b> on the insulation layers <b>306</b> like in this embodiment, even when the ink guides <b>304</b> are made of a metal, they are placed under an electrical insulated state.

Also, by providing the metallic layers <b>308</b> between the head substrate <b>30</b> and the insulation layers <b>306</b>, it becomes possible to suitably join the insulation layers <b>306</b> and the head substrate <b>30</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Here, in this embodiment, the insulation layers <b>306</b> and the metallic layers <b>308</b> are provided, although those layers are not necessarily required in the present invention.

Also, the metallic layers <b>308</b> may be omitted when the ink guides <b>304</b> and the head substrate <b>30</b> are joined to each other without using the metallic layers <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The metal-made ink guides <b>304</b> provided for the head substrate <b>30</b> with the metallic layers <b>308</b> and the insulation layers <b>306</b> therebetween are, for instance, made of a metal, such as Au, Cu, Ni, or Al, and has a polygonal pyramidal shape whose tip end has a sharply pointed convex shape. Meniscuses of ink are formed between the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b> and the through-holes <b>38</b> and the ink concentrates in the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b>. When a predetermined voltage is applied to the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> under this state, ink droplets are ejected from the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In this embodiment, the shape of the ink guides <b>304</b> is a quadrilateral pyramid, but the present invention is not limited to this.

In addition, there occurs no problem even when the ink guides <b>304</b> do not have a pyramidal or conical shape in their entireties so long as at least the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b> are sharply pointed. For instance, the ink guides <b>304</b> may have a shape where a cone or a polygonal pyramid whose tip end is sharply pointed, is placed on a cylindrical column or a polygonal column.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Even in this aspect, by forming the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b> in a sharply pointed shape, electric fields can concentrate in the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b>. As a result, it becomes possible to eject ink droplets with stability at a low voltage as compared with the conventional case and to eject minute droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Also, by setting the ink guides <b>304</b> as electrically-insulated metal portions, the dielectric constant thereof is substantially increased and it becomes easy to generate a strong electric field, thus improving the ink droplet ejection property.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In this embodiment, it is preferable that the tip end angle of the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b> be 120° or less and/or the radius of curvature of the tip end portions be 4 μm or less. In this aspect, it is not required to have the ink guides <b>304</b> whose tip ends are so sharply pointed when it is possible to eject droplets from the tip ends of the ink guides with stability at a desired ejection voltage. In order to eject the ink with more stability at a lower ejection voltage, however, it is preferable that the tip end portions of the ink guides be formed so as to have the tip end angle of 120° or less and/or the radius of curvature of 4 μm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are arranged on the upper surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> (on the surface opposing the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>) as ring-shaped circular electrodes that surround the connection portions among the ink guides <b>304</b>, the insulation layers <b>306</b>, the metallic layers <b>308</b>, and the head substrate <b>30</b>. Also, the ejection electrodes <b>36</b>, the ink guides <b>304</b> (including the insulation layers <b>306</b> and the metallic layers <b>308</b>), and the through-holes <b>38</b> are arranged so that they become substantially coaxial, that is, the centers thereof approximately coincide with each other. In this embodiment, a construction has been described in which the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are formed on the surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> so as to be exposed to the ink flow path. The present invention is not limited to this and the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> may be formed inside the head substrate <b>30</b> in a positional relation where the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are substantially coaxial with the through-holes <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Also, the multiple ink guides <b>304</b> and the multiple ejection electrodes <b>36</b> are formed integrally with the head substrate <b>30</b>, and distances between the ink guides <b>304</b> and the ejection electrodes <b>36</b> become constant. As a result, a drive voltage necessary for ejection is fixed from ejection portion to ejection portion and it becomes possible to eject multiple ink droplets at a high frequency with stability using a low drive voltage generally.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Even in this embodiment, like, for instance, in the case of the ejection electrodes <b>80</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the embodiment of the first aspect, a shape is preferably used in which the circular electrodes are partially removed on an ink supply side (ink flow path upstream side) like ejection electrodes <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. By thus partially removing the ejection electrodes <b>310</b> on the ink supply side or the ink flow path upstream side, a repulsive force exerted on ink particles as a result of application of a drive voltage to the ejection electrodes <b>310</b> at the time of recording is reduced on the ink supply side. As a result, even at the time of recording, it becomes possible to supply the ink particles to the ink guide <b>304</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Also, even with the ink jet recording apparatus <b>300</b> in this embodiment, it is certainly possible to perform an ink droplet ejection operation and provide the same effects as in the case of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> described above in the embodiment of the first aspect.</p>

Accordingly, in this embodiment, each same construction element is given the same reference numeral and the description thereof will be omitted. Therefore, in the following description, points unique to the ink jet recording apparatus <b>320</b> will be mainly explained.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">A head substrate <b>324</b> of an ink jet head <b>322</b> in this embodiment is provided with convex portions <b>326</b> common to ejection portions adjacent to each other in a direction orthogonal to an ink flow path (from the right side to the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, from the lower side to the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), and ink guides <b>304</b> and ejection electrodes <b>330</b> are provided on the convex portions <b>326</b>. In addition, concave portions <b>328</b> having a predetermined depth are formed outside the ejection electrodes <b>330</b> in a direction orthogonal to the ink flow path. That is, the ejection portions adjacent to each other in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path are formed on the same convex portion <b>326</b>, and the concave portions <b>328</b> are formed between the ejection portions adjacent to each other in the direction in which the ink flows.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Also, in this embodiment, the ejection electrodes <b>330</b> are preferably formed in a shape where they are partially removed on an ink supply side like the ejection electrodes <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">With this construction, the convex portions <b>326</b> function as leading weirs, and it becomes possible to lead ink in an ink guide <b>304</b> tip end direction and supply the ink to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Also, the concave portions <b>328</b> are provided, and the area of the ink flow path <b>44</b> increases. As a result, the amount of the ink flowing in the ink flow path <b>44</b> increases and it becomes possible to supply the ink to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>304</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Here, it is possible to say that the convex portions <b>326</b> and the concave portions <b>328</b> provided for the head substrate <b>324</b> of the ink jet head <b>322</b> of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>320</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> have the same constructions as the convex portions <b>94</b> and the concave portions <b>96</b> provided for the head substrate <b>92</b> of the ink jet head <b>91</b> of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>90</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> except for the construction of the ink guides. The convex portions <b>326</b> and the concave portions <b>328</b> have the same functions and effects as the convex portions <b>94</b> and the concave portions <b>96</b>. Therefore, the detailed description of the convex portions <b>326</b> and the concave portions <b>328</b> will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Next, a liquid ejection head production method according to a fifth aspect of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15E</figref> are each a schematic diagram showing an embodiment of a method of producing a metal portion serving as an ink guide of an ink jet head that is an example of the liquid ejection head according to the second aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing the shape of concave portions formed in an Si substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A to 17G</figref> are each a schematic diagram showing an embodiment of an ink jet head production method that is an example of the liquid ejection head production method according to the fifth aspect of the present invention where the ink guide produced in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15E</figref> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, an electrical insulation film <b>342</b> is formed on a &lt;100&gt; plane of an Si substrate <b>340</b> that is a single crystal substrate having the &lt;100&gt; plane as a surface. Then, a square opening portion <b>344</b> whose sides coincide with the &lt;110&gt; and &lt;1-10&gt; orientations of the crystalline plane of the Si substrate <b>340</b>, is produced in the insulation film <b>342</b> using a lithography method or the like so as to correspond to arrangement of an ink guide.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Next, anisotropic etching of the Si substrate <b>340</b> is performed using, for instance, a 34 wt % aqueous solution of KOH heated to 70° C. by using the insulation film <b>342</b> having the opening portion <b>344</b> as an etching mask. As a result of the etching, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15B and 16</figref>, a concave portion <b>346</b> whose cross section has an substantially quadrilateral pyramidal shape, is formed in the Si substrate <b>340</b>. Producing the concave portion <b>346</b> makes it possible to form the concave portion in a shape having a sharpened end portion whose base portion angle is around 120° or less and/or whose radius of curvature is 4 μm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the insulation film <b>342</b> is removed and another electrical insulation film <b>347</b> is newly formed on a surface of the Si substrate <b>340</b> including the concave portion <b>346</b>. As a result, the insulation film <b>347</b> is formed also for the inner surface of the concave portion <b>346</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, a metal portion <b>348</b> is formed on the surface of the Si substrate <b>340</b> including the concave portion <b>346</b> through plating or the like. As a result, a metal is filled into the concave portion <b>346</b>. Here, the plating is not the sole method of forming the metal portion <b>348</b> and the metal portion <b>348</b> may be formed through soldering or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Next, the metal portion <b>348</b> is removed except a part of the metal portion <b>348</b> filled into the concave portion <b>346</b>, that is, a quadrilateral pyramidal part (hereinafter referred to as the “metal portion <b>348</b><i>a</i>”) of the metal portion <b>348</b>. Then, an electrical insulation film is formed on the surface of the Si substrate <b>340</b> including the concave portion <b>346</b> through CVD or the like, a surface of the insulation film corresponding to the metal portion <b>348</b><i>a </i>is masked using a lithography method, the formed mask serves as an etching mask, and the insulation film is etched except its part corresponding to the metal portion <b>348</b><i>a</i>, thereby forming an electrical insulation layer <b>350</b> on a surface of the metal portion <b>348</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Then, a metallic film is formed on the surface of the Si substrate <b>340</b> including the concave portion <b>346</b> through evaporation or the like and is removed except its part above the metal portion <b>348</b><i>a </i>using, for instance, a lithography method and etching, thereby forming a metallic layer <b>352</b> on the insulation layer <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>, the convex metal portion <b>348</b><i>a </i>serving as an ink guide is formed at a position corresponding to arrangement of the ink guide of the Si substrate <b>340</b>, the insulation layer <b>350</b> is formed on a surface (surface serving as a bottom surface of the ink guide) of the metal portion <b>348</b><i>a</i>, and the metallic layer <b>352</b> is further formed on a surface of the insulation layer <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Here, in this embodiment, the concave portion for forming the ink guide is produced using an Si substrate. The present invention is not limited to this and any other single crystal substrate may be used so long as anisotropic etching of the single crystal substrate can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Next, an ink jet head production method in this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A to 17G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Here, only one ejection portion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A to 17G</figref>, although it is also possible to produce two-dimensionally disposed ejection portions at the same time with the production method in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Also, in this embodiment, a glass substrate <b>360</b> is used as an example of a substrate that has an electrical insulation property and serves as a head substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">First, a metallic film is evaporated onto the glass substrate <b>360</b>, a mask corresponding to an electrode pattern of a wiring portion is formed on the metallic film with a lithography method or the like, and the metallic film is etched using the formed mask as an etching mask, thereby forming an electrode <b>362</b> serving as the wiring portion on the glass substrate <b>360</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. Here, a method for evaporating the metallic film is not specifically limited and it is sufficient that the metallic film is evaporated using a conventionally known technique such as sputtering or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">A metallic film is evaporated on a surface opposite to the surface of the glass substrate <b>360</b> on which the electrode <b>362</b> has been formed, through sputtering or the like and then a mask is produced with a lithography method or the like. Here, the mask in this embodiment is a ring-shaped mask with which the metallic film is exposed to the outside except its part that will become an ejection electrode. Through etching the metallic film using the mask as an etching mask, a ring-shaped electrode <b>364</b> serving as an ejection electrode is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Here, it is also possible to form the electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which are partially removed, by forming the mask in a shape where a part of a ring shape is removed and etching the metallic film using the mask as an etching mask.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, a through-hole <b>366</b> is formed in the glass substrate <b>360</b> so that the electrode <b>362</b> and the ring-shaped electrode <b>364</b> form some portions of the inner wall surface of the through-hole <b>366</b>. By thus forming the through hole <b>366</b>, the electrode <b>362</b> and the electrode <b>364</b> are partially exposed to the side surface of the through-hole <b>366</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">It is sufficient that the through-hole <b>366</b> is formed using a conventionally known technique such as sand blasting or laser beam machining. Also, the through-hole <b>366</b> is preferably formed in a tapered shape where the through-hole <b>366</b> is gradually narrowed as a distance to a surface on which the electrode <b>362</b> is formed is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Next, for continuity between the electrode <b>362</b> and the electrode <b>364</b> on both surfaces of the glass substrate <b>360</b>, a metallic film is evaporated on the side surface of the through-hole <b>366</b>, thereby forming an electrode <b>368</b> on the side surface of the through-hole <b>366</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>. At this time, in order to prevent the metallic film from being evaporated on portions other than the side surface of the through-hole <b>366</b>, a resist layer that will become a mask may be formed in portions where the metallic film is not to be evaporated.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Then, a metal is filled into the through-hole <b>366</b> and is caused to adhere at a position corresponding to arrangement of an ink guide on a surface of the glass substrate <b>360</b> on which the electrode <b>364</b> has been formed, by performing plating such as electroplating. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>, a plated portion <b>370</b> serving as a drawing portion is formed so as to be embedded in the through-hole <b>366</b> and a metallic layer <b>372</b> is formed at the position corresponding to the arrangement of the ink guide. Here, as the metal used to perform the plating, various metals are usable and, in particular, a metal such as Au, Cu, or Ni which will never be corroded even when the metal contact the ink is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Even in this case, it is also possible to form a resist layer serving as a mask in parts in which plating is not to be performed, so that the plating will not be performed in parts other than the through-hole <b>366</b> and the position corresponding to the arrangement of the ink guide on the surface of the glass substrate <b>360</b> on which the electrode <b>364</b> has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Also, it is not required to perform the plating for the position corresponding to the arrangement of the ink guide and the plating for the through-hole at the same time. Those platings may be performed separately.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17F</figref>, a metallic layer <b>374</b> is formed through diffused junction of the metallic film <b>372</b> of the glass substrate <b>360</b> and the metallic layer <b>352</b> of the Si substrate <b>340</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>. Here, it is possible to join the metallic film <b>372</b> and the metallic layer <b>352</b> at 300° C. or less by performing the diffused junction using, for instance, a metal containing Sn or the like in a metallic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">It should be noted here that the method of joining the metallic layer <b>352</b> of the Si substrate <b>340</b> and the metallic film <b>372</b> of the glass substrate <b>360</b> to each other is not limited to the diffused junction and it is possible to use other conventionally known techniques such as soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Next, by removing the Si substrate <b>340</b> and then removing the insulation film <b>347</b> using etchant such as an aqueous solution of KOH, it is possible to produce a metal portion <b>348</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17G</figref> serving as an ink guide whose tip end portion has a tip end angle of 120° or less and/or has a radius of curvature of 4 μm or less, for the glass substrate <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">With the method described above, it is possible to produce a head substrate including the ink guide which is made of a metal and whose tip end is sharply pointed, the ejection electrode provided on the head substrate so as to surround the ink guide, the electrode drawing portion for establishing connection with voltage application means for applying a voltage to the ejection electrode, and the wiring portion provided on a surface opposite to the surface on which the ejection electrode of the head substrate has been arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Even in this case, it is possible to produce an ink jet head through assembling where a through-hole substrate including through-holes at positions corresponding to ejection portions is further placed at a position spaced apart from the head substrate of the head-substrate-side structural body produced in the manner described above by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">By thus manufacturing a liquid ejection head using, for instance, lithography and etching of a semiconductor manufacturing method, it becomes possible to produce a metallic ink guide and an ejection electrode having high reliability and high accuracy. As a result, it becomes possible to produce an ink jet head at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Also, by producing ink guides in the manner described above, an ink guide can be produced whose tip end is sharply pointed, using a metal with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The ink guide having inclined surfaces of a high-order polyhedron is not the sole ink guide that can be produced in the above embodiment and it is possible to produce ink guides having various shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Also, at the time of production of the ink jet head, alignment marks are preferably formed at predetermined positions of the single crystal substrate, the glass substrate, the metallic layer, and the like and alignment is performed with reference to the alignment marks. Performing the alignment using the alignment marks makes it possible to form the ink guides on the head substrate without causing positional displacements.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The liquid ejection head according to the second aspect of the present invention and the liquid ejection head production method according to the fifth aspect are fundamentally constructed in the manner described above.</p>

<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Accordingly, construction elements of the ink jet head <b>202</b> except the ink guides <b>204</b>, the ejection electrodes <b>206</b>, the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b>, and positions where the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> pass through the head substrate <b>30</b> are the same as those of the ink jet head <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. That is, the head substrate <b>30</b>, the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>, the shield electrode <b>40</b>, the 3-D barriers <b>42</b>, and the wiring portion <b>48</b> of the ink jet head <b>202</b> are the same as those of the ink jet head <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. Thus, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">In addition, the ink circulation means <b>14</b>, the voltage application means <b>16</b>, a counter electrode <b>70</b>, and a bias voltage supply <b>72</b> of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>200</b> are the same as those of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Hereinafter, the ink guides <b>204</b> and their related portions of the ink jet head <b>202</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> are provided for respective ejection portions on a surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> on a through-hole substrate <b>32</b> side and the ink guides <b>204</b> are attached to the upper surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>206</b>. Here, the head substrate <b>30</b> is made of an electrical insulative material such as glass or SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The ejection electrodes <b>206</b> are arranged between the upper surface (surface on a side opposing the through-hole substrate <b>32</b>) of the head substrate <b>30</b> and the bottom surfaces (surfaces on a head substrate <b>30</b> side) of the ink guides <b>204</b>. Also, the ink guides <b>204</b>, the ejection electrodes <b>206</b>, and the through-holes <b>38</b> of the through-hole substrate <b>32</b> are arranged so that they become substantially coaxial, that is, the centers thereof approximately coincide with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Here, in the ink jet head <b>202</b> of this embodiment, the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> are arranged between the head substrate <b>30</b> and the ink guides <b>204</b>, so it becomes possible to cause only electric fields generated from the upper surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> to act on ink particles. That is, no electric field that prevents concentration of the ink particles exists at the through-holes <b>38</b>, so it becomes possible to cause the ink particles to be concentrated in the through-holes <b>38</b> swiftly.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Also, arranging the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> below the bottom surfaces of the ink guides <b>204</b> makes it possible to cause the electric fields to be concentrated in the tip end portions of the ink guides. As a result, it becomes possible to reduce a voltage applied in order to cause ink droplets to be ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Further, the multiple ink guides <b>204</b> and the multiple ejection electrodes <b>206</b> are formed integrally with the head substrate <b>30</b>, so distances between the ink guides <b>204</b> and the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> become constant. Thus, the distance between the ink guide <b>204</b> and the ejection electrode <b>206</b> is fixed from ejection portion to ejection portion. Therefore, a drive voltage necessary for ejection is fixed from ejection portion to ejection portion and it becomes possible to eject multiple ink droplets at a high frequency with stability using a low drive voltage generally.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">It should be noted here that the ejection electrodes are not limited to the circular electrode and it is possible to use other electrodes in various shapes such as a polygonal electrode corresponding to the shape of the bottom surfaces of the ink guides and a ring-shaped electrode. However, an electrode having a shape where no hole exists, such as a circular electrode or a polygonal electrode, is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a ring-shaped electrode is generally used as the ejection electrodes. In the present invention, however, the ejection electrodes are arranged between the head substrate and the ink guides, so an electrode having a shape where no hole exists can be used. Using the electrode in the shape including no hole as the ejection electrodes makes it possible to produce the ejection electrodes with more ease because machining such as punching becomes unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Also, in this embodiment, the ejection electrodes are formed in such a size that they are hidden behind the ink guides, that is, the ejection electrodes are formed smaller than the bottom surfaces of the ink guides. The present invention is not limited to this and the ejection electrodes may be formed in any other size. For instance, the ejection electrodes may be formed larger than the bottom surfaces of the ink guides.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The ink guides <b>204</b> are attached onto surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> on a through-hole substrate <b>32</b> side and have a polygonal pyramidal shape whose tip end has a sharply pointed convex shape. Meniscuses of ink are formed between the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> and the through-holes <b>38</b> and the ink is supplied to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b>. When a predetermined voltage is applied to the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> under this state, ink droplets are ejected from the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In this embodiment, like in the case of the ink guides <b>34</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shape of the ink guides <b>204</b> is an octagonal pyramid. The present invention is not limited to this. That is, the shape of the ink guides <b>204</b> may be changed to a polygonal pyramid except the octagonal pyramid or to a cone or an elliptical cone. In addition, the ink guides <b>204</b> do not have to be in a pyramidal or conical shape in their entireties so long as at least the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> are sharply pointed. For instance, a shape may be used in which a cone or a polygonal pyramid whose tip end is sharply pointed, is placed on a cylindrical column or a polygonal column.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Also in this aspect, forming the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> in the sharply pointed shape makes it possible to cause electric fields to be concentrated at the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b>. As a result, it becomes possible to eject ink droplets with stability at a low voltage as compared with a conventional case. In addition, minute droplets can be ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">In this embodiment, it is preferable that the tip end angle of the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> be 60° or less and/or the radius of curvature of the tip end portions be 4 μm or less. In the present invention, if droplets can be stably ejected from the ink guide tip ends at a desired ejection voltage, it is not required to have the ink guides <b>204</b> whose tip ends are so sharply pointed. However, in order to eject the ink more stably at a lower ejection voltage, it is preferable that the tip end angle of the tip end portions of the ink guides be 60° or less and/or the radius of curvature of the tip end portions be 4 μm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Here, the surface of each ink guide <b>204</b> may be coated with a conductive film made of a metal or the like in a partial region thereof containing an extreme tip end portion. When such a conductive film is formed for the extreme tip end portion, the dielectric constant of the tip end portion is substantially increased, so it becomes easy to generate a strong electric field and possible to improve the ink droplet ejection property.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Also, the ink guides <b>204</b> preferably have conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">As described above, the ink guides <b>204</b> are arranged on the ejection electrodes <b>206</b>. When the ink guides <b>204</b> are made conductive, the ink guides <b>204</b> and the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> have the same potential. As a result, the ink guides <b>204</b> substantially serve as ejection electrodes and concentration of electric fields at the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> becomes easy, thereby ejecting ink droplets at a lower voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Also, the ink guides <b>204</b> are preferably made of a semiconductor, such as Si, GaAs, or InP, whose electric conductivity is in a range of 10<sup>−2 </sup>S/m to 10<sup>6 </sup>S/m. In particular, the ink guides <b>204</b> are preferably made of Si. Producing the ink guides <b>204</b> using a semiconductor, in particular, Si in this manner makes it possible to obtain ink guides having high conductivity with ease using a production method to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Here, the electric conductivity of Si can be adjusted by, for instance, mixing various substances into Si, and the present invention is not limited to the range described above and it is possible to produce ink guides having various electric conductivity values with ease using Si.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> are made of a conductive material, such as a metal, and are provided so as to pass through the head substrate <b>30</b> from the lower surfaces of the ejection electrodes <b>206</b>. Surfaces of the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> on a head substrate <b>30</b> back surface side (surface of the head substrate <b>30</b> opposite to an ink flow path <b>44</b> side) contact the wiring portion <b>48</b> and the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> electrically connect the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> and the wiring portion <b>48</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Here, the shape and position of the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> are not limited so long as the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> electrically connect the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> and the wiring portion <b>48</b> to each other. For instance, the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> may be arranged so that some portions of surfaces of the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> on the ink flow path <b>44</b> side become contact surfaces with the ejection electrodes <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Also, the ink jet recording apparatus <b>200</b> in this embodiment can perform an ink droplet ejection operation and provide the same effects as in the case of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> described above in the embodiment of the first aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">In particular, in this embodiment, the ejection electrodes are provided on the head substrate and the ink guides whose tip ends are sharply pointed, are provided on surfaces of the ejection electrodes, thereby ejecting ink droplets with stability at high speed through low-voltage driving and form a high-quality image at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an outline construction of an embodiment of an ink jet recording apparatus having an ink jet head according to another embodiment of the liquid ejection head according to the third aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an arrangement example of ejection electrodes of the ink jet head of the ink jet recording apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. An ink jet recording apparatus <b>220</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> has the same construction as the electrostatic ink jet recording apparatus <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b> except some portions. Accordingly, in this embodiment, each same construction element is given the same reference numeral and the description thereof will be omitted. Therefore, in the following description, points unique to the ink jet recording apparatus <b>220</b> will be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">A head substrate <b>224</b> of an ink jet head <b>222</b> in this embodiment is provided with convex portions <b>228</b> common to ejection portions adjacent to each other in a direction orthogonal to an ink flow path (from the right side to the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, from the lower side to the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>), and ink guides <b>204</b> and ejection electrodes <b>206</b> are provided on the convex portions <b>228</b>. Also, concave portions <b>226</b> having a predetermined depth are formed outside the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path. That is, ejection portions adjacent to each other in the direction orthogonal to the ink flow path are formed on the same convex portion <b>228</b> and the concave portions <b>226</b> are formed between ejection portions adjacent to each other in a direction in which the ink flows.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">It should be noted here that in this embodiment, the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> and electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> are provided below the ink guides <b>204</b>, thereby reducing the areas of the convex portions <b>228</b> and increasing the areas of the concave portions <b>226</b> as compared with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where the ejection electrodes <b>206</b> and the electrode drawing portions <b>208</b> are provided outside the ink guides <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">With this construction, the convex portions <b>228</b> function as leading weirs, so it becomes possible to lead the ink in an ink guide <b>204</b> tip end direction and supply the ink to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Also, the concave portions <b>226</b> are provided, thereby increasing the area of the ink flow path <b>44</b>. As a result, the amount of the ink flowing in the ink flow path <b>44</b> increases and the ink can be supplied to the tip end portions of the ink guides <b>204</b> with efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Here, it is possible to say that the convex portions <b>228</b> and the concave portions <b>226</b> provided for the head substrate <b>224</b> of the ink jet head <b>222</b> of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>220</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> have the same constructions as the convex portions <b>94</b> and the concave portions <b>96</b> provided for the head substrate <b>92</b> of the ink jet head <b>91</b> of the ink jet recording apparatus <b>90</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> except for the sizes of the convex portions and the concave portions and constructions of the ink guides, the ejection electrodes, and the electrode drawing portions, so the convex portions <b>228</b> and the concave portions <b>226</b> have the same functions and effects as the convex portions <b>94</b> and the concave portions <b>96</b>. Therefore, the detailed description of the convex portions <b>228</b> and the concave portions <b>226</b> will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Hereinafter, an ink jet head production method according to an embodiment of a liquid ejection head production method according to a sixth aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A to 23H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Here, only one ejection portion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A to 23H</figref>, although it is certainly possible to produce two-dimensionally disposed ejection portions at the same time using the production method in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">In this embodiment, a glass substrate <b>232</b> is used as an example of an electrical insulating substrate serving as a head substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">First, although not illustrated, a metallic film is evaporated onto the glass substrate <b>232</b>, a mask corresponding to the electrode pattern of a wiring portion is produced on the metallic film with a lithography method or the like, and the metallic film is etched using the mask, thereby forming an electrode <b>234</b> serving as the wiring portion for the glass substrate <b>232</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>. Here, a method for evaporating the metallic film is not specifically limited and it is sufficient that the metallic film is evaporated using a conventionally known technique such as sputtering or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Next, a metallic film is evaporated onto a surface opposite to a surface of the glass substrate <b>232</b> on which the electrode <b>234</b> has been formed, and a mask corresponding to the electrode pattern of an ejection electrode is produced on the metallic film using a lithography method or the like. Then, the metallic film is etched using the produced mask as an etching mask, thereby forming a circular electrode <b>236</b> serving as the ejection electrode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>, a through-hole <b>238</b> that is 100 μm in diameter for example is formed in the glass substrate <b>232</b> so that the electrode <b>234</b> and the electrode <b>236</b> form some portions of the inner wall surface of the through-hole <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">By thus forming the through-hole <b>238</b>, the electrode <b>234</b> and the electrode <b>236</b> are partially exposed to the side surface of the through-hole <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">It is sufficient that the through-hole <b>238</b> is formed using a conventionally known technique such as sand blasting or laser beam machining.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23D</figref>, for continuity between the electrode <b>234</b> and the electrode <b>236</b> on both surfaces of the glass substrate <b>232</b>, a metallic film is evaporated onto the side surface of the through-hole <b>238</b>, thereby forming an electrode <b>240</b> on the side surface of the through-hole <b>238</b>. At this time, in order to prevent the metallic film from being evaporated onto portions other than the side surface of the through-hole <b>238</b>, a resist layer serving as a mask may be formed in portions where the metallic film is not to be evaporated.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Then, a metal is filled into the through-hole <b>238</b> by performing plating such as electroplating. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23E</figref>, a plated portion <b>242</b> serving as an electrode drawing portion is formed in the through-hole <b>238</b> and the plated portion <b>242</b> also covers the portion corresponding to the electrode <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Here, it is possible to use various metals as the metal used to perform the plating and it is particularly preferable to use a metal, such as copper, nickel, or solder, which will never be corroded even through contact with ink.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Also, the punching step described above, that is, the step for forming the through-hole in the glass substrate and the metal filling step, that is, the step for filling the metal into the through-hole may be performed after a joining step to be described next.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Next, the electrode <b>236</b> and a surface of an Si substrate <b>244</b> are joined to each other. As a method of joining the electrode <b>236</b> and the Si substrate <b>244</b> to each other, it is possible to use various methods, such as joining through eutectic reaction between the electrode <b>236</b> and the Si substrate <b>244</b>, joining through mutual diffusion between a metallic film formed for the Si substrate <b>244</b> and the metallic film formed for the glass substrate <b>232</b>, and soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Here, the electrode <b>236</b> and the Si substrate <b>244</b> are joined to each other through the eutectic reaction. It is possible to adopt, for instance, a method with which the electrode <b>236</b> is formed using Au, and AuSi is formed by causing Si of the Si substrate <b>244</b> and Au of the electrode <b>236</b> to react with each other through heating of portions to be joined to each other to around 400° C.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Also, in the case of the joining through the mutual diffusion between the metallic films, it is, for instance, possible to use a method with which the electrode <b>236</b> is formed using Au, an AuSn film is formed for the Si substrate <b>244</b> as the metallic film, and the electrode <b>236</b> and the Si substrate <b>244</b> are joined to each other by diffusing Sn through heating of portions to be joined to each other to around 300° C.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23F</figref>, an oxide film <b>246</b> is formed on a surface of the Si substrate <b>244</b> that is not joined to the electrode <b>236</b>. The oxide film <b>246</b> is generally formed through film formation based on sputtering or CVD of SiO<sub>2 </sub>or through oxidation before joining with the electrode <b>236</b>. Also, the surface of the Si substrate <b>244</b> on which the oxide film has been formed is a &lt;100&gt; crystalline plane.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Next, a square resist pattern whose sides coincide with the &lt;110&gt; and &lt;1-10&gt; crystal orientations of the Si substrate <b>244</b>, is formed on the oxide film <b>246</b> using a lithography method or the like at a position corresponding to arrangement of an ink guide. Following this, the oxide film <b>246</b> is etched using the resist pattern as an etching mask. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23G</figref>, the oxide film <b>246</b> becomes a mask <b>248</b> having a shape corresponding to the shape of the square resist pattern, that is, a square shape whose sides coincide with the &lt;110&gt; and &lt;1-10&gt; crystal orientations of the Si substrate <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Next, the Si substrate <b>244</b> is immersed in, for instance, a 34 wt % aqueous solution of KOH heated to 70° C. and anisotropic etching of the Si substrate is performed. In this etching Step, the Si substrate <b>244</b> is anisotropically etched using the square mask <b>248</b> as an etching mask. During this etching, undercut progresses from the square portion of the mask <b>248</b> and the etching is performed until the mask <b>248</b> is separated from the surface of the Si substrate <b>244</b>. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23H</figref>, a pyramidal structural member <b>250</b> that is formed by inclined surfaces of a high-order polyhedron and serves as the tip end portion of the ink guide having a sharpened tip end with a tip end angle of 60° or less and/or a radius of curvature of 4 μm or less is formed for a part of the Si substrate <b>244</b>. Here, after the anisotropic etching of the Si substrate <b>244</b> is performed, the Si substrate <b>244</b> is left by a predetermined thickness. The pyramidal structural member <b>250</b> is therefore formed on the Si substrate <b>244</b> having the predetermined thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23I</figref>, a mask <b>252</b> resistant to Si etching is formed using SiO<sub>2</sub>, a metal, or the like for the pyramidal structural member <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Next, the Si substrate <b>244</b> is etched through Deep-RIE using the mask <b>252</b> as an etching mask, thereby forming on a surface of the glass substrate <b>100</b> a columnar structural member <b>254</b> having the pyramidal structural member <b>250</b> in its tip end portion and serving as a base portion of the ink guide on a surface of the electrode <b>236</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23J</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">With the method described above, it is possible to produce a head substrate structural body including the ejection electrode, the ink guide which is provided on the ejection electrode and whose tip end is sharply pointed, the electrode drawing portion that is provided below the ejection electrode so as to pass through the head substrate and establishes connection with voltage application means for applying a voltage, and the wiring portion provided on a surface opposite to the surface on which the ejection electrode of the head substrate has been arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Even in this case, it is possible to produce an ink jet head through assembling where a through-hole substrate including through-holes at positions corresponding to ejection portions is further placed at a position spaced apart from the head substrate of the head-substrate-side structural body produced in the manner described above by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In this embodiment, the pyramidal structural member serving as the ink guide is produced using the Si substrate. The present invention is not limited to this and it is sufficient that a single crystal substrate made of GaAs, InP, or the like on which anisotropic etching can be performed is used.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Here, as a matter of course, in order to form the electrode and the pyramidal structural member at precise positions, alignment marks may be formed at predetermined positions of the glass substrate, the Si substrate, and the like and alignment may be performed using the formed marks.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">By thus manufacturing a liquid ejection head using, for instance, lithography and etching of a semiconductor manufacturing method, an ink guide and an ejection electrode having high reliability and high accuracy can be produced. As a result, an ink jet head can be produced at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Also, by using the production method described above, it is also possible to produce with high accuracy an ink guide whose tip end is sharply pointed.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Next, another embodiment of the liquid ejection head production method according to the sixth aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A to 24C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">It should be noted here that the production method in this embodiment is the same as that in the embodiment described above based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A to 23H</figref> except the ink guide production method. Different points will be mainly described in the following explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">First, like in the case of the production method described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A to 23H</figref>, an electrode <b>234</b> serving as a wiring portion is formed for a glass substrate <b>232</b>. An electrode <b>236</b> serving as an ejection electrode is formed on a surface opposite to the surface of the glass substrate <b>232</b> on which the electrode <b>234</b> has been formed, at a position corresponding to arrangement of an ink guide. A through-hole is formed so that the electrode <b>236</b> and the electrode <b>234</b> constitute some portions of the inner wall of the through-hole. A metallic film is evaporated onto the side surface of the through-hole, and a plated portion <b>242</b> serving as an electrode drawing portion is produced by performing plating so as to fill the through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Then, by joining the electrode <b>236</b> on the glass substrate <b>232</b> and an Si substrate <b>244</b> with each other through eutectic reaction, mutual diffusion between metallic films, soldering, or the like, a product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> is obtained which has the same structure as the product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>, a mask <b>262</b> is formed at a position corresponding to arrangement of the ink guide.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Next, by performing anisotropic etching of the Si substrate <b>244</b> using the mask <b>262</b> as an etching mask, a pyramidal structural member <b>260</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref> is formed which serves as an ink guide whose tip end is sharply pointed.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Even with the method described above, it is possible to produce a head substrate including the ejection electrode, the ink guide which is provided on the ejection electrode and whose tip end is sharply pointed, the electrode drawing portion provided below the ejection electrode so as to pass through the head substrate and establishing connection with voltage application means for applying a voltage, and the wiring portion provided on a surface opposite to the surface on which the ejection electrode of the head substrate has been arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Even in this case, in completely the same manner, it is possible to produce an ink jet head through assembling where a through-hole substrate including through-holes at positions corresponding to ejection portions is further placed at a position spaced apart from the head substrate of the head-substrate-side structural body produced in the manner described above by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Adjusting the shapes of the masks, etchant, and the like, makes it possible to eliminate limitation to an ink guide including a tip end portion having a pyramidal structure and a base portion having a columnar structure and produce ink guides having various shapes such as an ink guide having a pyramidal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The liquid ejection head and the production method thereof according to the present invention have been described in detail above. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and it is certainly possible to make various changes and modifications without departing from the gist of the present invention.</p>
