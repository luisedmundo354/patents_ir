<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and system provides for acoustic sensing of structures, including a general shape and/or configuration of the structure and movement within the structure. Acoustic waves are used to characterize structures, including any activity within. As waves from a sound source travel into the structure, they resonate within cavities and connecting tunnels or halls. This acoustic resonance is received at an acoustic receiver. The received signal is analyzed in comparison to the generated signal, and properties of the structure are determined, including the size and shape of the structure, as well as movement of objects within the structure.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/541,352, filed on Feb. 3, 2004, and entitled “Active Acoustic Sensor of Underground Facilities,” the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to acoustic sensing for characterizing structures and the activity within structures. More specifically, the invention uses active acoustic signals and responses to the acoustic signals to determine the characteristics of and sense personnel movement within an underground facility or aboveground structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In present day police, military, and other intelligence and security operations, increasing numbers of operations are conducted that involve entering and securing above-ground or below-ground structures. Personnel involved with the tactical assessment of adversarial underground facilities and aboveground buildings are put at risk if an adversary is located within the structure. In such a case, a person entering the structure may be attacked by the adversary, or personnel in and/or around the structure may be subject to a surprise attack. Accordingly, operational planning involving such structures generally requires an abundance of caution in order to protect the involved personnel. Due to the many unknown risk factors involved, such planning and operations often proceed at a relatively slow pace. Once these facilities are identified, the ability to quickly and accurately assess the structures would improve operation planning and significantly lower the risks to soldiers and security personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There has been a great deal of work done to detect and localize underground facilities, however, there are currently few sensing devices that can characterize these structures. Ground, air and space-borne sensors may locate underground facilities using passive acoustic (listening), infrared and other observables. Once located, tactical personnel must determine the threats posed by these facilities. Several sensors exist for locating personnel hidden within structures but most are impractical for use in caves and tunnels. Similarly, there are few devices that can identify potentially hostile movement within urban buildings. “Through the wall” radar is currently in routine use by law enforcement and border security personnel to detect subjects on the other side of building walls and some cargo containers. However, the range of detection is limited. Like most electromagnetic waves, radar is severely attenuated by rock/soil or metal walls and would not penetrate far into underground structures or buildings. Passive acoustic sensors have been developed to listen for nearby human activity (or heartbeats) within structures, and these may be very helpful in determining if humans are present in caves and tunnels. However, these sensors do not provide any information about the underground structure or location of activity deep inside a structure. In the case of underground facilities, military analysts have concluded that “the sheer complexity of underground facilities, including their location, depth, configuration, and military functions, suggest that this problem will plague U. S. defense planners for years to come”. Thus, new sensing methods are needed for characterizing configuration and activity within tunnels and caves.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Similarly, homeland security and urban combat situations require sensors that detect activity within buildings and other structures. Law enforcement agencies, rescue teams and fire departments need better “see through the wall” technologies to locate people within these structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a method and system for utilizing acoustic waves to characterize structures and activity within structures. A source of acoustic waves is placed at or near an entrance to a structure and generates acoustic waves that enter the structure. The acoustic waves generate a resonance within at least a portion of the structure, and this resonance is detected by an acoustic receiver that is placed at or near the entrance to the structure. The signal from the acoustic receiver is provided to a spectrum analyzer and spectra associated with the received signal are generated. Resonance peaks within the spectra are analyzed to determine at least one of size and location of chambers or connecting segments within the structure and movement of objects within the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the present invention provides an apparatus for sensing characteristics of a structure. The apparatus comprises (a) an acoustic generator operable to generate acoustic waves directed into an entrance of the structure, the acoustic waves generating acoustic resonance within at least a portion of the structure, the acoustic resonance generating resonant acoustic waves; (b) an acoustic receiver operable to receive the resonant acoustic waves from the entrance of the structure; and (c) a control system operably interconnected to the acoustic generator and the acoustic receiver and operable to receive a signal from the acoustic receiver corresponding to the resonant acoustic waves and analyze the signal to determine at least a movement of an object within the portion of the structure associated with the acoustic resonance. In one embodiment, the acoustic generator includes a loudspeaker, a power amplifier operably interconnected with the loudspeaker and operable to drive the loudspeaker to generate the acoustic waves, and a frequency sweep generator operably interconnected to the power amplifier and operable to deliver a frequency varying signal to the amplifier. The acoustic generator may also include a sweep trigger operably interconnected to the frequency sweep generator and operable to control the frequency sweep generator to deliver the frequency varying signal. The sweep trigger controls a rate at which the frequency of the frequency varying signal is adjusted and a range of frequencies of the frequency varying signal. The range of frequencies, in an embodiment, is selected based on expected characteristics of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The acoustic receiver, in an embodiment, comprises a microphone and a preamplifier operably interconnected to the microphone. The acoustic receiver may also include a spectrum analyzer operably interconnected to the preamplifier and operable to generate a spectra of signals received at the microphone, and a structural characteristics estimator operably interconnected to the spectrum analyzer and operable to receive the spectra of signals from the spectrum analyzer and analyze the spectra to generate an estimation of the structural characteristics of the portion of the structure generating the resonant acoustic waves. The structural characteristics are estimated, in an embodiment, determining resonant peaks of the spectra, comparing the resonant peaks to predetermined resonant peaks associated with structures having known structural characteristics, and determining the structural characteristics based on the comparison. The determining of the structural characteristics may be performed using a least squares fit between the resonant peaks and the predetermined resonant peaks to generate an estimate of the structural characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, the acoustic receiver further comprises a motion and direction detector operably interconnected to the spectrum analyzer and operable to receive a plurality of spectra from the spectrum analyzer and generate an estimation of motion of objects within the portion of the structure generating the resonant acoustic waves. The motion and direction detector is operable to compare successive spectra of the plurality of spectra and estimate movement based on a difference in resonant peaks between the successive spectra.</p>

Also, as used herein, the term characteristics (or structural characteristics) is used to refer to physical properties of structures, such as size, shape, and layout of chambers and/or cavities therein, as well as movement and activity within a structure. Acoustic waves are generated and excite an acoustic resonance within the structure, and this acoustic resonance is received at an acoustic receiver. Acoustic resonance is caused by one or more reflections of an acoustic wave within a structure that often result in the intensification of acoustic waves at certain frequencies. The frequencies at which acoustic resonance occurs is a property of the size, shape, and layout of chambers within the structure, as well as the number and placement of objects within the chambers. The received signal is analyzed in comparison to the generated signal, and characteristics of the structure are determined, including the size and shape of the structure, as well as movement of objects within the structure. Furthermore, the method and system may be used in rescue operations to determine the existence of cavities or movement within collapsed structures, such as collapsed buildings or mines.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention uses acoustic waves to characterize structures, including the activity within. As waves, such as sound waves, from an acoustical source travel into the structure, they resonate within cavities and connecting tunnels or halls. These resonances are the result of the same types of reflections that result in echoes in large caves or rooms. In one embodiment, the acoustic frequencies used are very low, near the threshold of hearing, and are termed infrasonic (i.e. less than about 20 hertz). At these low frequencies, the acoustic waves have a relatively long wavelength and may penetrate deep into a structure. For example, at 20 hertz the wavelength is approximately 18 meters (˜55 feet). Rock, soil and walls are almost perfect reflectors (&gt;99%) at these relatively low frequencies and the interior chambers resonate at frequencies where one or more wavelengths fit within the walls. A microphone, or other acoustic receiver, sensitive to this frequency range senses these resonances. The source frequency is swept over a frequency range sufficient to excite the natural resonances of the interior spaces. These measurements create a “resonance spectrum” of the structure over the swept frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic illustration of a system of the present invention is now described. A structure <b>20</b>, in this example is an underground facility having a chamber or cavity located within the earth <b>24</b>. Acoustic waves <b>28</b> are generated from an acoustic generator <b>32</b>, and these waves are emitted and resonate within the structure <b>20</b>. The acoustic generator <b>32</b> may be deployed at an entrance <b>36</b> to the underground facility, or held by a user within the structure <b>20</b> itself. An acoustic receiver <b>40</b> senses the waves <b>44</b> that reflect and resonate within the structure <b>20</b>. The received acoustic signals <b>44</b> are processed by a control system <b>48</b> to characterize the structure <b>20</b> and determine total volume and number of cavities, connecting segments, entrances, and moving entities within. As used herein, the term entrance refers to any part of a structure where acoustic waves may be transmitted into other parts of the structure. Such entrances include, for example, openings, windows, doors, and/or interior parts of the structure itself.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system may be used in many embodiments, such as military applications to provide for improved safety of soldiers and guided vehicles deployed within underground structures to determine extent of underground structures, and whether entities, such as adversarial combatants, are approaching, including around blind corners. The layout and extent can be characterized in terms of total volume, number of entrances, number of large caverns, and moving entities within the structure. Characterization of underground facilities using both before and after readings may be used to provide an assessment of battle damage.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The use of acoustic signals provides several important characteristics. For example, rock and soil walls provide relatively little attenuation of acoustic signals, unlike electromagnetic radiation which is significantly attenuated by such material. Similarly, above-ground structures such as houses and steel or concrete buildings also provide relatively little attenuation of acoustic signals. Furthermore, acoustic waves may travel around corners to sense deep within the structure. The technology also has a low cost as compared with electromagnetic equipment, and is relatively small and may be embodied in a man-portable apparatus. Multiple configurations are available, including handheld, and air delivery into the entrance, vehicle-mounted, or standoff sensing. The frequency of the acoustic signals may also be selected to be below the hearing threshold of occupants of the structure, and may thus provide undetected sensing of the structure and movement therein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system may also be used in many embodiments involving non-military operations, such as law enforcement and emergency personnel attempting to locate people. As mentioned above, the system may be used to characterize and sense movement within non-military structures such as buildings, homes, tunnels and mines, as well as sensing the characteristics and any movement within collapsed structures for rescue operations.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Having generally described the invention and applications thereof, a more detailed discussion of some embodiments of the invention are now presented with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the electronics required to excite resonances, receive the reflected waves and analyze the spectrum of the received waves. Acoustic waves are generated by the acoustic generator <b>32</b> that includes, in this embodiment, a sweep trigger <b>50</b>, a frequency sweep generator <b>54</b>, a power amplifier <b>58</b>, and control circuitry <b>62</b>. The acoustic generator <b>32</b> is connected to a loudspeaker <b>66</b> that creates the acoustic waves. Acoustic waves are received at the acoustic receiver <b>40</b> that includes, in this embodiment, a microphone <b>70</b>, a preamplifier, a spectrum analyzer <b>78</b>, motion direction detection components <b>82</b>, structure characteristics estimation components <b>86</b>, and control circuitry <b>90</b>. A user interface <b>94</b> provides a user with control capability and provides an output indicative of the structural layout and any motion detected within the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Having generally described the components of the system, the operational steps for using the system are now described. First, a trigger signal is generated at the sweep trigger <b>50</b> to initiate a frequency sweep at some desired rate by the frequency sweep generator <b>54</b>. The frequency is swept over a preset range needed to excite the resonances in the structure of interest. This range is based on prior knowledge of the sweep range required for similar structures under test (i.e. deep caves versus urban buildings). For example, typical underground structures large enough to contain human occupants will generally have many resonances in the range of about 0 Hz to about 200 Hz. Each of these resonances may be used to provide information about the characteristics of the structure including layout and activity therein. In addition, the sweep may be limited to infrasonic frequencies if there is a need for covert sensing. The frequency sweep electrical signal is then amplified at power amplifier <b>58</b> and used to drive the speaker <b>66</b> or other sound source. Although illustrated as a speaker or other electromechanical device, the sound source may be driven in alternate ways including, for example, pneumatic or electrostatic. In addition, alternate ways to excite a range of frequencies may be employed such as impulses, frequency chirps and other more time-limited sources. Furthermore, if advantageous for a particular application, alternate ways of directing the generated acoustic waves at the structure and focusing the energy can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The reflected waves returning from the structure interior are detected using the microphone <b>70</b> or other transduction device sensitive to the full frequency range of the excitation. The received signal is preamplified at the preamplifier <b>74</b> and sent to the spectrum analyzer <b>78</b> to obtain the response spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Analysis of the response spectrum is performed at the motion and direction detection components and the structure physical properties estimation components and provides information on the facility characteristics including number and lengths of connecting segments and chamber volumes. Personnel movement and other activity is sensed by comparing successive spectra to a baseline spectrum taken at an earlier time. In addition, the direction of motion and number of entities can be sensed from detailed analysis of the spectrum amplitude and phase near the resonance frequencies. The motion and direction detection components and the structure physical properties estimation components may include software and/or hardware components capable of receiving the response spectrum and performing the appropriate analysis, in comparison to the signal generated by the acoustic generator <b>32</b>, to provide output to the user interface <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the control circuitry <b>90</b> and <b>62</b> provide communications between the user interface <b>94</b>, acoustic generator <b>32</b>, and the acoustic receiver <b>40</b>. The user interface <b>94</b> may include user controls to begin sensing operations, and an output, such as a video display, to provide information related to the structure to a user. In one embodiment, the output is displayed as a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional map on a video screen that a user may analyze. The acoustic generator <b>32</b>, acoustic receiver <b>40</b>, and user interface <b>94</b> may be connected using any available technology for communication of information, including both wire connections and wireless connections. For example, the acoustic generator <b>32</b> and acoustic receiver <b>40</b> may be integrated as a single unit and placed at an entrance to or within a structure, and communicate with the user interface <b>94</b> through a radio connection. Furthermore, although illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as components of the acoustic receiver, it will be understood that the spectrum analyzer <b>78</b>, motion and direction detection components <b>82</b>, and structure physical properties estimation components <b>86</b> may be separate from the acoustic receiver <b>40</b>. The acoustic receiver <b>40</b>, in this case, would communicate the raw received acoustic signal to the spectrum analyzer <b>78</b> using one of any number of communication methods. Similarly, the entire system may be included in a handheld system that may be transported by personnel at the entrance to the structure, and while within the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, several embodiments of the system are illustrated with reference to different structures that may be analyzed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cave or tunnel having an associated cavity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an underground bunker, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a building or other above-ground structure. In each case, the control system <b>48</b> is connected to the acoustic generator <b>32</b> and acoustic receiver <b>40</b>. Acoustic signals <b>28</b> enter the structure and excite a resonance signal <b>44</b> within the structure. The acoustic signals may enter the structure through areas of the structure that are relatively transparent, such as openings, windows, and open doors. The resonance signal <b>44</b> is received by the acoustic receiver <b>40</b> and analyzed by the control system <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, the characteristics of a structure and motion therein are provided to a user. The motion and direction components <b>82</b>, and the structure physical properties estimation components <b>86</b> receive the response spectrum and provide an output based on the analysis of the response spectrum. This output, in one embodiment, is based on acoustic models for the response spectrum produced by different types of structures. At low frequencies, well-established acoustic transmission line theory can be used to model the response of a structure's interior chambers and branches. Such transmission line theory is known, and described, for example, in the publication: Allen D. Pierce, Acoustics: An introduction to it's physical principles and applications, Chapter 7: Low frequency models of sound transmission, McGraw Hill, 1981.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as an example, a transmission line model for a tube (or tunnel) <b>100</b> of length d with a closed-end <b>104</b> that is terminated with acoustic load impedance Z<sub>L </sub>is now described. The input impedance Z<sub>i </sub>looking into the tube at X=−d may be modeled according to one or more models of sound transmission that are known. Such a model is described, for example, in the publication: Kinsler, L. E. and Frey, A. R., Fundamentals of acoustics, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, pp. 201, 1962. In one embodiment, the input impedance Z<sub>i </sub>is modeled as:</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Tube resonances occur when the reactive part of the input impedance goes to zero. At this frequency, the power through the tube is a maximum for a constant driving pressure. An example of an impedance graph of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for a 2 meter diameter tunnel in rock ending with a rock wall 32.4 meters from the entrance. The solid curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph of the imaginary part of the input impedance for this structure. Note that there are five resonance peaks below 25 Hz, and the resonance frequencies are a fixed frequency apart (˜5.25 Hz). The reflectance spectrum at the tunnel entrance will peak at these same resonances. The dashed curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates how the resonance pattern changes if the same tunnel has a 5 meter square chamber at the end (125 m<sup>3 </sup>volume). With the chamber added, the resonance peaks shift to lower frequencies, and the peaks are no longer at fixed frequency separations. Thus, analysis of the resonance pattern provides information on the presence and size of the chamber. In one embodiment, the control portion of the system includes information on resonance patterns of known physical structures, and the received spectrum is compared to the known resonance patterns to determine an estimate of the physical properties, such as chamber configuration, size, and volume. This comparison and analysis and estimation is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, resonance spectra for a scale model are illustrated. When operating using acoustic signals and resonant cavities, the model used to analyze the returned spectra scales with frequency. These low frequency models of tunnel resonances have been tested using scale models, with the response spectrum of one such model illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A 20:1 scale model of the above tunnel described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> comprises a 0.10 meter diameter, 1.62 meter long PVC pipe that is capped at one end and driven with a loudspeaker at the opposite end. A small microphone is located directly in front of the speaker. The scaled acoustic model has a similar response at 500 Hz as the 32.4 meter tunnel at 25 Hz. An illustration of the scale model measured spectrum is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The dotted lines in this figure are drawn at the predicted frequencies of the tube of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> times the scaling factor (20). As shown in the figure, the measured resonance frequencies of the scaled physical model <b>150</b> agree well with the predicted resonances of the full-scale tube <b>160</b>. This demonstrates the accuracy and sensitivity of the transmission line models at low frequencies. At higher frequencies, the air absorbs the sound waves more strongly, and these dissipative effects weaken the resonances. The drop off in resonance amplitude at the higher frequencies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is partly due to this absorption. Although the transmission line models generally do not include absorption of the waves at higher frequencies, the models still provide adequate estimates for the resonance frequencies that may be used when analyzing received spectra for a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment of the invention, personnel movement is sensed by comparing changes in the response spectrum over time as personnel move within a structure. To illustrate the analysis, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows the difference in the response spectra for the same PVC tube described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with a model occupant located at several positions along the tube <b>100</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. The model occupant <b>200</b> occupies approximately 10% of the tube cross-sectional area. The curve <b>204</b> shows the response when the model occupant <b>200</b> is located at the end of the tube <b>100</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as position A. Curve <b>208</b> shows the response when the model occupant <b>200</b> is moved to a second position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as position B. Curve <b>212</b> shows the response when the model occupant <b>200</b> is moved to a third position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as position C. Finally, curve <b>216</b> shows the response when the model occupant <b>200</b> is moved to a fourth position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as position D. At location A the presence of the occupant results in minimal difference at all frequencies compared to the spectrum for the tube having no occupant. However, as the model occupant <b>200</b> is moved closer to the entrance end of the tube <b>100</b>, the spectrum is dramatically changed, especially at frequencies near resonance. Inspection of the spectral changes, including amplitude and phase, near resonance peaks may be used to determine both the size and position of the model occupant <b>200</b> relative to the entrance. For instance, the polarity changes between curve <b>212</b> and curve <b>216</b> at 360 Hz as the model occupant <b>200</b> crosses the center of the tube. These spectral details, in an embodiment, are extracted by the above-described motion and direction detection components and structure physical properties estimation components (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and used to determine the direction of movement of personnel within a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another embodiment of the invention provides activity detection of a person moving within a building. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, an illustration of a building <b>300</b>, and occupant <b>304</b> are illustrated, with the occupant <b>304</b> having differing positions within the building <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows measured resonance spectra for this model of an occupant moving within a building. The model of this example is a box with 0.61 meter square, 0.013 meter thick plywood walls. A model occupant and the model box are scaled to represent a person within a two-story building. The model occupant is approximately 1/500th the volume of the box interior. A loudspeaker and microphone are located at the upper right of the front wall panel of the model box, 0.15 meters from the edges. The model occupant is moved along a line on the floor of the box that is 0.46 meter from the front wall with the speaker. The spectra in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> are measured for the model occupant located against the left wall (wall) <b>310</b>, ⅓ of the distance across (middle) the box <b>314</b>, and ⅔ of the distance across the box to the right wall (right) <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As may be observed from the spectra of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the resonance at 35 Hz is a characteristic Helmholtz resonance of the box. The frequency of the resonance is determined by the volume of the box and the effective length of the loudspeaker mounting. The peaks near 100 Hz are caused by resonances of the side panels of the compliant plywood sides. Significant changes in both of these resonance peaks can be seen as the model occupant is moved within the structure. The differences between the spectra for the model occupant <b>304</b> against the wall and at two positions inside the box are also shown in the figure and marked “wall-middle” <b>322</b> and “wall-right” <b>326</b>. These difference plots exhibit similar resonance changes on both sides of the peaks as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The measurements of the model building shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> demonstrate the sensitivity of the system to movement within a structure. The spectral differences caused by movement to a new location are approximately 10% of the amplitude of the spectra in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, even though the model occupant is only 0.2% of the volume of the structure. The high sensitivity is due to the effect of the small occupant on the high-slope sides of the resonance peaks. The slight shifts in frequency caused by the presence of the model occupant result in relatively large spectral differences.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The examples above show how to model simple tubes and chambers with transmission-line acoustic techniques. However, more complicated structures resembling tunnels, caves and buildings more likely to occur in the field are modeled, in one embodiment, by adding side branches to the main structure. If additional tunnels and chambers branch from the main tunnel, these structures result in resonance peaks at additional frequencies that may be distinguished from the original peaks. Thus analysis of the resonance spectrum provides detailed information on the chambers and connecting segments inside a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As an example of a side branch, a separate, closed tunnel can be added to the side of the simple tunnel model already described. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, side branches <b>350</b> to the main tube <b>354</b> in the model of this embodiment add in parallel. In this case, it is convenient to write the transmission line equations for side branches <b>350</b> and the main branch <b>354</b> as admittances (Y=1/Z) rather than impedances. In terms of admittances, Equation 1 becomes:</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An illustration of resonance frequencies for the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for the same main tube length as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (32.4 meters). The side branch <b>350</b> for this example is 2.84 meters in diameter and 23.14 meters long. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the resonances of the tube with a side branch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are indicated by the solid curve <b>370</b>, and the resonances from the tube <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are indicated by the dashed curve <b>374</b> for the purposes of comparison. As may be readily observed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the resonances (zeros of the Y<sub>i </sub>curves <b>370</b>) are no longer uniformly spaced in frequency as for the single tube (indicated by curve <b>374</b>). With the addition of the side branch, the resonance frequencies now occur at unique frequencies characteristic of the length and size of the main tube and side branch. These unique, and non-uniformly spaced resonance frequencies may be modeled and used in determining an estimation of the size and shape of unknown tubes or tunnels.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As demonstrated above, embodiments of the invention may use the resonance spectrum to uniquely determine the connectivity, lengths and diameters of tubes and box-like structures. Additionally, many “inverse” methods are known in the art that can provide values for these parameters of a structure based on measurements of the resonance spectrum. Other embodiments of the invention use such inverse methods. Examples include the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for system ID, linear least-squares parameter estimation, and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear estimation (described in publication: D. Marquardt, “An algorithm for least-squares estimation of nonlinear parameters,” SIAM J. Appl. Math., Vol. 11, pp. 431-441, 1963).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another embodiment of the invention uses a modeling method similar to an inverse-method that uses reflected acoustic waves to estimate the changes in vocal tract (tube) area beyond the human mouth. Such a model is described in the publication: Schroeder, M. R. “Determination of the geometry of the human vocal tract by acoustic measurements,” J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 41(4), pp. 1002-1010, 1967. For this inversion method, the area function for the tract is obtained from measurements of the admittance function at the mouth, once certain constraints are placed on this function. The acoustic measurements are matched to a simplified transfer function for the vocal tract using a least-squares match criterion. The vocal tract-area function is then computed using an iterative procedure. In a similar manner, the present invention computes structural characteristics using acoustic signals.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other changes in the form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
