<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of latch assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Latch assemblies are relied on in many applications for securing items, such as panels, doors, and doorframes together. For example, containers, cabinets, closets, compartments and the like may be secured with a latch. An important use for latches is in the automotive field, where there is a desire and need to access automotive compartments, such as, for example, the trunk or passenger compartments of vehicles, as well as interior compartments such as a glove box. Furthermore, in many applications an electrically operated latch is desirable due to the need for remote or push-button entry, coded access, key-less access, or monitoring of access. Various latches for panel closures have been employed where one of the panels such as a swinging door or the like is to be fastened or secured to a stationary panel, doorframe, or compartment body. Although many latch assemblies are known in the prior art, none are seen to teach or suggest the unique features of the present invention or to achieve the advantages of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a latching system for securing two members together. The present invention includes a housing, a rotary pawl, catch means for releasably holding the pawl in a closed configuration, and means for operating the catch means. The pawl is pivotally attached to the housing and is rotationally movable between a closed or engaged configuration and an open or disengaged configuration. The pawl is provided with a torsion spring member that biases the pawl toward the open or disengaged configuration. The catch means includes a locking member that is movable between an extended position and a retracted position and is spring biased toward the extended position. The locking member can be retracted by the action of the means for operating the catch means, which in the illustrated examples is an electrically powered solenoid. When the pawl strikes a keeper during closing, the pawl is moved to the closed configuration. A lug projecting from the pawl is engaged by the locking member once the pawl is in the closed configuration in order to keep the pawl in the closed configuration. At this time the pawl and a portion of the housing cooperatively capture the keeper to secure the latch to the keeper. Energizing the solenoid retracts the locking member, which allows the pawl to rotate under the force of the torsion spring to the open configuration. Thus, the latch can be disengaged from the keeper and a compartment, for example, can be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further embodiment of the present invention includes a housing, a rotary pawl, catch means for releasably holding the pawl in a closed configuration, and actuation means for operating the catch means. The pawl is pivotally attached to the housing and is rotationally movable between a closed or latched configuration and an open or unlatched configuration. The pawl is provided with a torsion spring member that biases the pawl toward the open or disengaged configuration. The catch means includes a trigger that is pivotally movable between an engaged position and a disengaged position and is spring biased toward the engaged position. The trigger can be moved to the disengaged position by the action of the actuation means, which in the illustrated examples is an electrically powered actuator. When the pawl strikes a striker (also known as a keeper) during closing, the pawl is moved to the closed configuration. A notch in the pawl is engaged by the trigger once the pawl is in the closed configuration in order to keep the pawl in the closed configuration. At this time the striker is captured in a slot in the pawl to thereby secure the latch and the striker together. Energizing the actuator pivotally moves the trigger to the disengaged position, which allows the pawl to rotate under the force of the torsion spring to the open configuration. The striker can then be disengaged from the latch and a compartment, for example, can be opened.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Some embodiments of the latches disclosed herein have some features in common with the latches disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,927,772, issued on Jul. 27, 1999, U.S. Non-provisional Utility patent application Ser. No. 10/001,479, filed on Nov. 1, 2001, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/245,089, filed on Nov. 1, 2000, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/254,605, filed on Dec. 10, 2000, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/273,944, filed on Mar. 7, 2001, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/318,839, filed on Sep. 13, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/312,677, filed on Aug. 15, 2001, all of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-18</figref>, a latch <b>100</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention can be seen. The latch <b>100</b> includes a latch housing <b>102</b>, a pawl <b>104</b>, a locking member <b>106</b>, and means for selectively moving the locking member in and out of engagement with the pawl. In the illustrated embodiment, a solenoid assembly <b>108</b> serves as the means for selectively moving the locking member in and out of engagement with the pawl.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the illustrated example, the latch <b>100</b> is shown being used for securing a member <b>200</b> relative to a keeper <b>208</b>. The latch <b>100</b> is generally applicable wherever one or more closure members need to be secured in a certain position. Further, the member <b>200</b> can be movable or stationary. In addition, the latch <b>100</b> may be mounted in any orientation depending upon the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Preferably, the housing <b>102</b> has a portion that closes off the open end of the pawl slot <b>158</b> when the pawl <b>104</b> is in the closed configuration. Furthermore, the housing must be adapted to allow an unobstructed path to the pawl slot <b>158</b> when the pawl <b>104</b> is in the open configuration. In the first embodiment, the housing <b>102</b> has an upper portion <b>110</b> that is provided with an open U-shaped indentation or recess <b>112</b> as viewed in profile. The lateral side of the U-shaped indentation located farthest from the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> acts to close off the open end of the pawl slot <b>158</b> when the pawl <b>104</b> is in the closed configuration. The open end of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b> allows an unobstructed path to the pawl slot <b>158</b> when the pawl <b>104</b> is in the open configuration. The U-shaped indentation is sized such that the housing <b>102</b> will not interfere with the movement of the keeper <b>208</b> relative to the housing <b>102</b> as the pawl <b>104</b> is moved from the open configuration to the closed configuration by contact with the keeper <b>208</b>. The housing <b>102</b> has a lower portion <b>114</b> that mates with the upper portion <b>110</b> in a clam-shell fashion. A first slot <b>116</b> is provided within the portion of the upper housing portion <b>110</b> that has the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b>. The slot <b>116</b> receives a portion of the pawl <b>104</b> and allows for the pawl <b>104</b> to be rotationally supported by the housing <b>102</b> while portions of the pawl <b>104</b> project into and overlap the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b>, all without interference with the rotational movement of the pawl. The lower housing portion <b>114</b> has a corresponding slot that provides clearance for the pawl <b>104</b> to move rotationally relative to the housing <b>102</b> over its operational range of motion without interference from any part of the lower housing portion <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The U-shaped indentation <b>112</b> is oriented such that the open end of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b> is directed in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shaft or plunger <b>120</b> of the solenoid <b>108</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the shaft or plunger <b>120</b> of the solenoid <b>108</b> essentially lies in the plane of rotation of the pawl <b>104</b>. The plane of rotation of the pawl <b>104</b> is defined as a plane to which the axis of rotation of the pawl <b>104</b> is perpendicular and that passes through the center of the pawl <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The solenoid body <b>122</b> is provided with a threaded portion <b>124</b> that passes into the housing <b>102</b>. A solenoid nut <b>126</b> located inside the housing <b>102</b> engages the threaded portion <b>124</b> to secure the solenoid <b>108</b> to the housing <b>102</b>. Electrical energy is supplied to the solenoid <b>108</b> through the wires <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The latch assembly <b>100</b> also includes a pawl <b>104</b> shown pivotally connected to the latch housing <b>102</b> with suitable attachment means such as the pawl pivot pin <b>138</b> that passes through the hole <b>140</b> in the pawl <b>104</b>. The upper housing portion <b>110</b> and the lower housing portion <b>114</b> are each provided with a pair of semi-cylindrical cavities <b>132</b> that form cylindrical cavities for receiving the ends of the pivot pin <b>138</b> as the upper housing portion <b>110</b> and the lower housing portion <b>114</b> are assembled together in clam-shell fashion. Thus the pawl <b>104</b> is rotationally supported by the housing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The pawl <b>104</b> has a body portion <b>154</b> through which the hole <b>140</b> passes. The pawl <b>104</b> has a lug or projection <b>156</b> and is provided with a pawl slot <b>158</b> to retain the keeper member <b>208</b> when the pawl <b>104</b> is in the latched position. In the illustrated example, the keeper member <b>208</b> has a rod-shaped portion <b>134</b> that engages the pawl slot <b>158</b> as the panel <b>200</b> is moved to the closed position relative to the keeper <b>208</b>. When the panel <b>200</b> is closed, the rod-shaped portion <b>134</b> of the keeper member <b>208</b> will be positioned or caught in the pawl slot <b>158</b> that is closed off by a lateral side of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b>. The pawl <b>104</b> is also provided with an arm portion <b>160</b> extending from the pawl body <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A pawl torsion spring <b>162</b> is installed on the pawl <b>104</b> with the coiled portions <b>164</b> and <b>166</b> surrounding the pivot pin <b>138</b> on either side of the pawl <b>104</b>. The cross bar <b>168</b> of the torsion spring <b>162</b> engages the notch <b>170</b> in the arm portion <b>160</b>. In the illustrated example the notch <b>170</b> is enlarged to more positively retain the cross bar <b>168</b> in position relative to the pawl <b>104</b>. The torsion spring <b>162</b> also has tail portions <b>172</b>,<b>174</b> and arms <b>176</b>,<b>178</b>. The vertical spring arms <b>176</b>,<b>178</b> extend from the respective coiled portions <b>164</b> and <b>166</b> of the torsion spring <b>162</b> and connect to cross bar <b>168</b>. The pawl arm <b>160</b> is positioned intermediate the spring arms <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>. The projection or lug <b>156</b> has a flat surface <b>180</b> that extends roughly in a radial direction relative to the pivot axis of the pawl <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The tails <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> of the torsion spring <b>162</b> fit into and lie along the steps <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>, respectively, formed by a wider portion of the slot <b>117</b> in the area of the pivot pin. With the tails <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> of the torsion spring <b>162</b> positioned along the steps <b>182</b>,<b>184</b>, the cross bar <b>168</b> of the torsion spring <b>162</b> exerts a force on the arm portion <b>160</b> of the pawl <b>104</b> that biases the pawl <b>104</b> toward the open or unlatched configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The solenoid body <b>122</b> receives a portion of the solenoid shaft <b>120</b>. The locking member <b>106</b> is in the form of a plate that is positioned in a slot <b>142</b> in the outer end of the solenoid shaft <b>120</b> and is pinned to the outer end of the solenoid shaft <b>120</b> by the pin <b>144</b>. The locking member <b>106</b> is positioned within the housing <b>102</b> and moves as a unit with the solenoid shaft. A spring <b>188</b> is provided intermediate the locking member <b>106</b> and the solenoid body <b>122</b>. The spring <b>188</b> biases the locking member <b>106</b> and the solenoid shaft <b>120</b> into the extended position. When the locking member <b>106</b> is in the extended position and the pawl <b>104</b> is in the closed or latched position, the locking member <b>106</b> is positioned behind the lug <b>156</b> and prevents the pawl <b>104</b> from rotating to the open or unlatched position.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The latch assembly <b>100</b> is actuated by energizing the solenoid <b>108</b>. The solenoid <b>108</b> may be energized using a remotely located switch (not shown). When the solenoid <b>108</b> is energized, the locking member <b>106</b> is retracted such that the locking member <b>106</b> is moved out of engagement with the projection or lug <b>156</b> thereby freeing up the pawl <b>104</b> for pivoting. The bias provided by the pawl torsion spring <b>162</b> rotates the pawl <b>104</b> from its latched position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> and <b>10</b>, where the rod-shaped portion <b>134</b> of the keeper <b>208</b> is cooperatively captured by the pawl slot <b>158</b> and the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b>, toward its open configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>. The rotation of the pawl <b>104</b> brings the opening of the pawl slot <b>158</b> out from the portion of the slot <b>116</b> formed in the lateral side of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b>, such that the opening of the pawl slot <b>158</b> faces roughly toward the base <b>146</b> of the keeper member <b>208</b>, thus allowing the keeper member <b>208</b> to be disengaged from the pawl <b>104</b>. The panel <b>200</b> can then be opened by moving it to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Suitable mounting means are provided to retain the latch assembly <b>100</b> on a panel or mounting surface. For example, installation of the latch assembly <b>100</b> to a panel may be accomplished with nuts <b>230</b> and bolts <b>232</b> that pass through the housing <b>102</b> and the panel <b>200</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> the latch <b>100</b> is attached to the side of the panel <b>200</b> facing away from the keeper <b>208</b>. In this arrangement the rod-shaped portion <b>134</b> of the keeper <b>208</b> passes through the slot <b>234</b> to engage the latch <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> the latch <b>100</b> is attached to the side of the panel <b>200</b> facing toward the keeper <b>208</b>. In this arrangement the slot <b>234</b> is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the panel <b>200</b> is being closed, the opening of the pawl slot <b>158</b> faces toward the keeper <b>208</b> and is unobstructed by the lateral sides of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b>. As the panel <b>200</b> is slammed shut, the keeper <b>208</b> is received in the slot <b>158</b> and impacts the pawl <b>104</b> causing the rotation of the pawl <b>104</b> toward the closed configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> and <b>10</b>. At this time, even though the solenoid <b>122</b> may not be energized, the locking member <b>106</b> is partially retracted because the lug <b>156</b> and/or the pawl body <b>154</b> prevent movement of the locking member <b>106</b> to the fully extended position. As the pawl <b>104</b> rotates to the closed position, the lug <b>156</b> clears the locking member <b>106</b> allowing the locking member <b>106</b> to extend under the bias of spring <b>188</b> and move behind the lug <b>156</b>. Once the locking member <b>106</b> is in the extended position it catches the flat side <b>180</b> of the projection <b>156</b> to keep the pawl <b>104</b> in the closed position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> and <b>10</b>, thus securing the panel <b>200</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If there is a strong load tending to force the panel <b>200</b> open, high lateral forces may cause the locking member <b>106</b> and the solenoid shaft <b>120</b> to bind due to excessive friction and the bending of the solenoid shaft <b>120</b>, thus preventing the retraction of locking member <b>106</b> by the power available from the solenoid <b>108</b>. To alleviate this means to support the locking member <b>106</b> close to its point of engagement with the pawl <b>104</b> have been provided. In addition, means for reducing the frictional resistance to the retraction of the locking member <b>106</b> have also been provided. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-18</figref>, the rollers <b>236</b> provide both these functions. Each roller <b>236</b> has a large diameter portion <b>238</b> having small diameter portions <b>240</b> projecting from either side thereof. The lower housing portion <b>114</b> has two cavities <b>242</b> each shaped to matingly receive a portion of a respective roller <b>236</b>. The upper housing portion <b>110</b> and is provided with a pair of cavities <b>244</b>. Each cavity is shaped to receive a portion of at least the outer small-diameter roller portion <b>240</b> of a respective one of the rollers <b>236</b>. As the upper housing portion <b>110</b> and the lower housing portion <b>114</b> are assembled together in clam-shell fashion, they cooperatively support the rollers <b>236</b> for rotational movement while leaving at least a portion of the outer surface of the large-diameter roller portions <b>238</b> unobstructed. The rollers <b>236</b> are position directly under the locking member <b>106</b>, and the locking member <b>106</b> bears against the outer surface of the large-diameter roller portions <b>238</b>. Thus the rollers <b>236</b> reduce friction between the locking member <b>106</b> and the housing <b>102</b> by providing for rolling friction therebetween. Also by supporting the locking member <b>106</b> near its load point, they reduce bending moments on the solenoid shaft <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As an alternative to the two rollers <b>236</b>, a solid block made of a low friction material such as Dupont's DELRIN™ (an acetal homopolymer) or an acetal copolymer (e.g. CELCON®)) can be placed under the locking member <b>106</b> in a geometry similar to that illustrated for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-48</figref> to both reduce friction and to support the locking member near its load point.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition to the solenoid <b>108</b>, the latch <b>100</b> may be provided with a handle to manually operate the latch in the event the solenoid fails or there is no power to operate the solenoid. As an alternative or in addition to the handle, a mechanical key-operated lock plug can be incorporated into the design whereby rotation of the lock plug pushes the locking member <b>106</b>, for example using some form of cam arrangement, out of engagement with the lug <b>156</b> to thereby allow the panel <b>200</b> to be opened in the event of an electrical power failure.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-28</figref>, a second embodiment <b>100</b><i>a </i>of a latch assembly according to the present invention having three rollers can be seen. In operation the latch <b>100</b><i>a </i>is similar to the latch <b>100</b>, except for the differences that are noted below. The latch <b>100</b><i>a </i>does not have a clamshell-type housing. Instead, the housing of the latch <b>100</b><i>a </i>is two-piece version of the housing of the latch disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/318,639, and the operation is virtually identical to that latch. In the latch <b>100</b><i>a</i>, the locking member or locking plate <b>106</b> is replaced with a U-shaped bracket <b>106</b><i>a </i>provided at the outer end of the solenoid shaft <b>120</b><i>a</i>. The bracket <b>106</b><i>a </i>rotationally supports three rollers <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>and <b>236</b><i>c</i>. Rollers <b>236</b><i>a </i>and <b>236</b><i>c </i>are large diameter rollers and roller <b>236</b><i>b </i>is a small diameter roller. Roller <b>236</b><i>b </i>is positioned between rollers <b>236</b><i>a </i>and <b>236</b><i>c </i>on a cylindrical shaft <b>236</b><i>d </i>that is supported by the bracket <b>106</b><i>a</i>. The rollers <b>236</b><i>a </i>and <b>236</b><i>c </i>are spaced far enough apart such that the flat surface <b>180</b><i>a </i>of the lug <b>156</b><i>a </i>of pawl <b>104</b><i>a </i>can bear against the outer surface of the roller <b>236</b><i>b</i>, in the closed configuration. The rollers <b>236</b><i>a </i>and <b>236</b><i>c </i>bear against the portion of the housing below the bracket <b>106</b><i>a</i>. The pawl <b>104</b><i>a </i>is released from the latched configuration when the solenoid is energized to withdraw the bracket <b>106</b><i>a </i>and consequently the roller <b>236</b><i>b </i>out of engagement with the lug <b>156</b><i>a </i>of the pawl <b>104</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the rollers <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b</i>, <b>236</b><i>c </i>reduce friction between the locking member <b>106</b> and the housing <b>102</b> and between the locking member and the pawl, by providing for rolling friction between the locking member and both the housing and the pawl. Also by supporting the bracket <b>106</b><i>a </i>and shaft <b>236</b><i>d </i>near their load point, they reduce bending moments on the solenoid shaft <b>120</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-48</figref> a third embodiment <b>100</b><i>b </i>of a latch assembly according to the present invention can be seen. In operation the latch <b>100</b><i>b </i>is similar to the latch <b>100</b>, except for the differences that are noted below. The latch <b>100</b><i>b </i>has a solid support <b>241</b> for the locking member <b>106</b><i>b </i>to bear against at all times within the locking member's range of motion between retracted and extended positions. The solid support <b>241</b> is positioned on the side of the locking member <b>106</b><i>b </i>that is opposite the side that is in contact with the surface <b>180</b><i>b </i>of the pawl <b>104</b><i>b </i>in the closed configuration. Thus, the solid support <b>241</b> supports the locking member <b>106</b><i>b </i>near its load point and it thus reduces bending moments on the solenoid shaft <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the solenoid <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The solid support <b>241</b> may be integral with the housing <b>102</b><i>b </i>or it may be a separate piece that is attached to the housing <b>102</b><i>b</i>. The solid support <b>241</b> can be made from the same low friction materials mentioned previously herein.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, the geometry of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-48</figref>, is different from the previous embodiments. In latch <b>100</b><i>b </i>the pawl has a pawl slot <b>158</b><i>b </i>and a lug <b>156</b><i>b </i>that defines a flat surface <b>180</b><i>b </i>for engagement with the locking member <b>106</b><i>b</i>. The pawl slot <b>156</b><i>b </i>has an imaginary centerline <b>250</b> that extends to intersect an imaginary plane <b>252</b> defined by the flat surface <b>180</b><i>b </i>of the lug <b>156</b><i>b </i>at an angle θ that is less than 180 degrees. Preferably, the angle θ is less than or equal to 120 degrees and more preferably the angle θ is less than or equal to 90 degrees. This pawl geometry allows the orientation of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>102</b><i>b </i>to be changed such that the open end of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b><i>b </i>is directed in a direction that is substantially less than 90 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the shaft or plunger <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the solenoid <b>108</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-48</figref>, the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b><i>b </i>is oriented such that the open end of the U-shaped indentation <b>112</b><i>b </i>is directed in a direction that is substantially the same as the longitudinal axis of the shaft or plunger <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the solenoid <b>108</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As yet another alternative embodiment or in combination with some of the features disclosed above, it is also possible to provide a roller rotatably supported by the lug <b>156</b> for contact with the locking member <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-105</figref>, a latch <b>400</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention can be seen. The latch <b>400</b> includes a latch housing <b>402</b>, a pawl <b>404</b>, a trigger <b>406</b>, and actuation means for selectively moving the trigger out of engagement with the pawl. In the illustrated embodiment, an electrically operated actuator assembly <b>408</b> serves as the actuation means for selectively moving the trigger out of engagement with the pawl.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The latch <b>400</b> is generally applicable wherever one or more closure members need to be secured in a certain position. The latch <b>400</b> can be used together with the striker <b>508</b> to secure any two closure members together. In the illustrated example, the latch <b>400</b> is shown being used for securing a panel <b>500</b> relative to a compartment <b>509</b>. Further, the latch <b>500</b> can be mounted to either the movable member or the stationary member. In addition, the latch <b>400</b> may be mounted in any orientation depending upon the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferably, the housing <b>402</b> is in the form of a box that receives the various components of latch <b>400</b>. The latch <b>400</b> may also be provided with spacers <b>411</b> and <b>413</b>, and the multi-compartment tray <b>415</b> that help to properly support and position the various components of the latch within the housing <b>402</b>, as well as adding greater overall strength to the latch <b>400</b>. The tray <b>415</b> has a channel <b>417</b> that guides the linear movement of the slide <b>418</b> and a compartment <b>419</b> that houses the motor <b>410</b>. A portion of the screw <b>416</b> is positioned in channel <b>417</b> and another portion is positioned in compartment <b>419</b>. The partition <b>421</b> separating the channel <b>417</b> from compartment <b>419</b> has a slot <b>423</b> through which a portion <b>425</b> of the screw <b>416</b> extends. The screw <b>416</b> includes annular collars <b>511</b> and <b>513</b> on either side of the portion <b>425</b>. The collars <b>511</b> and <b>513</b> cooperate with the partition <b>421</b> to essentially prevent linear axial displacement of the screw <b>416</b> in the direction of its longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The housing <b>402</b> has a cover plate <b>401</b> that allows the housing <b>402</b> to be opened for the installation of the various components of the latch <b>400</b>. Furthermore, the housing must be adapted to allow an unobstructed path to the pawl slot <b>458</b> when the pawl <b>404</b> is in the open configuration. The housing <b>402</b> has an opening that allows at least a portion of the striker <b>508</b> to enter the housing <b>402</b> for engagement by the pawl <b>404</b>. In the illustrated example, the opening is in the form of a slot <b>412</b> that passes through the cover plate <b>401</b>, the bottom <b>403</b> of the housing, and one of the walls <b>405</b> of the housing that extends between the cover plate <b>401</b> and the bottom <b>403</b>. The slot <b>412</b> forms an open, approximately U-shaped indentation or recess in the housing <b>402</b> as viewed in profile. The slot <b>412</b> allows at least a portion of the striker <b>508</b> to enter the housing <b>402</b> for engagement by the pawl <b>404</b>. The slot <b>412</b> allows an unobstructed path to the pawl slot <b>458</b> when the pawl <b>404</b> is in the open configuration. The slot <b>412</b> is sized such that the housing <b>402</b> will not interfere with the movement of the striker <b>508</b> relative to the housing <b>402</b> as the pawl <b>404</b> is moved from the open configuration to the closed configuration by contact with the striker <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The electrically operated actuator assembly <b>408</b> includes a motor <b>410</b>, a bow-tie coupler <b>414</b>, a screw <b>416</b>, and a slide <b>418</b>. In the illustrated embodiment the motor <b>410</b> is a direct current (DC) motor that has an output shaft <b>420</b> that normally rotates in response to the motor being energized. Reversing the polarity of the current supplied to the DC motor <b>410</b> causes the direction of rotation of the output shaft <b>420</b> to be reversed. The motor <b>410</b> is received in the housing <b>402</b> and is installed at a fixed location therein. The bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> is attached to the output shaft <b>420</b> such that the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> rotates with the shaft <b>420</b> as a unit during normal operation of the latch <b>400</b>. The bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> is located near the end of the output shaft <b>420</b>. The screw <b>416</b> has a threaded portion <b>424</b> and a coupling portion <b>422</b>. The coupling portion <b>422</b> forms the end of the screw <b>416</b> that is closest to the motor <b>410</b>. The coupling portion <b>422</b> includes a pair of finger-like projections <b>426</b> that are offset from the central longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b> and extend in parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b> toward the motor <b>410</b>. The bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> has a hub <b>429</b>. In the assembled latch <b>400</b>, the hub <b>429</b> of the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> fits between the projections <b>426</b> with the hub's axis of rotation being coaxial with the central longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b>. The bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> also has wings <b>427</b> that extend radially outward from the hub <b>429</b>. The wings <b>427</b> are positioned between the projections <b>426</b> in terms of their angular position about the axis of rotation of the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> and the central longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b>, which are coincident. Thus, rotation of the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> brings the wings <b>427</b> into engagement with the projections <b>426</b> to thereby cause the rotation of the screw <b>416</b> about its longitudinal axis. Because the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> rotates with the shaft <b>420</b> as a unit, the rotation of the shaft <b>420</b> being transmitted to the screw <b>416</b> via the engagement between the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b> and the coupling portion <b>422</b> of the screw <b>416</b>. Thus, rotation of the shaft <b>420</b> causes rotation of the screw <b>416</b> in the same direction as the shaft <b>420</b>. The longitudinal axis of the motor <b>410</b>, the axis of rotation of the shaft <b>420</b>, the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>420</b>, the axis of rotation of the bow-tie coupler <b>414</b>, the axis of rotation of the screw <b>416</b>, and the central longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b> are all coincident in the illustrative embodiment represented by the latch <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b> is in the form of a threaded shaft extending from the coupling portion <b>422</b> in a direction away from the motor <b>410</b>. The threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b> is provided with male, triple-lead, helical thread of relatively large lead. The slide <b>418</b> has a bore <b>431</b> extending at least part way through its length in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b>. In the illustrated example, the bore <b>431</b> passes completely through the slide <b>418</b>. The bore <b>431</b> is provided with female, triple-lead, helical thread of relatively large lead that matches the thread of the threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b>. The slide <b>418</b> is installed in the housing <b>402</b> with the bore <b>431</b> coaxial with the screw <b>416</b>. In the assembled latch <b>400</b> the threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b> extends at least in part into the bore <b>431</b> of the slide <b>418</b> with the thread of the screw <b>416</b> in engagement with the thread of the bore <b>431</b> at all times. Thus, rotation of the screw <b>416</b> causes linear displacement of the slide <b>418</b> in a direction parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b>. Helical thread of large lead is preferred so that the desired linear displacement of the slide <b>418</b> can be obtained with only a few rotations or a fraction of a rotation of the screw <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The slide <b>418</b> is linearly movable between retracted and extended positions in response to the rotation of the screw <b>416</b>. In the retracted position the slide <b>418</b> is closest to the coupling portion of the screw <b>416</b> and in the extended portion the slide <b>418</b> is farthest from the coupling portion of the screw <b>416</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the threaded portion of the screw <b>416</b> does not extend completely through the bore <b>431</b>, although it is possible that in other operable embodiments of the invention the screw <b>416</b> could extend completely through the bore <b>431</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b> extends into the bore <b>431</b> to a first extent when the slide <b>418</b> is in the retracted position, and the threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b> extends into the bore <b>431</b> to a second extent when the slide <b>418</b> is in the extended position. The extent to which the threaded portion <b>424</b> of the screw <b>416</b> extends into the bore <b>431</b> is greater when the slide <b>418</b> is in the retracted position as compared to when the slide is in the extended position. In other words, the first extent is greater than the second extent. The difference between the first extent and the second extent is equal to the linear displacement of the slide <b>418</b>. Electrical energy is supplied to the motor <b>410</b> through the wires <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The latch assembly <b>400</b> also includes a pawl <b>404</b> shown pivotally connected to the latch housing <b>402</b> with suitable attachment means such as the pawl pivot pin <b>438</b> that passes through the hole <b>440</b> in the pawl <b>404</b>. The cover plate <b>401</b> and the bottom <b>403</b> of the housing <b>402</b> are each provided with a hole <b>432</b> and <b>433</b> for receiving the ends of the pivot pin <b>438</b> as the cover plate <b>401</b> and the open-box-like portion of the housing <b>402</b> are assembled together. Thus, the pawl <b>404</b> is rotationally supported by the housing <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The pawl <b>404</b> has a surface <b>454</b> near a corner of the pawl <b>404</b> provided for engagement by the trigger <b>406</b>. This trigger engaging surface <b>454</b> is part of a notch <b>456</b> located at the same corner of the pawl <b>404</b>. The pawl <b>404</b> is provided with a pawl slot <b>458</b> to retain the striker <b>508</b> when the pawl <b>404</b> is in the latched position. In the illustrated example, the striker <b>508</b> has a rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> that engages the pawl slot <b>458</b> as the panel <b>500</b> is moved to the closed position relative to the compartment <b>509</b>. When the panel <b>500</b> is closed, the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b> will be positioned or caught in the pawl slot <b>458</b> with the pawl <b>404</b> in the latched position. The pawl <b>404</b> is also provided with a second notch <b>460</b> the function of which is explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A pawl torsion spring <b>462</b> is installed in the housing <b>402</b> with the coiled portion <b>464</b> of the torsion spring <b>462</b> surrounding the pivot pin <b>438</b>. An arm <b>468</b> of the torsion spring <b>462</b> engages the notch <b>460</b> in the pawl <b>404</b>. The torsion spring <b>462</b> also has a second arm <b>472</b> that engages a wall <b>466</b> of the housing <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">With the arm <b>472</b> of the torsion spring <b>462</b> in engagement with the wall <b>466</b> of the housing <b>402</b>, the arm <b>468</b> of the torsion spring <b>462</b> exerts a force on the pawl <b>404</b> that biases the pawl <b>404</b> toward the open or unlatched position.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The trigger <b>406</b> is in the form of an L-shaped member that is pivotally supported in the housing <b>402</b>. The pivot axis of the trigger <b>406</b>, as defined by the trigger pivot pin <b>470</b>, is parallel to the pivot axis or axis of rotation of the pawl <b>404</b>. Furthermore, the pivot axis of the trigger <b>406</b>, as defined by the trigger pivot pin <b>470</b>, is spaced apart from the pivot axis or axis of rotation of the pawl <b>404</b>. The trigger <b>406</b> is pivotally movable between an engaged position and a disengaged position and is spring biased toward the engaged position. A trigger spring <b>488</b> is provided for biasing the trigger <b>406</b> toward the engaged position. The trigger spring <b>488</b> is a torsion spring and has a coiled portion <b>474</b>, a first arm <b>476</b>, and a second arm <b>478</b>. The trigger spring <b>488</b> is installed in the housing <b>402</b> with the coiled portion <b>474</b> of the torsion spring <b>488</b> surrounding the trigger pivot pin <b>470</b>. The arm <b>476</b> of the torsion spring <b>488</b> engages the slot <b>482</b> in the trigger <b>406</b>. The second arm <b>478</b> of the torsion spring <b>488</b> engages the wall <b>405</b> of the housing <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The trigger <b>406</b> has a first lever arm <b>484</b> and a second lever arm <b>486</b> joined together at approximately a right angle to form an “L” shape. In the illustrated embodiment, the second lever arm <b>486</b> is longer than the first lever arm <b>484</b>. The trigger pivot pin <b>470</b> passes through a hole in the trigger <b>406</b> near the joint between the second lever arm <b>486</b> and the first lever arm <b>484</b>. The second lever arm <b>486</b> is positioned intermediate the slide <b>418</b> and the pawl <b>404</b>. The first lever arm <b>484</b> has a distal end <b>490</b> located distally from the pivot axis of the trigger <b>406</b> and/or from the second lever arm <b>486</b>. The distal end <b>490</b> of the first lever arm <b>484</b> engages the surface <b>454</b> to hold the pawl <b>404</b> in the latched position when the trigger <b>406</b> is in the engaged position. As the slide <b>418</b> moves from the retracted to the extended position, the slide <b>418</b> engages the second lever arm <b>486</b> and causes the trigger <b>406</b> to pivotally move to the disengaged position where the trigger <b>406</b> no longer engages the pawl <b>404</b>. When the trigger <b>406</b> is in the disengaged position, the distal end <b>490</b> of the first lever arm <b>484</b> is disengaged from the surface <b>454</b> and the pawl <b>404</b> is free to rotate under spring bias to the unlatched position. The rod-shaped portion of the striker <b>508</b> can now be withdrawn from the pawl slot <b>458</b> and the panel <b>500</b> can be moved to the open position. As the trigger <b>406</b> is pivotally moved to the disengaged position, the end of the second lever arm <b>486</b> distal from the first lever arm <b>484</b> is moved toward the pawl <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The trigger spring <b>488</b> biases the trigger <b>406</b> toward the engaged position, such that when the slide is moved to the retracted position, the trigger <b>406</b> will tend to reengage the pawl <b>404</b> if the pawl <b>404</b> is rotated to the latched position. If the panel <b>500</b> is again moved to the closed position relative to the compartment <b>509</b>, the rod-shaped portion of the striker <b>508</b> will impact the pawl slot <b>458</b> and cause the rotation of IS the pawl <b>404</b> to the latched position. Once the pawl <b>404</b> is in the latched position, the pawl can again be engaged by the trigger <b>406</b> to thereby retain the pawl in the latched position and secure the panel <b>500</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The latch assembly <b>400</b> is actuated by energizing the motor <b>410</b>. The motor <b>410</b> may be energized using a remotely located switch (not shown). The slide <b>418</b> is normally in the retracted position when the panel <b>500</b> is secured in the closed position. When the motor <b>410</b> is energized, the screw <b>416</b> is rotated counter clockwise causing the slide <b>418</b> to be linearly displaced to the extended position. As the slide <b>418</b> moves to the extended position, the slide impacts the second lever arm <b>486</b> of the trigger <b>406</b> and causes the trigger <b>406</b> to move to the disengaged position thereby freeing up the pawl <b>404</b> for pivoting. The bias provided by the pawl torsion spring <b>462</b> rotates the pawl <b>404</b> from its latched position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, where the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b> is captured by the pawl slot <b>458</b>, toward its unlatched position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>. The rotation of the pawl <b>404</b> moves the opening of the pawl slot <b>458</b> such that the opening of the pawl slot <b>458</b> substantially registers with the slot <b>412</b> of the housing <b>402</b>, thus allowing the striker <b>508</b> to be disengaged from the pawl <b>404</b>. The panel <b>500</b> can then be opened by moving it to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The latch assembly <b>400</b> can be mounted on a panel or mounting surface, such as the frame surrounding the opening of the compartment <b>509</b>, using a variety of well-known fasteners. For example, installation of the latch assembly <b>400</b> to a supporting surface may be accomplished with screws that pass through holes in the bottom of the housing <b>402</b> and engage threaded holes in the supporting surface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-50</figref> the latch <b>400</b> is attached to the frame surrounding the opening of the compartment <b>509</b>. In this arrangement the striker <b>508</b> is mounted to the panel <b>500</b> such that, as the panel <b>500</b> is closed over the opening of the compartment <b>509</b>, the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b> passes through the slot <b>412</b> to engage the pawl slot <b>458</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Before the panel <b>500</b> can be secured in the closed position once again, the slide <b>418</b> must be returned to its retracted position so that the trigger <b>406</b> will be free to reengage the pawl <b>404</b> and retain the pawl <b>404</b> in the latched position when the pawl is driven to the latched position by the impact of the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b>. To accomplish the resetting of the slide <b>418</b> to the retracted position, an electronic control circuit (not shown) must be provided that controls the current supplied to the motor <b>410</b> in response to the remotely located switch being pressed. The control circuit would be programmed to supply electrical current to the motor <b>410</b> with a first polarity for a first predetermined duration and then with a second polarity that is the reverse of the first polarity for a second predetermined duration. The first polarity would be selected to rotate the screw <b>416</b> in the counter clockwise direction to thereby move the slide <b>418</b> from the retracted to the extended position, and the second polarity would be selected to rotate the screw <b>416</b> in the clockwise direction to move the slide <b>418</b> from the extended to the retracted position and thus reset the slide <b>418</b>. When the panel <b>500</b> is being closed, the opening of the pawl slot <b>458</b> substantially registers with the slot <b>412</b> and is essentially unobstructed by the sides of the housing <b>402</b> such that the pawl slot <b>458</b> can receive the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b> via the slot <b>412</b>. As the panel <b>500</b> is slammed shut, the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b> is received in the slot <b>458</b> and impacts the pawl <b>404</b> causing the rotation of the pawl <b>404</b> toward the latched position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56</figref>, <b>61</b>, and <b>100</b>. As the pawl <b>404</b> rotates to the latched position, the distal end <b>490</b> of the first lever arm <b>484</b> of the trigger <b>406</b> will move to the engaged position and reengage the surface <b>454</b> of the notch <b>456</b> to keep the pawl <b>404</b> in the latched position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56</figref>, <b>61</b>, and <b>100</b>, thus securing the panel <b>500</b> in the closed position. The notch <b>456</b> keeps the trigger <b>406</b> from over rotating and overshooting the surface <b>454</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The slot <b>412</b> is oriented such that the open end of the U-shaped profile of the slot <b>412</b> is directed (i.e. faces) in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the output shaft <b>420</b> of the motor <b>410</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the output shaft <b>420</b> of the motor <b>410</b> essentially lies in the plane of rotation of the pawl <b>404</b>. The plane of rotation of the pawl <b>404</b> is defined as a plane to which the axis of rotation of the pawl <b>404</b> is perpendicular and which passes through the center of the pawl <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">If there is a strong load tending to force the panel <b>500</b> open, a high torque will be applied to the pawl <b>404</b>. This in turn causes large forces, both normal to the surface <b>454</b> and frictional, to be exerted between the surface <b>454</b> and the-distal end <b>490</b> of the first lever arm <b>484</b> of the trigger <b>406</b>. However, because of the mechanical advantage provided by the second lever arm <b>486</b> of the trigger <b>406</b>, the size of the motor <b>410</b> and the energy consumption of the motor <b>410</b> can be kept within reasonable limits even as the latch <b>400</b> remains operable under a significant applied load.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As an alternative to reversing the polarity of the electrical current supplied to the motor <b>410</b>, the latch <b>400</b> can be provided with a mechanical means for resetting the slide <b>418</b>. One such mechanical means for resetting the slide can be seen in the illustrated embodiment and includes a kicker lever <b>492</b> that is pivotally connected to the slide <b>418</b>. The Kicker lever <b>492</b> is provided with a pivot shaft <b>494</b> that passes through a hole in the Kicker lever <b>492</b> proximate the end of the Kicker lever <b>492</b> closest to the slide <b>418</b> (also referred to herein as the proximal end of the kicker lever). The pivot shaft <b>494</b> is rotationally supported in the bearings <b>496</b> that are provided as part of the slide <b>418</b>. The material surrounding and defining the bearings <b>496</b> is resilient and is transected by a radial gap <b>499</b> such that the pivot shaft <b>494</b> can be snapped into the bearings <b>496</b>. At about the time the trigger <b>406</b> is disengaged from the pawl <b>404</b>, i.e. within the period beginning shortly before disengagement of the trigger and ending shortly thereafter, the slide <b>418</b> will be at or near its extended position and the pawl <b>404</b> will be at or near its latched position. Also, at some point during this time period, the end of the Kicker lever <b>492</b> farthest from the slide <b>418</b> (also referred to herein as the distal end of the kicker lever) contacts a cam surface <b>498</b> provided on the pawl <b>404</b>. As the pawl <b>404</b> rotates toward its unlatched position, the pawl <b>404</b> pushes on the kicker lo lever <b>492</b> and thereby drives the slide <b>418</b> back to its retracted position. As the pawl <b>404</b> rotates toward its unlatched position, the distance between the point at which the kicker lever <b>492</b> contacts the cam surface <b>498</b> and the rotational axis of the pawl <b>404</b>, as measured along a line directed along the longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b>, increases. Because the rotational axis of the pawl <b>404</b> is fixed in location relative to the housing <b>402</b>, the kicker lever <b>492</b> and the slide <b>418</b> are moved back toward the retracted position of the slide <b>418</b>. Thus the driving of the slide <b>418</b> back to its retracted position is effected as the pawl <b>404</b> rotates toward its unlatched position.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The mechanical means for resetting the slide <b>418</b> greatly simplifies the design of the electronic circuits controlling the latch <b>400</b>. With such a mechanical resetting <b>20</b> means, the electronic control circuit is only required to supply electrical current to the motor <b>410</b> with a first polarity for a first predetermined duration to effect unlatching of the latch <b>400</b>. Again, the first polarity would be selected to rotate the screw <b>416</b> in the counter clockwise direction to thereby move the slide <b>418</b> from the retracted to the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the illustrated embodiment, the trigger <b>406</b> is made up of two L-shaped halves <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> that are superimposed and brought into contact with one another to form the trigger <b>406</b>. Each arm <b>514</b>, <b>516</b> of the L-shaped halves <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> that forms part of the second lever arm <b>486</b> of the trigger <b>406</b> has a bowed-out portion that is bowed outward away from the central plane of the trigger <b>406</b> defined by the interface between the two L-shaped halves <b>510</b> and <b>512</b>. The bowed-out portions form an opening <b>518</b> in the second lever arm <b>486</b> of the trigger <b>406</b> through which the kicker lever <b>492</b> is positioned. The opening <b>518</b> allows the kicker lever <b>492</b> to pass through the second lever arm <b>486</b> of the trigger <b>406</b> and contact the cam surface <b>498</b> of the pawl <b>404</b>. Each arm <b>514</b>, <b>516</b> of the L-shaped halves <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> also has a slot <b>520</b>, <b>522</b> that define the slot <b>482</b> of the second lever arm <b>486</b> that is engaged by the trigger spring <b>488</b>. Furthermore, each bowed-out portion of the arms <b>514</b>, <b>516</b> has a projection <b>524</b>, <b>526</b>, respectively. The projections <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> contact each other when they are assembled to form the trigger <b>406</b>. The portion of the trigger spring <b>488</b> that passes through the slots <b>520</b>, <b>522</b> and the projections <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> limit the range of angular positions that the kicker lever <b>492</b> can assume relative to the slide <b>418</b>. Accordingly, the portion of the trigger spring <b>488</b> that passes through the slots <b>520</b>, <b>522</b> and the projections <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> guide the kicker lever <b>492</b> to ensure that the kicker lever <b>492</b> is always properly positioned relative to the slide <b>418</b> and the pawl <b>404</b> to provide for the resetting of the slide <b>418</b> back to its retracted position as the pawl <b>404</b> rotates to its unlatched position.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The end of the second lever arm <b>486</b> distal from the first lever arm <b>484</b> is provided with a groove <b>528</b> that engages a linkage rod <b>530</b>. The linkage rod <b>530</b> passes to the exterior of the housing <b>402</b> and extends in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw <b>416</b> away from the motor <b>410</b> and the slide <b>418</b>. Pulling the linkage rod <b>530</b> outward from the housing <b>402</b> moves the trigger <b>406</b> to the disengaged position to thereby release the pawl <b>404</b> from the latched position and effect the unlatching of the latch <b>400</b>. The linkage rod <b>530</b> can be connected by cable to a remotely located pulley. It can be arranged for the rotation of the pulley to be controlled by a cylinder lock. This provides a secure mechanical override that allows the operation of the latch <b>400</b> in the event of motor or electrical power failure.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The latch <b>400</b> may also include a micro switch <b>532</b> and a micro switch holder <b>534</b>. The micro switch holder <b>534</b> holds and positions the micro switch <b>532</b> in registry with the slot <b>412</b> where the micro switch can be engaged by the striker <b>508</b> when the striker <b>508</b> is captured by the pawl <b>404</b>. The striker <b>508</b> pushes on the micro switch lever <b>536</b> to close the micro switch when the striker <b>508</b> rotates the pawl <b>404</b> to the latched position thus generating a signal that the latch <b>400</b> is closed. This signal can be conducted to the outside of the housing <b>402</b> by wires <b>538</b> and can be used to control the current supply to the motor <b>410</b>, generate alarms, and/or to monitor activity such as access to the compartment secured by the latch <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 106-108</figref> show another embodiment <b>300</b> of the latch of the invention that is designed to take advantage of an off-the-shelf linear actuator <b>308</b>. In the latch <b>300</b> the rotary pawl mechanism of the present invention is used with the alternative type of linear actuator <b>308</b>. The main difference between the latch <b>300</b> and the latch <b>400</b> is that the most of the linear actuator <b>308</b> is external to the latch housing <b>302</b>. In this way, different off-the-shelf linear actuators can be used without requiring modifications to the latch <b>300</b>. The modular design of the latch <b>300</b> also accommodates design changes that the manufacturers of the off-the-shelf linear actuators may make in their designs over time without requiring modifications to the latch <b>300</b>. The housing <b>302</b> is in two halves <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> that come together in clamshell fashion. A portion of the bearing surfaces for the pivot shafts of the trigger and pawl are made in the half housing <b>301</b>, while the remaining portion of the bearing surfaces for the pivot shafts of the trigger and pawl are made in the half housing <b>303</b>. The linear actuator <b>308</b> has a plunger opening in its housing through which the plunger <b>318</b> that pushes on the trigger <b>306</b> extends outward. A flanged collar <b>305</b> surrounds the plunger opening. The two housing halves <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> come together around the collar <b>305</b> surrounding the plunger opening of the linear actuator <b>308</b>. The housing half <b>301</b> has a slot <b>309</b> that registers with the collar <b>305</b> behind its flange <b>313</b>. A C-shaped clip <b>315</b> is placed through the slot <b>309</b> and partially encircles the collar <b>305</b> behind its flange <b>313</b>. This prevents the linear actuator <b>308</b> from being pulled apart from the housing <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The housing <b>302</b> is placed between a U-bracket <b>317</b> and a support plate <b>319</b> and bolts <b>321</b> are driven through the U-bracket <b>317</b> and the housing halves <b>301</b> and <b>303</b>, and are then secured to threaded openings in the support plate <b>319</b>. The housing halves <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> are secured together. The support plate <b>319</b> has mounting holes <b>323</b> for mounting the latch <b>300</b> to a closure member. The support plate <b>319</b> has a slot <b>312</b> for allowing the striker <b>508</b> to enter the housing <b>302</b> and engage the pawl <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The plunger <b>318</b> of the linear actuator <b>308</b> is used to move the trigger <b>306</b> to the disengaged position in the same way that the slide <b>418</b> moves the trigger <b>406</b>. In the latched configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref>, the pawl <b>304</b> is in the latched configuration and captures the rod-like portion <b>434</b> of the striker <b>508</b>. The trigger <b>306</b> is in the engaged position and keeps the pawl <b>304</b> in the latched position. Energizing the linear actuator <b>308</b> moves the plunger <b>318</b> to the extended position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, which causes the trigger <b>306</b> to be moved to the disengaged position, also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 107</figref>. Once the trigger <b>306</b> is moved to the disengaged position, the pawl <b>304</b> is released and rotates under spring bias to the unlatched position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 107</figref>. The striker <b>508</b> is now released and any closure secured by the latch <b>300</b> can then be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The linear actuator <b>308</b> is an off-the-shelf item and therefore its internal details are not illustrated here. The linear actuator <b>308</b> uses a rotating screw to linearly displace the plunger <b>318</b>. One difference here is that the longitudinal axis of the motor of the linear actuator <b>308</b> is not inline with the longitudinal axis of the screw of the linear actuator <b>308</b> but is offset from it. This is due to the fact that in the linear actuator <b>308</b> rotation of the output shaft of the motor is imparted to the screw via a pair of meshing gears, one gear being fixed to the output shaft of the motor and one gear being fixed to the end of the screw nearest the motor. Therefore, the motor of the linear actuator <b>308</b> necessarily lies to one side of the screw of the linear actuator <b>308</b>. This causes the off-the-shelf linear actuators such as the linear actuator <b>308</b> to be relatively bulky and not suitable for all applications. Otherwise the latches <b>400</b> and <b>300</b> are essentially identical.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 109 to 139</figref>, yet another embodiment <b>400</b><i>a </i>of a latch made in accordance with the present invention can be seen. The latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>is essentially similar to the latch <b>400</b> except for the differences that are discussed below. In the interest of brevity, those features of the latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>that remain the same as the latch <b>400</b> are not described again as such a description would be merely duplication of material that has already been presented with respect to the latch <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As with the latch <b>400</b>, the latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>has a motor <b>410</b>, a bow-tie coupler <b>414</b>, a screw <b>416</b>, and a slide <b>418</b><i>a</i>. The slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>differs from the slide <b>418</b> in that it is not intended to be used with a kicker lever <b>492</b> and accordingly is not ordinarily provided with the bearings <b>496</b>. The kicker lever <b>492</b> is replaced in the latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>by the compression spring <b>493</b>. The compression spring <b>493</b> is provided between the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>and the trigger <b>406</b><i>a</i>. The slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a cross-shaped projection <b>497</b> that acts as a spring retainer and guide with respect to the spring <b>493</b>. At the end of each arm of the cross-shaped projection <b>497</b> is an over-hanging catch surface <b>548</b> that engages a coil near the end of the spring <b>493</b> that is in contact with the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>in order to ensure that the spring <b>493</b> is properly positioned intermediate the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>and the trigger <b>406</b><i>a</i>. The trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>is of one-piece construction and lacks the opening <b>518</b> for the kicker lever <b>492</b>, which is no longer necessary. The spring <b>493</b> is not strong enough to overcome the trigger spring <b>488</b> and actuate the trigger <b>406</b><i>a</i>, even when it is most compressed by virtue of the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>being in its fully extended position. Accordingly, the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>will not be actuated until the projection <b>495</b> of the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>impacts the longer arm <b>486</b><i>a </i>of the trigger <b>406</b><i>a</i>. However, once the motor is no longer energized, the spring <b>493</b> drives the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>back to its retracted position. Alternatively, the compression spring <b>493</b> can be provided between the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>and a portion of the housing <b>402</b><i>a</i>, a portion of the insert <b>415</b><i>a</i>, or some other structure that is fixed in position relative to the housing <b>402</b><i>a</i>. It is also possible to use a torsion spring in place of the compression spring <b>493</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the latch <b>400</b><i>a</i>, the micro switch <b>532</b><i>a </i>is repositioned as compared to the micro switch <b>532</b> in the latch <b>400</b> such that the micro switch <b>532</b><i>a </i>is actuated in response to the position of the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>rather than in response to the position of the striker <b>508</b><i>a</i>. The latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>has a micro switch actuator <b>540</b> that is mounted on the same pivot axis as the pawl <b>404</b><i>a</i>. The micro switch actuator <b>540</b> is provided with fins <b>542</b> that engage the sides <b>544</b> and <b>498</b><i>a </i>of the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>such that the micro switch actuator <b>540</b> and the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>pivot together as a unit about the same axis of rotation. The micro switch actuator <b>540</b> is also provided with a projection <b>546</b> for engaging the micro switch lever <b>536</b><i>a</i>. The latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a redesigned micro switch holder <b>534</b><i>a </i>that repositions the micro switch <b>532</b><i>a </i>such that the micro switch lever <b>536</b><i>a </i>can be depressed by the projection <b>546</b> when the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>is in the latched position. Furthermore, the housing insert <b>415</b><i>a </i>and the housing <b>402</b><i>a </i>are redesigned slightly to route the wiring of the latch differently to thereby relieve some of the strain on the wiring for the motor and the micro switch. The pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>used with the latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>shows a pawl slot <b>458</b><i>a </i>with a less severely reentrant side.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">During the unlatching operation, the motor <b>410</b> is energized resulting in the rotation of the bowtie coupler <b>414</b>. The bowtie coupler in turn rotates the screw <b>416</b> as described previously with respect to the latch <b>400</b>. As the screw <b>416</b> rotates, it causes the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>to move in rectilinear fashion toward the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>by means of a triple-lead thread on the shaft of the screw <b>416</b> and inside the slide <b>418</b><i>a</i>. The slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>moves toward the arm <b>486</b><i>a </i>of the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>and pushes the arm <b>486</b><i>a</i>, which causes the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>to rotate until the arm <b>484</b><i>a </i>of the trigger is disengaged from the notch <b>456</b> of the rotary pawl <b>404</b><i>a</i>. The disengagement of the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>from the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>allows the pawl to rotate to the unlatched position under the bias of the pawl spring <b>462</b> to thereby release the striker <b>508</b><i>a</i>. The slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>and screw <b>416</b> are returned to their starting positions by the compression spring <b>493</b>. The latch <b>400</b><i>a </i>can also be unlatched mechanically by pulling on the linkage rod <b>530</b><i>a</i>. The linkage rod <b>530</b><i>a </i>differs from the linkage rod <b>530</b> only in the orientation of the L-shaped end of the linkage rod relative to the loop at the other end. In the linkage rod <b>530</b> the loop at one end of the linkage rod extends in the same plane as defined by the L-shaped end and the elongated middle portion of the linkage rod, while in the linkage rod <b>530</b><i>a </i>the loop at one end of the linkage rod extends in a plane perpendicular to the plane defined by the L-shaped end and the elongated middle portion of the linkage rod.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The trigger spring <b>488</b> biases the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>toward the engaged position, such that when the slide <b>418</b><i>a </i>is moved to the retracted position, the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>will tend to reengage the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>if the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>is rotated to the latched position. During latching, the rod-shaped portion <b>434</b><i>a </i>of the striker <b>508</b><i>a </i>engages the pawl slot <b>458</b><i>a </i>with the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>initially in the unlatched position, and then pushes the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>to the latched position as the striker <b>508</b><i>a </i>reaches the latched position relative to the housing <b>402</b><i>a</i>. Once the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>is in the latched position, the pawl can again be engaged by the trigger <b>406</b><i>a </i>to thereby retain the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>in the latched position and secure the striker <b>508</b><i>a </i>in its closed or latched position relative to the housing <b>402</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As the striker <b>508</b><i>a </i>rotates the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>to the latched position, the micro switch actuator <b>540</b> rotates with the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>to its latched position where the micro switch actuator <b>540</b> depresses the micro switch lever <b>536</b><i>a</i>, which signals that the pawl <b>404</b><i>a </i>is in the latched position.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A purely mechanical version of the latches <b>400</b> and <b>400</b><i>a </i>is also contemplated as part of the present invention. The motor <b>410</b>, the bowtie coupler <b>414</b>, the screw <b>416</b>, the slide <b>418</b><i>a</i>, and the spring <b>493</b> are eliminated from the purely mechanical version of the latch. The purely mechanical version has a shortened housing that houses the trigger and pawl and their associated springs, and also support the linkage rod <b>530</b><i>a</i>. As is the case with the housing <b>402</b>, <b>402</b><i>a</i>, the shortened housing has an opening allow for engagement between the striker <b>508</b><i>a </i>and the pawl <b>404</b><i>a</i>. In the purely mechanical version, the trigger is rotated to the disengaged position primarily by pulling on the linkage rod <b>530</b><i>a</i>. It should also be noted that either of the disclosed micro switch configurations may be used with either one of the latches <b>400</b> and <b>400</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, a micro switch may also be incorporated into the purely mechanical version of the latches for remote monitoring of the condition of the latch.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made to the latch of the present invention without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, and it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of the latch which are within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
