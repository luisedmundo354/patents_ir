<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a multiple-output DC-DC converter, an electronic apparatus comprising such a multiple-output DC-DC converter, and a method of controlling a multiple-output DC-DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">WO 02/058220-A1 discloses a single output DC-DC converter in which a main switch periodically couples a DC input voltage to an inductor to store energy in the inductor during an on-period of the main switch. During an off-period of the main switch, a secondary switch couples a load to the inductor to transfer energy from the inductor to the load. A subsequent on and off-period of the main switch is called a switching cycle or a cycle. A ratio of the on-period to the duration of a cycle is called the duty cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The output voltage of the DC-DC converter is regulated by comparing the output voltage across the load with a reference level. If the output voltage is above the reference level, this indicates that the amount of energy supplied to the load is too high. During the next cycle, the duty cycle will have a predetermined minimum value so that the amount of energy stored in the inductor will be minimal. If the output voltage is below the reference level, during the next cycle, the duty cycle will have a predetermined maximum value. The output voltage is thus regulated by using the minimum and the maximum duty cycle only.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This prior art DC-DC converter is unsuitable for providing multiple individually regulated output voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple-output DC-DC converter in which the multiple output voltages are each regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first aspect of the invention provides a multiple-output DC-DC converter as claimed in claim <b>1</b>. A second aspect of the invention provides an electronic apparatus comprising such a multiple-output DC-DC converter as claimed in claim <b>16</b>. A third aspect of the invention provides a method of controlling a multiple-output DC-DC converter as claimed in claim <b>17</b>. Advantageous embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The multiple-output DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention comprises an inductor and a main switch which periodically couples a DC-input voltage to the inductor. During the on-time of the main switch, energy is stored in the inductor. Each one of a multitude of loads is coupled via one of a multitude of output switches to the inductor. Across each of the loads, one of a multitude of output voltages is present.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A controller controls the main switch and the output switches in sequences of cycles. Each one of the cycles contains an on-phase of the main switch followed by an on-phase of one of the multitude of output switches. The cycles have either a predetermined first or a second duty cycle which is larger than the first duty cycle. No other duty cycles occur. The first duty cycle is also referred to as the minimum duty cycle, and the second duty cycle is also referred to as the maximum duty cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The controller comprises a multitude of comparators which each compare one of the multitude of output voltages with an associated one of a multitude of reference voltages. The controller further checks whether the number of the multitude of output voltages which have a value above their associated reference voltage, is larger than, smaller than, or equal to the number of the multitude of output voltages which have a value below their associated reference voltage. Depending on the outcome of the check made by the controller, the duty cycles are selected such that the number of cycles with the minimal duty cycle (this number of duty cycles is further referred to as the first number) are larger than, smaller than, or equal to the number of cycles with the maximum duty cycle (this number of duty cycles is further referred to as the second number), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this manner, the total energy stored in the inductor will track the total energy required by the loads. For example, if in a DC-DC converter with three outputs, one of the output voltages is above its associated reference voltage (also referred to as reference level, or reference value), and two of the output voltages are below their associated reference level, the energy to be supplied to the first mentioned output should decrease while the energy supplied to the last mentioned output should be increased. Consequently, the total energy stored in the inductor should increase and the number of outputs which require more energy is larger than the number of outputs which require less energy. Thus, in the next sequence of cycles, the number of cycles with the maximum duty cycle should be larger than the number of cycles with the minimum duty cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">WO 02/058220-A1 discloses a multiple-output DC-DC converter in which the outputs are independently controlled in either the pulse width modulation (further referred to as PWM mode or the pulse frequency modulation (further referred to as PFM) mode. In the PWM mode, the duty cycles of the outputs differ because for each output the ratio between the input voltage and the output voltage is different. Moreover, the duty cycle is also related the current in the coil of the converter and the total output power provided. Further, the output has to be determined that requires the highest amount of energy. This output has to operate in the PWM mode. Then, the number of switching cycles of any other output operating in the PWM mode is determined from which part of the total amount of energy has to be supplied to a particular output. This prior art DC-DC converter is complex because it has to be determined which output requires the highest amount of energy to control its duty cycle such that sufficient energy will be stored in the inductor, what the duty cycle of the other outputs should be, and how many switching cycles have to be applied for a particular output in the total switching sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention only has to select how many of the two predetermined duty cycles (the minimum and the maximum duty cycle) have to be provided in the total switching sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>2</b>, the number of cycles in a sequence to which the minimum duty cycle is allocated, equals the number of output voltages which have a value above their associated reference voltage. The number of output voltages which have a value equal to their associated reference voltage, are either neglected, or are arbitrarily assigned to the cycles with the minimum or maximum duty cycle. The number of cycles in the sequence to which the maximum duty cycle is allocated equals the number of output voltages that have a value below their associated reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>3</b>, as much as possible with the present values of the first number and the second number, one of the cycles with the maximum duty cycle precedes one of the cycles with the minimum duty cycle. In this manner, first, during the cycles with the maximum duty cycle, the average current through the inductor increases, and then, during the cycles with the minimum duty cycle, the average current through the inductor decreases. Consequently, the chance that the current through the inductor becomes zero is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>4</b>, the order of the cycles in a sequence is selected to first comprise all the cycles with the maximum duty cycle and then all the cycles with the minimum duty cycle. Due to the cycles with the maximum duty cycle, first the average value of the current through the inductor increases, then, due the cycles with the minimum duty cycle, the average value decreases. Again, the chance that the current through the inductor becomes zero is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>5</b>, the minimum duty cycles are allocated as much as possible to cycles of which the corresponding output voltages have a value below their associated reference voltage. In cycles with the minimum duty cycle, the duration of the on-time of the output switch is larger than in the cycles with the second duty cycle and thus the amount of energy supplied to the associated load is larger. This is exactly what is required at an output with an output voltage below its reference value. Similarly, the maximum duty cycles are allocated as much as possible to cycles of which the corresponding output voltages have a value above their associated reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Both the number of the minimum and the maximum duty cycles in a sequence are determined by the number of output voltages above and below their associated reference voltages, respectively. Whereas in contrast, the minimum duty cycles are preferably allocated to output switches corresponding to outputs that have an output voltage below their reference value and the maximum duty cycles are preferably allocated to output switches corresponding to outputs that have an output voltage above their reference value. Usually, there will be no match in the numbers concerned, and, consequently, a maximum duty cycle will be allocated to some of the output voltages with a value below their reference value as defined in claim <b>7</b>, or a minimum duty cycle will be allocated to some of the output voltages above their reference value, as is defined in claim <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>8</b>, in a sequence of cycles, the cycle wherein a lowest amount of energy is transferred is allocated to an output of which the output voltage is above its associated reference voltage. This causes a minimal further increase of this voltage which already has a value higher than its reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>9</b>, the first cycle in a sequence is allocated to an output of which the voltage is above its associated reference voltage and to which a minimum duty cycle is allocated. Usually, the first cycle in a sequence starts with the lowest average value of the current in the inductor. This is due to the fact that cycles with the minimum duty cycle occur at the end of the sequence. This lowest amount of energy should be supplied to an output that is going to receive a much larger amount of energy than required. This is particularly true for an output that has already a voltage above its reference value and to which a minimum duty cycle has to be allocated because there are no maximum duty cycles left.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>10</b>, in a sequence of cycles, the cycle wherein a highest amount of energy is transferred is allocated to an output of which the voltage is below its associated reference voltage. This causes a minimal further decrease of this voltage which already has a value lower than its reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>11</b>, in a sequence, the last cycle to which a maximum duty cycle is allocated is selected to be an output of which the voltage is below its associated reference voltage and to which a maximum duty cycle is allocated. Usually, in a sequence, the last cycle to which a maximum duty cycle is allocated has the highest average value of the current in the inductor. This is due to the fact that cycles with the minimum duty cycle occur at the end of the sequence. This highest amount of energy should be supplied to an output which is going to receive a much smaller amount of energy than required. This is particularly true for an output that already has a voltage below its reference value and to which a maximum duty cycle has to be allocated because there are no minimum duty cycles left.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>12</b> or <b>13</b>, if in a particular sequence either the minimum or the maximum duty cycle has to be allocated to an output of which the voltage is above or below its reference level, respectively, in a next sequence the correct duty cycle is allocated to this output. This has the advantage, that the wrong allocating of duty cycles will be averaged over time and thus its negative influence on the regulation of the output voltages concerned is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>14</b>, the mode of the outputs is tracked.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment as defined in claim <b>15</b>, if the mode indicates that an output does not need to supply current to the load, no switching cycle should be allocated to this output to prevent the output voltage to rise even further.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">These and other aspects of the invention are apparent from and will be elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.</p>

The DC-DC converter, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an up-converter <b>1</b> comprises a series arrangement of an inductor L and a first switch S<b>1</b> (the main switch) arranged between a first input terminal <b>2</b> and a second input terminal <b>3</b> to receive an input voltage Vin. A parallel arrangement of a diode D and a second switch S<b>2</b> (the output switch) is arranged between the junction of the main switch S<b>1</b> and the inductor L and the first output terminal <b>4</b>. The second input terminal <b>3</b> and the second output terminal <b>5</b> are interconnected. A smoothing capacitor C is arranged between the first output terminal <b>4</b> and the second output terminal <b>5</b>. A load <b>12</b> is connected between the first output terminal <b>4</b> and the second output terminal <b>5</b>. A comparator <b>9</b> compares the output voltage Vout at the first output terminal <b>4</b> with a reference voltage VR at terminal <b>10</b> to supply an error signal <b>11</b> to the controller <b>6</b>.

The first duty cycle D<b>1</b> is also referred to as the minimum duty cycle, and the second duty cycle D<b>2</b> is further referred to as the maximum duty cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The arrows at the instants t<b>2</b>, t<b>4</b>, t<b>6</b>, t<b>8</b>, t<b>10</b> indicate sample instants at which the comparator <b>9</b> compares the output voltage Vout with the reference voltage VR. If the output voltage Vout is higher than the reference voltage VR, a succeeding cycle CY will have the minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>. If the output voltage Vout is lower than the reference voltage VR, a succeeding cycle will have the maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is assumed that the value of the capacitor C is sufficiently large to keep the average level of the output voltage Vout substantially constant. At the instant t<b>2</b>, the main switch S<b>1</b> is closed and the output switch S<b>2</b> is opened, and consequently, the load <b>12</b> will draw a discharge current through the capacitor C which causes a downward jump in the voltage at the output due to the ESR. The ESR is the series impedance of the capacitor C. The linear decrease of the output voltage Vout from the instant t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b> is due to the load discharging the output capacitor. At the instant t<b>3</b>, the main switch S<b>1</b> is opened and the output switch S<b>2</b> is closed: a charge current will flow into the capacitor C. Due to the ESR of the capacitor C, the polarity change of the current will cause an upward jump in the output voltage Vout. The decrease of the output voltage Vout from the instant t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b> is due to the coil current decrease, resulting in an ESR voltage drop decrease. The comparator <b>9</b> compares the output voltage Vout with the reference level VR at, or just before the instant t<b>4</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the level of the output voltage Vout is below the reference level VR, and thus a maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> will be allocated to the next cycle starting at the instant t<b>4</b>.</p>

Usually, in a sequence SE, the last cycle CY<b>1</b>, CY<b>2</b>, CY<b>3</b> to which a maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> is allocated has the highest average value of the current IL in the inductor L.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a further embodiment in accordance with the invention, the DC-DC converter further comprises mode detectors <b>15</b> which keep track of the modes of the outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b>, O<b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At the instant t<b>15</b>, as indicated by the arrows SV<b>1</b>, SV<b>2</b>, SV<b>3</b> the comparators <b>12</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>10</b> compare the output voltages V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b> with the reference levels VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, VR<b>3</b>, respectively. The output voltages V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> both have a value below their associated reference levels VR<b>1</b> and VR<b>2</b>. The output voltage V<b>3</b> has a value above its associated reference level VR<b>3</b>. Consequently, in the next sequence SE from instant t<b>15</b> to instant t<b>21</b>, two of the cycles CY<b>1</b>, CY<b>2</b>, CY<b>3</b> will have the maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b>, and one of the cycles CY<b>1</b>, CY<b>2</b>, CY<b>3</b> will have the minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The allocation of the one minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> and the two maximum duty cycles D<b>2</b> in the sequence SE may be performed in several ways. Preferably, first, it is tried to allocate minimum duty cycles D<b>1</b> to cycles CY<b>1</b>, CY<b>2</b>, CY<b>3</b> in which the output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b> is below the associated reference voltage VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, VR<b>3</b>, and to allocate maximum duty cycles D<b>2</b> to cycles CY<b>1</b>, CY<b>2</b>, CY<b>3</b> in which the output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b> is above the associated reference voltage VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, VR<b>3</b>. Therefore, if available, a maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> has to be allocated to the third switch S<b>3</b> because the third output voltage V<b>3</b> is higher than its reference level VR<b>3</b>, and a minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> has to be allocated to the first and second switch S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">However, in the embodiment in accordance with the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, to either the first V<b>1</b> or the second V<b>2</b> output voltage a maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> has to be allocated as there is only a single minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> to be allocated. Thus in the process of allocating the single minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> and the two maximum duty cycles D<b>2</b> to the three available cycles CY<b>1</b>, CY<b>2</b>, CY<b>3</b> in the sequence SE it has been decided to allocate one of the maximum duty cycles D<b>2</b> to the third switch S<b>3</b> (the third output voltage V<b>3</b> has a value above its reference VR<b>1</b>). The other maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> and the single minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> are allocated to the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. For one of the switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> this is correct because a minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> should be allocated to output voltages V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> which have a value below their reference values VR<b>1</b> and VR<b>2</b>. For the other one of the switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> this is incorrect.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is advantageous to select the allocation in time of the duty cycles in the order: first the two maximum duty cycles D<b>2</b> and then the minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>. In this manner, first the average current IL through the inductor L increases preventing the current IL from crossing zero during the cycle in which the minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a next step, it has to be selected in what order the power has to be delivered to the outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b>, O<b>3</b>. It is clear that the switch S<b>3</b> should be operated with the maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b>, and thus should be associated with the first or the second cycle CY<b>1</b> or CY<b>2</b>. As the third output voltage V<b>3</b> has already a value above its reference value VR<b>3</b> it is advantageous to supply as little as possible power to the third output O<b>3</b>. Consequently, this third switch S<b>3</b> should be associated with the first cycle CY<b>1</b> because the average current IL in the inductor L is minimal. The association of the first and the second switch S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> to the second and third cycle S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> is not important, one of the switches S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> will be controlled correctly, the other will not. Preferably, if possible, in a next sequence SE, the allocation to the switches S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> is reversed to obtain an averaging effect.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As soon as one of the output voltages V<b>1</b> or V<b>2</b> drops below its associated reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, the controller CO should switch to the situation with one output requiring a load current. With a maximum of one output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> with load current, the principle works the same as with single output control as is disclosed in WO 02/058220-A1. This means that if the output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> is below its reference value VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, the next switch cycle CY should have the maximum duty cycle, and when the output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> is above its reference value VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, the next switch cycle CY should be the minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>. Thus, only the output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> with load current will get switching cycles CY and output power. The other output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> stays at a level above its reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b> and gets no switching cycles CY as is shown in the following table, wherein the i in Di,j refers to the minimum duty cycle if i=1 and to the maximum duty cycle if i=2, and wherein j refers to output O<b>1</b> (voltage V<b>1</b>) ifj=1 and to output O<b>2</b> (voltage V<b>2</b>) ifj=2.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As soon as the other output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> drops below its reference voltage VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, the controller CO should switch to the two-output situation. When the load L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> at the active output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> is switched off and the output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> gets and stays above its reference value VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, the controller CO should switch back to the no-load situation at both outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For two outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> with load current, the inductor current IL has to be adapted correctly and the power has to be distributed according to the need at the outputs O<b>1</b> and O<b>2</b>. With two outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> there are four options:</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">both outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> have an output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> above their reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>,</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">the first output O<b>1</b> has an output voltage V<b>1</b> above its reference level VR<b>1</b> and the second output O<b>2</b> has an output voltage V<b>2</b> below its reference level VR<b>2</b>,</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">the first output O<b>1</b> has an output voltage V<b>1</b> below its reference level VR<b>1</b> and the second output O<b>2</b> has an output voltage V<b>2</b> above its reference level VR<b>2</b>,</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">both outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> have an output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> below their reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The inductor current IL should increase when both output voltages V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> have values below their reference value VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>. The inductor current IL should decrease when both output voltages V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> have values above their reference value VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>. And, the inductor current IL has to remain at the same level when one of the output voltages O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> has a value above its associated reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, and one of the output voltages O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> has a value below its associated reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>. This results in a sequence SE of two maximum cycles D<b>2</b> when the inductor current IL should increase, two minimum cycles D<b>1</b> when the inductor current IL has to decrease, and one minimum D<b>1</b> and one maximum D<b>2</b> duty cycle when the inductor current IL must remain at the same level.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thus, when both outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> have a voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> above their reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, they will both get a minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>. In the same way when both outputs have a voltage below their reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, they both will get a second duty cycle D<b>2</b>. When one of the outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> is above its reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, and one O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> below its reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b>, the situation is different. Since the maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> has a short second phase (during which the switch S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> arranged between the inductor and the load L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> is closed) the energy transfer to the output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> is smaller than during the minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b> which has a longer second phase. This means that the output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> with an output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> above its reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b> will get a maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> and the output O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> with an output voltage V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> below its reference level VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b> will get a minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>. To maximize the output power and prevent zero current in this situation first the maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> will occur and then a minimum duty cycle D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The next table shows these control rules for two active outputs. Again, the i in Di,j refers to the minimum duty cycle if i=1 and to the maximum duty cycle if i=2, and j refers to output O<b>1</b> (voltage V<b>1</b>) ifj=1 and to output O<b>2</b> (voltage V<b>2</b>) ifj=2. Each of the sequences comprises two successive next cycles.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The conclusion for down-conversion is that at least the same rules are valid as for up-conversion. There are additional alternatives since the choice from the minimum D<b>1</b> and the maximum D<b>2</b> duty cycles is no longer critical for the outputs O<b>1</b>, O<b>2</b> but is only relevant for the inductor current IL.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a block diagram of an apparatus with a DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention. The DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention, which is denoted by <b>100</b>, receives an input voltage Vin and supplies a first output voltage V<b>1</b> to a first circuit <b>101</b>, a second output voltage V<b>2</b> to a second circuit <b>102</b>, and a third output voltage V<b>3</b> to a third circuit <b>103</b>. The first, second and third circuits <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> may be internal circuits (for example a receiver, a transmitter and a display in a mobile phone, or signal processing circuits and a display in a television or computer display) in an audio-visual application or may be external apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a state diagram for elucidating the modes of output voltages. For the control of the converter, it is not required to measure whether an output Oi requires a load current or not. The mode of an output Oi is tracked with an algorithm elucidated with respect to the state diagram. The index i is an integer which indicates one of a plurality of outputs, depending on how many output Oi the converter has.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The modes are defined as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">mode <b>0</b>: the output voltage Vi is larger than its reference voltage VRi, no power required, the output Oi is not active,</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">mode <b>1</b>: the output voltage Vi is larger than its reference voltage VRi, minimum power required, the output Oi is active,</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">mode <b>2</b>: the output voltage Vi is smaller than its reference voltage VRi, maximum power required, the output Oi is active,</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The value of the mode is determined by the previous mode and the new sampled output voltage Vi. If the sampled output voltage Vi is smaller than its reference value VRi, always mode <b>2</b> will be reached. If the sampled output voltage Vi is larger than its reference value VRi, mode <b>2</b> changes into mode <b>1</b>, and mode <b>1</b> changes into mode <b>0</b>. If the output voltage Vi is larger than its reference value VRi, the mode <b>1</b> will become mode <b>0</b> and mode <b>0</b> will stay mode <b>0</b> and the output Oi is not active. Thus, in active operation, for each output Oi, the mode will alternate between mode <b>1</b> and mode <b>2</b> in a sequence that depends on the measured value of the output voltage Vi. If one of the outputs Oi has zero load its output voltage Vi will remain above its reference level VRi which results in mode <b>0</b>.</p>

And in step <b>103</b>, in a sequence SE of cycles CY, the first maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> is applied to the first switch S<b>1</b> associated with the first output voltage V<b>1</b>, and then the second maximum duty cycle D<b>2</b> is applied to the second switch S<b>2</b> associated with the second output voltage V<b>2</b>, or the other way around.</p>
