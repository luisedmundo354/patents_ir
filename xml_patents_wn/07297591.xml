<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2002-87241 filed on Dec. 30, 2002, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a capacitor of a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the integration density of semiconductor memory devices increases, the space taken up by a memory cell area typically decreases. A decrease in cell capacitance is typically a serious obstacle in increasing the integration of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices having storage capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a high voltage (10V or higher) device such as Liquid Crystal Device (LCD) Drive Integrated Circuit (IC) or LDI, a decrease in the cell capacitance raises the boosting frequency to increase power dissipation, thereby making it difficult to scale down the entire chip size. For memory devices, a decrease in the cell capacitance not only lowers the ability to read a memory cell and increases a soft error rate, but it also hinders the operation of the device at low voltages and causes excessive power consumption during the operation of the device. Therefore, a method for increasing cell capacitance needs to be developed for the manufacture of a highly integrated semiconductor memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, dielectric properties of the cell capacitance can be evaluated by the equivalent oxide thickness (Toxeq) and the leakage current density. The Toxeq is a value obtained by converting the thickness of a dielectric layer formed of a material other than a silicon oxide substance into the thickness of a dielectric layer formed of a silicon oxide substance. As the value of the Toxeq becomes smaller, the capacitance increases. Also, it is preferable that the leakage current density has a small value in order to improve the electrical properties of a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a conventional method, to increase the cell capacitance, a dielectric layer is formed of a combination of a silicon oxide layer (SiO<sub>2</sub>, hereinafter represented as ‘O’) and a silicon nitride layer (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, hereinafter represented as ‘N’), for example, an NO, ON, or ONO layer. However, because the silicon oxide and silicon nitride layers have low dielectric constants, this method is limited in improving the cell capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, research is being done on methods in which a silicon nitride layer or a silicon oxide layer is replaced by a high dielectric layer having a high dielectric constant for the dielectric layer of a capacitor. Accordingly, various metal oxides having high dielectric constants are potentially strong candidates for this new capacitor dielectric layer material.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a capacitor of a semiconductor device having a large capacitance per unit area, by which leakage current can be inhibited to reduce power dissipation and the size can be scaled down to achieve high integration. A method for manufacturing the same is also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a capacitor of a semiconductor device includes a capacitor lower electrode disposed on a semiconductor substrate. A first dielectric layer comprising aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is disposed on the capacitor lower electrode. A second dielectric layer comprising a material having a higher dielectric constant than that of aluminum oxide is disposed on the first dielectric layer. A third dielectric layer comprising aluminum oxide is disposed on the second dielectric layer. A capacitor upper electrode is disposed on the third dielectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, a capacitor dielectric layer includes the first and third dielectric layers formed of aluminum oxide, which exhibits a large band gap and conforms with a tunneling mechanism, and the second dielectric layer formed of a high k-dielectric material, which has a higher dielectric constant than that of aluminum oxide and can serve as a voltage distributor to the first and third dielectric layers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment of the present invention, the second dielectric layer is preferably formed of a material having a dielectric constant of 20 or higher. For example, the second dielectric layer may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a Ti-doped Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a TaOxNy layer, a HfO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(STO) layer, a (Ba, Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>(BST) layer, a PbTiO<sub>3 </sub>layer, a Pb(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3</sub>(PZT) layer, a SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>(SBT) layer, a (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3 </sub>layer, and a BaTiO<sub>3</sub>(BTO) layer, and combinations thereof. The second dielectric layer is preferably thicker than the first dielectric layer or the third dielectric layer and may range from about 100 Å to about 1000 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The thickness of the first dielectric layer or the third dielectric layer may range from about 30 Å to about 300 Å. The capacitor lower electrode and the capacitor upper electrode may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a doped polysilicon, a metal such as W, Pt, Ru, and Ir, a conductive metal nitride such as TiN, TaN, and WN, and a conductive metal oxide such as RuO<sub>2 </sub>and IrO<sub>2</sub>, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a capacitor of a semiconductor device is provided. The method includes forming a lower electrode of a capacitor on a semiconductor substrate. Next, a first dielectric layer comprising aluminum oxide is formed on the capacitor lower electrode, and then a second dielectric layer comprising a material having a higher dielectric constant than aluminum oxide is formed on the first dielectric layer. Afterwards, a third dielectric layer comprising aluminum oxide is formed on the second dielectric layer. Finally, a capacitor upper electrode is formed on the third dielectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment of the present invention, the second dielectric layer is preferably formed of a material having a dielectric constant of 20 or higher. For example, the second dielectric layer may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a Ti-doped Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a TaOxNy layer, a HfO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(STO) layer, a (Ba, Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>(BST) layer, a PbTiO<sub>3 </sub>layer, a Pb(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3</sub>(PZT) layer, a SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>(SBT) layer, a (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3 </sub>layer, and a BaTiO<sub>3</sub>(BTO) layer, and any combination thereof. The second dielectric layer is preferably formed to be thicker than the first dielectric layer or the third dielectric layer and may be formed to a thickness of 100 Å to 1000 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise performing a thermal treatment on the second dielectric layer at a temperature of about 300° C. to about 500° C. after forming the second dielectric layer. The thermal treatment may be carried out in an atmosphere containing oxygen, such as, for example, in an atmosphere of O<sub>3 </sub>gas, O<sub>2 </sub>plasma gas, or N<sub>2</sub>O plasma gas.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this embodiment of the present invention, the first dielectric layer or the third dielectric layer may be formed to a thickness of about 30 Å to about 300 Å and is preferably formed using a gas containing oxygen (O) without hydrogen (H) as a reactant gas. For instance, the reactant gas may include O<sub>3 </sub>gas or O<sub>2 </sub>plasma gas.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this embodiment of the present invention, the capacitor lower electrode or the capacitor upper electrode may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a doped polysilicon, a metal such as W, Pt, Ru, and Ir, a conductive metal nitride such as TiN, TaN, and WN, and a conductive metal oxide such as RuO<sub>2 </sub>and IrO<sub>2</sub>, and any combination thereof. The capacitor lower electrode or the capacitor upper electrode is preferably formed at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 500° C. using physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second dielectric layer <b>134</b> is preferably formed of a material having a high dielectric constant of 20 or higher. This allows the second dielectric layer <b>134</b> to serve as a voltage distributor to the first dielectric layer <b>132</b> and the third dielectric layer <b>136</b>. That is, the second dielectric layer <b>134</b> helps to distribute a high voltage to the first dielectric layer <b>132</b> and the third dielectric layer <b>136</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 6</figref> are various graphs showing properties of the capacitor according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates breakdown voltages having a leakage current of 10 nA with respect to various capacitors and dielectric layers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when a capacitor is formed of a polysilicon layer-dielectric layer-polysilicon layer (hereinafter, referred to as ‘SIS’), a dielectric layer is one of an ONO layer and a silicon oxide layer. Also, when a capacitor is formed of a metal (or a conductive metal oxide or a conductive metal nitride)-dielectric layer-metal (hereinafter, referred to as ‘MIM’), a dielectric layer is one of an AIO/TaO layer, an AlO/TaO/AlO layer (hereinafter, referred to as ‘ATA’), a TaO layer, an AlO layer, an AlO/HfO layer, and a HfO layer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the dielectric layer <b>130</b> formed of a multiple layer such as the AlO/TaO layer, the AlO/HfO layer, and the ATA layer rather than a single layer such as the TaO layer, the AlO layer, and the HfO layer, show superior electrical properties in respect to the breakdown voltage of 10 nA under the same Toxeq.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Therefore, it is preferable that a dielectric layer having a high dielectric constant such as TaO and HfO is formed thicker than other dielectric layers to act as a voltage distributor for reducing the voltage of the AlO layer, and the AlO layer having conductibility by a tunneling mechanism is used to prevent the leakage current.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates leakage current characteristics of the capacitor including the ATA layer according to the embodiment of the present invention and the capacitor including the AlO/TaO layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates comparison results between a double-layer structure such as an AlO(150 Å)/TaO(600 Å) layer and a TaO(600 Å)/AlO(150 Å) layer, a triple-layer structure such as an AlO(50 Å)/TaO(600 Å)/AlO(100 Å) layer, and an AlO(100 Å)/TaO(600 Å)/AlO(50 Å) layer, in which upper and lower electrodes are formed to different thicknesses, among combinations of AlO and TaO. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the triple-layer structure such as the ATA layer is superior to the double-layer structure in respect to a balance of the leakage current at a positive voltage and a negative voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a value of the leakage current density based on a method of depositing a capacitor upper electrode in the AlO(150 Å)/TaO(600 Å) structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates values of the leakage current density depending on whether or not a thermal treatment is conducted at about 450° C. after forming the capacitor upper electrode using PVD.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a capacitor upper electrode is formed of TiN by two different methods. Firstly, the MOCVD is carried out using a C-based metal organic source gas at about 400° C. Secondly, a capacitor upper electrode is formed by sputtering, one of the PVD processes, using a source gas without carbon at about 200° C.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In comparing the two methods, there is little difference between them at low voltages. However, an early breakdown is caused when a TiN capacitor upper electrode is formed using MOCVD at a high voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, while a capacitor dielectric layer is formed of the AlO (150 Å)/TaO(600 Å), a capacitor upper electrode is formed of TiN, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Here, even if MOCVD is replaced by PVD, when a thermal treatment is further performed at about 450° C. in an N<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere, the leakage current characteristic of the capacitor is degraded. Accordingly, it can be seen that the early breakdown, caused during the capacitor upper electrode formation using MOCVD, results from a process temperature of about 400° C. rather than the C-based source gas.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other words, even if a capacitor upper electrode is formed of TiN and then thermally treated in a nitrogen atmosphere at about 450° C., the leakage current characteristic of the capacitor does not degrade when a capacitor dielectric layer has the triple-layer structure of an ATA(AlO(50 Å)/TaO(600 Å)/AlO(100 Å) layer. Rather, in the ATA structure, a current is lowered at a base level.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, when the dielectric layer has the double-layer structure such as the AlO/TaO layer or the TaO/AlO layer, and the capacitor upper electrode is formed and then thermally treated at a high temperature, TiN and TaO, which form the capacitor upper electrode, react with each other, or oxygen atoms existing in the TaO layer move to the TiN layer. As a result, the TaO layer lacks oxygen, thus increasing the leakage current. To alleviate this type of oxygen shortage in the TaO layer during the high-temperature thermal treatment, in the present invention, another AlO layer is preferably disposed between the TaO layer and the electrode to prevent a direct contact therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates TDDB results of the capacitor including the ATA layer according to the embodiment of the present invention. Thicknesses of 370 Å, 144 Å, and 165 Å in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represent equivalent oxide thicknesses. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a capacitor including the ATA layer more than doubles the capacitance per unit area of a capacitor including the ONO layer and is more reliable than the capacitor including the ONO layer under the same voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7F</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating a method for manufacturing the capacitor according to the embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a cylinder-type capacitor is formed on a substrate. However, the present invention should not be limited thereto and is applicable to a variety of capacitors irrespective of positions or shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, an interlayer dielectric (ILD) <b>212</b> is formed of a silicon oxide layer on a substrate <b>210</b>. A contact plug <b>214</b> is formed in the ILD <b>212</b> to electrically connect the interlayer dielectric <b>212</b> with a capacitor lower electrode. To form a cylinder-type capacitor, an etch stop layer <b>216</b> is formed on the ILD <b>212</b> including the contact plug <b>214</b>. The etch stop layer <b>216</b> is preferably formed of a material having an etch selectivity with respect to a mold layer <b>218</b> to be formed thereon. For example, when the mold layer <b>218</b> is formed of a silicon oxide layer, the etch stop layer <b>216</b> is typically formed of a silicon nitride layer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the mold layer <b>218</b> is formed on the etch stop layer <b>216</b>. When the etch stop layer <b>216</b> is formed of a silicon nitride layer, the mold layer <b>218</b> can be formed of a silicon oxide layer. The mold layer <b>218</b> is preferably slightly thicker than the capacitor lower electrode to be formed later.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the mold layer <b>218</b> is patterned using a photolithographic process to define a capacitor lower electrode region <b>219</b>. Then, the exposed etch stop layer <b>216</b> is removed. As a result, the capacitor lower electrode region <b>219</b>, which exposes the contact plug <b>214</b>, is defined by the remaining mold layer <b>218</b><i>a </i>and the etch stop layer <b>216</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, a conductive material layer <b>220</b> for forming the capacitor lower electrode is uniformly formed on the capacitor lower electrode region <b>219</b> and the mold layer <b>218</b><i>a</i>. For instance, the conductive material layer <b>220</b> may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a doped polysilicon, a metal such as W, Pt, Ru, and Ir, a conductive metal nitride such as TiN, TaN, and WN, and a conductive metal oxide such as RuO<sub>2 </sub>and IrO<sub>2</sub>, and any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The conductive material layer <b>220</b> can be formed using CVD, PVD, or atomic layer deposition (ALD). In the case where the capacitor lower electrode is formed between metal interconnection layers, the deposition process is preferably carried out within a range of 25 Å to 500 Å. This is because an excessively high process temperature may lower the reliability of the metal interconnections, between which the capacitor is formed. Afterwards, a buffer layer <b>225</b>, which is a silicon oxide layer like the mold layer <b>218</b>, is formed on the conductive material layer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, the buffer layer <b>225</b> and the conductive material layer <b>220</b> are etched using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) until the mold layer <b>218</b><i>a </i>is exposed, thereby separating a node of the conductive material layer <b>220</b>. Then, the remaining mold layer <b>218</b><i>a </i>and buffer layer <b>225</b> are removed using a wet etch process. Here, the etch stop layer <b>216</b><i>a </i>is used to prevent etching of the ILD <b>212</b> thereunder. As a result, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, the cylinder-type capacitor lower electrode <b>22</b><i>a </i>is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, a dielectric layer (<b>230</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>) is formed on inner and outer walls of the capacitor lower electrode <b>220</b><i>a</i>. To begin with, an oxide aluminum (ALO) layer <b>232</b>, i.e., a first dielectric layer, is uniformly formed on the inner and outer walls of the capacitor lower electrode <b>220</b><i>a</i>. The first dielectric layer or the AlO layer <b>232</b> is preferably formed using ALD. However, a CVD process may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The ALD process is preferably performed at a temperature of about 250° C. to 500° C. A source gas can be tetra methyl aluminum (TMA) and a reactant gas can be an O2-based source. The reactant gas preferably includes one of H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>2 </sub>plasma. The first dielectric layer <b>232</b> is formed to a thickness of about 30 Å to about 300 Å. Preferably, O<sub>3</sub>, or O<sub>2 </sub>plasma, which are both O<sub>2</sub>-based sources without hydrogen ions, is used as the reactant gas and the ALD process is carried out at about 30° C. to about 450° C.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate dielectric properties depending on whether or not a reactant gas contains H-radicals when the AlO layer is deposited using ALD. In the embodiment, upper and lower electrodes are formed of TiN using sputtering at about 200° C. The thickness of the AIO layer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> does not represent the oxide thickness but the substantial thickness. The TMA source gas is commonly used irrespective of whether or not the reactant gas contains H-radicals.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, when the reactant gas includes H<sub>2</sub>O, the leakage current characteristic is poorer with the same thickness. This is because when the reactant gas includes H<sub>2</sub>O, OH-radicals, which enter the AIO layer during the formation thereof, deteriorate the leakage current characteristic of the AIO layer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Afterwards, a second dielectric layer <b>234</b> is formed on the first dielectric layer <b>232</b>. The second dielectric layer <b>234</b> is preferably formed of a material that may cause a great amount of leakage current but should have a high dielectric constant. Thus, even if such a material is formed to a thick thickness, its equivalent oxide thickness can vary within a small range. Accordingly, the second dielectric layer <b>234</b> is preferably formed of a material having a dielectric constant of 20 or higher. For example, the second dielectric layer <b>234</b> may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a Ti-doped Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a TaO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y </sub>layer, a HfO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(STO) layer, a (Ba, Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>(BST) layer, a PbTiO<sub>3 </sub>layer, a Pb(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3</sub>(PZT) layer, a SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>(SBT) layer, (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3 </sub>layer, and a BaTiO<sub>3</sub>(BTO) layer, and any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second dielectric layer <b>234</b> can be formed using ALD or CVD. For example, when the second dielectric layer <b>234</b> is formed of TaO using ALD, the process temperature can range from about 250° C. to about 500° C. Also, like the AlO layer, an O<sub>2</sub>-based reactant source may include one of H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>2 </sub>plasma. The thickness of the second dielectric layer <b>234</b> can range from about 100 Å to about 1000 Å. When the TaO layer is formed using CVD, the O<sub>2</sub>-based reactant source may include one of H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>2 </sub>plasma and the deposition process is preferably performed at a temperature of about 350° C. to about 500° C.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Under the foregoing process conditions, it is possible to obtain a TaON layer by using an N<sub>2</sub>-based reactant gas such as N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The process conditions for forming a Ti-doped TaO layer are similar to those described above except that the source gas includes Ti instead of Ta, or a mix gas of a Ti-based gas and a Ta-based gas.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After the second dielectric layer <b>234</b> is formed of TaO using CVD, a thermal treatment is further carried out. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, the thermal treatment is illustrated as arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, a third dielectric layer <b>236</b> is formed of AIO on the second dielectric layer <b>234</b>. The third dielectric layer <b>236</b> can be formed using the same method under the same process conditions as the first dielectric layer <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, an upper capacitor electrode <b>240</b> is formed on the third dielectric layer <b>236</b>. Like the lower electrode, the upper capacitor electrode <b>240</b> may be formed of one selected from the group consisting of a Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a Ti-doped Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer, a TaO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y </sub>layer, a HfO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer, a SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(STO) layer, a (Ba, Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>(BST) layer, a PbTiO<sub>3 </sub>layer, a Pb(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3</sub>(PZT) layer, a SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>(SBT) layer, (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O<sub>3 </sub>layer, and a BaTiO<sub>3</sub>(BTO) layer, and any combination thereof. The third dielectric layer <b>236</b> is preferably formed using ALD, CVD, or PVD at about 25° C. to about 500° C.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the present invention, the dielectric layer <b>230</b>, which can be, for example, an ATA layer, is preferably formed in-situ. Thus, it is preferable to use a clustered apparatus including a chamber for forming the AlO layer and a chamber for forming a high k-dielectric layer such as TaO layer in order to support the in-situ process.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the present invention, a capacitor having large capacitance per unit area can be manufactured. Since a boosting frequency can be lowered, power dissipation can be reduced, thereby enabling the manufacture of a low power device. In addition, this enables the manufacture of a smaller capacitor having the same capacitance. Thus, the chip size can be reduced to achieve high integration.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the capacitor of the present invention exhibits a higher breakdown voltage than the conventional capacitor and improves electrical properties such as the leakage current characteristic and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a method for manufacturing a cylinder-type capacitor, this invention should not be construed as being limited thereto.
