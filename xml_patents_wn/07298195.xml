<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is related to techniques for clock and data recovery (CDR) techniques and, more particularly, to techniques for improving the switching times and linearity of phase interpolators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In many applications, including digital communications, clock and data recovery (CDR) must be performed before data can be decoded. Generally, in a digital clock recovery system, a reference clock signal of a given frequency is generated together with a number of different clock signals having the same frequency but with different phases. In one typical implementation, the different clock signals are generated by applying the reference clock signal to a delay network. Thereafter, one or more of the clock signals are compared to the phase and frequency of an incoming data stream and one or more of the clock signals are selected for data recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of existing digital CDR circuits use voltage controlled delay loops (VCDL) to generate a number of clocks having the same frequency and different phase for data sampling (i.e., oversampling). One technique for generating multiple clock signals having a phase spacing that is smaller than a delay element is to interpolate between the delay stage phases. Phase interpolators are typically controlled by an N bit interpolation control word that selects a desired one of 2<sup>N </sup>possible phases. In one typical implementation, the phase interpolator comprises 2<sup>N </sup>dedicated interpolators, each associated with a given desired phase, and the array of 2<sup>N </sup>interpolator outputs are multiplexed to select the desired clock phase. Such an array of 2<sup>N </sup>interpolators, however, consumes considerable area and power, especially as the number of interpolated phases increases.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another common implementation, a single interpolator is comprised of N weighted current sources that are selectively turned on or off, in accordance with the applied N bit interpolation control word, to obtain the desired clock phase. When a given current source is turned off, however, it takes time for the transistor drain to turn back on and reach steady state. With 90 nM transistor technology, for example, it has been found that the time it takes to switch from one phase to another desired phase is too slow (on the order of greater than 500 ps).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need therefore exists for improved techniques for interpolating two input clock signals to generate a clock signal having a phase between the phase of the two input clock signals. A further need exists for improved interpolation techniques that provide fast-switching variable clock phases, and a highly linear phase interpolation transfer function, while utilizing less power and area.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, methods and apparatus are provided for improving phase switching and linearity in an analog phase interpolator. A phase interpolator in accordance with the present invention comprises (i) a plurality of tail current sources that are activated for substantially all times when the phase interpolator is operational; (ii) at least two pairs of input transistor devices, wherein one pair of the input transistor devices is associated with a minimum phase of the phase interpolator and another pair of the input transistor devices is associated with a maximum phase of the phase interpolator; and (iii) a plurality of current steering switches that provide currents generated by the plurality of tail current sources to one or more of the at least two pairs of input transistor devices, based on an applied interpolation control signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides methods and apparatus for generating multiple clock phases, with a highly linear interpolation transfer function, and fast-switching between phases, for data sampling in clock and data recovery (CDR) systems. According to one aspect of the invention, weighted input devices provide linear interpolation over a wide range of operating frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of a conventional phase interpolator <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an input clock signal is applied to a delay stage <b>110</b> to generate two phase offset clock signals that are applied to the input of the analog phase interpolator <b>100</b>. The input clock signal may be generated, for example, by a local voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) or a voltage controlled delay loop (VCDL). The analog phase interpolator <b>100</b> generates an interpolated clock signal <b>130</b> having a desired phase in response to an interpolation control code <b>140</b>, in a known manner. For example, an interpolation control code <b>140</b> of 000 may correspond to a minimum phase value and an interpolation control code <b>140</b> of 111 may correspond to a maximum phase value.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Generally, the analog phase interpolator <b>100</b> generates an output clock having a phase that is the weighted sum of the two input phases. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the interpolator <b>100</b> receives two differential inputs, A/Ā and B/ <o ostyle="single">B</o>, and generates an output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, that is the weighted sum of the input phases. The weighting ratio is determined by the exemplary 3-bit phase control code <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram <b>200</b> of an implementation of a conventional interpolator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The exemplary conventional interpolator <b>200</b> is an adjustable interpolator with a 3 bit adjustment range (w[2:0]). The interpolator <b>200</b> receives two differential inputs, A/Ā and B/ <o ostyle="single">B</o>, and generates an output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, that is the weighted sum of the input phases. The weighting ratio is determined by the 3-bit phase control input, w[2:0].</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, weighted current sources <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> on each side (left, L, and right, R) of the interpolator <b>200</b> are switched on and off, based on the 3-bit phase control code <b>140</b>, to achieve the desired output phase. Each weighted current source <b>210</b> is comprised of two transistors. The top transistor in each set turns the current source on or off, based on the corresponding binary weight value, w. The bottom transistor in each set is controlled by a voltage bias, V<sub>bn</sub>, that serves to weight the current source appropriately. It is noted that the number adjacent each transistor, such as 24, indicates the transistor width for an exemplary FET implementation, and the Nx number, such as 4x, indicates the number of such FET transistors that are wired in parallel for binary weighting.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, when the 3-bit phase control code <b>140</b> has a value of 000, the weighted current sources <b>210</b>-<b>1</b><sub>L </sub>through <b>210</b>-<b>3</b><sub>L </sub>on the left side of the interpolator <b>200</b> are active and the current is applied to the input transistors <b>220</b>-L on the left side of the interpolator <b>200</b> (and the output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, will follow the phase of the input, A/Ā). Similarly, when the 3-bit phase control code <b>140</b> has a value of 111, the weighted current sources <b>210</b>-<b>1</b><sub>R </sub>through <b>210</b>-<b>3</b><sub>R </sub>on the right side of the interpolator <b>200</b> are active and the current is applied to the input transistors <b>220</b>-R on the right side of the interpolator <b>200</b> (and the output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, will follow the phase of the input, B/ <o ostyle="single">B</o>). For intermediate values of the 3-bit phase control code <b>140</b>, the current sources <b>210</b> are activated accordingly and an intermediate phase output is obtained at the output of the interpolator <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Generally, the interpolator <b>200</b> is implemented as two current mode logic (CML) buffers having cross-coupled outputs. Each CML buffer is comprised of tail current sources <b>210</b>, input devices <b>220</b> and load transistors <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The exemplary 3-bit interpolator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides 8 (2<sup>3</sup>) distinct phase levels (<b>0</b>Φ through <b>7</b>Φ). The architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be extended to provide 2<sup>N </sup>distinct phase levels for an N bit interpolation control signal, by adding an additional weighted current source <b>210</b> for each additional bit, for a total of N weighted current sources <b>210</b>. Thus, the power and area requirements of the interpolator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> increase linearly with the value of N.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an alternate implementation, 2<sup>N </sup>dedicated interpolators can be employed, each associated with one of 2<sup>N </sup>corresponding phase values. The current source associated with each of the 2<sup>N </sup>interpolators can remain active at all times when the overall interpolator is operational, and the current source corresponding to a desired phase can be selected. Thus, such an alternate implementation would not require switching current sources on and off to achieve a desired phase.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> selectively turns the current sources <b>210</b> on and off, based on the N bit interpolation control word <b>140</b>, to achieve a desired one of 2<sup>N </sup>phases. As previously indicated, when a given current source <b>210</b> is turned off, however, it takes time for the transistor drain to turn back on and reach steady state. With 90 nM transistor technology, for example, it has been found that the time it takes to switch from one phase to another phase exceeds 500 ps. Thus, a faster approach is needed for switching from one phase to another.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention recognizes that as data rate, power, and area requirements become more stringent, it becomes even more important for the interpolator <b>100</b> to provide fast-switching variable clock phases, and a highly linear phase interpolation transfer function, while utilizing less power and area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram of a phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b> incorporating features of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Generally, the exemplary phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> employs four weighted tail current sources <b>310</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>310</b>-<b>4</b>, via pairs of current steering switches <b>320</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>320</b>-<b>4</b>, similar to a high-speed digital-to-analog converter, to provide identical currents to both sides of the interpolator <b>300</b>, minimizing mismatch errors. The tail current sources <b>310</b> are always on, and the current is simply steered from one side to the other by the current steering switches <b>320</b>, providing fast phase switching. The phase-to-phase switching characteristic for the phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b> is discussed below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Each current steering switch <b>320</b> selectively passes current to a left or right-side input device <b>330</b>-L, <b>330</b>-R, based on the applied interpolation control word.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the exemplary four tail current sources <b>310</b> are optionally weighted according to a ratio of 3-2-2-1, which provides 8 equal phase increments. Binary weighting could also be used to provide 15 phase increments. It is noted that the same set of four tail current sources <b>310</b> drives both sides of the phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b>. Thus, there is no potential current source mismatch that will impair the linearity of the phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another aspect of the invention, the weighted input devices <b>330</b>-L and <b>330</b>-R on the left and right side of the phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b>, respectively, are each comprised of a plurality of weighted transistors. The weighting ratio in the exemplary embodiment is 3-2-2-1 as in the tail current sources, and the weighted input transistor is connected to a tail current source of similar weight. In this manner, the transistors do not see a large range of current from the current sources <b>320</b> and the gain of the input devices <b>330</b> can be scaled to improve linearity. Thus, the weighted input devices <b>330</b> provide constant gain for both sides of the interpolator <b>300</b> regardless of the weighting ratio chosen, resulting in high linearity of the phase interpolation transfer function.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to yet another aspect of the invention, an array of switch buffers <b>350</b> is provided to ensure that the transistors in the current steering switches <b>320</b> turn on and off at the same time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the exemplary array of switch buffers <b>350</b> is similar to a high speed digital-to-analog converter. The array of switch buffers <b>350</b> receives the interpolation control word and configures the transistors in the current steering switches <b>320</b> to steer the current to the left or right side input devices <b>330</b>, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The exemplary phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b> is an adjustable interpolator with a 4 bit adjustment range (PH[3:0]). The phase interpolator circuit <b>300</b> receives two differential inputs, A/Ā and B/ <o ostyle="single">B</o>, and generates an output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, that is the weighted sum of the input phases. The weighting ratio is determined by the 4-bit phase control input, PH[3:0]. For example, when the 4-bit phase control code has a value of 0000, the minimum phase is desired, and all the current from the weighted current sources <b>310</b> is steered by the current steering switches <b>320</b> to the left-side weighted input device <b>330</b>-L (and the output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, will follow the phase of the input, A/Ā). Similarly, when the 4-bit phase control code <b>140</b> has a value of 1111, the minimum phase is desired, and all the current from the weighted current sources <b>310</b> is steered by the current steering switches <b>320</b> to the right-side weighted input device <b>330</b>-R (and the output phase, Z/ <o ostyle="single">Z</o>, will follow the phase of the input, B/ <o ostyle="single">B</o>). For intermediate values of the 4-bit phase control code, the current from the weighted current sources <b>310</b> is steered by the current steering switches <b>320</b> to both the left and right side input devices <b>330</b>-L, <b>330</b>-R, in accordance with the weighting, and an intermediate phase output is obtained at the output of the interpolator <b>300</b>.</p>
