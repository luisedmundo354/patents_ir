<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a liquid dispensing system having a dispensing module and a gun manifold, the gun manifold includes a shelf portion that extends outwardly from its front face and the dispensing module includes a correspondingly shaped aperture configured to engage the shelf portion so that the dispensing module rests, or hangs, on the gun manifold without being held into place. From this position, the module can be easily and readily attached to the manifold. The shelf and aperture have complementary shapes and can be keyed so as to require the mating of the manifold and module in only one orientation. Additionally, an adaptor can be provided between the module and manifold so that smooth face manifolds and modules can still be coupled to corresponding manifolds and modules having shelves or apertures.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to liquid dispensing systems having separate components that are coupled together and, more particularly, to the manners in which such components are fastened together.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Viscous liquids or fluids are applied by dispensers onto a surface of a substrate in a variety of dispensing applications employed in the manufacture of products and product packaging. These viscous liquids include thermoplastic materials such as hot melt adhesives. Liquid dispensers utilize pneumatically or electrically actuated valve assemblies for metering a precise quantity of the viscous liquid and discharging the metered amount through a small-diameter dispensing orifice. Many thermoplastic materials exist in a solid form at room or ambient temperature and must be heated to create a flowable viscous liquid. Other hot melt adhesive materials are supplied as liquids at room temperature. A solid form of material is placed in a holding tank having heated walls and is melted by heating the solid material above its melting point. The viscous liquid is pumped in a molten state under pressure from the holding tank through a supply conduit to a manifold block. The manifold block has liquid passageways connected in fluid communication with the dispensing orifice of one or more liquid dispensers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dispensing module that includes the dispensing orifice is usually connected to the manifold block, sometimes referred to as a gun body or gun manifold, by way of screws or bolts that extend through the module and into threaded holes in the face of the gun manifold. In order for the liquid dispensing system to operate properly, this connection of the manifold with the module must be accomplished so that fluid or liquid ports on each of the manifold and module are properly aligned so as to provide leak-proof fluid communication between the two subassemblies or components. In the case of a pneumatically operated module and/or one which provides air-assisted liquid dispensing, cross-connection of an air port with an adhesive port must be avoided. Connecting the two subassemblies entails placing the module in its proper position and then, while holding the module steady, threading the connecting bolts through the module into the manifold. Misalignment may cause the adhesive to leak from the gun onto a conveying system and/or substrate as well as to leak into the air section of the module.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Oftentimes, operational or maintenance personnel will need to remove the module from the manifold for such purposes as cleaning or attaching a different module. Thus, a need exists for an interface between a dispensing module and a gun manifold that simplifies attachment of the module, prevents misalignment of the two subassemblies and their respective fluid ports during attachment, and prevents misconnecting the two subassemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is generally directed to an apparatus for dispensing liquid thermoplastic material, such as hot melt adhesive, including at least a first component which is configured for easier attachment and removal with respect to a second component of a dispensing system. More particularly, the first component includes a first side and at least one passageway for receiving the liquid thermoplastic material. The passageway includes an opening on the first side and the first component further includes a first interactive surface on the first side and configured as one of a recessed portion extending only partially into the first component or a projecting portion configured to extend only partially into the second component. The first interactive surface is adapted to cooperate with the second interactive surface on the second component and thereby either at least partially supports the first component on the second component or at least partially supports the second component on the first component, depending on which component receives the other component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The various components which may incorporate the interactive surfaces of the present invention include, for example, dispensing modules, gun manifolds, adaptors, or other liquid dispensing components of systems designed to dispense liquid thermoplastic material, such as hot melt adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the preferred embodiment, the first and second interactive surfaces cooperate to self-support one of the first and second components on the other of the first and second components. The first and second interactive surfaces have asymmetric shapes which cooperate for such self-support in one orientation but not when in an opposite orientation. The first and second components may include respective first and second air ports which align when the first and second interactive surfaces cooperate. The interactive surfaces may include asymmetrically curved surfaces which may further comprise curvilinear surfaces having different radii of curvature. The curvilinear surfaces may define either a recessed portion or a projecting portion therebetween. The recessed portion and the projecting portion may be generally bow-tie shaped, or may have various other shapes such as rectangular shapes, dovetail shapes or other shapes including angled surface portions or combinations of straight surfaces with curved surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Generally, a method for attaching the first component to the second component includes at least partially supporting one of the first and second components on the other of the first and second components by engaging the recessed portion of the first component with the projecting portion of the second component. First and second liquid ports, located on the same faces as the recessed and projecting portions, are aligned in fluid communication with each other. A separate fastener is then used to fasten the first component to the second component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It will be appreciated that the foregoing aspects of the invention are applicable to various types of dispensing systems, which may involve pneumatic or electric actuation. These various aspects are also applicable to various components of such systems which would benefit from the features described herein. These and other features, objects and advantages of the invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various terms of spatial reference and orientation are used throughout this specification, such as “vertical”, “upward”, “downward” and the like. Such terms are not to be construed in a limiting manner, but are merely used for the sake of clarity in describing the examples and embodiments of the invention described herein. For example, terms such as “vertically supported” mean that one component is capable of being supported in a vertical manner relative to another component, and not that it necessarily has to be supported in that manner in a given application.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a schematic view of an assembled liquid dispensing system, or gun, <b>100</b>. This system <b>100</b> is typically connected to a source of melted adhesive (not shown) and a pressurized air source (not shown). In packaging applications, such a gun <b>100</b> is mounted and a substrate moves in relation to the gun; in other applications, the gun <b>100</b> is mounted on a movable platform and controlled by a robot or other automated positioning system. In particular, a gun manifold <b>102</b> is connected with a dispensing module <b>104</b> that includes a dispensing orifice <b>106</b> to deliver adhesive or other liquid in a controlled manner. The dispensing orifice <b>106</b> may be located on a nozzle <b>107</b> carried by the module <b>104</b>. The manifold <b>102</b> may include a connector <b>108</b> that connects with a pressurized air source. Typical hot melt pneumatic adhesive guns operate in a range of between 40 to 70 psi. The manifold <b>102</b> also includes a connector <b>110</b> that connects with a source of pressurized liquid such as hot melt adhesive. Two passageways may exist within the manifold <b>102</b> to communicate liquid from the manifold <b>102</b> to the dispensing module <b>104</b>. The first passageway <b>112</b> provides the pressurized air to a corresponding passageway <b>116</b> in the module <b>104</b>. Similarly, the passageway <b>114</b> provides the liquid to a corresponding passageway <b>118</b> in the module <b>104</b>. In addition to these passageways <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, the gun <b>100</b> may include a number of other passageways that are not shown. For example, electrical connections may be provided within the module <b>104</b> and the manifold <b>102</b>; also, other exhaust and intake ports may be present to provide such features as “swirl-air” that are used to control the dispensing pattern of the module <b>104</b>. Thus, a skilled artisan would recognize that the gun <b>100</b> may include a number of internal features and passageways such as those found in dispensing pneumatic guns distributed by the present Assignee under such product models as H100, H200, H400, CF200 and H20, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An interface <b>120</b> exists where the passageways <b>112</b> and <b>116</b> meet and another interface <b>122</b> exists where the passageways <b>114</b> and <b>118</b> meet. Each of these interfaces <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> typically include two matching openings (one on the manifold <b>102</b> and the other on the module <b>104</b>) that mate together to permit fluid communication between the respective passageways. An O-ring <b>121</b>, <b>123</b> or other gasket-like element is often included at the interfaces <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> to help provide a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The module <b>104</b> further provides a dispensing chamber <b>124</b> that receives the air and the liquid, respectively, from the passageways <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. From the dispensing chamber <b>124</b>, the liquid, such as hot melt adhesive, is controllably released through the dispensing orifice <b>106</b> typically by air actuation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The manifold <b>102</b> and the module <b>104</b> are held together in place using the bolt <b>126</b>. Typically two bolts are used, although only one is visible in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Through the passageway <b>128</b>, the bolt <b>126</b> passes through the module <b>104</b> and engages threads at the end of the passageway <b>128</b> within the manifold <b>102</b>. In this configuration, a face <b>132</b> of the module <b>104</b> is put in contact with a corresponding face <b>130</b> of the manifold <b>102</b>. For purposes of orientation, the face <b>130</b> is referred to as the front face of the manifold <b>102</b> and the face <b>132</b> is referred to as the rear face of the module <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The manifold <b>102</b> additionally includes a projecting portion <b>140</b> that extends outwardly from its face <b>130</b>. The module <b>104</b> includes a complementary shaped recessed portion, or channel, <b>142</b> on its face <b>132</b> that cooperates with the shape of the projecting portion <b>140</b>. Together, these two features permit the module <b>104</b> to be retained by the manifold or to hang or rest from the manifold <b>102</b> even without the bolt <b>126</b> being present. The module <b>104</b>, therefore, is supported in the vertical direction by the manifold <b>102</b>. The recessed portion <b>142</b> and the projecting portion <b>140</b> are advantageously shaped so that the module <b>104</b> is self-supported by the manifold <b>102</b> in the vertical direction, or in other words, the module <b>104</b> hangs from the manifold <b>102</b> without additional support. With the module <b>104</b> and the manifold <b>102</b> so aligned, the module <b>104</b> does not need to be held in place by an operator when threading the bolt <b>126</b> through the passageway <b>128</b>. Bolts <b>126</b> extend through holes in the components (such as manifold <b>102</b> and module <b>104</b>) that may or may not open onto the recessed portion or projecting portion (such as recessed portion <b>142</b> or projecting portion <b>140</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The recessed portion <b>142</b> and projection portion <b>140</b> may alternatively be configured so as to provide substantial vertical support but still require slight steadying of the module <b>104</b> by an operator. Thus, while the module <b>104</b> may not freely hang, it is supported enough so that it does not require the operator to hold the module in a proper position while trying to attach the module <b>104</b> to the manifold <b>102</b>. Instead, the projecting portion <b>140</b> and the recessed portion act to align the module <b>104</b> and manifold <b>102</b> so that with one hand the operator may steady the module <b>104</b> while, with the other hand, easily attach bolts or other retaining devices. Accordingly, the embodiments of the present invention described herein contemplate modules and manifolds that cooperate to support a module in the vertical direction and, advantageously, cooperate to self-support the module in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Regardless of whether the module <b>104</b> freely hangs or requires some additional operator steadying, through the interaction of the projecting portion <b>140</b> and the recessed portion <b>142</b>, the interface <b>120</b> between the air passageways <b>116</b> and <b>112</b> is properly aligned and the interface <b>122</b> between the liquid passageways <b>114</b> and <b>118</b> is aligned as well. As described in more detail herein with additional embodiments of the present invention, the projection portion <b>140</b> and recessed portion <b>142</b>, in the event of a seal failure or other leak, may act as a dam to prevent adhesive from reaching the air passageway <b>116</b> of the module <b>104</b> and also may include a channel or similar area to permit adhesive to be diverted from the module <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The projecting portion <b>140</b> and the recessed portion <b>142</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are exemplary in nature and many alternative configurations are possible. The present invention contemplates a variety of interactive, complementary surfaces and shapes that permit the module <b>104</b> to be temporarily retained by the manifold <b>102</b>. In general, the front face <b>130</b> of the manifold <b>102</b> will include one or more interactive surfaces and the rear face <b>132</b> of the module <b>104</b> will include complimentary interactive surfaces. When the front face <b>130</b> and the rear face <b>132</b> are positioned together, the interactive surfaces will communicate with one another and cooperate so as to permit the module <b>104</b> to be self-supporting in the vertical direction in relationship to the manifold <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> illustrate an exemplary module according to another embodiment of the present invention. The following description of the module <b>202</b> focuses on its rear face <b>201</b> that mates to a gun manifold (not shown) and, in particular, the recessed feature <b>212</b>. However, it is understood that the gun module <b>202</b> may include all the internal and external features typically present in hot melt pneumatic adhesive guns.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The module <b>202</b> includes a threaded extension <b>218</b> for receiving a nozzle (not shown) for dispensing liquid and a rear face <b>201</b> that mates with a gun manifold (not shown). Screw holes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are included to permit the module <b>202</b> to be attached to the gun manifold. The rear face <b>201</b> of the exemplary module <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> includes a port <b>204</b> to an air passage way and a port <b>206</b> to a liquid passageway. In this particular example, each port <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> has a surrounding indentation <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, respectively, that accommodates an O-ring (not shown) between the module <b>202</b> and the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A recessed portion <b>212</b> is present between the air port <b>204</b> and the liquid port <b>206</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the recessed portion <b>212</b> resembles a “bow-tie” in that it has a narrow central region that flares outwardly on each side. It will be appreciated that the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are further examples of bow-tie shapes. Recessed portion <b>212</b> includes a top curved portion <b>240</b> and a bottom curved portion <b>242</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> provides a side view that highlights the shape of the recessed portion <b>212</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> provides a detailed view of the recessed portion <b>212</b>. In particular, the top curved portion <b>240</b> includes an undercut region <b>220</b> that extends to form a lip <b>226</b> while the bottom curved portion <b>242</b> includes its own undercut portion <b>222</b> that extends to form a lip <b>224</b>. The lip <b>226</b> permits the module <b>202</b> to be self-supporting in the vertical direction, as oriented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, when it is placed on a gun manifold (not shown) having a complementary projecting portion. Thus, the module <b>202</b> will temporarily be retained by, or hang from, the manifold until bolts or other retainers can be inserted in the openings <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>. Opposed surfaces of lips <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> may be chamfered or angled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> to aid in mating the module <b>202</b> with another component.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In those instances in which the module may be configured to dispense in an upward direction, it would be coupled to a manifold in an orientation opposite to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Accordingly, in such an orientation, the lip <b>224</b> (not lip <b>226</b>) would interact with a complementary projecting portion of the manifold so as to hold the module <b>202</b> on the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The top curved portion <b>240</b> and the bottom curved portion <b>242</b> may have the same or may have different radii of curvature. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, the curved portions <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> have different radii of curvature. Accordingly, the complementary projecting portion of the manifold (not shown) will have appropriately shaped complimentary curved portions. As a result of this asymmetry, the module <b>202</b> will properly mate with the manifold in only one orientation. Thus, the recessed portion <b>212</b> of the module <b>202</b> can be considered “keyed” such that it operates to correctly orient the module <b>202</b> and, thereby, prevent an operator from inadvertently flipping the module <b>202</b> when attaching it to a manifold. The curved portions <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> also act to properly align the module <b>202</b> with the gun manifold. Because of the curved shape, the module is urged towards proper side-to-side alignment. Thus, the openings <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> will be aligned with their corresponding openings on the gun manifold. Similarly, the bolt holes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> will be properly aligned as well.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> illustrate and exemplary gun manifold configured to be coupled with the module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> in accordance with principles of the present invention. The manifold <b>302</b> differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that the opening <b>304</b> for the air passageway is located on the top of the manifold <b>302</b>. There is also a region <b>318</b> within the manifold for electrical features such as a heating element and controls (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The manifold <b>302</b> includes a front face <b>308</b> that mates with a gun module such as one similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. A recess <b>308</b><i>a </i>may be provided to accommodate one or more screw heads <b>202</b><i>a </i>associated with the module. Holes <b>314</b> and <b>316</b> match similarly placed holes on a gun module and permit bolts or other retaining means to be used to secure the manifold <b>302</b> to a gun module. The front face <b>308</b> also includes an opening <b>310</b> to an air passageway and an opening <b>312</b> to a liquid passageway. Through these openings <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, air and liquid, respectively, are introduced into an attached gun module.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A portion <b>306</b>, projects outwardly from the surface of the front face <b>308</b>. The exemplary projecting portion <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> has a narrow neck that curves outwardly to a thicker wing on each side. Thus, there is a top curved portion <b>340</b> and a bottom curved portion <b>342</b>. Similar to the complementary regions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, these curved portions <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> are shown with different radii of curvature; however, alternative embodiments contemplate having the same radius of curvature for each curved portion <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The side cut-away view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> more clearly shows the profile of the projecting portion <b>306</b>. This view also illustrates the opening <b>320</b> through which liquid, such as adhesive or its precursor, is introduced into the manifold <b>302</b>. The detailed view of encircled area <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows that the projecting portion <b>306</b> includes an undercut portion <b>330</b> along its top edge and an undercut portion <b>332</b> along its bottom edge. Thus, these undercut portions <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> create a projecting portion <b>306</b> that has a “T-shaped” profile <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> illustrates the module <b>202</b> and the manifold <b>302</b> assembled together. The air connection is not shown; however, an electrical cable <b>356</b> and fluid coupling <b>354</b> are depicted. Furthermore, a cover <b>352</b>, secured by bolts <b>350</b>, is shown that covers the region <b>318</b> and an exemplary gun mounting assembly <b>360</b> is depicted as well. When the module <b>202</b> is placed on the manifold <b>302</b>, its recessed portion <b>212</b> cooperates with the projecting portion <b>306</b> so that the module is retained by, or hangs from, the manifold <b>302</b>. While in such a position, an operator can attach bolts <b>370</b> and <b>372</b> to more permanently secure the module <b>202</b> to the manifold <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref> depict a number of variations of how the rear face of a gun module can be shaped so that it interacts with a complementary front face of a manifold. Although, the assemblies within this series of figures are being referred to as examples of a module, these shapes could just as easily be used as examples for the manifold or other liquid dispensing components. The present invention contemplates an interface between the module and the manifold that permits the module to be retained by, or hang from, the manifold. The exemplary shapes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref> will permit such hanging of the module, regardless of whether they are implemented on the manifold or the module. Additionally, these figures do not explicitly illustrate the complementary surfaces that would interact with the illustrated examples, as one of ordinary skill would recognize that any complementary surface would include an appropriately shaped projecting portion corresponding to each illustrated recessed portion and an appropriately shaped recessed portion corresponding to each illustrated projecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similar to the exemplary modules described earlier, the module <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes an air opening <b>204</b> and a liquid opening <b>206</b> along with bolt holes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>. In fact, all the various modules hereinafter described include these features even if not explicitly described. The portion <b>412</b> surrounding the air opening <b>204</b> is sized to fit an O-ring or other gasket (not shown). Similarly, the region <b>408</b> surrounding the liquid opening <b>206</b> is sized for an O-ring (not shown) as well. However, the region <b>408</b> includes an annular protrusion <b>410</b> immediately surrounding the opening <b>206</b>. In some instances, liquid passing through the opening <b>206</b> may attach to the O-ring and act to dislocate the O-ring or to pull it within the opening <b>206</b>. The annular protrusion <b>210</b> separates the liquid and the O-ring thereby ensuring that the O-ring remains in position. The indented regions <b>412</b> and <b>408</b> may be formed so as not to substantially contribute to retaining the module <b>402</b> on a manifold (not shown) or they can be cut into the module <b>402</b> to a depth that does interact with a corresponding annular protuberance on the manifold so as to provide additional resting surfaces on which to hang the module <b>402</b>. The recessed portion <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> resembles the bow-tie shape <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> that helps properly align the openings <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> of the module <b>402</b>. As explained earlier, the recessed portion <b>404</b> may also be “keyed” so as to prevent the module <b>402</b> from being improperly positioned on a gun manifold (not shown). The recessed portion <b>404</b> of the module <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and the other alternative embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-24</figref>, may include a lip portion (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) or may have a smooth profile.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The module <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a recessed portion <b>504</b> that is a horizontally extending region having substantially the same width <b>506</b> along its entire length. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the module <b>602</b> includes a recessed portion <b>604</b> substantially along its entire top half. As a result, the angled surface <b>608</b> appears to protrude from the module <b>602</b>. This angled surface <b>608</b> would effectively interact with a corresponding protruding portion on a manifold if the module <b>602</b> was placed in an orientation such that it dispensed upwards. The annular portion <b>606</b> provides a mating surface between the module <b>602</b> and a manifold (not shown). When bolted together as an assembly, the surface <b>606</b> would form a seal with the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The module <b>702</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, includes a recessed portion resembling a bow-tie as well. However, instead of smoothly curved portions, the recessed portion <b>704</b> is defined by angled portions <b>710</b> and <b>712</b>. As before, these angled portions <b>710</b>, <b>712</b> may be shaped different from one another to provide a “keyed” module. The module <b>802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has a recessed portion <b>804</b> in which the curved portions <b>808</b>, <b>810</b> are more circular than previously described bow-tie recessed portions. The module <b>902</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> resembles the horizontally extending region <b>504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> but includes the additional features <b>908</b> and <b>910</b>. These features <b>908</b> and <b>910</b> provide a relatively small indent into the recessed portion <b>904</b>. As a result, the module <b>902</b> will automatically be urged into alignment when placed on a complimentary manifold (not shown). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the exemplary module <b>1002</b> includes two recessed portion <b>1004</b> and <b>1006</b> positioned side-by-side that flare outwardly towards the sides of the module <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is substantially similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> except for the location of the respective liquid openings. The liquid opening <b>508</b> of the module <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is located off-center to the annular region <b>510</b> similar to opening <b>206</b> in annular region <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In contrast, however, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the liquid opening <b>1204</b> is centered within the surrounding annular region <b>1206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In many of the configurations illustrated herein, the manifold will include a complementary shaped projecting portion. When the manifold and the module are coupled together, this projecting portion separates the air port and the liquid port. More particularly, the projecting portion and recess portion create a dam-like structure between the two ports. Thus, even if an O-ring should fail or liquid should leak from the manifold, the dam will help prevent the adhesive from reaching the air port and damaging the module. Additionally, the recessed portions may be shaped to provide exit paths for any liquid that might escape from the liquid port. In particular, as these recessed portions are sloped downwards from their centers, any liquid entering the channel would have a tendency to migrate outwardly to the edges of the modules and not towards the air port.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">One embodiment of the present invention relates to a dispensing module that can continue to interact with legacy, or old style, gun manifolds. These manifolds typically have a smoothly machined front surface that mates to a smoothly machined rear face of a dispensing module. As modules with hanging features become more popular, it is still worthwhile to have these new types of modules interact with an old-style manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A legacy manifold <b>2502</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> having a smooth front face <b>2516</b> with no projecting portions. This manifold <b>2502</b> includes, along with a number of other features not shown, an air supply connector <b>2512</b> and a liquid supply connector <b>2514</b>. The module <b>2504</b> includes a rear face having a recessed portion <b>2518</b> and a dispensing nozzle <b>2510</b>. This recessed portion <b>2518</b> does not necessarily interfere with the module <b>2504</b> being securely fastened to the manifold <b>2502</b>. The module <b>2504</b> may simply be mounted to the manifold <b>2502</b> using one or more bolts <b>2508</b> such that the smooth contacting surfaces, and O-rings if present, sealingly couple the module <b>2502</b> and manifold <b>2504</b>. This arrangement, however, would not take benefit of the retaining, or hanging, feature offered by the module <b>2504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An adaptor <b>2506</b> can be used, therefore, in between the manifold <b>2502</b> and the module <b>2504</b>. The adaptor <b>2506</b> attaches to the manifold <b>2502</b> and provides a projecting portion <b>2519</b> on which to hang or otherwise at least partially support one or more modules <b>2504</b>. Typically, the adaptor <b>2506</b> would utilize a bolt <b>2520</b> and one or more existing mounting holes <b>2521</b> to connect with the manifold <b>2502</b>. For example, the adaptor <b>2506</b> could use the original holes used to mount a module while providing alternative holes which a module could then use. One of ordinary skill would envision many alternative ways to connect one or more modules <b>2504</b>, the adaptor <b>2506</b>, and the manifold <b>2502</b>, including the use of a long bolt <b>2508</b> through at least one of the original mounting holes <b>2521</b>. Similar to the arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, recessed portion <b>2518</b> is shaped complementary to the projecting portion <b>2519</b> and permits the module <b>2504</b> to hang from the manifold <b>2502</b>. In this way, a new style module <b>2504</b> can operate with an older-style manifold <b>2502</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows an exploded view of the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As alternative to the adaptor <b>2506</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the adaptor <b>2606</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> can be used to permit a new style manifold <b>2602</b> to be used with an older style module <b>2604</b>. The older style module <b>2604</b> includes a dispensing nozzle <b>2610</b> and a smooth rear face <b>2616</b> with no recessed region. In this instance, the adaptor <b>2606</b> includes a recessed portion <b>2618</b> that matches a projecting portion <b>2619</b> on the front face of the manifold <b>2602</b>. As seen before, the recessed portion <b>2618</b> permits the module <b>2604</b> to temporarily be retained by, or hang from, the manifold <b>2602</b>. In operation, for example, the module <b>2604</b> is connected with the adaptor <b>2606</b> through one or more bolts <b>2608</b>. The module <b>2604</b> and the adaptor <b>2606</b> is then hung from the projecting portion <b>2619</b> so that the bolt <b>2608</b> can be fully tightened within the passageway, or mounting hole, <b>2621</b>. Accordingly, in this manner, older-style modules <b>2604</b> can be modified to operate with newer-style manifolds <b>2602</b>. Alternatively, the original bolts associated with module <b>2604</b> may be replaced with longer bolts and components <b>2602</b>, <b>2604</b> and <b>2606</b> may be stacked or assembled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> and new longer bolts may be used to secure them together. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The adaptors <b>2506</b> and <b>2606</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 13A</figref> may be shaped so as to conform to any of the recessed shapes (or complimentary projecting portions) illustrated herein for purposes of supporting liquid dispensing components such as modules, manifolds, adaptors, or any other similar components. Thus, with the use of the appropriate adaptor, legacy equipment can be adapted so as to provide the dam-like structure to prevent contamination of the air passageway with liquid, the keying feature to prevent mis-orienting a module on a manifold, and the self-alignment feature to align the corresponding passageways of the manifold and module. In addition, adaptors constructed in accordance with the invention may be used to allow easy changeover of multiple modules coupled with a single adaptor with other modules on another adaptor which may be different in number and/or spacing, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the previously described embodiments, the recessed portions of the various modules have been located between the air port and the liquid port. However, other embodiments of the present invention contemplate locating the recessed region in other portions of a module's rear face as well. For example, the module <b>2702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> includes a recessed portion <b>2704</b> located near the top of the module <b>2702</b>. As before, the module <b>2702</b> includes an air port <b>2708</b>, a liquid port <b>2710</b> and bolt holes <b>2712</b>, <b>2714</b>. In this example, however, the recessed portion <b>2704</b> is not located between the ports <b>2708</b>, <b>2710</b>. As recessed portion <b>2704</b> will interact with a complimentary projecting portion of a manifold (not shown) to permit the module <b>2702</b> to be retained by, or to hang from, the manifold. The profile shape of the recessed portion <b>2704</b> resembles a dovetail having edges that flare away from each other; however, alternative embodiments may include a recessed portion having edges substantially parallel with one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts a module <b>2802</b> having a recessed portion <b>2804</b> similar in shape to that of recessed portion <b>2704</b> but located near the bottom of the module <b>2802</b> instead of the top. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a module <b>2902</b> having two recessed portions <b>2904</b> and <b>2906</b> located at opposite ends of the module <b>2902</b>. The profiles of the recessed portions <b>2904</b> and <b>2906</b> may be similar or may be different so as to prevent mis-orienting the module <b>2902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The modules of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref> include recessed portions that are “rabbet shaped”. The module <b>3002</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, includes the rabbet portion <b>3004</b> along its top edge while the module <b>3102</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, includes the rabbet portion <b>3104</b> along its bottom edge. The module <b>3202</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, includes one rabbet <b>3204</b> along its top edge as well as another rabbet <b>3206</b> along its bottom edge. These rabbet portions are configured to receive complementary shaped projecting portions on a manifold (not shown) in accordance with the inventive principles.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref> illustrate an exemplary module according to another embodiment of the present invention. The following description of the module <b>3302</b> focuses on its rear face <b>3301</b> that mates to a gun manifold (not shown) and, in particular, the recessed feature <b>3312</b>. However, it is understood that the gun module <b>3302</b> may include all the internal and external features typically present in hot melt pneumatic or electric adhesive guns.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The module <b>3302</b> includes screw holes <b>3308</b>, <b>3310</b> to permit the module <b>3302</b> to be attached to the gun manifold. The rear face <b>3301</b> of the exemplary module <b>3302</b> includes a port <b>3304</b> to an air passageway and a port <b>3306</b> to a liquid passageway. In this particular example, each port <b>3304</b>, <b>3306</b> has a surrounding indentation <b>3314</b>, <b>3316</b>, respectively, that accommodates an O-ring (not shown) between the module <b>3302</b> and the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A recessed portion <b>3312</b> is present between the air port <b>3304</b> and the liquid port <b>3306</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the recessed portion <b>3312</b> resembles a “bow-tie” in that it has a narrow central region that flares outwardly on each side. Thus, there is a top curved portion <b>3340</b> and a curved bottom portion <b>3342</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> provides a side view that highlights the shape of the recessed portion <b>3312</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> provides a detailed view of the recessed portion <b>3312</b>. In particular, the top curved portion <b>3340</b> includes an undercut region <b>3320</b> that extends to form a lip <b>3326</b> while the bottom curved portion <b>3342</b> includes its own undercut portion <b>3322</b> that extends to form a lip <b>3324</b>. The lip <b>3326</b> permits the module <b>3302</b> to be self-supporting in the vertical direction, as oriented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref>, when it is placed on a gun manifold (not shown) having a complementary projecting portion. Thus, the module <b>3302</b> will temporarily be retained by, or hang from, the manifold until bolts or other retainers can be inserted in the openings <b>3308</b> and <b>3310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The module <b>3302</b> is substantially similar to the module <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> except for the lips <b>3326</b> and <b>3324</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, the analogous lip <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> slant away from the rear face <b>201</b>. The module <b>3302</b> has lips <b>3324</b>, <b>3326</b> that are substantially perpendicular to the face <b>3301</b> of the module <b>3301</b>. If used with a manifold having a complimentary shaped projecting portion, the relatively flat surface of the lips <b>3324</b>, <b>3326</b> provide more surface area to frictionally engage the manifold than the slanted lips <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In those instances in which the module may be configured to dispense in an upward direction, it would be coupled to a manifold in an orientation opposite to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Accordingly, in such an orientation, the lip <b>3324</b> (not lip <b>3326</b>) would interact with a complementary projecting portion of the manifold so as to hold the module <b>3302</b> on the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The top curved portion <b>3340</b> and the bottom curved portion <b>3342</b> may have the same or may have different radii of curvature. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref>, the curved portions <b>3340</b>, <b>3342</b> have different radii of curvature. Accordingly, the complementary projecting portion of the manifold (not shown) will have appropriately shaped complimentary curved portions. As a result of this asymmetry, the module <b>3302</b> will properly mate with the manifold in only one orientation. Thus, the recessed portion <b>3312</b> of the module <b>3302</b> can be considered “keyed” such that it operates to correctly orient the module <b>3302</b> and, thereby, prevent an operator from inadvertently flipping the module <b>3302</b> when attaching it to a manifold. The curved portions <b>3340</b>, <b>3342</b> also act to properly align the module <b>3302</b> with the gun manifold. Because of the curved shape, the module is urged towards proper side-to-side alignment. Thus, the openings <b>3304</b> and <b>3306</b> will be aligned with their corresponding openings on the gun manifold. Similarly, the holes <b>3308</b>, <b>3310</b> will be properly aligned as well.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates an exemplary module according to another embodiment of the present invention. The module <b>3602</b> is similar in many respects to the module <b>3302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>; accordingly, most of the features of module <b>3602</b> will only be briefly described. The rear face <b>3601</b> of the exemplary module <b>3602</b> includes a port <b>3604</b> to one air passageway and a second port <b>3605</b> to another air passageway. In some dispensing modules, a piston is actuated by pressurized air so as to move the piston in one direction. The movement of the piston is translated into movement of a needle within the module so as to control dispensing of liquid from the module. In such a module, a spring is typically provided that urges the piston in an opposite direction. As an alternative, a dispensing module may include a piston that does not use a spring but, instead, uses respectively applied air to move the piston in both the up and down direction. The module <b>3602</b> is an example of the latter type of dispensing module and, therefore, includes the port <b>3604</b> to provide air to move the piston down and the port <b>3605</b> to provide air to move the piston up. As in the previous embodiments, a port <b>3306</b> is included to a liquid passageway. In this particular example, each port <b>3604</b>, <b>3605</b>, <b>3606</b> has a surrounding indentation, respectively, that accommodates an O-ring (not shown) between the module <b>3602</b> and the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A recessed portion <b>3612</b> is present between the air ports <b>3604</b>, <b>3605</b> and the liquid port <b>3606</b>. The recessed portion <b>3612</b> is substantially similar to the “bow-tie” portion <b>3312</b> described earlier. Thus, there is a top curved portion <b>3640</b> and a bottom curved portion <b>3642</b>. In particular, the top curved portion <b>3640</b> includes an undercut region <b>3620</b> that extends to form a top lip while the bottom curved portion <b>3642</b> includes its own undercut portion <b>3622</b> that extends to form a bottom lip. Similar to the lips <b>3324</b>, <b>3326</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the top and bottom lips of the module <b>3602</b> are substantially perpendicular to the face <b>3601</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. However, use of lips similar to the slanted lips <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> is contemplated as well.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates a manifold <b>4002</b> that is adapted for use with multiple dispensing modules. An exemplary application of such a manifold <b>4002</b> would be in the production of non-woven materials such as that used in manufacturing diapers. The manifold <b>4002</b> includes five sections (a, b, c, d, e and f) that may be substantially the same. One of ordinary skill will recognize that fewer or more sections may be used to accommodate a number of different modules. The features of section a are explicitly described below; however, each of the other section b-f have similar features as well. An opening or port <b>4004</b> is provided that receives pressurized air and provides it in a controlled manner to a dispensing module via a port <b>4006</b>. Port <b>4010</b> is a liquid port that supplies liquid, such as hot melt adhesive, to a dispensing module. The port <b>4012</b> also supplies air to the dispensing module. However, this air is not typically used to actuate the dispensing of liquid but, instead, is used to affect the characteristics of the liquid being dispensed such as, for example, swirl-air. One of ordinary skill will recognize that the described ports for liquid and air are exemplary in nature and different configurations as known in this art may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, additional ports may be included to allow recirculation of liquid from the dispensing module.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Attachment holes <b>4008</b> and <b>4009</b> are included on the manifold <b>4002</b> to permit a dispensing module to be bolted, or otherwise attached, to the manifold <b>4002</b>. In addition, a projecting portion <b>4005</b> is provided that engages a complimentary shaped recessed portion of the dispensing module. In this way, the projecting portion <b>4005</b> supports the dispensing module in a vertical direction even before bolts are used to attach the dispensing module to the manifold <b>4002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a detailed view of the projecting portion <b>4005</b> and illustrates that the projecting portion <b>4005</b> has a bow-tie shape as described previously herein that includes two different radii of curvature in order to provide a “keyed” operation. Five of these projecting portions are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, thereby allowing five different dispensing modules to be attached to the manifold <b>4002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a cross-section view of the manifold <b>4002</b>. In this cross-sectional view, passageways to the different ports are depicted. For example passageway <b>4020</b> communicates with port <b>4006</b>, passageway <b>4022</b> communicates with port <b>4010</b>, and passageway <b>4024</b> communicates with port <b>4012</b>. The profile of the projecting portion <b>4005</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> and includes an upper surface <b>4030</b> and a lower surface <b>4032</b> that projects outwardly from, and substantially parallel to, the face <b>4001</b> of the manifold <b>4002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The exemplary manifolds and modules described herein may be manufactured in a variety of ways. For example, a manifold such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> may initially be formed with a rectangular ledge that protrudes from the face <b>308</b>. Subsequent, separate fabrication steps machine the face <b>308</b> so that it is within tolerances to sealingly mate with a dispensing module and machine the ledge to create the profile of the projecting portion <b>306</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> depicts a manifold with a projecting portion manufactured according to an alternative fabrication method. In particular, manifold <b>4102</b> initially includes a face <b>4104</b> having a substantially flat surface. During the manufacturing process, material is machined away from the face <b>4104</b> to create an upper recessed region <b>4106</b> and a lower recessed region <b>4108</b>. These regions <b>4106</b>, <b>4108</b> correspond to the surfaces which will mate with a dispensing module. Removal of the material effectively creates a projecting portion <b>4114</b> having an upper lip <b>4110</b> and a lower lip <b>4112</b>. During the removal process, the profile of the upper and lower lips <b>4110</b>, <b>4112</b> can be machined as well to create the features described herein, for example, with respect to FIG. <b>3</b>C. As a result the manufacturing process for forming the projecting portion of the manifold is simplified, improved, and more economical.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additionally, the machined portion <b>4025</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, on the manifold is formed according to the fabrication method used to produce the recessed region (<b>308</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A and 4001</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) within allowable tolerance. Portion <b>4025</b> is not formed however when alternative machining methods and/or cutting tools are followed such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred embodiments and while these embodiments has been described in some detail, it is not the intention of the Applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art.
