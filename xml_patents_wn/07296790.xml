<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-81735 titled “Automatic Document Feeding Apparatus,” filed on Nov. 18, 2003, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an automatic document feeding apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to an automatic document feeding apparatus having an automatic document feeding (ADF) roller designed to transmit power only in one direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, a document feeding apparatus in a telecopy machine, a copy machine, a scanner, and a digital compound machine is used to feed documents stacked in a feeding base to reading means for reading image information printed or written down on the documents.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional automatic document feeding apparatus. As shown in the drawing, a conventional automatic document feeding apparatus includes a shaft <b>2</b> rotated by driving means (not shown) connected to a gear <b>3</b>, an ADF roller <b>3</b> installed on the shaft <b>2</b>, and separating means <b>4</b> for separating documents D sheet by sheet. A feed roller <b>5</b> for feeding the documents at a predetermined speed is provided on a front end of the ADF roller <b>3</b>. The feeding speed of the ADF roller <b>3</b> is identical to or less than that of the feed roller <b>5</b>. In general, the feeding speed of the ADF roller <b>3</b> is slightly less than that of the feed roller <b>5</b>. Therefore, when the feed roller <b>5</b> starts feeding the documents D fed to a feeding base <b>1</b> by the ADF roller <b>3</b>, the document D may be torn between the ADF roller <b>3</b> and the feed roller <b>5</b> due to the difference in the feeding speed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve this problem, a clutch (not shown) is provided in the automatic document feeding apparatus. That is, when the shaft <b>2</b> rotates in a first direction where the document D is fed, the clutch is engaged with the ADF roller <b>3</b> and transmits a torque to the ADF roller <b>3</b>, and when the shaft <b>2</b> rotates in a second direction opposite to the first direction, the clutch is disconnected from the ADF roller and the torque from the shaft <b>2</b> is not transmitted. When the feed roller <b>5</b> starts feeding the document D, the ADF roller <b>3</b> rotates faster than the shaft <b>2</b>. At this point, since the shaft <b>2</b> is disconnected from the ADF roller <b>3</b> by the clutch, the ADF roller <b>3</b> can smoothly rotate in response to the feeding speed of the feed roller <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, while the feed roller <b>5</b> is feeding the document D, the document D may be jammed. In this case, the jammed document D may be removed by pulling a front end of the document D in a direction A. At this point, the jammed document D is removed as the ADF roller <b>3</b> smoothly slips on the shaft <b>2</b>. Alternatively, in case of pulling a rear end of the jammed document D to remove the jammed document D, the clutch is operated in an opposite direction such that the ADF roller <b>3</b> rotates the shaft <b>2</b> in the second direction. At this point, since the shaft <b>2</b> is connected to the driving means by a plurality of reduction gears, the ADF roller <b>3</b> rotates against a relatively large amount of resistance. As a result, it becomes difficult to remove the jammed document D, and, in the worst case, the jammed document D may be torn.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The automatic document feeding apparatus may further include a pickup roller <b>7</b> for picking up the document D and feeding the same to the ADF roller <b>3</b>. The pickup roller <b>7</b> contacts the document D only when picking up the document D. That is, when the pickup operation is completed, the pickup roller <b>7</b> moves away from the document D. The pickup roller <b>7</b> is installed on a bracket <b>8</b> rotatably coupled on the shaft <b>2</b>. In order to rotate the bracket <b>8</b>, the driving means should be designed to bi-directionally rotate. However, the direction change of the driving means slows down the document feeding speed, thereby reducing the number of documents fed per unit of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide an automatic document feeding apparatus that can easily remove a jammed document regardless of a pulling direction of the jammed document.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, embodiments of the present invention provide an automatic document feeding apparatus that is designed to prevent the reduction of the document feeding speed, which may be caused by a direction change of the driving means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an automatic document feeding apparatus comprising a shaft; an ADF roller which feeds documents sheet by sheet by cooperating with separating means, the ADF roller being mounted on the shaft such that the ADF roller can rotate by receiving a torque only in a first direction from the shaft; and power switching means which selectively connects driving means with the shaft, the power switching means being installed on the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The automatic document feeding apparatus may further comprise a pickup roller which picks up the documents stacked in a feeding base by receiving the torque only in the first direction from the shaft; a bracket rotatably mounted on the shaft, the pickup roller being installed on the bracket; clutching means which transmits the torque of the shaft to the bracket when the shaft rotates in the first direction and does not transmit the torque of the shaft to the bracket when the shaft rotates in a second direction; and an elastic member which biases the bracket in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the present invention, the clutching means may comprise a clutch spring fitted on a first cylindrical projection formed on the shaft and a second cylindrical projection formed on the bracket by first fitting force to allow the bracket to rotate in the first direction, the clutch spring having a first end inserted in a first insertion groove provided on the bracket; a clutch cover which encloses the clutch spring, the clutch cover being provided with a second groove in which a second end of the clutch spring is inserted and a circumferential projection; and a stopper contacting the circumferential projection so as to prevent the clutch spring from rotating in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The bracket may be provided with a plurality of the first insertion grooves for adjusting the first fitting force, and the clutch cover is provided with a plurality of the second insertion grooves for adjusting the first fitting force.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The stopper may be provided on the bracket. The power switching means is designed to disconnect the driving means with the shaft when the document is jammed.</p>

Reference numerals <b>109</b>A and <b>109</b>B respectively indicate first and second detecting sensors for detecting the documents D. That is, the first detecting sensor <b>109</b>A detects the documents D picked up from the feeding base <b>101</b> to determine start timing for aligning a front end of the document D on the feed roller <b>106</b>. The second detecting sensor <b>109</b>B detects the front end of the document fed by the feed roller <b>106</b> to determine start timing for reading the document by the reading means <b>107</b>. The second detecting sensor <b>109</b>B further detects a rear end of the document D to determine if the discharge of the document D is completed. The reference numerals <b>108</b> and <b>102</b> respectively indicate a discharging roller and a tray for stacking the documents D discharged by the discharging roller <b>108</b>. For stable document feeding, a pickup roller <b>103</b> for picking up the documents stacked in the feeding base <b>101</b> and feeding the same between the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the separating member <b>105</b> may be further provided. In Particular, when the feeding base <b>101</b> is horizontally disposed, it is preferable that the pickup roller <b>103</b> be provided.

When a current is applied to the electromagnet <b>121</b>, the gear part <b>122</b> is attached on the electromagnet <b>121</b> by electromagnetic force.

When the current being applied to the electron magnet <b>121</b> is cut off, the gear part <b>122</b> moves away from the electromagnet <b>121</b>. In this state, when the driving means rotates, only the gear part <b>122</b> rotates while the electromagnet <b>121</b> and the shaft <b>110</b> do not rotate.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>, all of the first to third members <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>rotate in the second direction <b>302</b>, as a result of which the inclined sections <b>234</b> of the first power coupling portion <b>231</b> push the inclined sections <b>242</b> of the second power coupling portions <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b</i>.

Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, both the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the pickup roller <b>103</b> rotate in the first direction <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to reduce load in the course of feeding the documents D, the pickup roller <b>103</b> is preferably designed to contact the documents only when it picks up the documents D.

Clutching means <b>250</b> is disposed between the bracket <b>130</b> and the shaft <b>110</b> for transmitting rotational force of the shaft <b>110</b> to the bracket <b>130</b> when the shaft rotates in the first direction and for interrupting rotational force of the shaft <b>130</b> when the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b> so as not to transmit the rotation force to the bracket <b>130</b>.</p>

As shown in the drawing, the bracket <b>130</b> is provided at a sidewall <b>131</b> with a first cylindrical projection <b>133</b> defining an insertion portion <b>132</b> in which the shaft <b>110</b> is inserted. The bracket <b>130</b> is further provided at the sidewall <b>131</b> with a first insertion portion <b>134</b> in which a first end <b>271</b> of a clutch spring <b>270</b> is inserted and a stopper <b>135</b>. The shaft <b>110</b> is provided with a pin hole <b>113</b>. A fourth member <b>260</b> provided with a second cylindrical projection <b>261</b> and a pin coupling portion <b>262</b> are inserted around the shaft <b>110</b>. The fourth member <b>260</b> is coupled on the shaft <b>110</b> through a substantially identical manner to the first member <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Alternatively, the fourth member <b>260</b> may be forcedly fitted around the shaft <b>110</b>. A clutch cover <b>280</b> formed in a hollow shape is disposed enclosing the clutch spring <b>270</b>. The clutch cover <b>280</b> is provided with a second insertion groove <b>281</b> in which a second end <b>272</b> of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is inserted and an outer circumferential projection <b>282</b> contacting the stopper <b>135</b>. The clutch spring <b>270</b> is fitted on the first and second cylindrical projections <b>133</b> and <b>261</b>. Since an inner diameter of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is less than outer diameters of the first and second cylindrical projections <b>133</b> and <b>261</b>, the clutch spring <b>270</b> is inserted around the projections <b>133</b> and <b>261</b> while being slightly widened. Therefore, the clutch spring <b>270</b> biases the first and second cylindrical projections <b>133</b> and <b>261</b> using a first fitting force.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in a first direction, the rotational force of the shaft <b>110</b> is transmitted to the first cylindrical projection <b>133</b> by the first fitting force of the clutch spring <b>270</b> via the second cylindrical projection <b>261</b>. The first end <b>271</b> of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is inserted in the first insertion groove <b>134</b> to push the bracket <b>130</b> in the first direction <b>301</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bracket <b>134</b> rotates in the first direction <b>301</b> and the pickup roller <b>103</b> contacts the document D. The pickup roller <b>103</b> and the ADF roller <b>104</b> rotate in the first direction <b>301</b> as described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first fitting force of the clutch spring <b>270</b> should be set such that it can rotate the bracket <b>130</b> in the first direction <b>301</b> while overcoming an elastic force of the elastic member <b>140</b> when the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in the first direction <b>301</b>. To set the first fitting force of the clutch spring in response to this requirement, the bracket <b>130</b> and the clutch cover <b>280</b> may be provided with a plurality of insertion grooves <b>134</b> and <b>281</b>, respectively. That is, by properly inserting the first and second ends of the clutch spring <b>270</b> in the first and second insertion grooves <b>134</b> and <b>281</b>, respectively, the first fitting force can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the shaft <b>110</b> further rotates in the first direction <b>301</b> after the pickup roller <b>103</b> contacts the document D, the bracket <b>130</b> is biased to further rotate in the first direction <b>301</b>. At this point, the first end <b>271</b> of the clutch spring <b>270</b> receives repulsive force from the bracket <b>130</b> in the second direction <b>302</b>. At this point, the first fitting force of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is reduced as the inner diameter of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is widened in a moment. As a result, the clutch spring <b>270</b> slips on the first cylindrical projection <b>133</b>. Accordingly, even when the shaft <b>110</b> further rotates in the first direction <b>301</b> after the pickup roller <b>103</b> contacts the document D, the pickup roller <b>103</b> maintains its gentle contacting state without applying excessive pressure to the documents D.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When a predetermined time has elapsed after the front end of the document D is detected by the first detecting sensor <b>109</b>A, the document D is fed by the feed roller <b>106</b>. When the document D is fed, since there is no need of rotating the shaft <b>110</b>, the current being applied to the power switching means <b>120</b> is cut off to disconnect the driving means <b>100</b> from the shaft <b>110</b>, thereby stopping the rotation of the shaft <b>110</b>. The bracket <b>130</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b> by the elastic force of the elastic member <b>140</b> to separate the pickup roller <b>103</b> from the document D. At this point, the first end <b>271</b> of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is pushed in the second direction <b>302</b> while bracket <b>130</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>. Then, the first fitting force of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is reduced as the inner diameter of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is widened, and thereby the clutch spring <b>270</b> slips on the first cylindrical projection <b>133</b>. Accordingly, the bracket <b>130</b> smoothly rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is preferable that there is provided suppressing means <b>160</b> for suppressing the excessive rotation of the bracket <b>130</b> in the second direction <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in the first direction <b>301</b> by the driving means <b>100</b>, the bracket <b>130</b> rotates in the first direction <b>301</b> to allow the pickup roller <b>103</b> to contact the document D. The document D picked up by the pickup roller <b>103</b> is fed sheet by sheet while passing through between the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the separating means <b>105</b>. When a front end of the document D is advanced to the feed roller <b>106</b>, the document D is conveyed by the feed roller <b>106</b>. Accordingly, there is no need for bi-directionally rotating the driving means <b>100</b> and preventing the delay of the feeding time, which is incurred in the conventional automatic document feeding apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A feeding speed of the ADF roller <b>104</b> is identical to or less than that of the feed roller <b>106</b>. In general, the feeding speed of the ADF roller <b>104</b> is slightly less than that of the feed roller <b>106</b>. Therefore, to prevent the document D from being torn by the difference in the feeding speed, since the ADF roller <b>104</b> should rotate in response to the feeding speed of the feed roller <b>106</b>, the ADF roller <b>104</b> should be disconnected with the shaft <b>110</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the ADF roller <b>104</b> rotates in the first direction <b>301</b> at the feeding speed identical to that of the feed roller <b>106</b>, the inclined sections <b>242</b> of the second power coupling portion <b>240</b> push the inclined sections <b>234</b> of the first power coupling portion <b>231</b> and the third member <b>230</b><i>a </i>is pushed in the direction of arrow <b>303</b>. As a result, the power connection between the shaft <b>110</b> and the ADF roller <b>104</b> is cut off and the ADF roller <b>104</b> smoothly rotates in response to the feeding speed of the feed roller <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To align the front end of the document D on the feed roller <b>106</b>, the feed roller <b>106</b> does not rotate or rotates in the second direction until the front end of the document D reaches thereto. That is, in a state where the feed roller <b>106</b> is stopped or rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>, the document D is conveyed from the first detecting sensor <b>109</b>A to slightly over the feed roller <b>106</b> after the front end of the document D is detected by the first detecting sensor <b>109</b>A. As a result, as shown by a broken line <b>305</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the document D is neatly curved and aligned on the feed roller <b>106</b>. In this state, when the feed roller <b>106</b> rotates in the first direction <b>301</b>, the document D is advantageously stably fed without being skewed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Power switching means that is identical to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be further provided on the feed roller <b>106</b>. In this case, the current applied to the power switching means can be cut off to prevent the feed roller <b>106</b> from rotating while the document D is being aligned on the feed roller <b>106</b>. After the document alignment is finished, the current is applied to the power switching means to convey the document by rotating the feed roller <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For the automatic document feeding apparatus that does not employ the aligning process, The ADF roller <b>104</b>, the pickup roller <b>103</b> and the feed roller <b>106</b> are continuously rotated only in the first direction <b>301</b>. At this point, after the front end of the document is inserted in the feed roller <b>106</b>, the power switching means disconnects the driving means <b>100</b> from the shaft <b>110</b>. As a result, the bracket <b>130</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b> by the elastic force of the elastic member <b>140</b> to allow the pickup roller <b>103</b> to be separated from the document D and the ADF roller <b>104</b> rotates in response to the feeding speed of the feed roller <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the document D is jammed while being conveyed, a jammed location can be identified by checking the first and second detecting sensors <b>109</b>A and <b>109</b>B. That is, when the front end of the document D is not detected by the first detecting sensor <b>109</b>A for a predetermined time after the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the pickup roller <b>103</b> start rotating, it can be determined that the document D is jammed between the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the feed roller <b>106</b>. When the front end of the document D is not detected by the second detecting sensor <b>109</b>B for a predetermined time after the front end of the document D is detected by the first detecting sensor <b>109</b>A, it can be determined that the document D is jammed between the feed roller <b>106</b> and the reading means <b>107</b>. When the rear end of the document D is not detected by the second detecting sensor <b>109</b>B for a predetermined time after the front end of the document D is detected by the second detecting sensor <b>109</b>B, it can be determined that the document D is jammed between the reading means <b>107</b> and the discharging roller <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When it is determined that the document D is jammed between the reading means <b>107</b> and the discharging roller <b>108</b>, since this is the case where the front end of the document D reaches the tray <b>102</b>, the jammed document D can be removed by pulling the document D in a direction A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When it is determined that the document D is jammed between the feed roller <b>106</b> and the reading means <b>107</b>, it is impossible to pull the front end of the document D in the direction A. Accordingly, it is possible to remove the jammed document D by pulling the rear end of the document D in a direction B. When the document D is jammed between the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the feed roller <b>106</b>, it is possible to remove the jammed document D by pulling the rear end of the document D in the direction B.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In more in detail, when the rear end of the jammed document D is pulled in the direction B to remove the jammed document D between the feed roller <b>106</b> and the reading means <b>107</b> or between the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the feed roller <b>106</b>, the ADF roller <b>104</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>. At this point, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the opposing sections <b>241</b> of the second power coupling portion <b>240</b> push the opposing sections <b>233</b> of the first power coupling portion <b>231</b> in the second direction <b>302</b> and the third member <b>230</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>. As a result, the first member <b>210</b> and the shaft <b>110</b> also rotate in the second direction <b>302</b>. Here, the operation of the clutching means <b>250</b> for selectively connecting the bracket <b>130</b> with the shaft <b>110</b> is important. When the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>, the bracket <b>130</b> cannot rotate in the second direction <b>302</b> by the suppressing means <b>160</b>. In this case, since the first end of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is inserted in the first insertion groove <b>134</b>, it is twisted in a direction where the diameter thereof reduces, thereby further biasing the first and second cylindrical projections <b>133</b> and <b>261</b>. As a result, the shaft <b>110</b> and the ADF roller <b>104</b> cannot rotate in the second direction <b>302</b> as far as the bracket <b>130</b> does not rotate in the second direction <b>302</b>. Since the document D is pressed between the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the separating member <b>105</b>, it is difficult to remove the document D if the ADF roller <b>104</b> does not rotate. Therefore, when the document D is pulled in the direction B by excessive force, the document D may be torn.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, in the present invention, when the shaft <b>110</b> rotates in the second direction <b>302</b>, the second end of the clutch spring <b>270</b> pushes the second insertion groove <b>281</b> to rotate the clutch cover <b>280</b> in the second direction <b>302</b>. At this point, since the outer circumferential projection <b>282</b> of the clutch cover <b>280</b> contacts the stopper <b>135</b>, the clutch cover <b>280</b> cannot rotate. In this state, when the second end <b>272</b> of the clutch spring <b>270</b> continuously pushes the clutch cover <b>280</b> in the second direction <b>302</b>, the inner diameter of the clutch spring <b>270</b> is widened. As a result, since there is a slip between the second cylindrical projection <b>261</b> and the clutch spring <b>270</b>, the torque of the shaft <b>110</b> is not transmitted to the bracket <b>130</b>. Accordingly, when the jammed document D is pulled in the direction B, the jammed document D can be easily removed while the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the shaft <b>110</b> smoothly rotate in the second direction <b>302</b>. When the document D is jammed, the driving means <b>100</b> is disconnected with the shaft <b>110</b> by the power switching means <b>120</b>. As a result, since only the ADF roller <b>104</b> and the shaft <b>110</b> rotate, the jammed document D can be more easily removed.</p>
