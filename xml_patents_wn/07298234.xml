<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/481,703 filed on Nov. 25, 2003.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the interconnection of electronics elements in on-chip (inside the chip) and off-chip (board level) level interconnection, high-speed connector, cable fabrication. More particularly, this invention is related to, (a) connecting two or more electronic devices inside the chip, (b) connecting the high speed signal lines two or more chips (e.g. processors), useful in high speed systems including personnel computer (PC) super-computer, game system, imaging system, communication system, and (c) also interface means (as the connector or cable) to connect two or multiple high speed electronics elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The increasing level of integration within electrical integrated circuits (IC) leads to both higher data rates and larger number of IC interconnections. Today, the inherent signal speed of ICs is increasing to 5 GHz, and shortly it will reach 20 GHz and beyond. The number of pin connection is also increasing, with single ICs requiring close to 2000 interconnections (i.e. single processor), and shortly it will increase to over 5000. Simultaneously achieving higher data rates and higher interconnect densities for both on-chip and also off-chip, will be increasingly difficult as the IC technologies continue to evolve increasing signal speed of electronic devices and interconnection number. In on-chip cases (inside the die), as the number of the electronic devices such as transistors are increased with continued development of fabrication technology, interconnecting electronic devices without sacrificing signal speed is becoming an increasing challenge. In the off-chip case, high density interconnects, covering from die-level packaging to chip-to-chip (hereafter chip indicates the die with package) interconnection on the printed circuit board (PCB), will also become increasingly difficult as the IC technologies continue to evolve, thereby increasing the signal speed and interconnection number.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With increased signal speed and interconnection number within and outside of the IC, low-cost high-level interconnect techniques compatible with today's manufacturing technology is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, it is known that if the electronic devices (for both on-chip and off-chip) are connected with the help of the metal conductor (act as the interconnects), electrical signal can be flown and the electronic device can be connected with each other. This is true for low-speed signal, below a few MHz. At multi GHz frequencies, interconnect lengths become a significant fraction of the wavelength of the high frequency harmonics, and therefore interconnects must be designed with proper concern of impedance, cross talk, and attenuation. Significant attenuation and rise-time degradation can be caused by losses in the transmission line. As is readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, the transmission line loss is the sum of the conductor loss and dielectric loss, both of which are dependent on the frequency. This dielectric loss is dependent on the loss tangent (tangent loss) of the materials and it varies from dielectric to dielectric. For example, the PCB materials like FR4 have the loss tangent of 0.018, whereas the alumina has the 0.0008. The less the tangent loss of the dielectric, the lower the transmission loss for the given interconnect distance and fixed conductor loss. Using the low-loss tangent material, would help to increase the signal carrying capacity of the interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is the schematic showing part of conventional off-chip interconnection. In off-chip interconnection, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chip <b>120</b> (for example processor or memory) is connected with chip <b>130</b> by multilayered electrical signal lines <b>110</b> and ground lines <b>112</b> contained within PCB <b>108</b>. Conventional printed circuit board (PCB) materials are mainly FR4, Roger, and alumina. Low cost PCB material is mainly FR4, which is frequently used. The metal used for interconnects is mainly copper which is used for routing the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional interconnection technology for off-chip is mainly based on the microstrip line or strip-line transmission layout on the dielectric material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a cross-sectional of a microstrip layout, which refers to a trace routed as the top or bottom layer for example of a PCB for the case of off-chip interconnection. The electrical conductor <b>140</b>A with width W and thickness T are laid on the dielectric material <b>142</b>A having height H. The ground or power line <b>144</b>A is located opposite of the signal conductor <b>140</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is the cross-sectional view of strip line layout, which uses a trace <b>140</b>B routed on the inside layer <b>142</b>B for example of a PCB and has two voltage-reference planes (i.e. power and/or ground) <b>144</b>B and <b>144</b>B′.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For high-speed signal interconnection, a lower loss tangent is necessary. Lower loss tangent material offers following functions for off-chip interconnects;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">(a) higher density interconnection due to reduction of the cross-talk, (b) reducing the capacitance of the interconnection, helping to transfer the signal longer distance, (c) lower propagation delay, and (d) reducing the microwave loss and help to transmit the longer distance. In other words, it helps to transmit the higher speed signal a longer distance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Besides the dissipation-factor of the dielectric materials, the microwave loss also limits the bandwidth of the interconnection. Microwave-loss occurs due to the electrode structure mainly from skin-depth of the signal. As Cu's skin-depth at 100 GHz is 0.2 μm, the skin-depth due to the conductor structure is neglected. So, the bandwidth of the interconnection (for off-chip interconnection) is mainly dependent on the material loss tangent (dielectric loss).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is relatively straight forward that increasing the bandwidth can be possible using of the material having lower loss tangent. However, in this case, new PCB material development is necessary. Besides, manufacturing process is also needed to develop compatible to new PCB materials.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Much work can be found in off-chip interconnection technology focusing on the material development for achieving the low-loss tangent material. The development cost of these low loss tangent materials is very high and implementing into the practical system would not only increase the system cost, but also reduce the reliability. Today, other areas of focusing area to overcome the high microwave loss (due to the dielectric) include the use conventional materials such as FR4 (board material), or shortening the length on the interconnection layout to reduce the transmission loss and signal integrity. In both cases, implementing such technology would require one to pay high cost.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As explained above, the conventional electronics interconnect technology being used in off-chip interconnection cannot be used, as the signal speed is increasing. Existing conventional electrical interconnects have the limitation of achieving the bandwidth in certain level, beyond that, either new low loss-tangent material development is necessary or new interconnect technology using conventional material is required. Developing low-loss tangent material and its related manufacturing process for PCB build-up require high investment and time. It is highly desirable to have the innovative interconnect technology, which would use conventional material and conventional manufacturing processes, but a lower effective loss tangent. This technique or technology can be easily implemented as they can use the standard dielectric material used in PCB industries.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The best modes for carrying out the present invention will be described in turn with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, the same reference numerals denote components having substantially the same functions and arrangements, and duplicate explanation will be made only where necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">An important point of high speed electronic interconnect system (for off-chip and on-chip) according to the invention is that the microwave loss induced due to the dielectrics is to be reduced by reducing the effective loss-tangent of the dielectrics, resulting in increasing the signal carrying capacity of the interconnect. In doing so, the main point is kept into mind that the technique is to be cost effective, and compatible to standard manufacturing technology.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">It is very straight forward that increasing interconnects (both on-chip and off-chip) bandwidth can be possible by using of the low loss-tangent material. However, new materials and related manufacturing technologies are to be developed to implement practical interconnects. It is highly desirable to invent the interconnects which have low effective loss-tangent, and which could use conventional manufacturing technology.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the preferred embodiments explanation, first several interconnects structures (techniques) to reduce the effective loss-tangent will be explained considering the single signal line with specific characteristics impedance, and later part of this section cover the process and applications of the preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is the top view and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> are the cross-sectional views of a portion of the interconnects system, taken along AA′ direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> in the first embodiment in accordance with the invention, wherein the same numerals represents the same parts so that repeated explanation is omitted here. Microstrip line as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is laid onto dielectric system <b>148</b>, having the opened trenches <b>150</b>A (or <b>150</b>B) into the dielectric system <b>148</b> located at the backside of the signal line <b>140</b>A. The ground plan <b>152</b> is located on other dielectric system <b>148</b>A′. The shape of the opened trenches <b>150</b>A (and <b>150</b>B) could be tetrahedral (square, rectangular or circular) or any shaped convenient for manufacturing, and the trenches are filled with the air or any dielectric materials having lower dielectric constant and lower loss tangent. This could be filled with the liquid crystal. By doing this, the refractive index can be tuned based on the electrical field. While signal flowing through the transmission line <b>140</b>A (conductor), the electrical field <b>154</b> (and also magnetic field (not shown)) passes through the opened trenches and dielectric system <b>148</b>A left under the transmission line <b>140</b>A. As the electrical field <b>154</b> is passing through the opened trenches containing the air and the less dielectric layer, the effective dielectric constant and effective loss tangent of the structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, gets much more lower than those of actual dielectric material used in dielectric system <b>148</b>A. This results in reducing the microwave loss (experienced due to the dielectrics) as compared with that of the conventional uniform dielectric system (not shown). In other words, signal transmission is less dispersive, and higher bandwidth of the interconnect system is ascertained, as compared with the conventional interconnects where signal conductor is laid onto the uniform dielectric medium.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Based on the shape and physical parameters of the opened trenches, the microwave loss experienced due to the dielectric system, can be made as low as close to the air. In the preferred embodiment, the dielectric is left under the conductor, to reduce microwave loss as close to air, the opened trenches could be extended to the conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C are the cross-sectional views, illustrating different microstrip configurations on the dielectric system having back trenches for electrical interconnects in a second preferred embodiment according to the invention, wherein the same numerals represent the same parts so that repeated explanations are omitted here. Different microstrip lines structures such as single ended and differential pars with opened trenches are shown. For simplicity, single pairs and also single-ended (single channel) microstrip type signal lines are shown, but in actual application multiple signal lines could also be used in multilayered dielectric layers. The microwave losses of the signal lines are dependent on (a) conductor width W <b>140</b>A (designed to have close to 50 ohm for the single-ended, and close to 100 ohm for the differential pairs lines) and (b) trench <b>150</b>B parameters such as dielectric height (from ground plan to conductor) H, deepness of the trenches Hm/n, where n and m are the integer and equal to 1, 2, 3, and so on. For the differential pair lines, space between the differential line (d<sub>2 </sub>or d<sub>3</sub>) determines the microwave loss. Optimizing the each factors, will determine the low microwave loss and low signal propagation delay. For simplicity one type of trenches are shown here, but it can cover other shapes of the trench such as square, rectangular, or circular, or the shape convenient to manufacturing. Again, here the trench is filled with the air (or gas) or kept vacuum, but other dielectric materials with suitable dielectric constant and loss tangent can also fill it.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the insertion loss (S<b>21</b>) of the conventional signal line (homogeneous dielectric) for example the case as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as prior art, and the signal lines with different trenches shape inside the dielectric system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, in a third preferred embodiment according to the invention. The data shown is for the 300 mm long microstrip type signal line. Depending on the parameters chosen the insertion loss can be changed and the bandwidth of the interconnects can be increased. Ideally, the speed of the signal can be made to closer to the speed of the light. With varying the parameters of the opened trenches, the effective dielectric constant and effective loss tangent of the dielectric system can be made to lower as compared with the actual dielectric materials of the dielectric system.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C are the cross-sectional views, illustrating different strip line configurations on the dielectric system having opened back trenches for electrical interconnects in a fourth preferred embodiment according to the invention, wherein the same numerals represent the same parts so that similar explanations are omitted here. For simplicity, single pairs and also single-ended (single channel) stripline type signal lines are shown, but in actual application multiple signal lines could also be used in multilayered dielectric layers. The microwave losses of the signal lines are dependent on the (a) conductor width W <b>140</b>B (designed to have close to 50 ohm for the single-ended, and close to 100 ohm for the differential pairs lines) and (b) opened trenches <b>150</b>B parameters such as dielectric height (from ground plan to conductor) H<sub>1 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>, deepness of the trenches Hm/n, where n and m are the integer and equal to 1, 2, 3, and so on. For the differential pair lines, space between the differential line (d<sub>2 </sub>or d<sub>3</sub>) determines the microwave loss.

Again, here the trench is filled with the air, but other dielectric materials with suitable dielectric constant and loss tangent can fill it.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is the top view and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</figref> are the cross-sectional views of the portion of the interconnection system, taken along AA′ direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, in the fifth preferred embodiment in accordance to the present invention, wherein like parts are indicated by like reference numerals as used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, so that repeated explanation is omitted here. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the coplanar line configuration consisting of signal line <b>140</b>C and both sides ground <b>144</b>C is used on dielectric system <b>142</b>C with backside slotted (<b>150</b>A or <b>150</b>B′, or <b>150</b>B (not shown)). According to this invention the effective dielectric constant (i.e. microwave index) and effective loss tangent is considerably decreased, and the electrical field intensity near to the signal line. The reason is as follows: (i) the electric field leaks out effectively into the backside (air) so that the effective dielectric constant (microwave index) and effective loss tangent decrease. For simplicity, signal lines consisting of the ground-signal-ground (G-S-G) configuration is shown, various configurations such as G-S-S-G or G-S-G-S-G or G-S-S-S-G etc. having opened trenches also cover this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Dielectric material, which can be used for this purpose, includes all kinds of dielectric and ceramics materials such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, FR4, Duroid, AlN, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, BN, SiC, BeO, and all kinds of low temperature cofired ceramics etc. All kinds of polymer materials having dielectric properties also falls under this dielectric material. These dielectric materials can be made using high (or low) temperature ceramics processing or using the IC fabrication process. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, backside opened-trench portion <b>150</b>A or <b>150</b>B′ or <b>150</b>B (not shown) is filled up with the air (or gas) or vacuum as for example. Instead of air (or gas), the backside opened-trench portion can be filled up with the dielectric material having lower loss-tangent properties than the dielectric system <b>142</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is the top view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref> are the cross-sectional views taken along AA′ section, illustrating the microstrip configuration on the dielectric system having backside slots and also the periodic structure, in a sixth preferred embodiment according to the invention, wherein like parts are indicated by like reference numerals as used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, so that repeated explanation is omitted here. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B, and <b>8</b>C, the microstrip line configuration consisting of signal line <b>140</b>E and back-side ground <b>144</b>E, is used on dielectric system <b>142</b>E consisting of the dielectric sphere (i.e. air) or cylinder <b>160</b> with diameter <b>2</b><i>r </i>and span a, and backside slot (trenches) <b>150</b>A (or <b>150</b>B). According to this invention the effective loss-tangent of the dielectric system is considerably decreased. This also reduces the effective dielectric constant (i.e. microwave index) of the dielectric system. The electrical field intensity under the trenches can be localized.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The spheres <b>160</b> array into the dielectric, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, could be air (or gas or vacuum) hole (with cylindrical in shape) or any other material having the lower loss-tangent than the surrounding dielectric media. Each cylinder (sphere) constitutes the cell, and hereafter mentioned the single cylinder as circular cell. Each circular cell (not shown) again can be arranged in triangular or square (not shown) way. The arrangement of the each cell here after mentioned as the lattice. According to this invention, the circular cell contains air with low dielectric constant, and is formed inside the dielectric material with higher dielectric constant. The electric field from the signal line can made to pass through the air cell, reducing the effective dielectric constant and also reducing effective loss tangent, which results in increasing the bandwidth of the interconnects. Based on the parameters of diameter and the span, the electrical field distribution can be concentrated into the dielectrics system with air-holes array.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In the preferred embodiment, the circular cells with triangular and square-lattice structures are mentioned. It also includes the elliptic unit cell with square or triangular-lattice structure. In the case of the cell, the shape of circle, or square or ellipse can be used to tune the dielectric constant along with the loss tangent in the same dielectric layer. This helps to add many passive features in the interconnection such as varying the phase velocity (which is function of the dielectric constant), varying the bandwidth of the interconnect; help to adjust the skews of the signal etc. in the single interconnect system. In addition, various passive features such as the emphasis and also equalizations feature can also be made varying the dielectric constant along the path where the signal flow from transmitter to receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the preferred embodiment, the microstructure configuration with single electrode of microstrip line type is shown as signal line, the present invention also include other configurations such as strip line or coplanar type or other configuration reducing the effective dielectric constant and effective loss tangent. Single or multiple electrodes with single or multiple layers of the dielectric could also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">According to the preferred embodiment, ideally, the bandwidth of the electronic interconnect system can be possible to make the closer to fiber (closer to the light), if other loss due to the signal line structure such as the electrode parameter (resistance, capacitance) are neglected.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The dielectric system mentioned in the preferred embodiment also includes the photonic crystal structure (2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional) comprising with the dielectric periodic structure and the line defect for the signal line layout. The band-gap is formed due to use of the lower dielectric material cylinder into the dielectric substrate with comparatively higher dielectric constant. In the structure, the electrical field created from the high-speed signal, flowing through the signal line (not shown) is confined and controlled in the n-plan direction by the 2D photonic band gap effect. The electrical field can be localized completely in the air-hole along the signal flowing direction making the low effective dielectric constant (low microwave loss), and thereby increasing the bandwidth of the interconnect system. By changing the shape of the cylinder for example elliptic and its different size and their span, the electrical field can be localized in the dielectric slab. This allows to have the different interconnect system having the different bandwidth by changing the dielectric constant, and signal can be made slow and high speed where it necessary. According to the preferred embodiment, the interconnect can be designed ideally having the bandwidth closer to optical fiber, and carry the high-speed electronics signal (even terahertz level). In the example, the dielectric system consisting of the 2D photonic crystal is shown. Present invention also includes the 3D photonic crystal for high-speed interconnect systems applying in the on-chip and off-chip application. This also includes the means such as the connector and cable used to high-speed connection of electronic elements covering transistor to instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">According to the preferred embodiment, the interconnect system can be fabricated as follows; first a layer of cylindrical holes are made into a dielectric substrate. Standard PCB manufacturing technology for off-chip interconnection can be used for this purpose. This is followed by the formation of the signal line. The hole can be made underneath the signal line or that portion is masked while opening the holes outside the signal line. In the preferred embodiment alternatively, the lower loss-tangent material as compared with the dielectric substrate can fill up the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is the schematic and <b>9</b>B and <b>9</b>C are the enlarged front and side cross-sectional views along AA′ and BB′ directions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, illustrating a portion of the high speed signal lines (of stripline type transmission line) of off-chip interconnections in the seventh preferred embodiment according to the present invention. For simplicity in drawing, only the surrounding portion of signal lines is shown. In the preferred embodiment, two single-ended strip lines <b>216</b> are shown as the high-speed signal lines, and the signal lines are laid on one-side of the “comb” shaped dielectric substrate <b>218</b>, the other side of which has the “teeth”. The “comb” shaped dielectric substrate having signal line <b>216</b> in one side, is sandwiched by a top thin uniform dielectric substrate <b>220</b> having ground plan <b>144</b>B and the bottom “comb”-shaped dielectric substrate <b>222</b> having ground plan <b>144</b>B, to make the stripline configuration. As the “Comb” shaped dielectric substrate <b>218</b> signal line is located at the top of other comb-shaped dielectric substrate <b>222</b> having the ground plan <b>144</b>B, hereafter (for explanation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), the signal line substrate is called as the top and bottom comb-shaped dielectric is called as Bottom dielectric. Each “Comb”-shaped dielectric substrate (<b>218</b> and <b>222</b>) has the series of the “teethes” <b>224</b>A (for signal line) and <b>224</b>B (for bottom), having the space of S<sub>b </sub>(for bottom) and S<sub>u </sub>(for up) between the teeth, and the teeth thickness of T<sub>b </sub>(for bottom) T<sub>u </sub>(for up). Both dielectric systems are stacked the signal line substrate in a way that the teeth position of the top and the bottom dielectric systems are 90 degrees to each other to have strong support, and their opening portion is facing in the same direction. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the teeth for both upper and bottom dielectrics are directed in upward direction. The signal line is laid in between the space between the teeth, and the comb helps to make strong mechanical support (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Using of comb shaped dielectrics <b>218</b> and <b>222</b> will make the air pockets <b>226</b>A and <b>226</b>B along the conductor path in both upper and bottom side of the signal lines <b>216</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>). Having larger volume of air space (top and bottom) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the signal flows at the speed closer to the speed of the light. Based on the requirements of the signal carrying capacity of the interconnects and also requirements of the mechanical support based on the applications, the spaces between comb S<sub>b </sub>and S<sub>u </sub>and their thickness T<sub>b </sub>and T<sub>u </sub>(for both bottom and upper dielectrics) can be designed. In the preferred embodiment, the comb-shaped dielectric substrate can be made after metallization, and it could be done standard process, such as mechanical drilling, or laser drilling. Etching process either wet or dry etching can also be used after patterning, and conventional etching process used frequently in manufacturing can be used. The dielectric substrate with metallization can be stacked using conventional PCB manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to this invention, for simplicity, only one arrangement of teeth position and signal line position are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, several different configurations for the teeth and signal lines (not shown) for different positions of the signal line and teeth of upper and lower dielectric system can be thought. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the teeth of upper dielectric substrate is positioned from left-right (vice-versa) direction along the substrate and the signal line is passing in between the teeth, that is, signal line is front-back (vice versa) direction. Whereas, the teeth of the bottom dielectric is positioned front-back direction (just opposite to those of upper dielectric). Other different configurations can be thought.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the preferred embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, teeth of the top comb-shaped dielectric system is placed parallel to the signal line and the teeth of the bottom comb-shaped dielectric system is in perpendicular to the signal line. Different configuration of arrangement can be possible. For example, both comb-shaped dielectric system can be positioned in parallel to the signal line, and both comb-shaped can be positioned perpendicular to the signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Other combination for placing signal lines on the dielectric system can also be possible. One of the example (not shown) could be the teeth of the upper substrate is front-back (vice-versa) direction, and the signal line is laid along the direction of left right (vice-versa). According to this invention, alternatively, different shape for the dielectric substrate (ground and signal lines) could be thought. One of the examples is the configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, with just opposite to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, comb-shaped signal substrate <b>228</b>, sandwiched by the comb-shaped ground substrate <b>230</b> (top side) and the thinner ground substrate <b>232</b> at the bottom side. In the eighth embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the position of the thinner ground plan is located at the bottom and in FIGS. The thinner dielectric substrate is located at the top. Also the teeth direction is downward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the teeth are in upward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the preferred embodiment, a portion of the signal line (strip lines configuration) structure is shown for explanation purpose. According to this present invention, the structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is only made closer to the high-speed signal lines, and outside of the signal lines standard structure with uniform multilayered dielectric system can be used. This structure is for the reducing the effective dielectric constant and effective loss tangent of the dielectric system, which results in increasing the signal carrying capacity of the interconnects and also reduce the signal propagation delay between the channels, help to eliminate the skews between the channels. This structure help to eliminate the using of the pre-emphasize/equalization circuit and more simplify the board design in the case of the off-chip interconnects.</p>
