<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of Japanese Applications No. 2003-391643, filed Nov. 21, 2003; No. 2004-282753, filed Sep. 28, 2004; and No. 2004-272353, filed Sep. 17, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated by this reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a photodetection circuit and a confocal microscope having the circuit, and more specifically to a photodetection circuit for enlarging the photodetection dynamic range and improving the S/N ratio of height data, and a confocal microscope having the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a confocal microscope applies dotted illumination to a specimen, converges transmitted light, reflected light, or fluorescence from the specimen on a confocal diaphragm, and detects by a photodetector the intensity of the light passing through the confocal diaphragm, thereby obtaining the surface information about the specimen. A scanning confocal microscope scans the surface of the specimen using dotted illumination in various methods, thereby obtain the surface information about the specimen in a wide range.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the outline of the configuration of a conventional confocal microscope (scanning confocal laser microscope).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the confocal microscope shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a laser beam output from a laser beam source <b>101</b> passes through a beam splitter <b>102</b>, and enters a two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>103</b>. The two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>103</b> has a first optical scanner <b>103</b><i>a </i>and a second optical scanner <b>103</b><i>b</i>, performs two-dimensional scanning using luminous flux, and leads it to an object lens <b>107</b>. The luminous flux input to the object lens <b>107</b> becomes converging beam and scans the surface of a specimen <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The light reflected by the surface of the specimen <b>108</b> is introduced from the object lens <b>107</b> again to the beam splitter <b>102</b> through the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>103</b>, then reflected by the beam splitter <b>102</b>, and converges on a pinhole <b>110</b> by an image forming lens <b>109</b>. The pinhole <b>110</b> cuts off the reflected light from the points other than the beam condensing point of the specimen <b>108</b>, and a photodetector <b>111</b> detects the light only passing through the pinhole <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The specimen <b>108</b> is held on a specimen table <b>113</b>. A stage <b>114</b> and the photodetector <b>111</b> is controlled by a computer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The beam condensing position by the object lens <b>107</b> is in a position optically conjugate with the pinhole <b>110</b>. When the specimen <b>108</b> is in the beam condensing position of the object lens <b>107</b>, the reflected light from the specimen <b>108</b> converges on the pinhole <b>110</b> and passes through the pinhole <b>110</b>. When the specimen <b>108</b> is displaced from the beam condensing position of the object lens <b>107</b>, the reflected light from the specimen <b>108</b> does not converges on the pinhole <b>110</b>, and does not pass through the <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an I-Z curve indicating the relationship between the relative position (Z) of the object lens <b>107</b> to the specimen <b>108</b> and the output (I) of the photodetector <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the specimen <b>108</b> is in the beam condensing position Z<b>0</b> of the object lens <b>107</b>, the output of the photodetector <b>111</b> indicates a maximum value. As the relative position of the object lens <b>107</b> to the specimen <b>108</b> leaves from the position, the output of the photodetector <b>111</b> indicates a sudden decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the characteristic, if the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>103</b> performs two-dimensional scanning on the beam condensing point, and an image is generated by the output of the photodetector <b>111</b> in synchronization with the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>103</b>, then an image of only a specific height portion of the specimen <b>108</b> is formed, and an image (confocal image) is obtained by optically slicing the specimen <b>108</b>. Furthermore, the specimen <b>108</b> is discretely moved on the specimen <b>108</b> in the optical axis direction, the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>103</b> performs scanning in each position to obtain a confocal image, and the Z position of the stage <b>114</b> where the output of the photodetector <b>111</b> indicates the maximum value is detected, thereby obtain the height information about the specimen <b>108</b>. Additionally, by overlaying and displaying the maximum value of the output of the photodetector <b>111</b> at each point of the specimen, an image can be obtained with all points of the image displayed in focus (extend image).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, when there is a large difference in brightness with the confocal microscope, that is, when a specimen having a large brightness difference between a bright portion and a dark portion is observed, it is necessary to adjust the detection sensitivity not to reach saturation on the screen. In this case, the adjustment is to be made based on a bright portion, and the data of a dark point includes much noise. Therefore, generally, a bright portion is compressed using a logarithm amplifier (γ characteristic) while a dark portion is brightened to expand the photodetection dynamic range, thereby reducing the entire contrast (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H7-212158). There also the technology of using the LUT (lookup table) to improve the visibility of a dark portion (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H6-124192).</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The embodiments of the present invention are described below by referring to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first embodiment of the present invention is explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of the confocal microscope (scanning confocal laser microscope) to which the present invention is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First, a body of a microscope <b>1</b> is configured as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A laser beam source <b>6</b> generates a laser beam as a spot beam for scanning the surface of a specimen <b>11</b>. A mirror <b>7</b> is a reflector for leading the laser beam from the laser beam source <b>6</b> to a two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b>. The two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> is a mechanism for using a laser beam from the laser beam source <b>6</b> obtained through the mirror <b>7</b> in the two-dimensional scanning. The two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> performs XY scanning using a spot beam under the control of a two-dimensional scanning control circuit <b>4</b>. The two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> comprises, for example, a resonant scanner for scanning in the X axis direction and a galvano-scanner for scanning in the Y axis direction. The two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> can perform scanning in the X and Y directions along the optical path of a spot beam for an object lens <b>10</b> by directing the resonant scanner and the galvano-scanner respectively in the X axis direction and Y axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A revolver <b>9</b> holds a plurality of object lenses <b>10</b> having different power. The revolver <b>9</b> can be moved in the optical axis direction (vertical direction) using a Z axis travel control circuit <b>17</b>, and can set the object lens <b>10</b> having a desired power in the plurality of object lenses <b>10</b> in the optical observation path of a microscope by a switching operation. Through the set object lens <b>10</b>, the spot beam is emitted from the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> and used in the two-dimensional scanning on the specimen <b>11</b> on a stage <b>12</b>. The stage <b>12</b> is a stage to hold the specimen <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">On the other hand, the reflected light from the specimen <b>11</b> is returned to the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> through the object lens <b>10</b>, and then returned from the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> to a half mirror <b>8</b>. The half mirror <b>8</b> is a semitransparent mirror provided on the optical output path of the laser beam source <b>6</b> for the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b>, and leads reflected light from the specimen <b>11</b> obtained through the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> to the detection system. A lens <b>13</b> collects reflected light obtained through the half mirror <b>8</b> from the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b>. A pinhole plate <b>14</b> has pinholes of a predetermined diameter respectively, and one of the pinhole is arranged in the focal position of the lens <b>13</b> on the front side of the phtoreception surface of a photodetector <b>15</b>. The photodetector <b>15</b> is a photodetection element for converting the light obtained through the pinhole to an electric signal corresponding to the quantity of the light. The electric signal obtained from the photodetector <b>15</b> is amplified to a predetermined level by an amplifier <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A microscope control circuit <b>18</b> and an image input circuit <b>19</b> are in a computer <b>2</b>. The microscope control circuit <b>18</b> is connected to the two-dimensional scanning control circuit <b>4</b> in the body of a microscope <b>1</b>, and the Z axis travel control circuit <b>17</b>, and controls the computer <b>2</b> to execute an instruction from an operator by input device not shown in the attached drawings, for example, to start and stop the scanning on the two-dimensional scanning control circuit <b>4</b> and appropriately perform the process of driving the revolver <b>9</b> by the body of a microscope <b>1</b>. The image input circuit <b>19</b> receives a signal photoelectrically converted by the photodetector <b>15</b> and amplified by the amplifier <b>16</b>, and a timing signal from the two-dimensional scanning control circuit <b>4</b>, and the computer <b>2</b> forms an image from the signals and displays them on a monitor <b>3</b>, thereby obtaining surface information about the specimen <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the configuration of the photodetection circuit to which the present invention is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The photodetection circuit to which the present invention is applied is configured by the photodetector <b>15</b> and the amplifier <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The photodetector <b>15</b> detects the light from the specimen <b>11</b> and photoelectrically converts it. The output signal from the photodetector <b>15</b> is input to a first linear amplifier <b>20</b> and a second linear amplifier <b>21</b>, amplified at a predetermined amplification rate (gain G<b>1</b>) by the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>, and amplified at an amplification rate (gain G<b>2</b>) (G<b>1</b>&gt;G<b>2</b> by the second linear amplifier <b>21</b>. An offset voltage is applied to the second linear amplifier <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The signal which has passed through the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> is processed by a half-wave rectifier circuit <b>22</b> such that only one side signal of the positive and negative signals can be passed. Finally, an addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> calculates the output of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> and the output of the half-wave rectifier circuit <b>22</b>, and the resultant is obtained as an output signal of the amplifier <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory view of the process of expanding the input dynamic range without reducing the S/N ratio of a dark portion on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The amplifier explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref> expands the input dynamic range without reducing the S/N ratio of a dark portion on the screen. The process is explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The horizontal axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicates an input voltage, and the vertical axis indicates an output voltage. The specimen <b>11</b> can be various types, and is explained below as having large difference in contrast (large brightness difference between a bright portion and a dark portion) on the screen. “A” shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicates an output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>. Similarly, “B” indicates an output signal of the second linear amplifier <b>21</b>, and “C” indicates an output signal of the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b>. These hold true in the subsequent descriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Generally, when a specimen indicating a large difference in contrast is observed, there can be a case in which an input voltage cannot be smaller than the range from 0 to V<b>1</b>, and can reach the range from V<b>1</b> to V<b>2</b> at the bright portion on the screen. If the input dynamic range of the image input circuit <b>19</b> is equal to V<b>0</b>, the bright portion exceeds the limit of the display and indicates white saturation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">To avoid this, the intensity of the illumination to the specimen <b>11</b> is reduced. For example, when the output of the laser beam source <b>6</b> is suppressed, the bright portion becomes V<b>0</b> or lower. However, the level of the dark portion is also lowered, and it becomes difficult in discriminating the data of the dark portion. Additionally, the effect of the circuit noise lowers the S/N ratio, thereby reducing the quality of data. To prevent this, the path of the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first linear amplifier <b>20</b> multiplies the input signals of 0 to V<b>1</b> and in excess of V<b>1</b> by G<b>1</b> as is and output them (refer to A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). On the other hand, the reference voltage for offset is input to the second linear amplifier <b>21</b>. When the input signal from the photodetector <b>15</b> exceeds the offset voltage, the output can be positive or negative on this potential point. That is, in the range of input voltage&lt;offset voltage, the input signal indicates negative output multiplied by G<b>2</b>. In the range of input voltage&gt;offset voltage, the input signal indicates positive output multiplied by G<b>2</b> (refer to B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the output of the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> is input to the half-wave rectifier circuit <b>22</b>, 0 is output in the negative range, that is, in the range of input voltage&lt;offset voltage, and the output as a result of multiplying the input signal by G<b>2</b> is obtained in the positive range, that is, in the range of input voltage&gt;offset voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Therefore, for the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> (subtraction in this case), a signal from the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> output as a result of multiplying the input voltage by G<b>1</b>, and a signal of 0 in the range of 0 to offset voltage of an input voltage, and a signal multiplied by G<b>2</b> is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As a result, the output voltage from the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> is the voltage of the signal multiplied by the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> in the range of the input voltage from 0 to offset voltage, and the voltage of the signal multiplied by (G<b>1</b>−G<b>2</b>) as a total gain in the range of offset voltage or higher (refer to “C” shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> can only process the input voltage of V<b>1</b>, but the gain can be reduced in the area of offset voltage or higher by the path of the second linear amplifier <b>21</b>, thereby hardly attaining the saturation level in the input voltage V<b>1</b>. As a result, the input voltage up to the level of V<b>2</b> can be processed, and the range of V<b>1</b> to V<b>2</b> of the dynamic range can be expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Normally, the conventional logarithm amplifier has the effect of expanding a dynamic range. However, the conventional logarithm amplifier increases the gain of a dark portion and reduces the gain of a bright portion in a circuit. Therefore, the dark portion becomes bright but high in amplification rate of noise and the S/N ratio becomes degraded. However, with the configuration according to the present invention, the gain of the bright portion can be lowered without changing the gain of the dark portion. Therefore, the present invention has the effect of expanding the dynamic range and simultaneously maintaining the S/N ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Described below is the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The confocal microscope (scanning confocal laser microscope) to which the second embodiment of the present invention is applied has the same configuration as the first embodiment, but the sensitivity-variable optical sensor used for the photodetector <b>15</b> is different.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The feature of the confocal microscope is the function of obtaining the height data of the specimen <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The beam condensing position by the object lens <b>10</b> is conjugate with the pinhole on the pinhole plate <b>14</b>. When the specimen <b>11</b> is in the beam condensing position by the object lens <b>10</b>, the reflected light from the specimen <b>11</b> converges on the pinhole plate <b>14</b>, and passes through the pinhole plate <b>14</b>. When the specimen <b>11</b> is displaced from the beam condensing position, the reflected light from the specimen <b>11</b> does not converge on the pinhole plate <b>14</b>, and does not pass through the pinhole plate <b>14</b>. That is, when the specimen <b>11</b> is in the beam condensing position of the object lens <b>10</b>, the output of the photodetector <b>15</b> indicates the maximum value, and as the relative position between the object lens <b>10</b> and the specimen <b>11</b> deviates from the position, the output of the photodetector <b>15</b> suddenly drops.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">By the above-mentioned characteristic, only the specific height of the specimen <b>11</b> is displayed as an image, and an image can be obtained as an optically sliced image (confocal image) of the specimen <b>11</b> when the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> two-dimensional scanning is performed on the beam condensing point and the output of the photodetector <b>15</b> is displayed as an image in synchronization with the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b>. Furthermore, the height information about the specimen <b>11</b> is obtained by discretely moving the revolver <b>9</b> in the optical axis direction through the Z axis travel control circuit <b>17</b>, performing the scanning by the two-dimensional scanning mechanism <b>5</b> using a laser beam while changing the relative position between the object lens <b>10</b> and the specimen <b>11</b>, thereby obtaining a confocal image, and detecting the position of the revolver <b>9</b> in which the output of the photodetector <b>15</b> indicates the maximum value at each point of the specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At this time, in the process of extracting the brightness information indicating the maximum value obtained while moving the revolver <b>9</b> at each point of the specimen <b>11</b>, the operation of constantly comparing the brightness information is performed. One of the factors of the quality of the height information is the S/N ratio of a detection signal. Especially, a dark portion is subject to the effect of noise, etc., and it is desired that the brightest possible information is to be compared. Assuming that the amplifier <b>16</b> and the first embodiment have similar configurations, data can be obtained without degrading the S/N ratio of the dark portion by the expansion of the dynamic range of the detection system. However, according to the second embodiment, the photomultiplier tube (hereinafter referred to as a PMT) having the amplification facility not only prevents the degradation of the S/N ratio of a dark portion, but also improves the S/N ratio. If the function of electronically amplifying a signal obtained by converting an optical signal to an electric signal is provided, the PMT can be replaced with an APD (avalanche photo diode), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an explanatory view of a process of improving the S/N ratio of a dark portion.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First, assume that the detection signal of the specimen <b>11</b> is in the range from 0 to V<b>1</b>. The operation of the amplifier <b>16</b> is the same as that according to the first embodiment. That is, the input voltage can be obtained up to the level of V<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At this time, the detection signal from the specimen <b>11</b> is in the range from 0 to V<b>1</b>. Therefore, as compared with the case in which the height data of the specimen <b>11</b> is obtained only by the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>, the dynamic range of the output signal is narrowed down to 0 through Vf. However, since the PMT is used for the photodetector <b>15</b> in the second embodiment of the present invention, the voltage applied to the PMT can be adjusted (enhanced), thereby possibly amplifying the signal at a high S/N ratio which cannot be realized by the amplification of an electric circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">That is, since the input signal to the amplifier <b>16</b> can be first amplified by the multiplying system of the sensor for the amount corresponding to V<b>0</b>-Vf and then input, the output signal of the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> is changed from C to D as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> when it is considered that the range of the output voltage of 0 to V<b>0</b> is obtained by the range of the same detection signal <b>0</b> to V<b>1</b> from the specimen <b>11</b>. As compared with the case in which the height data of the specimen <b>11</b> is obtained only by the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>, the signal level of the dark portion is enhanced without fail, and the signal is obtained as an advantageous signal in S/N ratio. As a result, the data precision of the dark portion of the specimen <b>11</b> can be considerably improved in the process of storing the position of the revolver <b>9</b> for the maximum brightness by comparing the brightness signal.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If an output dynamic range is appropriately adjusted by adjusting the gain of an electric circuit, the S/N ratio is degraded as compared with the case using only the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> (the transmission characteristic also indicates an increase for the output voltage axis, and the final transmission characteristic (folded line position) is different from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). However, since the signal intensity is raised in advance by the sensor and the gain of the bright portion to suppress the output saturation by the folded line characteristic which lowers the gain of the bright portion, there arises a large difference in S/N ratio of the final detection signal (height data) although the total gain of the saturation level is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When a brightness signal is obtained after passing through the amplifier <b>16</b> to which the present invention is applied, the relative difference of the signal is not linear. However, since the system of obtaining height data is to store the position in which the maximum brightness value is given for each point of the specimen <b>11</b> while changing the relative position in the optical axis direction between the object lens <b>10</b> and the specimen <b>11</b>, the absolute value of the brightness is not taken into account, but the relative comparison is made in the brightness value group in the optical axis direction at each point of the specimen <b>11</b>. Therefore, since the linearity of the brightness is not required (it is impossible to invert the bright and dark portions), the height data can be correctly obtained. On the other hand, the brightness image is obtained with the folded line characteristic as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, but it is possible to return to a linear brightness display by giving the inverse characteristic by, for example, a LUT (look-up table).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, the S/N ratio can be improved in the process of obtaining the height data because the processing is performed on an analog signal before it is treated in the digital processing by the image input circuit <b>19</b>. The signal quality is not changed although the brightness value is amended after a signal is obtained through a linear amplifier and is once A/D converted. The data having a poor S/N ratio in the dark portion and having been sampled has poor signal quality. Therefore, the data remains unreliable although it is treated in digital processing, for example, the brightness is amended using a LUT (look-up table). That is, as described above, the S/N ratio is improved by the combination of a sensitivity-variable sensor and the folded line characteristic indicating the drop of a gain in the bright portion.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Another example of the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> does not perform subtraction, but inversely amplifies the path of the second linear amplifier <b>21</b>, and performs addition after negative half-wave rectification. That is, a combination is designed such that the gain in the bright portion can be finally lowered with the scale, etc. of the actual circuit configuration taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A system of a different gain (linear amplifier, offset voltage, half-wave rectifier) can also be added in parallel. Thus, a plurality of stages can set a plurality of folded line points, thereby realizing an approximation in the transmission characteristic of logarithm amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The gains of the offset voltage and the linear amplifier are optionally set (varied), and arbitrary transmission characteristics can be realized depending on folded lines.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Switching can be performed between the linear characteristic and the folded line characteristic. That is, by providing the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> with the function of enabling/disabling an operation, only the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> can be used as in the conventional system.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The switching can be performed by the microscope control circuit <b>18</b> at an instruction from an operator through, for example, an input device not shown in the attached drawings. The gain of each of the first linear amplifiers <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, and the photodetector <b>15</b> can also be changed by the microscope control circuit <b>18</b> at an instruction of an operator through the input device.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the effect of the photodetection circuit (amplifier) according to the present invention is described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the relationship between the input level and the output level when only a linear amplifier is used and when a logarithm amplifier is used.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this example, the case in which a linear amplifier (normal amplifier) is used is compared with the case in which a logarithm amplifier is used. When a logarithm amplifier is used, for example, assuming that the output saturation level is 4, the input dynamic range can be expanded until the output level is enhanced by 2. Therefore, the gain of the dark portion is increased by the circuit, and the screen looks brighter, but since noise also increases, and the screen looks blurry.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When a linear amplifier is used, the S/N ratio of a signal is output as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the relationship between the input level and the output level in the first and second embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above in the first embodiment, the output of the addition/subtraction circuit can be calculated by (linear)−(half-wave rectification) for the area having the value equal to or larger than the threshold in a system having a different gain because a signal is output by the half-wave rectifier circuit when a threshold (for example, the input level of 3) is exceeded. Therefore, the entire gain is lowered without changing the S/N ratio in the dark portion. By the decrement of the gain, the input dynamic range can be expanded for a bright level.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When a sensor is a sensitivity-variable sensor such as a PMT, etc., the gain of the sensor is raised to adjust the level of the bright portion as described above in the second embodiment. Therefore, the input level of the dark portion can be increased, thereby improving the S/N ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the relationship between the input level and the output level when systems of different gains are added in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">By adding signal systems of different thresholds and gains (linear amplifier, offset voltage, half-wave rectifier) in parallel to generate a plurality of stages, a plurality of folded lines can be set, thereby realizing an approximation of transmission characteristic of a logarithm amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Described below is the third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The confocal microscope to which the third embodiment of the present invention is applied has the same configuration as that according to the second embodiment. Therefore, only the portions different from those according to the second embodiment are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an explanatory view of the ill effects of the saturation of the output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">There is an upper limit of the output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>. When there occurs saturation by the upper limit, as indicated by “A” shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the voltage value of an output signal remains unchanged although the voltage value of an input signal becomes large. However, in this state, since the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> subtracts an output signal by the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> from the output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>, the voltage value of the output signal of the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> becomes smaller as the voltage value of the input signal becomes larger after the output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> is saturated by the upper limit as indicated by C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Thus, from the point where the upper limit is reached, an image is displayed with a decreasing brightness as the brightness of the specimen <b>11</b> becomes higher. This holds good when the gain of the photodetector <b>15</b> is changed such that it can be larger. The third embodiment has been designed to suppress the ill effects for the above-mentioned reason.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Described below is the fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Using the folded line characteristic, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as compared with the linear characteristic, the increment of the output signal for the increment becomes smaller in the portion in which an input signal is large, and the bright portion is compressed. Therefore, when the specimen <b>11</b> is observed with an eye kept on the bright portion, it is desired to use the linear characteristic. Thus, the fourth embodiment utilizes the switching between the use of the linear characteristic with the output signal from the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> output to the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> and the use of the folded line characteristic of subtracting the output signal from the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> to the output signal from the first linear amplifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The confocal microscope to which the fourth embodiment of the present invention is applied has the same configuration as the first embodiment. Therefore, only the portions different from those of the first embodiment are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The switching of the characteristics can be realized by loading the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> with the function of selecting whether or not the calculation of the output signal from the half-wave rectifier circuit <b>22</b> for the output signal from the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> is performed. Otherwise, it can be realized by changing the offset voltage to the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> because the signal output by the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> matches the output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> until the input signal from the photodetector <b>15</b> to the second linear amplifier <b>21</b> exceeds the offset voltage and therefore the linear characteristic can be actually used if a voltage value of V<b>1</b> or larger (when the input signal is the voltage value of V<b>1</b>, the voltage value of the output signal of the first linear amplifier <b>20</b> is V<b>0</b> and saturated) is set as the offset voltage. In this example, it is assumed that the characteristics can be switched using the signal to the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b>. With the assumption, the switching of characteristics can be realized by the microscope control circuit <b>18</b> changing a signal (hereinafter referred to as a “switch signal”) to be output to the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> of the amplifier <b>16</b> at an instruction from an operator through, for example, the input device not shown in the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Since the bright portion is compressed in the folded line characteristic, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the observation condition for switching from the linear characteristic (A) to the folded line characteristic (C) is performed, the dynamic range of the output signal is narrowed by the switch, and the entire brightness seems to have been lowered. Thus, it is necessary for the operator (user) to make an adjustment to raise the brightness, and quick observation cannot be performed. On the other hand, when the observation condition is changed to switch from the folded line characteristic to the linear characteristic, the switching expands the dynamic range of the output signal, thereby easily generating saturation in which the bright portion exceeds the display limit. Therefore, the operator has to make an adjustment to reduce the brightness, thereby also disabling quick observation. As a result, according to the present embodiment, automatically corresponding to the switch of the characteristics, and appropriate output signal can be constantly output from the amplifier <b>16</b>, thereby avoiding the reduction in efficiency of the operation by the brightness adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">According to the present embodiment, a device having the function of amplifying an electric signal at an electronic level such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT), etc. is adopted as the photodetector <b>15</b>. They are adopted as the photodetector <b>15</b> because they can amplify at a high S/N ratio which cannot be performed by an electric circuit. Other devices, for example, an APD, than the PMT can be used as the <b>15</b> if the above-mentioned amplification can be performed. The change of the amplification rate of the photodetector <b>15</b> is made at an instruction from the microscope control circuit <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When switching the characteristics is indicated by an operator through the input device not shown in the attached drawings, the microscope control circuit <b>18</b> changes a switch signal for input to the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b>. Depending on the switching contents, the amplification rate of the photodetector <b>15</b> is changed correspondingly. If the switching from the linear characteristic to the folded line characteristic is performed, a higher amplification rate is set for the photodetector <b>15</b>. If the switching from the folded line characteristic to the linear characteristic is performed, a lower amplification rate is set for the photodetector <b>15</b>. Thus, the level of the input signal input from the photodetector <b>15</b> to the amplifier <b>16</b> is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">By the above-mentioned adjustment, if the switching from the linear characteristic to the folded line characteristic is performed, the output signal of the addition/subtraction circuit <b>23</b> can be changed from C indicated by the solid line to D indicated by the broken line by performing the amplification on a larger scale as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to allow the photodetector <b>15</b> to amplify the input signal at a higher amplification rate. As a result, for example, if the output voltage range from 0 to V<b>0</b> is obtained by the range of the detection signal <b>0</b> to V<b>1</b> from the specimen <b>11</b> in the linear characteristic, then the output voltage range from 0 to V<b>0</b> can be obtained by the range of the detection signal <b>0</b> to V<b>1</b> although the switching to the folded line characteristic is performed. With the folded line characteristic, the S/N ratio in the dark portion can be improved. Thus, by constantly maintaining the output dynamic range, the impression of the entire brightness change by the switching of the characteristic is not given to a user. It indicates that when the brightness is adjusted to obtain an appropriate image before the switching, the appropriate image can also be obtained after the switching. Therefore, the operator can continue the observation on an appropriate image after the switching of characteristics. Since the brightness adjustment can be optimally and automatically performed, the necessity to make the adjustments can be avoided, and the operability and the convenience can be improved. This holds true with the switching from the folded line characteristic to the linear characteristic.</p>

Thus, the apparent brightness of an image an be maintained at a substantially constant level although the object lens <b>10</b> is switched. As a result, since an operator can continue observation in the optimum state after switching the object lens <b>10</b>, the operability and convenience can be outstandingly improved. When a focusing amendment is also made between the object lenses <b>10</b>, the necessity to make a readjustment of the focal position in addition to the brightness adjustment in response to the switching of the object lenses <b>10</b> can also be removed. Therefore, the operability and convenience can be further improved.</p>
