<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an internal power supply voltage generating circuit of semiconductor memory devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to an internal power supply voltage generating circuit with reduced standby current of a Pseudo Static Random Access Memory (PSRAM).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, the standby current of a PSRAM consists of the consumption current of internal circuits of semiconductor memory devices, the refresh current, and the leakage current. In the prior art, the ratio of the leakage current to the standby current is very small. As transistors and various elements gradually become very small, the ratio of the leakage current to the standby current becomes very large and cannot be ignored. This leakage current is mostly a channel leakage current of the transistor and is proportional to the width of the transistor. As mobile devices become popular, the need for low-power and high-density memory becomes important. Thus, an increase of the leakage current becomes a significant problem.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an internal power supply voltage generating circuit and internal circuits using an internal power supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the internal power supply voltage generating circuit <b>10</b> includes a plurality of internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n</i>. Each of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n </i>generates an external power supply voltage (Vext) and an internal power supply voltage (Vint). The generated internal power supply voltage (Vint) is used to drive internal circuits of semiconductor memory devices such as a high voltage (VPP) generator <b>20</b>, a cell power supply voltage (Vcore) generator <b>30</b> and a peripheral circuit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n </i>is under the control of a deep power-down detection signal (PWb). The deep power-down detection signal (PWb) becomes a logical high in deep power-down mode to turn off the PMOS transistors of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n</i>, and becomes a logical low in modes other than the deep power-down mode to turn on the PMOS transistors of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n</i>. If the PMOS transistors of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n </i>are turned on, the current flows and the internal power supply voltage (Vint) is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The internal power supply voltage drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n </i>generate the current in order to generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in standby mode. However, the current generated in the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n </i>become the origin of the leakage current in standby mode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One method of reducing the leakage current is to reduce the width of the PMOS transistors of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n</i>. It is, however, impossible to reduce the width of the internal power drivers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>10</b>-<i>n </i>constantly. This is because the current (i.e., the internal power supply voltage) necessary for the operation (driving) of the internal circuits must be supplied in a mode other than the standby mode or the deep power-down mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to reduce the leakage current in standby mode by driving only a predetermined internal power driver but not driving the remaining internal power drivers in standby mode.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Since the embodiments are provided so that a person of ordinary skill in the art will be able to understand the present invention, they may be modified in various manners and the scope of the present invention is not limited by the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the present invention, in a standby mode, only internal power drivers necessary for the operation of internal circuits (i.e., the minimum internal power supply voltage level necessary to drive the internal circuits is maintained) are driven, and the remaining internal power drivers are not driven. Therefore, the leakage current in standby mode can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an internal power supply voltage generating circuit and internal circuits according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the internal power supply voltage generating circuit <b>100</b> includes at least one or more first internal power drivers <b>110</b> and a plurality of second internal power drivers <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>to reduce the leakage current in a standby mode.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first internal power drivers <b>110</b> are provided to supply the current necessary for the operation of internal circuits <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> in standby mode. In general, the greater the chip size, the greater the number of the first internal power drivers <b>110</b>. The first internal power drivers <b>110</b> do not operate in a deep power-down mode, but generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in all modes (including standby mode) other than the deep power-down mode.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The plurality of second internal power drivers <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>do not operate in standby mode or the deep power-down mode, and generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in all modes other than the deep power-down mode and standby mode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The internal circuits, i.e., the VPP generator <b>200</b>, the Vcore generator <b>300</b>, the peripheral circuit <b>400</b>, etc., are driven by the internal power supply voltage (Vint) generated from the first and second internal power drivers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n. </i></p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first internal power drivers <b>110</b> do not generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in the deep power-down mode (i.e., stop the supply of current), but generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in all modes (including the standby mode) other than the deep power-down mode. Furthermore, the first internal power driver <b>110</b> consists of a PMOS transistor for generating an external power supply voltage (Vext) as the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in response to the deep power-down detection signal (PWb). The PMOS transistor is turned off the in deep power-down mode in response to the deep power-down detection signal (PWb) of a logical high, and is turned on in all modes other than the deep power-down mode in response to the deep power-down detection signal (PWb) of a logical low. When the PMOS transistor is turned on and the current flows, the internal power supply voltage (Vint) is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each of the second internal power drivers <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>includes each of internal power supply voltage generators DRV<b>1</b> to DRVn and each of back bias controllers BBC<b>1</b> to BBCn.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the internal power supply voltage generators DRV<b>1</b> to DRVn does not generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in the deep power-down mode and the standby mode, but generates the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in all modes other than the deep power-down mode and the standby mode.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, each of the internal power supply voltage generators DRV<b>1</b> to DRVn receives the high voltage (VPP) as a back bias in standby mode and precludes the leakage current of the internal power supply voltage generator DRV that does not operate in standby mode, and receives the internal power supply voltage (Vint) as a back bias in all modes other than the deep power-down mode and the standby mode and generates the internal power supply voltage (Vint) using the external power supply voltage (Vext).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each of the back bias controllers BBC<b>1</b> to BBCn transfers the high voltage (VPP) to each of the internal power supply voltage generators DRV<b>1</b> to DRVn in the standby mode, and transfers the internal power supply voltage (Vint) to each of the internal power supply voltage generators DRV<b>1</b> to DRVn in all modes other than the standby mode. The high voltage (VPP) and the internal power supply voltage (Vint) output from the back bias controllers BB<b>1</b> to BBCn are used as a back bias of each of the internal power supply voltage generators DRV<b>1</b> to DRVn.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed block diagram of the second power driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the internal power supply voltage generator DRV includes PMOS transistors P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. The back bias controller BBC includes two transfer gates TG<b>1</b>, TG<b>2</b> and an inverter IV<b>1</b>. In this case, the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> is used to preclude the supply of the internal power supply voltage (Vint) in the deep power-down mode, and does not generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint). The PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is used to preclude the supply of the internal power supply voltage (Vint) the in standby mode, and does not generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint). The transfer gate TG<b>1</b> transfers the internal power supply voltage (Vint) as a back bias of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> in all modes other than the standby mode. The transfer gate TG<b>2</b> transfers the high voltage (VPP) as a back bias of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> in the standby mode.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, the operation of each of constituent elements of the internal power supply voltage generator DRV will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">First, in the deep power-down mode, i.e., when the deep power-down detection signal (PWb) is a logical high, the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> is turned off, so that the internal power supply voltage (Vint) is not generated. In all modes other than the deep power-down mode, i.e., when the deep power-down detection signal (PWb) is a logical low, the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> is turned on to transfer the current generated by the external power supply voltage (Vext), thus generating the internal power supply voltage (Vint).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, in the standby mode, i.e., when a standby detection signal (STDE) is a logical high, the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is turned off and the high voltage (VPP) as a back gate is applied, so that a threshold voltage (Vt) of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> rises. If the threshold voltage of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> rises, the leakage current is not generated although the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is turned off. In all modes other than standby mode, i.e., when the standby detection signal (STDE) is a logical low, the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is turned on, and the internal power supply voltage (Vint) is applied as a back gate (as a back bias). Thus, the internal power supply voltage (Vint) generated from the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> is output.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The operation of each of the constituent elements of the back bias controller BBC will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the standby mode, i.e., when the standby detection signal (STDE) is a logical high, the transfer gate TG<b>2</b> is turned on, so that the high voltage (VPP) is transferred thereto as a back gate of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b>. In all modes other than standby mode, i.e., when the standby detection signal (STDE) is a logical low, the transfer gate TG<b>1</b> is turned on, so that the internal power supply voltage (Vint) is transferred as a back gate of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The above descriptions can be summarized in short as follows. In the standby mode, only the first internal power drivers <b>110</b> operate to generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint), and the second internal power drivers <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>do not operate. In the deep power-down mode, since the first and second internal power drivers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>are not driven, the internal power supply voltage (Vint) is not generated. In all modes other than the standby mode and the deep power-down mode, both the first and second internal power drivers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>operate to generate the internal power supply voltage (Vint).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, in the standby mode, only the first internal voltage drivers <b>110</b> are driven but the remaining second internal voltage drivers <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<i>n </i>are not driven, in order to maintain a minimum internal power supply voltage level necessary for driving the internal circuits. It is thus possible to reduce the leakage current in the standby mode. That is, the number of transistors constituting drivers is reduced due to the reduction of the number of drivers that are driven. Accordingly, a channel leakage current of the transistors is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, according to the present invention, the leakage current is reduced in standby mode of a PSRAM and other mobile device. Accordingly, the entire power consumption can be significantly reduced. This leads to an increased use time of mobile devices necessary for low-power consumption.</p>
