<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed, in general, to computer-aided design and modeling.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computer-aided design and modeling (CAD/CAM) have become an integral part of the process for designing and manufacturing any number of components. By designing, modeling, and revising the components in a data processing system, the product can be visualized and optimized as it is being developed to ensure a correct design before any actual manufacturing takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The ability to quickly find potential design problems which will impact manufacturing with high costs or other problems is a great advantage during this process. To validate designed product models, it is necessary to define the character of each face and edge to determine the interrelation of each modeled part. There is currently no accurate, automated method for finding manufacturing related features such as parting lines, undercuts, crossover faces, cavity and core regions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is, therefore, a need in the art for a system, process and computer program product for enabling an efficient and automated identification and characterization of the above manufacturing related features in product models.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A preferred embodiment provides a system, method, and computer program product for decomposing a product model into manufacturing specific regions. Further, a preferred embodiment provides a corresponding system, method, and computer program product incorporating an object view visualization method for decomposing a product model into manufacturing specific regions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that they may readily use the conception and the specific embodiment disclosed as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Before undertaking the DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION below, it may be advantageous to set forth definitions of certain words or phrases used throughout this patent document: the terms “include” and “comprise,” as well as derivatives thereof, mean inclusion without limitation; the term “or” is inclusive, meaning and/or; the phrases “associated with” and “associated therewith,” as well as derivatives thereof, may mean to include, be included within, interconnect with, contain, be contained within, connect to or with, couple to or with, be communicable with, cooperate with, interleave, juxtapose, be proximate to, be bound to or with, have, have a property of, or the like; and the term “controller” means any device, system or part thereof that controls at least one operation, whether such a device is implemented in hardware, firmware, software or some combination of at least two of the same.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in Table 1 and understood by skilled artisans, cavity and core faces are used for cavity and core design of molds and tools respectively, and must be identified and extracted out as cavity and core regions for mold/tool design.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Parting lines are the boundary (with maximum length) of cavity and core regions, from which parting surfaces will be created. Patch loops are the boundaries of cavity and core regions other than parting lines, and are used to create patch surfaces for mold/tool design.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Crossover region faces are the faces which partly stay in cavity side and partly stay in core side, so they need to be split in the middle (along isocline) to avoid undercuts for mold/tool release. Crossover vertical faces are the faces without draft, they need to have draft added or assigned either in the cavity side or the core side.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Undercut faces need special mechanism systems (lifter or slider) in mold/tool design, which incur a correspondingly high cost. Unnecessary undercuts need to be removed in product design to achieve design optimization. Undercut edges are used to help identify undercut faces.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An object view visualization method is used to decompose a product model into manufacturing-specific regions. The method is described below:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First, based on draw (mold release) direction, the top and bottom views for the product model are generated. Visible and invisible faces and edges of the product model in each view are determined and assigned an object name as shown in Table 2:</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrate an exemplary model as decomposed into cavity and core regions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the product model in top view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the product model in bottom view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows the cavity region of the product model. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> show the core region of the model. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> shows the parting lines and patch loops of the product model.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The disclosed system and method provides a much more accurate solution in finding parting lines, undercuts, crossover faces than many of the existing solutions. In current solutions addressing the above issue, classification of faces in the product model is through the use of face draft analysis. Based on the results of face draft analysis, faces are first put into the positive and negative groups. Next, the positive faces are assumed to be the cavity faces, and negative faces for the core faces. This assumption may not be always correct because a positive face may be a core face and a negative face may be a cavity face. Therefore, those solutions will often generate incorrect results in finding parting lines and undercuts.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The disclosed system and method can automatically recognize cavity and core regions, a capability unavailable in the current product market.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flowchart of a process in accordance with a preferred embodiment. Here, the system will first select a product solid model, either automatically or by receiving a user selection (step <b>305</b>). A draw direction (mold release direction) will then be specified, either by the user or according to the model design file (step <b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The system will then generate top view (step <b>315</b>) and identify all faces and edges of model which are visible in top view (step <b>320</b>). The outputs will be as shown in Table 2: F1, Non F1, E1 and Non E1.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The system will then generate bottom view (step <b>325</b>) and identify all faces and edges of model which are visible in bottom view (step <b>330</b>). As above, the outputs will be as shown in Table 2: F2, Non-F2, E2 and Non-E2.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The system will then assign manufacturing-specific regions to each face and edge based on the rules shown in Table 3, above (step <b>335</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The rules are preferably applied in the following sequence:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041">1) If a face is &lt;F1 only&gt;, then it is assigned to the Cavity Face region.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0042">2) If a face is &lt;F2 only&gt;, then it is assigned to the Core Face region.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0043">3) If a face is &lt;F1 and F2&gt;, then it is assigned to the Crossover Face region.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0044">4) If a face is &lt;Non-F1 and Non-F2&gt;, then it is assigned to the Undercut Face region</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0045">5) If an edge is &lt;Non-E1 and Non-E2&gt;, then it is assigned to the Undercut Edge region.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0046">6) If an edge has its two adjacent faces belonging to a cavity and a core face each, then it is assigned to the Parting Edge region.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0047">7) Parting loops are comprised of parting edges, among all parting loops. A Parting Line Loop is defined as the one with maximum loop length against the draw direction.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0048">8) After the parting line loop is identified, the other loops are Patch Loops (internal holes).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">Finally, the system will store the assigned manufacturing-specific regions (step <b>340</b>).</p>
