<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to radio frequency (RF) receivers and, more particularly, to a latch driver circuit employed as a local oscillator driver for driving a passive mixer of an RF receiver.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is known, a passive mixer is often used in a linear RF receiver system to meet stringent linearity and noise requirements. An example of a passive mixer is a double balanced resistive Field Effect Transistor (FET) mixer, where all the ports are operated differentially. In the FET mixer, local oscillator (LO) signals are applied to the gates, RF signals are applied to sources (or drains) and intermediate frequency (IF) signals are taken from the drains (or sources). In order to achieve the high linearity and low noise requirements, a relatively large LO signal is required, which LO signal is typically greater than 10 dBm.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The resistive FET mixer works by changing the resistance between gate to source from low to high resistance. The high intercept point (IP<sub>3</sub>) of the FET mixer is achieved by operating the FETs of the FET mixer at a linear region and completely switching the gates on and off. Therefore, it is important to properly bias the FETs of the FET mixer by apply a relatively large LO signal to the FET mixer. The large LO signal applied to the FET mixer is also important for achieving a low conversion loss and thus a low noise figure. A typical LO signal level that is required to achieve an IP<sub>3 </sub>of greater than 15 dBm is over 10 dBm. In order to deliver 10 dBm of power in a 50 ohm system, for example, a peak-to-peak current of 40 mA<sub>p-p </sub>or equivalently peak-to-peak voltage of 2 V<sub>p-p </sub>is required. Accordingly, the LO signal should be amplified from 0 dBm, which is the typical output power level of the LO, to 10 dBm for properly driving the FET mixer. In order to amplify the LO signal from 0 dBm to 10 dBm, however, requires that the LO signal be passed through a linear amplifier prior to being provided to the FET mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One drawback or disadvantage to using a linear amplifier to boost the power level of the LO signal from 0 dBm to 10 dBm and to provide the minimum peak-to-peak current of 40 mA<sub>p-p </sub>is the excessive power required by the linear amplifier itself. In this example, a minimum of 20 mA of bias current is needed to operate the linear amplifier. This power required to operate the linear amplifier (e.g., 20 mA) is a substantial portion of the overall power dissipation of a typical RF receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would, therefore, be desirable to overcome the aforesaid and other disadvantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A driver circuit that is operative to drive a passive mixer located in a radio-frequency (RF) receiver is set forth. The driver circuit includes a power supply and a biasing circuit that is operative to enable and/or drive elements of the driver circuit. A differential amplifier stage of the driver circuit is coupled to the supply and to the biasing circuit. The differential amplifier stage is adapted to receive first and second input signals from a local oscillator and to process the first and second input signals for providing first and second amplified signals as an output. A latch stage of the driver circuit is coupled to the differential amplifier stage, supply and biasing circuit. The latch stage is adapted to receive and process the first and second amplified signals, as provided by the differential amplifier stage, for providing latched versions of the first and second amplified signals. A filtering stage of the driver circuit is coupled to the latch stage. The filtering stage is adapted to receive and filter the latched versions of the first and second amplified signals for providing first and second filtered signals, wherein each of the first and second filtered signals includes predetermined signal content associated with at least one predetermined frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the filtering stage of the driver circuit includes a band-pass filter adapted to control the at least one predetermined frequency range to include a fundamental frequency range. In one example, the fundamental frequency range ranges from approximately 8 GHz to approximately 9.2 GHz. Furthermore, one exemplary circuit topology of the filtering stage may include a tank circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect, the driver circuit may further include a signal conditioning stage coupled to the differential amplifier stage. The signal conditioning stage is adapted to provide preliminary filtering to the first and second amplified signals for removing predetermined harmonic signal content from the first and second amplified signals while minimizing any signal amplitude degradation to the first and second amplified signals. In one aspect, the signal conditioning stage may include a first inductor and capacitor pair coupled in parallel and having first and second terminals. The first terminal of the first inductor and capacitor pair may be coupled to the supply and the second terminal of the first inductor and capacitor pair may be coupled to a first terminal of a first resistor. A second terminal of the first resistor may be coupled to communicate with the first amplified signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the signal conditioning stage may further include a second inductor and capacitor pair coupled in parallel and having first and second terminals. The first terminal of the second inductor and capacitor pair may be coupled to the supply and the second terminal of the second inductor and capacitor pair may be coupled to a first terminal of a second resistor.

The first transistor may further include a first gate terminal that may be coupled to a gate biasing source and a first source terminal that may be coupled to communicate with the first amplified signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides a relatively low power, low noise figure, latch driver circuit. The latch driver circuit may be employed to drive a number of devices and/or circuits, such as a passive mixer of an RF receiver, which may be incorporated in a radar system, wire-less telecommunication device and the like. When the latch driver circuit is incorporated in a radar system, such as a phased array radar systems which itself may incorporate a number of RF receivers, the overall power consumption and noise figure of the radar system may be significantly reduced, as will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, shown is a high level functional block diagram of a radar system <b>10</b> incorporating the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> of the present invention. The radar system <b>10</b> includes an RF transmitter portion <b>14</b> and an RF receiver portion <b>16</b>. The RF transmitter and receiver portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the radar system <b>10</b> are both coupled to a common antenna <b>18</b>, via a duplexer <b>20</b>. The duplexer <b>20</b> operates as a high speed switch for rapidly multiplexing between the RF transmitter and the RF receiver portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the radar system <b>10</b> to couple the RF transmitter portion <b>14</b> to the antenna <b>18</b> during the energy transmission stage of operation of the radar system <b>10</b> and to couple the RF receiver portion <b>16</b> to the antenna <b>18</b> during the energy or echo receive stage of operation of the radar system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the exemplary embodiment, the RF transmitter portion <b>14</b> of the radar system <b>10</b> includes a waveform generator <b>22</b> coupled to a power amplifier <b>24</b>. The waveform generator <b>22</b> is adapted for generating a repetitive train of short pulses that are subsequently provided to the antenna <b>18</b>, via the power amplifier <b>22</b> and duplexer <b>20</b>, for radiating the train of pulses out into space. The RF receiver portion <b>16</b> of the radar system <b>10</b> includes a low noise amplifier <b>26</b> coupled to the duplexer <b>20</b> as well as to a passive mixer <b>28</b> (e.g., mixer that does not have any gain). The passive mixer <b>28</b> is coupled to a latch driver <b>12</b>, which driver <b>12</b> is coupled to a local oscillator <b>30</b>. The passive mixer <b>28</b> is further coupled to an intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifier and filtering portion <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, which is coupled to a phase detector <b>34</b>. The phase detector <b>34</b> is coupled to a video amplifier <b>36</b>, which is finally coupled to a display <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally in this arrangement of the radar system <b>10</b>, RF energy or echos (collectively referred to herein as “RF signal”) sensed by the antenna <b>18</b> is sent to the RF receiver portion <b>16</b> of the radar system <b>10</b>, via the duplexer <b>20</b>. The RF receiver portion <b>16</b> serves to separate the desired RF signal from the ever-present noise and other interfering signals, as well as to amplify the RF signal sufficiently to actuate the display <b>38</b>. At microwave frequencies, the noise at the RF receiver output <b>37</b> is typically that generated by the RF receiver portion <b>16</b> itself rather than external noise that enters the RF receiver <b>16</b>, via the antenna <b>18</b>. The input stage <b>39</b> of the RF receiver <b>16</b> should not introduce excessive noise, which would interfere with the RF signal to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The passive mixer <b>28</b> operates to translate the receiver RF signal to an IF signal by mixing the RF signal with a signal provided by the LO (e.g., LO signal), which is received at the mixer <b>28</b>, via the low power, low noise figure, latch driver circuit <b>12</b> of the present invention, as will be described in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gain of the IF amplifier <b>32</b><i>a </i>results in an increase in the IF signal level. The IF amplifier <b>32</b><i>a </i>also includes the function of the matched filter <b>32</b><i>b</i>, which operates to maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio. Maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the matched filter <b>32</b><i>b </i>maximizes the delectability of the IF signal. The phase detector <b>34</b> receives and processes the IF signal to extract the Doppler frequency by comparison with a reference signal at the transmitted frequency. The video amplifier <b>36</b> raises the signal power of the extracted Doppler frequency to a level suitable for actuating the display <b>38</b>. A threshold may be established at the output of the video amplifier <b>36</b> to permit the detection decision to be made. If the output of the video amplifier <b>36</b> crosses the threshold, a target (not shown) is said to be present and such target is illustrated on the display <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the low power, low noise figure latch driver circuit <b>12</b> of the present invention. The latch driver circuit <b>12</b> includes a differential amplifier stage <b>40</b> coupled to a latch stage <b>42</b>. The latch stage <b>42</b> is further coupled to filtering stage <b>44</b>, which in the exemplary embodiment may include a band-pass filter.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The differential amplifier stage <b>40</b> includes first and second transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> which respectively include collector terminals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a </i>coupled to a supply <b>50</b> (e.g., VCC), via respective first and second load resistors <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. A base terminal <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>of each of the first and second transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are respectively coupled to receive a plurality of signals from the local oscillator <b>30</b>. The first and second transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> each further include an emitter terminal <b>46</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>c </i>which is coupled to a collector terminal <b>56</b><i>b </i>of a third transistor <b>56</b>.

The third transistor <b>56</b> further includes an emitter terminal <b>56</b><i>c</i>, which is coupled to a Direct Current (D.C.) biasing circuit <b>60</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The latch driver circuit <b>12</b> of the present invention further includes the filtering stage <b>44</b><i>a </i>having input ports <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>and output ports <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>. The input ports <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>of the filter stage <b>44</b> are respectively coupled to the first and second output ports <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the latch stage <b>42</b> and the output ports <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b </i>of the filtering stage <b>44</b> are coupled to the passive mixer <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), as will be described in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the exemplary embodiment, the filtering stage <b>44</b> includes a band-pass filter, which is operative to filter higher order harmonic signal content from the latched versions of the first and second amplified signals for providing respective first and second LO signals (e.g., first and second filtered signals, as realized at the output of the filtering stage <b>44</b> and as provided to one input port of the mixer <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>)) having signal content at a predetermined frequency, such as the fundamental frequency of the first and second amplified signals (e.g., GHz range). In an embodiment, the higher order signal content filtered from the latched versions of the first and second amplified signals may include third order harmonics. In other embodiments, the filtering stage <b>44</b> can be further tuned to filter fifth and seventh order harmonics from the first and second amplified signals to provide the respective first and second LO signals. It should be understood that the filtering stage <b>44</b> may reduce the amplitude of the first and second amplified signals to provide the respective first and second LO signals at the fundamental frequency, and thus, it may be necessary to provide the first and second LO signals to an amplifier (not shown) prior to providing the first and second LO signals to the passive mixer circuit <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first and second mixer signals, which have maximum signal content at the fundamental frequency are particularly useful in driving the passive mixer <b>28</b> because the passive mixer <b>28</b> is specifically tuned to mix the fundamental frequency portion of the LO signal provided by the local oscillator <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with the RF signal provided by the antenna <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to provide an output at the IF. Since the fundamental frequency portion of the LO signal is provided by the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> to the passive mixer <b>28</b> with a maximum concentration of signal content at the fundamental frequency, the mixer <b>28</b> will be mixing the maximum power level LO signal with the RF signal for maximizing the conversion gain of the passive mixer <b>28</b>. In other words, maximizing the conversion gain of the mixer <b>28</b> using the maximum power level LO signal, as provided by the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> of the present invention, minimizes conversion losses or noise figure of the passive mixer <b>28</b> and permits the mixer <b>28</b> to provide an IF output having a relatively greater power level.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the exemplary embodiment, the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> may be categorized as a regenerative circuit, which can deliver a relatively large voltage output while consuming minimal current. The current consumption of the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> may be determined as the peak-to-peak voltage divided by the either the first or second load resistor <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> (e.g., R<sub>L1 </sub>or R<sub>L2</sub>). In this example, the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> provides differential output signals (e.g., first and second amplified signals) from the collector terminals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the first and second transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, respectively. Therefore, each of the differential outputs should provide 1 V<sub>p-p </sub>(or 2 V<sub>p-p </sub>differential). The first and/or second load resistor, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, should not be set arbitrarily high to reduce the bias current if the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> is to operate at a high frequency. For instance, if the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> is to operate at approximately 10 GHz, the RC time constant should be less than 10 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one specific example, the first and second load resistors <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> can each include a 300 ohm resistor and a 3.3 mA bias current may be provided to emitters <b>46</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>c</i>, <b>62</b><i>c</i>, <b>64</b><i>c </i>of respective first, second, fourth and fifth transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. Under these operating characteristics, the latch driver circuit <b>12</b> can operate to drive the passive mixer <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with approximately 10 to 12 dBm of LO driver output power while only consuming approximately 3.3 mA of bias current (as opposed to a conventional linear amplifier being used to drive the passive mixer <b>28</b>, which consumes approximately 20 mA of bias current to provide the passive mixer <b>28</b> with approximately 10 to 12 dBm of LO driver output power).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During operation of the latch driver circuit <b>12</b>, the first clock signal provided by the first clock circuit <b>58</b> is controlled to turn the amplifier stage <b>40</b> on and the second clock signal provided by the second clock circuit <b>76</b> is controlled to turn the latch stage <b>42</b> off. More precisely, the first clock signal provided by the first clock circuit <b>58</b> is controlled to provide a positive voltage value to the base <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the third transistor <b>56</b> for turning on the third transistor <b>56</b> to permit the D.C. bias circuit <b>60</b> to provide biasing current to the emitters <b>46</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>c </i>of the first and second transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, which enables the first and second transistors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to respectively pass positive and negative local oscillator signals from each of their respective bases <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>to their respective collectors <b>46</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>c</i>. Furthermore, current provided by the supply <b>50</b> and flowing through the first load resistor <b>52</b> combines with the current flowing from the collector <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the first transistor <b>46</b> to provide the first amplified signal. At the same time, current provided by the supply <b>50</b> and flowing through the second load resistor <b>54</b> combines with the current flowing from the collector <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the second transistor <b>48</b> to provide the second amplified signal. After the first and second amplified signals are provided to the latch stage <b>42</b> of the latch driver circuit <b>12</b>, as will be described below, the first clock signal provided by the first clock circuit <b>58</b> is controlled to turn off the amplifier stage <b>40</b> and the second clock signal provided by the second clock circuit <b>76</b> is controlled to turn on the latch stage <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first amplified signal (e.g., positive current value) follows the signal path denoted by the dashed line labeled as “A,” which provides to the first amplified signal to the latch stage <b>42</b>.

Also, the bandpass filtering features of the signal conditioning stage <b>90</b> incurs a loss because it is implemented using inductors <b>92</b>, <b>96</b> having substantially finite Q values of approximately 10 (ten). However, the shunt peaking features of the signal conditioning stage <b>90</b> operates to substantially recover or compensate for this loss in signal.
