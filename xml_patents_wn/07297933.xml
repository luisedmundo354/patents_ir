<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a micro-tip for near-field light, a method for generating near-field light by using the micro-tip, a probe including the micro-tip, a storage apparatus including the probe, a surface observation apparatus, an exposure apparatus, a method for manufacturing a device and a method for manufacturing a probe including the micro-tip for near-field light.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, a scanning tunneling microscope (hereafter referred to as ‘STM’) capable of directly observing the electron structure of surface atoms of a conductor was developed (G. Binning et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 49, 57 (1983)), and thereby, a real space image was able to be measured with high resolution regardless of single crystal or amorphous substance. Since then, considerable researches have been done on scanning probe microscopes (hereafter referred to as ‘SPMs’) in the field of evaluation of microstructures of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of SPMs include, for example, scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs), atomic force microscopes (AFMs), magnetic force microscopes (MFMs) and scanning near-field optical microscopes (SNOMs), in which surface structures are detected using a tunneling current, an interatomic force, a magnetic force, light and the like attained by bringing a probe including a micro-tip close to a specimen to be evaluated. The SNOM is a type of SPM, and performs a measurement through the use of near-field light generated from a micro-aperture with a resolution of λ/2 or less which has been considered to be impossible to achieve with respect to conventional optical microscopes. Consequently, fine pattern shapes of specimen surfaces and the like are nondestructively measured with high resolution. Furthermore, since the SNOM can use specimens of living bodies, cells and other materials which were conventionally difficult to be observed, various types of subject can be observed, and therefore, the SNOM is applied in wide areas.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A sharp micro-tip was proposed for generating near-field light in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-293134. However, in the case where near-field light is generated using a micro-aperture provided at the tip of the sharp micro-tip, when the aperture diameter of the above-mentioned micro-aperture is decreased to improve the resolution, the efficiency of generation of the near-field light is reduced. Therefore, further improvement of the efficiency of generation is required. When the tip is sharpened, prevention of deformation in the shape of the micro-tip during the manufacturing process and during use is also required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above-mentioned problems, and to provide a micro-tip for near-field light, which can generate near-field light with high efficiency and which is unlikely to deform during the manufacturing process, during use or the like, a method for generating near-field light by using the micro-tip, a probe including the micro-tip, a storage apparatus including the probe, a surface observation apparatus, an exposure apparatus, a method for manufacturing a device and a method for manufacturing a probe including the micro-tip for near-field light.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the above-mentioned configuration is applied, in particular, the top of a cone-shaped micro-tip is composed of a plane in order to detect or apply near-field light, and a through hole is provided at the top, a high generation efficiency of near-field light can be achieved. When the interior of the micro-tip is in the shape of a cone, incident light is reflected at the inner surface, and light-collecting spots are spatially generated due to interference and collection in the interior of the micro-tip. Therefore, the top of the interior of the micro-tip is not made into the shape of a sharp cone but made into the shape of a plane, the locations of the light-collecting spots due to the inner surface reflection are changed, the location of a micro-aperture provided at the tip of the micro-tip for generating near-field light is arranged in the vicinity of the above-mentioned light-collecting spots, and thereby, high generation efficiency of near-field light can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is also made clear that the locations of generation of the above-mentioned light-collecting spots vary depending on not only the shape of the micro-tip, but also the polarization direction of the light incident into the micro-tip. Consequently, both of the shape of the interior of the micro-tip and the polarization direction of the light incident into the micro-tip must be taken into consideration for generation of near-field light with high efficiency. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are schematic diagrams showing change in the locations of light-collecting spots depending on the polarization direction when light enters into a micro-tip in the shape of a quadrangular pyramid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show electric field strengths in cross sections parallel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) and perpendicular (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), respectively, to the direction of the electric field of the incident light when a plane wave enters into the probe of the present invention from directly below. The light reflected at the inner surface of the cone causes interference, and as a result, spots, at which light is collected and thereby is enhanced, are generated in the interior of the cone. Black circles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> indicate the regions thereof. The number of spots decreases as the apex of the cone approaches, and no spot is generated in close vicinity to the apex. In a conventional near-field generation probe, the aperture is provided at the apex of the cone, and is at a distance from these spots. Consequently, the near-field light generated outside the aperture has a reduced intensity. In the present invention, the top of the cone is composed of a plane, and the plane is arranged in the vicinity of the location of this spot. As a result, the aperture is provided in the vicinity of the center of the spot or in the location including the center of the spot, and thereby, the intensity of the near-field light generated from the aperture toward the outside is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example in which the intensity of the near-field light generated varies with change in the size of the top plane of the interior of the micro-tip. That is, desirably, the shape of the interior of the micro-tip is made to be a rectangular pyramid in which the top is composed of a plane (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) while the size of the top is determined in consideration of the polarization direction of the incident light (in this example, when the wavelength of the incident light is 500 nm, and the material of the micro-tip is gold (Au), the top is in the shape of a rectangle in the order of 600 nm×800 nm). Numerical calculations show that the intensity of the near-field light generated under this optimum condition may be enhanced to about 40 times larger than that of the micro-tip having the interior in a sharpened shape. Furthermore, since sufficient effect of enhancing the near-field light can be expected even when there is an error in the order of 100 nm on a side basis with respect to the size of the rectangular top, an error in the order of 100 nm is acceptable with respect to the error in patterning, the error in the depth direction of etching and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the top of the exterior of the micro-tip is made to be flat in addition to the top of the interior of the micro-tip, a load applied to the top on a unit area basis is reduced in the case where the micro-tip is brought into contact with a specimen during the use of the micro-tip. Consequently, even when the micro-tip is brought into contact with a specimen to be observed or a subject to be processed, deformation of the micro-tip itself can be prevented. Furthermore, there is an effect of preventing breakage of the subject to be observed. When the plane portion of the top is supported by an inclined surface of the cone in a manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the strength against a force applied to the micro-tip in the horizontal direction can be improved compared with that of the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the probe constructed from the above-mentioned micro-tip, a surface observation apparatus having an improved speed of surface observation or information processing equipment capable of reducing a time for recording can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An exposure apparatus capable of forming a fine pattern at a high speed can be provided using the probe constructed from the above-mentioned micro-tip. Furthermore, a miniaturized, large-capacity optical memory can be realized by constructing a multi-probe from this probe.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the above-mentioned method for manufacturing a probe, by using semiconductor processing techniques, e.g., in particular, thermal oxidation of a silicon substrate and thin film formation with a vacuum apparatus, and by making into an appropriate shape in accordance with the use, a method for manufacturing a probe including a micro-tip with a micro-aperture can be realized, in which a micro-tip capable of generating near-field light with high efficiency can be formed with excellent reproducibility, and deformation of the micro-tip shape can be reduced during the manufacturing process. According to the above-mentioned method for manufacturing a probe, the yield is increased, and a micro-tip can be prepared in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A method for manufacturing a micro-tip including a micro-aperture of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A concave portion <b>3</b> is formed by crystal axis anisotropic etching on the surface of a first substrate <b>2</b> with surface orientation (<b>100</b>). At this time, the bottom of the concave portion <b>3</b> is not pointed, but is formed into the shape of a plane. Preferably, not all planes are made to be the (<b>100</b>) plane by etching, and etching is stopped at some midpoint condition when the concave portion is formed in the substrate by crystal axis anisotropic etching. Subsequently, a thermal oxidation film is formed on the surface of the concave portion <b>3</b>. This thermal oxidation film has a function as a releasing layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A first lightproof layer <b>5</b> is deposited on the surface of the first substrate <b>2</b> with a vacuum film formation apparatus (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>).

For example, when transfer is performed to an elastic subject, e.g. a cantilever, an AFM/SNOM combination probe can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first lightproof layer <b>5</b> on the releasing layer <b>4</b> is joined to the second substrate <b>6</b> or a third lightproof layer <b>11</b> on the second substrate <b>6</b>. In order to perform this, an alignment apparatus capable of holding each substrate with a vacuum chuck and the like is used. The first substrate <b>2</b> and the second substrate <b>6</b> are aligned, and are brought into contact while facing each other. Subsequently, a load is applied, so that the first lightproof layer <b>5</b> and the second substrate <b>6</b> or the third lightproof layer <b>11</b> on the second substrate <b>6</b> are joined (pressure-bonded).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Peeling is performed at the interface between the releasing layer <b>4</b> and the first lightproof layer <b>5</b>, and therefore, the first lightproof layer <b>5</b> is transferred onto the second substrate <b>6</b> or the third lightproof layer <b>11</b> on the second substrate <b>6</b>. That is, peeling is performed at the interface between the releasing layer <b>4</b> and the first lightproof layer <b>5</b> by separating the first substrate <b>2</b> and the second substrate <b>6</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A micro-aperture having a diameter of 100 nm or less is formed at the top of the micro-tip with a focused ion beam processing apparatus. In the above-mentioned example, the micro-tip was used after being pressure-bonded to another substrate. However, as another method for use, it can be considered that the micro-tip is used without being pressure-bonded to another substrate. A method for manufacturing a micro-tip suitable for such a use will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A concave portion having a flat bottom is formed on a Si substrate by using anisotropic etching. An etching-stop layer is formed on this concave portion, and back etching is performed from the reverse surface of the substrate by a technique of anisotropic etching and the like. At this time, etching is performed until the top of the concave portion is exposed. A micro-aperture is formed on the top of this exposed concave portion with a focused ion beam processing apparatus. A lightproof layer is formed on the substrate surface and therefore, a micro-tip is completed.</p>
