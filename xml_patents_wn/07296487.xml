<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/545,511 filed Feb. 18, 2004.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to force-sensing linkages and, in particular, to linkages used in aircraft control systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art related to linkages used in aircraft control systems includes U.S. Pat. No. 6,311,566 to Ferguson. This patent shows the use of an inner first tube, a second outer tube, a spring connecting the first and second tubes, a position sensor connected between the first and second tubes and a stop assembly stop assembly limits the relative longitudinal movement between the first and second tubes to a selected range.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The stop assembly includes an eccentrically positioned, or off-center hole, formed in an inwardly directed flange on one tube. A stop nut attached to the other tube is inserted through the off-center hole. When the stop nut is then centered, lips on the stop nut limit the relative longitudinal movement of the flange to the distance between the lips.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Assembly of this linkage is awkward and cumbersome. In addition, only a relatively small crescent shaped portion of the stop nut engages the flange.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem with this design is that friction forces between the tubes result in the generation of wear particles, contamination and inaccuracy of the force measurements provided by the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, this design does not provide any limits on angular movement between the tubes, simply relying on the rod ends remaining coplanar because of the orientation of respective mounting points.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A link and sensor assembly includes a first rod, a second rod received telescopingly within the first rod, a force sensor attached between the rods and a motion limiter. The force sensor has a longitudinal range of motion. The limiter limits longitudinal motion between the rods to the range of motion and limits angular motion between the rods.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, a link and sensor assembly <b>10</b> includes a first rod <b>12</b> and a second rod <b>14</b>. These rods are provided with attachment points <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, respectively. A cylindrical spring <b>20</b> is connected between the rods <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Also connected between the rods <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is a linear position sensor <b>22</b>. The sensor <b>22</b> may be, for example, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). LVDTs are well known in the position sensing art and will not be further described.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to provide increased reliability through redundancy, the assembly <b>10</b> may be provided with multiple LVDT sensors <b>22</b> (for example, three total) arranged in parallel relationship within the spring <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The travel of the rod <b>12</b> with respect to the rod <b>14</b> is limited by the lateral pin <b>24</b> in cooperation with the one or both of the apertures <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. The pin <b>24</b> may be, for example, press fit into the rod <b>14</b>, though other retention methods are possible (for example, welding, glueing, threading, or peening). It should be noted that the pin may be alternatively attached to the rod <b>12</b> which would then cooperate with an aperture in the rod <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The rod <b>14</b> is journalled within the bearings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The bearings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may be, for example, bushings or an annular array of ball-race linear bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In operation, the assembly <b>10</b> is attached by the mounting points <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> between respective unshown structures (for example, an actuator and a flight control surface). Relative longitudinal forces between the points <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> compress or tension the spring <b>20</b> resulting in longitudinal motion of the rod <b>14</b> with respect to the rod <b>12</b> as it telescopes within the rod <b>12</b>. This motion is indicative of the forces applied and is measured with the position sensor <b>22</b>. The sensed position in combination with the spring characteristic provides a measure of the applied force, the spring <b>20</b> and the position sensor <b>22</b> thus acting as a force sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To prevent motion beyond the capabilities of the spring <b>20</b> and/or the position sensor <b>22</b> (as well as to provide a link if the spring <b>20</b> breaks or becomes detached), the pin <b>24</b> in combination with one or more of the apertures <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> acts as a motion limiter. The extent the most restrictive aperture is oversized in the longitudinal direction limits the longitudinal motion of the rod <b>14</b> with respect to the rod <b>12</b> and the extent the most restrictive aperture is oversized in the circumferential direction limits the angular motion of the rod <b>14</b> with respect to the rod <b>12</b>. For example, the most restrictive aperture can be longitudinally elongate to allow a desired range of longitudinal motion while being of substantially the same dimension as the pin <b>24</b> in the circumferential direction to substantially eliminate any angular motion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The assembly <b>10</b> can be easily bolted together and the pin <b>24</b> attached to secure the assembly. The full strength of the pin <b>24</b> is available to ensure link integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The use of the bearings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> minimize friction between the rods <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. This improves the accuracy and repeatability of the force measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The motion limiter formed of the pin <b>24</b> and one or more of the apertures <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> not only limits the relative longitudinal motion of the rods <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, but also, can be used to prevent relative angular motion between the rods <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. This provides protection for the spring <b>20</b> and the position sensor <b>22</b>. In addition, should the spring <b>20</b> and/or its connection to the rods <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> fail, the link remains functional.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another embodiment of a link and sensor assembly <b>40</b> includes a first rod <b>42</b> and a second rod <b>44</b>. These rods are provided with attachment points <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, respectively. A cylindrical spring <b>50</b> is connected between the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. The spring <b>50</b> may advantageously include integral clamps <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> at one end of the spring <b>50</b> and integral clamps <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> at the other end of the spring <b>50</b> (see also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The ends of the spring <b>50</b> may be provided with internal threads that engage corresponding external threads on the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> (unshown). After screwing the spring <b>50</b> and the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> into threaded engagement, the clamps <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> can be tightened to provide a secure attachment. It is also possible to use other methods of fastening the spring <b>40</b> to the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, for example, welding, gluing or other fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also connected between the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> is a linear position sensor <b>60</b>. The sensor <b>60</b> may be, for example, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). In order to provide increased reliability through redundancy, the assembly <b>40</b> may be provided with multiple LVDT sensors <b>60</b> arranged in parallel relationship within the spring <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a motion limiter <b>62</b> is provided to limit the motion between the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> as the rod <b>44</b> telescopes within the rod <b>42</b>. The rod <b>42</b> has internal splines <b>64</b> that engage the peripheral spines <b>66</b> of sleeves <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. The sleeves <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> may be held in place within the rod <b>42</b> with the internal lock nuts <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and a inwardly extending stop <b>75</b> on the rod <b>42</b>. Between the rod <b>44</b> and the sleeves <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> are arrays of ball splines <b>76</b>. A portion of the race for each ball spline is formed in opposing surfaces of the rod <b>44</b>. The ball spines are basically linear ball-race bearings with the race grooves and balls acting additionally as splines.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a stop <b>78</b> extends from the rod <b>44</b>. The stop <b>78</b> is limited in motion between the sleeves <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. The range of travel may be further adjusted through the use of shims <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the use of ball splines provides an advantageously low friction between the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. It is also possible to replace the ball splines with conventional splines if the friction is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In operation, the assembly <b>40</b> is attached by the mounting points <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> between respective unshown structures (for example, an actuator and a flight control surface). Relative longitudinal forces between the points <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> compress or tension the spring <b>50</b> resulting in longitudinal motion of the rod <b>44</b> with respect to the rod <b>42</b> as it telescopes within the rod <b>42</b>. This motion is indicative of the forces applied and is measured with the position sensor <b>52</b>. The sensed position in combination with the spring characteristic provides a measure of the applied force, the spring <b>50</b> and the position sensor <b>60</b> thus acting as a force sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The full strength of the stops <b>75</b>, <b>78</b> is available to ensure link integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The use of the ball splines <b>68</b> minimize friction between the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. This improves the accuracy and repeatability of the force measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The motion limiter <b>62</b> not only limits the relative longitudinal motion of the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, but also, prevents relative angular motion between the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. This provides protection for the spring <b>50</b> and the position sensor <b>60</b>. In addition, should the spring <b>50</b> and/or its connection to the rods <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> fail, the link remains functional.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be evident that this disclosure is by way of example and that various changes may be made by adding, modifying or eliminating details without departing from the fair scope of the teaching contained in this disclosure. The invention is therefore not limited to particular details of this disclosure except to the extent that the following claims are necessarily so limited.</p>
