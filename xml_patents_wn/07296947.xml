<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an arrangement comprising a first component and a second component, and a connecting element for connecting the first component to the second component at a distance from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the context of the present invention, the terms “first component” and “second component” are to be understood in a general sense. The first component may be a profiled section, in particular a hollow profiled section, which has a lateral surface which is completely continuous in the circumferential direction or alternatively is partially open. In the latter case, the first component may, for example, be a U-section or a C-section or also generally a rectangular profiled section. The second component may, for example, be a profiled section or a plate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One specific application for the arrangement described in the introduction is that of connecting a tensioning tube to an A-pillar of a motor vehicle. In motor vehicles, a horizontal cross-member to which inter alia the dashboard is secured usually runs between the substantially vertical A-pillars. In addition to the cross-member bearing the dashboard, however, it is also possible for an additional tensioning tube to be braced between the two A-pillars. The additional tensioning tube can be used, for example, to prevent the A-pillars from buckling outward in the event of a crash.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One problem with securing a tensioning tube between the A-pillars of a motor vehicle is that the distance between the A-pillars may vary from vehicle to vehicle, even in the case of the same model of vehicle, on account of manufacturing tolerances. Since providing tensioning tubes which are suitably matched to the distances which occur between the A-pillars would entail considerable increased cost and time expenditure, it is more expedient for the tensioning tubes to be cut to a minimum length which corresponds to the minimum distance between the A-pillars produced by the tolerances. This in turn presents the problem that a tensioning tube of this type, i.e. one which has been cut to a minimal length, has to be secured at a distance from at least one of the A-pillars in the case of a vehicle in which the distance between the A-pillars is greater on account of the tolerances. This requires a connection technique which allows length compensation between that end of the tensioning tube which is to be secured to the A-pillar or the A-pillar(s), i.e. takes account of the possible tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is desirable to have an arrangement which allows a tensioning tube to be connected to an A-pillar at a distance and which, moreover, is able to transmit the high forces which occur in the event of a crash, which may amount to more than 80 kN, from the A-pillar to the tensioning tube without the connection between tensioning tube and A-pillar becoming detached so that the A-pillar buckles laterally outward.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 197 41 551 A1 has described a connection arrangement for connecting a cross-member to the A-pillars of a motor vehicle, the intention of which is to achieve an axial tolerance compensation combined, at the same time, with a high tensile and compressive strength in the connection. The known connecting element has an axially displaceable spacer piece and a radially spreadable clamping piece, as well as an actuating mechanism for spreading the clamping piece. The clamping piece is brought into clamping engagement with the wall of the first component via the actuating mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Nevertheless, with this known arrangement, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that in the event of particularly high tensile forces acting on the connection the frictional lock between the clamping piece and the wall of the first component will be overcome and the clamping piece will slip off the first component, so that the first component is separated from the second component.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention is based on the object of refining an arrangement of the type described in the introduction in such a way as to increase the strength of the connection between the first component and the second component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the invention, an arrangement is provided, comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">a first component, having a longitudinal center axis, a wall and having an end, said first component being in profiled section form at least at said end,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">a second component,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">a connecting element for connecting said end of said first component to said second component at a distance from one another,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">said connecting element having an axially movable spacer for bridging said distance between said end of said first component and said second component, further having at least one clamping piece, which can be brought into contact in a clamping manner with said wall of said first component, and furthermore having an actuating mechanism which is operatively connected to said spacer piece and said clamping piece in such a manner that when said actuating mechanism is actuated, said spacer piece moves in direction of said longitudinal center axis until it comes into contact with said second component and said clamping piece is brought into a clamping engagement with said wall of said first component,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0015">wherein at said end of said first component there is at least one step which is directed for said longitudinal center axis of said first component and in front of which said at least one clamping piece comes into engagement with said wall of said first component.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">The advantage of the configuration of the arrangement according to the invention is that the ability of the connection of the first component to the second component to withstand tensile loads is increased compared to the known arrangement. The at least one clamping piece, which comes into predominantly frictional engagement with the wall of the first component, may slip relative to the first component in the event of excessively high tensile loads. However, the at least one step provided at the first component limits this slipping or prevents it from the outset, depending on the distance from the step at which the clamping piece comes into engagement with the first component when the actuating mechanism is actuated during connection of the first component to the second component. The step which is provided on the first component in accordance with the invention therefore prevents the connection between the first and second components from becoming disconnected, thereby considerably increasing the strength of the connection.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">Therefore, the arrangement according to the invention inherently combines the function of length compensation, which is realized by the axially moveable spacer piece, and the realized by the axially moveable spacer piece, and the exertion of a clamping force on the first component, which is applied by the at least one clamping piece, with the step which is provided in accordance with the invention additionally being responsible for a considerable improvement in the operating safety of the arrangement under high forces. Therefore, the arrangement according to the invention is able to connect the first component to the second component so securely that when the arrangement is used to connect a tensioning tube to the A-pillar, the high forces which occur in the event of a crash are transmitted from the connecting element to the first component, i.e. the tensioning tube, without the tensioning tube being torn off the A-pillar at the connecting location.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The step may, for example, be formed by machining of the tube end, for example widening and flanging, as an edge or rim formed integrally with the first component or by rolling in a bead, or by welding, soldering, adhesively bonding or shrinking a bush onto the first component. If the first component or at least the end which is to be connected to the second component is made from a relatively thick material, the at least one step can also be produced by material-removing machining.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In one preferred configuration, at the first component there is a further step which is directed toward the longitudinal center axis of the first component and which is at an axial distance from the first step.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">This second step, together with the first step on the first component forms a pocket which is recessed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction and in which the at least one clamping piece comes into engagement with the wall of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">Furthermore, it is preferable if that end of the first component which is to be connected to the second component is tubular in form, and if the at least one step extends over the entire circumference of the wall of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">Forming the at least one step over the entire circumference in this way further improves the tensile strength of the arrangement. The at least one or two steps may be formed as radially inwardly directed projections on the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">In a further preferred configuration, that end of the first component which is to be connected to the second component is formed as an attachment piece which is fixedly connected to the remaining part of the first component and on which the at least one step is present.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">The advantage of forming the at least one step on an attachment piece which is fixedly connected to the first component is that the attachment piece, with respect to the remaining body of the first component, can be formed from a material which is harder and/or has thicker walls than the remaining part of the tube, with the result that the tensile strength of the connection can be improved still further while at the same time saving on weight and costs. In the case of the preferred use of the connecting element according to the invention for connecting a tensioning tube to an A-pillar, the attachment piece may be welded as a sleeve onto the end of the tensioning tube, so as to engage over the outside of it.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">In a further preferred configuration, the spacer piece and the clamping piece are formed as separate elements.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">In this case, it is advantageous that the spacer piece and the clamping piece can move independently of one another, with the result that, by way of example, the clamping piece can be brought into engagement with the first component at a predetermined position irrespective of the position of the spacer piece, which may vary on account of the distance which is to be bridged varying for manufacturing tolerance reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">In a further preferred configuration, the connecting element is designed in such a way that the clamping piece can be brought into engagement with the wall of the second component by means of the actuating mechanism as a result of the superimposing of an axial movement and a movement directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the first component or only as a result of a movement directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">In the case of the first alternative, it is advantageous that the clamping piece, as a result of the superimposition of an axial movement and a movement directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the first component can “dig” or “cut” into the material of the wall of the first component, resulting in not just a frictionally locking but also a positively locking engagement between the clamping piece and the wall of the first component. This allows the connection of the first component to the second component to withstand particularly high forces. An advantage of the second alternative is that the location at which the clamping piece comes into engagement with the first component is well defined in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">In a further preferred configuration, the actuating mechanism has a screw mechanism which is designed in such a way that its continuing actuation firstly brings the spacer piece into contact with the second component and then brings the clamping piece into engagement with the wall of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">The advantage in this case is that the screw mechanism creates an actuating mechanism which is particularly simple to operate and which acts on both the spacer piece and the clamping piece, specifically in such a way that first of all the spacer piece is brought into contact with the second component, in order to bridge the distance between it and the first component, and then the clamping piece is brought into engagement with the wall of the first component as a result of further actuation of the screw mechanism, for example the turning of a screw.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">In this context, it is preferable if the screw mechanism has a screw, with which a nut is in threaded engagement, which nut moves toward the second component when the screw is turned, in the process moving the spacer piece in the axial direction either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">This creates an actuating mechanism which is in design terms of advantageously simple construction for the spacer piece, in order to move the spacer piece in the axial direction. The screw in this case preferably acts as a slide, directly or indirectly, on the spacer piece, which is preferably mounted in such a manner that it can slide in the axial direction on the screw.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">In a further preferred configuration, the nut, when the screw is turning, acts directly or indirectly on the clamping piece in order to bring it into engagement with the wall of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">In particular in combination with the configuration described above, these measures create a mechanism which is of particularly simple design, since all that is required to move both the spacer piece and the clamping piece is a single nut.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">According to the invention, the arrangement according to one or more of the above configurations is used to connect a tube, in particular a tensioning tube, to an A-pillar of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">However, the arrangement can also be used to connect the cross-member which bears the dashboard to the A-pillar(s).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">Further features and advantages will emerge from the following description and the appended drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">It will be understood that the features mentioned above and those which are yet to be explained below can be used not only in the combination given in each instance, but also in other combinations or on a stand-alone basis without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an arrangement <b>10</b> having a first component <b>12</b> and a second component <b>14</b>, as well as a connecting element which is provided with the general reference numeral <b>16</b>. The connecting element <b>16</b> is used to connect the first component <b>12</b> to the second component <b>14</b>. Only parts of the first component <b>12</b> and the second component <b>14</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">In the present application, the first component <b>12</b> is a tensioning tube, and the second component <b>14</b> is an A-pillar of a motor vehicle. An end <b>17</b> of the first component <b>12</b> which is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b> is tubular in form. Furthermore, in the present instance the second component <b>14</b> extends substantially transversely with respect to a longitudinal direction or longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an outermost free end <b>20</b> of the first component <b>12</b> is at a distance from the second component <b>14</b>, and the first component <b>12</b> is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b> at this distance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">The connecting element <b>16</b> has a spacer piece <b>22</b> which can move axially, i.e. in the longitudinal direction <b>18</b>, and is designed in the form of a substantially cylinder-symmetrical sleeve <b>23</b> and a likewise substantially cylinder-symmetrical sleeve <b>25</b> arranged as an axial extension of the sleeve <b>23</b>. The sleeves <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> are not fixedly connected to one another. On its side facing the second component <b>14</b>, the spacer piece <b>22</b> has a bearing surface <b>24</b>, it being possible for the spacer piece <b>22</b> to be widened in the manner of a ring on this side. The spacer piece <b>22</b> is used to bridge the distance between the outermost free end <b>20</b> of the first component <b>12</b> and the second component <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the length of the spacer piece <b>22</b> in the longitudinal direction is greater than the distance between the free end <b>20</b> of the first component <b>12</b> and the second component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">An external dia meter of the spacer piece <b>22</b>, in this case of the second sleeve <b>25</b>, approximately corresponds to the internal diameter, or is slightly smaller than the internal diameter, of the first component <b>12</b> in the region of its end <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">Furthermore, the connecting element <b>16</b> has a clamping piece <b>26</b> which is designed in the form of a spreadable ring or as a clamping jaw. In a manner which is not illustrated in more detail, the clamping piece <b>26</b> has incisions which run in the longitudinal direction <b>18</b> and enable it to spread transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction <b>18</b>, or alternatively, as illustrated, it is possible to provide a plurality of circumferentially distributed clamping jaws which are not connected to one another or are only connected to one another by desired breaking points.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">The clamping piece <b>26</b> is seated on a conical slide <b>30</b>, which can move in the axial direction relative to the spacer piece <b>22</b> when the connecting element <b>16</b> is in the unbraced state. In this configuration, the spacer piece <b>22</b> and the clamping piece <b>26</b> are separate elements which can move relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">The clamping piece <b>26</b> serves to be brought into clamping contact with an inner-side wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> in order to anchor the connecting element <b>10</b> in the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">As a further module, the connecting element <b>16</b> has an actuating mechanism <b>34</b>. The actuating mechanism <b>34</b> is designed as a screw mechanism and comprises a screw <b>36</b> which has a screw head <b>38</b> and a screw shank <b>40</b>. The screw shank <b>40</b> has an external screw thread <b>42</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the screw head <b>38</b> is provided, for example, with a hexagon socket <b>44</b> for attaching a hexagon key. The screw head <b>38</b> is seated on the second component <b>14</b>. The screw <b>36</b> is in this case guided through an opening <b>46</b> in the second component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">A nut <b>48</b> which is provided with an internal screw thread, via which the nut <b>48</b> is in engagement with the external screw thread <b>42</b> of the screw <b>36</b>, is seated on the screw shank <b>40</b>. The outside of the nut <b>48</b> is designed as a square. The sleeves <b>23</b> and <b>25</b>, which form the spacer piece <b>22</b>, and the slide <b>30</b>, by contrast, are arranged in sliding displacement on the shank <b>40</b> of the screw. The nut <b>48</b> is secured against rotation in a recess <b>50</b> of the slide <b>30</b>. The slide <b>30</b> and preferably also the spacer piece <b>22</b> are likewise secured against rotation, i.e. cannot rotate with the screw <b>36</b> when the latter is turned.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">The first component <b>12</b> is reinforced in the region of its end <b>20</b>, so that the connecting element <b>16</b> cannot be pulled out of the component <b>12</b> as a result of expansion of the wall <b>32</b> of the component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">At its end <b>17</b> which is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b>, the first component <b>12</b> has a step <b>52</b> which is directed toward the longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b> and in front of which the clamping piece <b>26</b> comes into engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> when the actuating mechanism <b>34</b> is actuated or the screw <b>36</b> is turned. When the screw <b>36</b> is being tightened, the clamping piece <b>26</b> comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> in front of the step <b>52</b> or adjacent to but at a short distance from the latter. In the event of high tensile loads being exerted on the connection between the first component <b>12</b> and the second component <b>14</b>, the clamping piece <b>26</b> may slip on the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b>. However, this slipping is limited by the clamping piece <b>26</b> coming into positively locking contact with the step <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">In the exemplary embodiment shown, that end <b>17</b> of the first component <b>12</b> which is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b> is formed by an attachment piece <b>54</b>, which is connected to the remainder of the first component <b>12</b> and on which the step <b>52</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">The attachment piece <b>54</b> is designed in the form of a sleeve, preferably in the form of a union sleeve, which is fixedly connected to the remaining part <b>56</b> of the first component <b>12</b>. For this purpose, the attachment piece <b>54</b> partially engages over the outside of the part <b>56</b> of the first component <b>12</b>, with the two parts being, for example, welded together in the region of overlap. In this way, a second step <b>58</b> directed toward the longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b> is formed. The clamping piece <b>26</b> comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the attachment piece <b>54</b>, which therefore forms part of the first component <b>12</b>, in the region between the first step <b>52</b> and the second step <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">Accordingly, a pocket is formed in the region between the first step <b>52</b> and the second step <b>58</b>, in which pocket the clamping piece <b>26</b> comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> when the screw <b>36</b> is tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">The first step <b>52</b> is present over the entire circumference of the attachment piece <b>54</b>, which is tubular in form, and its extent in the radial direction toward the longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> approximately corresponds to or is greater than the wall thickness of the part <b>56</b> of the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">Furthermore, in the region of the step <b>52</b>, in the present case at its end facing the second component <b>14</b>, the attachment piece <b>54</b> is configured with a radial thickened or reinforcing portion <b>60</b>. Moreover, the attachment piece <b>54</b> also has a greater wall thickness than the remaining part <b>56</b> of the first component <b>12</b>, which prevents the end <b>17</b> of the first component <b>12</b> or the attachment piece <b>54</b> bending out in the radial direction when the clamping piece <b>26</b> is brought into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">The step may also, for example, be formed by machining the tube end, for example widening or flanging, as an edge or rim formed integrally with the first component <b>12</b> or by rolling in a bead, or by welding, soldering, adhesively bonding or shrinking a bush onto the first component <b>12</b>. If the first component <b>12</b>, or at least the end <b>16</b> which is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b>, is made from a thicker material, it is also possible for the at least one step <b>52</b> to be produced by material-removing machining.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">In the text which follows, the function of the connecting element <b>16</b> during connection of the first component <b>12</b> to the second component <b>14</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">The preassembled connecting element <b>16</b> is inserted into the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">Then, the screw <b>36</b> is turned by means of a suitable tool, for example a hexagon key. Since the nut <b>48</b> is secured against rotation, when the screw <b>36</b> is turned the nut <b>48</b> moves along the shank <b>40</b> toward the second component <b>14</b>, and in doing so, via the slide <b>30</b>, first of all slides the spacer piece <b>22</b> toward the second component <b>14</b>. In the process, the slide <b>30</b> likewise displaces the clamping piece <b>26</b> in the direction toward the second component <b>14</b>, but without any relative movement between the clamping piece <b>26</b> and the slide <b>30</b>. At the beginning of the actuation of the actuating mechanism <b>34</b>, therefore, first of all the spacer piece <b>22</b> is moved until it comes into contact with the second component <b>14</b>, without the clamping piece <b>26</b> coming into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b>. This is based on the movement resistance against the movement of the spacer piece <b>22</b> being lower than the resistance to a relative displacement of the clamping piece <b>26</b> with respect to the conical portion of the slide <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">As the screw <b>36</b> continues to be turned, the bearing surface <b>24</b> of the spacer piece <b>22</b> comes into contact with the second component <b>14</b>. The screw head <b>38</b> for its part, if this has not already occurred, comes to bear against the second component <b>14</b> on the opposite side from the bearing surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">As the screw <b>36</b> continues to be turned, the nut <b>48</b> slides the slide <b>30</b> further toward the second component <b>14</b>. Since the spacer piece <b>22</b>, i.e. the sleeves <b>23</b> and <b>25</b>, are now already bearing against the second component <b>14</b> in such a manner that they cannot move in the axial direction, the slide <b>30</b> then executes an axial movement relative to the spacer piece <b>22</b>. Since, moreover, the clamping piece <b>26</b> is now unable to move in the axial direction, since it is bearing against the spacer piece <b>22</b>, the further movement of the slide <b>30</b>, directed axially toward the second component <b>14</b>, causes the clamping piece <b>26</b> to spread or widen, so that it comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b>, more specifically of the attachment piece <b>54</b> between the first step <b>52</b> and the second step <b>58</b>. The first component <b>12</b> is then securely and rigidly connected to the second component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065">In this exemplary embodiment, the clamping piece <b>26</b> is accordingly formed in such a way that it can be brought into engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> by means of the actuating mechanism <b>34</b> exclusively as a result of a movement directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a further exemplary embodiment of an arrangement having a connecting element <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">The connecting element <b>72</b> has a spacer piece <b>74</b>, a clamping piece <b>76</b> and an actuating mechanism <b>78</b>, the actuating mechanism <b>78</b>, as in the exemplary embodiment described above, being operatively connected to the spacer piece <b>74</b> and the clamping piece <b>76</b>, in such a manner that, preferably at the start of actuation of the actuating mechanism <b>78</b>, the spacer piece <b>74</b> is moved in the axial direction until it comes into contact with the second component <b>14</b>, and that preferably in the event of further actuation the clamping piece <b>76</b> comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">For this purpose, the actuating mechanism <b>78</b> has a screw <b>80</b> and a nut <b>82</b>, which is in threaded engagement with the screw <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">Furthermore, a slide <b>84</b> in the form of a ring is also arranged between the nut <b>82</b> and the clamping piece <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">Furthermore, in a manner which is not illustrated, the connecting element <b>72</b> has a basket which surrounds the arrangement comprising the spacer piece <b>74</b>, the clamping piece <b>76</b>, the slide <b>84</b> and the nut <b>82</b>, and specifically not over its entire circumference, but rather only by means of a few, for example two, webs which are delimited in the circumferential direction and along which the nut <b>82</b>, the slide <b>84</b>, the clamping piece <b>76</b> and the spacer piece <b>74</b> are secured against rotation. At their outer circumference, the spacer piece <b>74</b>, the clamping piece <b>76</b>, the slide <b>84</b> and the nut <b>82</b> are provided with corresponding grooves, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and, for example for the spacer piece <b>74</b>, are denoted by the reference numerals <b>244</b> and <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">At the end <b>17</b> which is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b>, the first component <b>12</b> has a step <b>90</b> which is directed toward the longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b> and in front of which the clamping piece <b>76</b> comes into engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> when the actuating mechanism <b>78</b> is actuated or the screw <b>80</b> is turned. When the screw <b>80</b> is being tightened, the clamping piece <b>76</b> comes into clamping engagement approximately at a location of the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> which is denoted by the reference numeral <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">In the exemplary embodiment shown, that end <b>17</b> of the first component <b>12</b> which is to be connected to the second component <b>14</b> is formed by an attachment piece <b>94</b> which is connected to the remainder of the first component <b>12</b> and on which the step <b>90</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">The attachment piece <b>94</b> is designed in the form of a sleeve which is fixedly connected to the remaining part <b>96</b> of the first component <b>12</b>. For this purpose, the attachment piece <b>94</b> partially engages over the outer side of the part <b>96</b> of the first component <b>12</b> at a location <b>98</b> at which the two parts are, for example, welded to one another. In this way, a second step <b>100</b>, directed toward the longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b>, is formed at the location <b>98</b>. The clamping piece <b>76</b> comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the attachment piece <b>94</b> in the region between the first step <b>90</b> and the second step <b>100</b>, preferably at a location <b>92</b> which is closer to the first step <b>90</b> than to the second step <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">The step <b>90</b> is present over the entire circumference of the tubular attachment piece <b>94</b> and its extent in the radial direction toward the longitudinal center axis <b>18</b> approximately corresponds to the wall thickness of the part <b>96</b> of the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">Furthermore, in the region of the step <b>90</b>, in the present case at its end <b>102</b> facing the second component <b>14</b>, the attachment piece <b>84</b> is configured with a thickened portion. Moreover, the attachment piece <b>94</b> also has a greater wall thickness than the remaining part <b>96</b> of the first component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">Furthermore, a flange may also be provided on the attachment piece <b>94</b>, preferably at the height of the first step <b>90</b>, so as to additionally prevent the attachment piece <b>252</b> from bending open in the radial direction in the region of the step <b>248</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">The arrangement <b>70</b> functions as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">After the connecting element <b>72</b> without the screw <b>80</b> has been inserted into the first component <b>12</b>, the screw <b>80</b> is screwed to the nut <b>82</b>. In the process, the nut <b>82</b> moves axially toward the second component <b>14</b>, and in the process first of all slides the slide <b>84</b>, the clamping piece <b>76</b> and the spacer piece <b>74</b> toward the second component <b>14</b>, until the spacer piece <b>74</b> comes to bear against the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">Since the spacer piece <b>74</b> can then move no further in the axial direction when the screw <b>80</b> is turned further, the nut <b>82</b>, via the slide <b>84</b>, slides the clamping piece <b>76</b> onto the conical portion of the spacer piece <b>74</b>, with the result that the clamping piece <b>76</b> is spread or widened until it comes into clamping engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b>, more specifically of the attachment piece <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0080">Accordingly, in this exemplary embodiment the connecting element <b>72</b> is formed in such a way that the clamping piece <b>76</b> can be brought into engagement with the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> by means of the actuating mechanism <b>78</b> as a result of a superimposed axial movement and a movement directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction <b>18</b> of the first component <b>12</b>. The superimposing of an axial movement and a radial movement for the clamping piece <b>76</b> allows the latter to dig into the material of the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b>, resulting in an engagement between the clamping piece <b>76</b> and the wall <b>32</b> of the first component <b>12</b> which is not just frictionally locking but also partially positively locking.</p>
