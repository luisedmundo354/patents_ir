Hence, a detailed description of those computers is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The operation will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The following description is made in connection with the case where the users of the first creating group <b>130</b>, which comprises the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, create an electronic album. Also, it is assumed that the user operating the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> is a host user and the users operating the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> are guest users. (Initial Setting Process)</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing the operation of an initial setting process for creating an electronic album, including setting of category information and user information. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents the operation on the side of the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">First, the album server <b>110</b> prepares a template for creating an electronic album and stores the template in the template DB <b>207</b> (step S<b>401</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows one example of the template. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the template is made up of an image entry area <b>1001</b> in which data of images, such as photos, is to be input, text entry areas <b>1002</b>, <b>1004</b> in which data of comments, such as impressions, is to be input, an advertisement entry area in which advertisement data is to be input, etc. The text entry areas include a title entry area <b>1004</b> in which a title of an electronic album is to be input, and a comment entry area <b>1002</b> in which comments (compositions) freely written by the user are to be input. Additionally, the template is prepared in plural number for each item of category information.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Then, in step S<b>402</b>, the album server <b>110</b> prepares category information for classifying electronic albums in accordance with predetermined classes, and stores the category information in the category DB <b>208</b>. The category information includes, e.g., items such as “travel” and “food”. Further, the category information “travel”, for example, may be divided into sub-category information classified for each destination of travel, such as “Tahiti”, “Maldives” or “Canada”.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Then, the album server <b>110</b> starts a procedure for making a Web site available for general use, on which electronic albums are created and made open to the public. That procedure is performed after preparing the template (step S<b>401</b>) and preparing the category information (step S<b>402</b>). The template and the category information may be added and deleted, as required, after making the Web site available for general use.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Subsequently, it is assumed that the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> accesses the Web site and notifies the intent of creating an electronic album to the album server <b>110</b>. In such a case, in step S<b>403</b>, the album server <b>110</b> prompts selection of the category information. This prompt is performed by transmitting data for displaying the category information stored in the category DB <b>208</b> on the output device <b>307</b> of the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>. Note that, in this specification, data displayed on the output device on the user side is expressed by “display data”. Upon receiving the display data, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> displays an image, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, on the display screen. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, category items <b>1101</b> are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Category selection information representing the selected category information and theme information input by the user are both transmitted to the album server <b>110</b>. Those data are transmitted from the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> as a response to a prompt for selecting the category information and a prompt <b>1102</b> for inputting the theme information regarding the theme of an electronic album to be created. Upon receiving the category selection information and the theme information in step S<b>404</b>, the album server <b>110</b> goes to step S<b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step S<b>405</b>, the album server <b>110</b> transmits, to the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>, display data for prompting the user to select one of the templates stored in the template DB <b>207</b>. This step is responsive to the category selection information received in step S<b>404</b>. Also, the album server <b>110</b> prompts entry of the user information. This prompt is performed by transmitting, to the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>, display data for displaying a screen image to input the user information (such as the user names, passwords, and e-mail addresses) regarding users (album creating users) who participate in creating the electronic album. Correspondingly, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> displays an image, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, on the display screen. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, numeral <b>1201</b> denotes a list of templates to be selected, and numeral <b>1202</b> denotes a column in which the mail address is to be entered as the user information. Also, numeral <b>1203</b> denotes a column in which the mail addresses of friends, who participate in creating the electronic album, are to be entered.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The column <b>1203</b> may be modified so as to request entry of the gender and ages of the album creating users as the user information. This is because the user information including the gender and ages represents personality of the album creating users. Such information may be available, for example, as marketing materials. In other words, such information may be useful in estimating what kinds of users having different personalities desire what categories of albums or travels.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Template selection information representing the selected template and the user information input by the user are both transmitted from the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to the album server <b>110</b>. Those data are transmitted as a response to prompts for selecting the template and inputting the user information. In step S<b>406</b>, the album server <b>110</b> receives the template selection information and the user information.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Then, in step S<b>407</b>, the album server <b>110</b> stores the category selection information and the theme information, received in step S<b>404</b>, in the category DB <b>208</b>. Also, the album server <b>110</b> stores the template selection information and the user information, received in step S<b>406</b>, in the user information DB <b>209</b>. At that time, the category selection information and the theme information, stored in the category DB <b>208</b>, and the template selection information and the user information, stored in the user information DB <b>209</b>, are stored as information regarding the first creating group <b>130</b> in a manner correlated to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step S<b>408</b>, the album server <b>110</b> transmits approval-of-use information permitting the use of the Web site to create an electronic album by an e-mail, for example, to the creating users of the electronic album, whose addresses are stored in the user information DB <b>209</b> in above step S<b>407</b>. The approval-of-use information includes the user name, password, URL (Uniform Resource Locator), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">More specifically, the approval-of-use information contains information needed for issuing (or obtaining) an approval of an access to the album server <b>110</b>. The approval of an access to the album server <b>110</b> is given for each of a plurality of album creating user terminals. For example, when the approval-of-use information contains the user name, password and URL as mentioned above, different user names are defined for the individual album creating user terminals. Alternatively, different passwords may be defined for the individual album creating user terminals. The approval of an access is made individually for each of the plurality of album creating user terminals. Therefore, the album server <b>110</b> can discriminate the information (including the approval-of-use information) transmitted to it. Stated otherwise, the approval-of-use information enables the album server <b>110</b> to determine which one of the album creating user terminals has transmitted that approval-of-use information.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this embodiment, the password and the URL are of the same data. Thus, the URL has the function of the password. Also, the URL contains an “address” on the Internet for accessing the selected template information. For example, when the category information is “travel” and the sub-category information is “Maldives”, the URL contains an “address” for the corresponding template. Further, the URL contains an “address” for the electronic album under creation.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, the URL contains a domain. The domain is expressed by, e.g., an Internet Protocol address (IP address) or alphabets corresponding to the IP address.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">First, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> accesses the Web site provided by the album server <b>110</b> for creating an electronic album. Further, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> notifies the intent of creating an electronic album to the album server <b>110</b> through the Web site (step S<b>501</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In response to the notification, the album server <b>110</b> transmits the display data for selection of the category information and the display data for entry of the theme information to the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>. Then, in step S<b>402</b>, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> receives the display data for selection of the category information and the display data for entry of the theme information. As a result, the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is displayed on the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">More specifically, in step S<b>403</b>, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> displays, on the output device <b>307</b>, a screen image based on the display data for selection of the category information and the display data for entry of the theme information. The screen image based on the display data for selection of the category information includes category selection buttons provided for each item of the category information for selecting the category information.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Using the input device <b>306</b> of the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>, the host user clicks one of the category selection buttons and selects the category information. Also, the host user enters the theme information using the input device <b>306</b> of the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>. Then, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> transmits both the category selection information representing the selected category information and the entered theme information to the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As a response to the transmitted category selection information, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> receives in step S<b>404</b>, from the album server <b>110</b>, the display data for selecting the template and the data for prompting entry of the user information regarding the creating users, i.e., the users of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Based on the data received in step S<b>404</b>, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> displays in step S<b>509</b> a template selection screen and an entry screen for inputting the user information regarding the album creating users on the output device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The template selection screen may be displayed as an entry screen including a plurality of templates displayed at the same time on one display screen. Alternatively, one template may be displayed on one display screen by providing a switching button or the like on a screen image and replacing the template with a next one each time the switching button is depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The host user selects the template and enters the user information through the input device <b>306</b>. Then, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> transmits the template selection information representing the selected template and the entered user information to the album server <b>110</b>. The user information contains the user names, passwords, e-mail addresses, etc. The user information may also contain the gender and ages of the creating users, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As a response to the template selection information and the user information both transmitted in step S<b>505</b>, the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> receives, in step S<b>406</b>, approval-of-use information transmitted from the album server <b>110</b>. The user information received by the album server <b>110</b> also contains the mail addresses of users who participate in creating the electronic album together with the host user. Based on the user information, therefore, the approval-of-use information is transmitted from the album server <b>110</b> to each of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> and is received by them.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The approval-of-use information contains, as described above, information enabling the album server <b>110</b> to determine which one of the album creating user terminals has transmitted the approval-of-use information. Hence, in an album creating process described below, the album server <b>110</b> can determine which one of the album creating user terminals has made an access to it.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(Album Creating Process)</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart showing the operation of an electronic album creating process by a creating user, looking from the album server side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents the operation on the side of the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The album creating users, whose user information has been input in the initial setting process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, access the Web site for creating the electronic album through the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, and notify the intent of creating the electronic album. At that time, the album server <b>110</b> transmits, to one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> who has accessed, display data for prompting entry of the user name and the URL as password (step S<b>601</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In response to the prompt, the one user of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> enters the user name and the URL as password by using the input device <b>306</b>, followed by transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In step S<b>602</b>, the album server <b>110</b> receives the user name and the URL as password transmitted from the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>. Then, the album server <b>110</b> checks and confirms whether the received user name and URL match with those ones registered in the user information DB <b>209</b>. If the received user name and URL match with the registered ones, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>603</b>, and if not so, the album creating process is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the received user name and URL match with the registered ones and the control flow proceeds to step S<b>603</b>, the album server <b>110</b> checks whether any user of the first creating group <b>130</b>, to which the user having the relevant user name belongs, is now creating the electronic album. If any user of the first creating group <b>130</b> is now creating the electronic album, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In step S<b>610</b>, the album server <b>110</b> determines whether the same user has accessed. In this embodiment, different approval-of-use information is assigned to each album creating user. Then, the album server <b>110</b> does not transmit the template for creating the electronic album when access has already been made based on the same approval-of-use information.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">More specifically, the URL serving also as a password contains the Internet address of the template selection information regarding the stored album. On the other hand, the user name is user information correlated to the URL (see step S<b>407</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Also, the user name is different for each user. Accordingly, when the album server <b>110</b> has already approved access based on the same name, it does not transmit the template for creating the electronic album to the user having the same name. In other words, when access to the album server is already permitted based on certain approval-of-use information, another access to the album server based on the same approval-of-use information is prohibited.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The approval-of-use information for permitting access to the album server contains a user name and a password. In this embodiment, a different user name is defined for each of album creating users. Alternatively, different passwords may be defined for individual users. This case will make the user free from troublesome operation of inputting the user name.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If it is determined in step S<b>610</b> that the access is not from the same user, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>604</b>. In step S<b>604</b>, the album server <b>110</b> transmits the fact that another album creating user is under the operation, to the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> that has accessed in step S<b>601</b>. Then, the album server <b>110</b> goes to step S<b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">On that occasion, the album server <b>110</b> transmits, to the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, display data for a communication screen enabling the relevant users of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> to make a chat or the like between or among them, and thereafter transmits communication information, which is input from any of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, to all of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If any other album creating user of the first creating group <b>130</b> is not under the operation of creating the electronic album, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In step S<b>605</b>, the album server <b>110</b> transmits the display data for the template for creating an electronic album, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, to the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> that has accessed in step S<b>601</b>. The template display data causes the whole of a template, including an image entry area and a text entry area, to be displayed on the output device <b>307</b> of the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> so that the relevant user may create the electronic album. As another example, in response to a request from the relevant user of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, the album server <b>110</b> may transmit the template display data for displaying only an image entry area or a text entry area.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When the operation of creating an electronic album is performed for the first time by the first creating group <b>130</b>, the display data for the template selected in the initial setting process, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, is transmitted as the template display data. That is, the display data for the template, in which neither images nor comments are entered, is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When the operation of creating an electronic album has been performed before by the first creating group <b>130</b> and the user is going to edit the electronic album, the display data for the template, for which the operation of creating the electronic album has been performed before by the first creating group <b>130</b>, is transmitted as the template display data. That is, the display data for the template, in which at least part of image data and comment data has already been entered, is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Subsequently, in step S<b>606</b>, the album server <b>110</b> receives the data transmitted from the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>. Then, the album server <b>110</b> goes to step S<b>607</b>. In step S<b>607</b>, the album server <b>110</b> determines whether the data received in step S<b>606</b> is the data (e.g., image data and comment data) for creating the electronic album or an end-of-operation notice. If the received data is the data (e.g., image data and comment data) for creating the electronic album, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>608</b>, and if it is an end-of-operation notice, the album creating process is ended after storing the album data of the electronic album in the electronic album DB <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the received data is determined in step S<b>607</b> as being the data for creating the electronic album and the control flow proceeds to step S<b>608</b>, the album server <b>110</b> processes the received creation data in match with the entry areas of the template and inputs it in the template. For example, when the received creation data is image data, the image data is input in the template after being scaled up or down in accordance with the size of the image entry area designated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In step S<b>609</b>, the album server <b>110</b> transmits, to the user now creating the electronic album, display data for the template in which the creation data has been input in step S<b>608</b>.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In response to the notification, the display data for prompting entry of the user name and the password is transmitted from the album server <b>110</b> to one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> that has accessed the Web site. In step S<b>702</b>, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> receives the display data for prompting entry of the user name and the password.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In step S<b>703</b>, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> displays, on the output device <b>307</b>, a screen image based on the display data for prompting entry of the user name and the password. When the relevant user inputs the user name and the password using the input device <b>306</b>, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> transmits the input user name and password to the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The album server <b>110</b> then determines whether the user name and the password transmitted from the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> match with those ones registered in the user information DB <b>209</b>. If matched, the template information is provided, and if not matched, the album creating process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As a response in the case where the transmitted user name and password match, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> receives in step S<b>704</b> the display data for the template for creating an electronic album, which is provided from the album server <b>110</b>, and displays a screen image based on the received template display data on the output device <b>307</b>. In the screen image, the whole of a template is displayed such that the user easily recognizes the image entry area, the comment entry area, etc. Also, when any image data or comment data has already been input, the template is displayed with the image data or comment data input therein.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">On that occasion, when another user of the first creating group <b>130</b> is under the operation of creating the electronic album, the album server <b>110</b> transmits display data for a communication screen enabling the users now creating the electronic album to make a chat or the like between or among them. Thereafter, the relevant users of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> can progress the operation of creating the electronic album while communicating information with each other. For example, when the image data has already been input, they can transmit opinions about that image data between or among them. As a result of the chat, an image showing a view of the sea may be changed to an image showing a view of the mountain.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">On that occasion, the chat communications are stored in the external storage <b>204</b>. Thus, communication data among a plurality of users is stored in the external storage <b>204</b> in correlation to the template. Also, as described above, when some user is going to participate in the chat, the user must access the album server based on the approval-of-use information. The approval-of-use information is different for each of the album creating users. When storing the chat communications in the external storage <b>204</b>, therefore, it is possible to confirm what chat has been made among which members of the album creating users.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, by taking the chat communications out of the external storage <b>204</b>, it is possible to confirm the album creating process later.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In step S<b>705</b>, the relevant user of the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, to which the template display data has been provided, enters creation data (such as image data and comment data) to be input in the template by using the input device <b>306</b> and transmits the creation data to the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The transmitted creation data (such as image data and comment data) is input in the template by the album server <b>110</b> after being scaled up or down in accordance with the size of the template. Then, display data for the template, in which the transmitted creation data (such as image data and comment data) has been input, is transmitted from the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In step S<b>706</b>, similar to above step S<b>704</b>, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> receives the updated template information and displays a screen image of the received template information on the output device <b>307</b>. Then, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>707</b>. In step S<b>707</b>, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> determines whether the intent of ending the operation is input from the user through the input device <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">If the intent of ending the operation is not input, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> returns to step S<b>705</b> and then repeats the above-described steps S<b>705</b> to S<b>707</b> of the album creating process. On the other hand, if the intent of ending the operation is input, the one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> goes to step S<b>708</b> and transmits an end-of-operation notice to the album server <b>110</b>, thereby ending the album creating process.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Advertisement Inserting Process)</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart showing the operation of a process for inserting an advertisement in the electronic album. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> represents the operation on the side of the album server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">First, the album server <b>110</b> prepares processed album data by processing the album data of the electronic album which has been created and stored in the electronic album DB <b>210</b> (step S<b>801</b>). The processing of the album data is made by converting the album data into the more easily available form. Namely, the album data is converted into such data as allowing an advertisement providing company A to make a judgment whether the electronic album is suitable for insertion of an advertisement. Herein, when there are plural sets of album data belonging to one category, those data are collected for each category by the conversion. For example, assuming that the category information is “travel” and the sub-category information is “Canada”, the album data including “Canada” in the theme information are correlated to each other. Such processing enables the company A to easily select the album in which an advertisement is to be inserted. Incidentally, the processed album data is prepared from the album data of the electronic album belonging to the category information that is going to be made open to the public on the Web site.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Then, in step S<b>802</b>, the album server <b>110</b> transmits the processed album data to the advertisement providing computers <b>140</b>, <b>141</b>, etc. operated by users in companies who demand insertion of advertisements. It is here assumed, for example, that the processed album data is transmitted to the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> of the company A.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the album server <b>110</b> receives in step S<b>803</b> data from the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> as a response to the transmission of the processed album data, it goes to step S<b>804</b>. In step S<b>804</b>, the album server <b>110</b> determines whether the data received in step S<b>803</b> is advertisement album data, which is prepared by inputting an advertisement, to be inserted in the electronic album, in the processed album data transmitted to the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b>, or a notice of indicating no demand for insertion of advertisements.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">If it is determined that the received data is the advertisement album data, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>805</b>. If it is determined that the received data is the notice of indicating no demand for insertion of advertisements, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In step S<b>805</b>, the album server <b>110</b> stores the received advertisement album data in the electronic album DB <b>210</b> and then goes to step S<b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In step S<b>806</b>, the album server <b>110</b> determines whether solicitation for advertisements is to be continued. That determination is made based on, for example, whether there is the processed album data in which an advertisement is not yet inserted, and whether there is another user, e.g., a company, who demands insertion of an advertisement.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If it is determined that the solicitation for advertisements is to be continued, the album server <b>110</b> returns to step S<b>802</b> and repeats the above-described steps S<b>802</b> to S<b>806</b> for the advertisement providing computer <b>141</b> of the company B, for example. Note that, when continuing the solicitation for advertisements, the processed album data is transmitted to the advertisement providing computer <b>141</b> after removing, from it, the processed album data that has been used to prepare the advertisement album data stored in above step S<b>805</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If it is determined that the solicitation for advertisements is not to be continued, the album server <b>110</b> goes to step S<b>807</b> and makes the advertisement album data, which has been stored in the electronic album DB <b>210</b>, available for general use (S<b>808</b>). This step of making the advertisement album data available for general use is performed depending on the category information of the electronic album.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thereafter, general users operating the general user computers <b>150</b>, <b>151</b>, etc. are able to access the Web site, provided by the album server <b>110</b>, through the general user computers <b>150</b>, <b>151</b>, etc., and to browse the images of the advertisement album data. In this connection, the album server <b>110</b> may arrange a contest, for example, and offer premiums to one or more creating users of the electronic albums, which gained prizes, from the advertising companies and so on. Stated otherwise, a step of selecting certain electronic album data for prizes may be added to increase an incentive to the creation of electronic albums. After making the advertisement album data open to the public, the advertisement inserting process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart showing the operation of a process for inserting an advertisement in the electronic album. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> represents the operation on the side of the advertisement providing computers <b>140</b>, <b>141</b>, etc. Also, in the following description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it is assumed that the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> of the company A executes the operation of the advertisement inserting process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">First, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> receives the processed album data transmitted from the album server <b>110</b> (step S<b>901</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Then, in step S<b>902</b>, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> displays, on the output device <b>307</b>, images of the processed album data received in above step S<b>901</b>. The company A, i.e., the user of the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b>, reviews the image displayed on the output device <b>307</b>, and determines whether to demand insertion of an advertisement in any of the images of the processed album data. The company A then enters a determination result using the input device <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If an advertisement is to be inserted, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>903</b>. On the other hand, if an advertisement is not to be inserted, the control flow proceeds to step S<b>907</b>. In the latter case, the company A, i.e., the user of the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b>, notifies the intent of not demanding insertion of an advertisement to the album server <b>110</b>, thereby ending the advertisement inserting process.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In step S<b>903</b>, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> searches and selects the processed album data, for which an advertisement is to be inserted, in accordance with an instruction from the user, i.e., the company A. Then, in step S<b>904</b>, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> prepares advertisement data to be attached to the processed album data selected in above S<b>903</b>. The advertisement data to be attached to the processed album data may be prepared in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Then, in step S<b>905</b>, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> inputs the advertisement data, which has been prepared in above step S<b>904</b>, in the processed album data that has been selected in above step S<b>903</b>. As a result, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> prepares advertisement album data in a combination of the processed album data and the advertisement data.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In step S<b>906</b>, the advertisement providing computer <b>140</b> transmits the prepared advertisement album data to the album server <b>110</b>, thereby ending the advertisement inserting process.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">With this embodiment, as described above in detail, the album server <b>110</b> receives the user information regarding the album creating users transmitted from the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>, and based on the received user information, it provides a template for creating an electronic album to the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>. Then, the album server <b>110</b> receives, via the network <b>120</b>, creation data (such as image data and comment data) to be input in the template that has been transmitted from the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, and inputs the received creation data in the template after processing it in accordance with respective entry areas of the template.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Thus, the album creating users operating the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> can transmit the creation data (such as image data and comment data), which is to be input in the template, through the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> and the network <b>120</b>. Accordingly, the album creating users can create a common electronic album in cooperation without meeting at a certain place for editing of the album.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Also, the album server <b>110</b> stores category information for classifying electronic albums in the category DB <b>208</b>, provides the category information to the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b>, and receives category selection information transmitted from the creating user computer <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> as a response to presentation of the category information. Then, in accordance with the received category selection information, the album server <b>110</b> provides the template to the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>. Therefore, the template suitable for the category information selected by the album creating user can be provided to the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, the album server <b>110</b> receives communication information transmitted from any of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, and then transmits the received communication information to all of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>. This enables the album creating users operating the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b> to perform the operation of creating an electronic album while communicating with one another through a chat or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Since the communication information is stored in the album server <b>110</b>, the album storing users can review the stored communication information later. In this respect, the communication information is stored in correlation to approval-of-use information specific to the individual users. It is therefore possible to know, for example, the process in which an image has been replaced, i.e., who has uttered the opinion to replace an image among the album creating users. That feature is effective in the case where there occurs a discrepancy between opinions of the users after the album has been completed or when it is closely completed, because of enabling the users to confirm the proceeding of the communications later.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Moreover, upon receiving the creation data (such as image data and comment data), which is to be input in the template, from the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, the album server <b>110</b> provides, to the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, the template in which the received creation data has been input. Therefore, even when the creation data is transmitted from any one of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>, the updated latest template can be provided to all of the creating user computers <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>130</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In this embodiment, a plurality of templates are prepared for each item of the category information and stored in the album server <b>110</b>. Instead of preparing a plurality of templates for each item of the category information, however, a plurality of prepared templates may be shared by plural items of the category information.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Alternatively, one template may be prepared for each item of the category information. In this case, when the host user selects the category information through the creating user computer, the template for creating an electronic album is automatically decided.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">While, in the advertisement inserting process of this embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the processed album data prepared by processing the album data of the electronic album is transmitted to one of the advertisement providing computers at a time for solicitation of advertisements, the processed album data may be simultaneously transmitted to all of the advertisement providing computers. In such a case, if a plurality of advertisement providing computers demand insertion of advertisements for the same processed album data, the album server <b>110</b> may decide one user, who can insert an advertisement for that processed album data, in accordance with a predetermined rule such as deciding the advertising user in the order of higher advertisement charges proposed by bidding users.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Other Embodiments of Present Invention)</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The scope of the present invention involves an embodiment that is implemented by supplying, to a computer in a system or apparatus connected to various devices, program codes of software for realizing the functions of the above-described embodiment, and by causing the various devices in accordance with the program codes stored in the computer (CPU and/or MPU) in the system or apparatus so that the various devices operate to achieve the functions of the above-described embodiment.

Hence, the program codes per se and means for supplying the program codes to the computer, e.g., a storage medium storing the program code, constitute the present invention. Storage mediums for storing the program codes may be, e.g., floppy disks, hard disks, optical disks, magneto-optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, nonvolatile memory cards, and ROMs.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Also, it is needless to say that the functions of the above-described embodiment are realized by not only a computer executing the program codes supplied to it, but also an OS (Operating System), another application software or the like which is working on the computer and realizes the functions of the above-described embodiment in cooperation with program codes. These program codes are also involved within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, as a matter of course, the present invention involves such a case in which the supplied program codes are stored in a memory provided in a function add-on board mounted in the computer or a function add-on unit connected to the computer, and a CPU or the like incorporated in the function add-on board or unit executes part or whole of the actual processing in accordance with instructions from the program codes, thereby realizing the functions of the above-described embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">According to the embodiment described above, the album server receives the user information regarding a plurality of album creating users input from one of them, and based on the received user information, it transmits, to the plurality of album creating users, approval-of-use information for accessing the Web site to create an electronic album. Also, the album server provides information to the plurality of album creating users to which the approval-of-use information has been transmitted. Then, the album server receives creation information that is related to images to be input in the template information and has been entered from the plurality of album creating users through user terminals, and then edits the images based on the template information. As a result, the plurality of album creating users can enter the creation information, which is to be input in the template information, through the user terminals operated by the individual album creating users, and can create a common electronic album in cooperation without meeting at a certain place for editing of the album.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Also, the album server provides, to the album creating user side, category information for classifying electronic albums, and receives category selection information input from the album creating user side as a response to presentation of the category information. Then, in accordance with the received category selection information, the album server provides template information. Therefore, the template information suitable for the selected category information can be provided to the album creating users.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Further, the album server receives communication information input from any of the album creating users, and then transmits the received communication information to all of the album creating users. This enables the album creating users to create an electronic album while communicating with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The advertisement providing side conventionally inserts an advertisement by estimating persons who are going to view the advertisement, but not confirming personalities, etc. of the viewers. Therefore, advertisement charges are often paid in spite of the advertising effect being unknown. Such a situation can be advantageously coped with by the embodiment. The embodiment makes it possible to provide an efficient and effective advertising method when putting advertisements on home pages, while enabling an electronic album to be provided inexpensively.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the claims.</p>
