<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An industrial sliding door has one or more panel assemblies, each panel assembly having a track panel secured to a header and a swinging panel hinged at the inner edge of the track panel to pivot in either direction about a vertical axis if the swinging panel is impacted by a vehicle such as a fork lift. Both panels can also pivot in at least one direction about a horizontal axis. A rail mounted stationary relative to the doorway at the lower edge of the door holds the lower edge of the door in proximity to the doorway and is disengagable if the door is hit from the opposite side, to permit the door panel assembly to swing about the horizontal axis away from the doorway. The swinging panel is held by a detent in the plane of the track panel in a normal position.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to industrial doors, and in particular to a sliding industrial door that has features built into it to make it capable of enduring an accidental impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sliding doors for industrial applications are well known. For example, for a large scale industrial freezer, in which forklift trucks are continually coming in and out of the freezer, insulated sliding doors have been used. The sliding doors are typically suspended by trolleys that have wheels engaged on tracks which are mounted to the wall over the doorway. There may also be tracks on the walls at the bottom of the door to hold the bottom of the door close to the doorway. Two panels are typically provided which meet in the middle of the doorway and are operated by a belt which is power driven at the top of the doorway and has a lower run of the belt attached to one of the panels and an upper run of the belt attached to the other panel, so that when the belt is driven, the panels move away from one another to open the doorway. When the belt is driven in the other direction, the panels move together toward one another to close the doorway. The opening of the door is typically actuated by a motion detector, a pull cord connected to a switch or an induction loop in the floor that senses the presence of a vehicle. Although the sliding doors open and close with considerable speed, the forklifts also travel with considerable speed. Sometimes, when a door is opening or closing, the forklift may impact the door, usually adjacent to a leading edge of one of the door panels. When this happens, severe damage can occur to the door.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art doors made to endure impacts such as this have typically been made of fabric covered foam or other soft materials, which can absorb impact without significant damage to the door. However, the materials of these doors have other disadvantages, including that they wear out, the severity of the impact that can be endured is quite limited, they are not easily cleaned, they absorb moisture, they can contribute to mold growth which is important in a food storage facility, and they can become torn, and do not present a structural or aesthetic appearance.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides an impactable sliding door that addresses these issues. In a door of the invention, there is at least one door panel assembly having a track panel that is suspended from the track and slidable relative to the track so as to open and close the doorway and a swinging panel that is hingedly connected to the track panel so as to pivot about a generally vertical axis relative to the track panel so that it can pivot in either direction out of the plane of the track panel. Thereby, the swinging panel can move out of the way regardless of which side it is struck from.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The swinging panel is preferably held in the plane of the track panel, in a normal position, by a detent mechanism. The detent can be at the top of the swinging panel with one part of the detent on the swinging panel and the other part of the detent on a header that extends from the first panel inwardly over the second panel. The detent permits release of the door in either direction and the hinge connection of the swinging door panel to the track door panel permits the swinging door panel to pivot in either direction out of the plane of the track door panel, when it is impacted from one side or the other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is also preferred that the swinging door panel have a leading edge, that is the edge that contacts the leading edge of the other sliding door panel in a two door panel assembly where the two door panels meet in the middle of the doorway, or the edge that contacts the threshold of the doorway in a single door panel assembly door closing system. The leading edge is preferably provided by a foam or otherwise highly compressible and impact-absorptive material, which may be covered with a reinforced fabric like nylon or canvas. Each of the track and swinging door panel sections may primarily be made, however, of a structurally rigid material. Preferably, if the door is to be used in a freezer or refrigerated room application, the material is an insulating material and should be of light weight to reduce its inertia and therefore the accelerating force necessary to swing it open when it is impacted. The leading edge may also be provided with a pressure responsive sensor that detects if the leading edge has been compressed or impacted, and a sensor may also be provided that senses whether the swinging panel has been swung out of the plane of the track panel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, it is preferred that an impact resistant sheet be added to the outside, on both sides of the second panel, in the area of the second panel which is most likely to be hit by a fork lift, that is in the area of about the lower half of the door and over substantially the entire surface area of the structurally rigid part of the second door panel. For example, a ⅛ inch thick sheet of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene is such a material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A soft leading edge of each door panel also contributes to sealing of the door when it is closed, either against the threshold of the doorway if it is a side closing door (having one door closing assembly), or against the leading edge of the other door panel assembly if it is a center closing door (having two door panel assemblies). The leading edges of the door panels may be provided with tubular or other structures that overlap when the doors are closed for better sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the invention, the entire door panel assembly, including both the first and second panels, is able to be swung about a horizontal axis in at least one direction. In the preferred embodiment, the horizontal axis is provided by the connection between the trolley wheels and the track, which is a conventional connection for sliding industrial doors, each trolley wheel having an outer circumference that is concave so that the wheel can engage a similarly shaped convex rail of the track and be guided by the rail and pivot about the horizontal rail. The mating concave and convex shapes permit rotation of the trolley wheels about the rail so that the door panel assembly can be swung about a horizontal axis in the direction away from the adjacent wall to which the track is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another feature of the present invention is that the bottom of the door is connected in a releasable fashion to a track that is fastened to the wall so that if the door is impacted and swung away from the wall, the connection can release. When the door is pivoted back into its normal operating position, which is generally in a vertical plane adjacent to the wall, the connection will automatically reengage to hold the bottom of the door adjacent to the wall as the door slides parallel to the wall and parallel to the doorway opening in the wall that the door closes. A feature can also be included that will automatically pivot the door back into a vertical plane, such as a re-engagement member that re-engages the door with the track when the door is fully opened.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref> illustrate a door <b>10</b> including a left door panel assembly <b>12</b> and a right door panel assembly <b>14</b>. The two door panel assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are identical mirror images of one another. The door panel assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are suspended from a track <b>16</b> in well-known manner by standard trolleys <b>18</b> at the outward top sides of each door panel assembly <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and by a left-hand trolley <b>20</b> at the inward top side of the assembly <b>12</b> and by a right-hand trolley <b>22</b> at the inward top side of the assembly <b>14</b>. The track <b>16</b> is bolted or otherwise affixed to a wall <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) and, preferably, a lower rail <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is also affixed to the wall <b>30</b> at the sides of the doorway opening, the lower rail <b>33</b> engaging a leaf spring extension of the door panel assembly to hold the lower end of the door panel assembly adjacent to the wall <b>30</b>, as further described below. In well known fashion, the track <b>16</b> on each side of center angles down slightly toward center (in a bi-part door; down toward the closed side in a single part door) so that the bottom of the door is closer to the floor when it is closed, to compress elastomeric seal strips <b>141</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) at the bottom of the door against the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7B</figref>, the trolleys illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> are affixed to a header <b>50</b> which is attached to the top of the track panel <b>52</b> of the door panel assembly <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> as described below. Each trolley <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>22</b> includes a pair of rollers <b>32</b>, each of which has a concave groove which defines its circumference. Each roller <b>32</b> receives a convex rail <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) of the track <b>16</b>. The shape of the rail <b>34</b> matches the convex shape of the circumference of each roller <b>32</b> such that the door panel assemblies <b>14</b> can swing in a direction away from the wall <b>30</b>. The wall <b>30</b> being adjacent to the inside surfaces of the door <b>10</b> obviously keeps the door panels <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> from swinging in the direction toward the wall <b>30</b>. When swinging about the axis defined by the concave surfaces of the rollers <b>32</b> and convex surface of rail <b>34</b>, the door panel assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> swing about a horizontal axis, since the rail <b>34</b> and rollers <b>32</b> define an axis which has its orientation horizontal. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the trolleys <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>22</b> may also be provided with spacers <b>36</b> which keep the rollers <b>32</b> on the rail <b>34</b> in case an impact should ever tend to lift or dislodge the rollers <b>32</b> from the rail <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The door panel assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are driven toward one another to close the doorway or away from one another to open the doorway (since they close in the middle of the doorway) by a power operated belt <b>37</b> in conventional fashion. The left-hand lead trolley <b>20</b> and the right-hand lead trolley <b>22</b> have respective drive attachments <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, with the attachment <b>40</b> being attached to the upper run of the drive belt <b>37</b> and the attachment <b>42</b> being attached to the lower run of the drive belt <b>37</b>. When the drive belt <b>37</b> is driven by an electric motor <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) in conventional fashion, for example to open the door, the upper run of the belt <b>37</b> moves to the right and the lower run moves to the left, driving the respective door panel assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the same respective directions. The opposite occurs when the door is closed, and the belt is driven in the opposite direction. The drive mechanisms, sensors (e.g., the motion detector that actuates the opening of the door), and related circuitry and hardware for opening and closing the door are well known and conventional. Any type of drive, sensors and circuitry could be used. Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> is an e-chain <b>46</b> which is a cable carrier that permits routing wires to the movable door assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in a movable fashion, also well known in the art, and any suitable means of supplying power to the moving components of the door that require power could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, which show only the door panel assembly <b>12</b>. The door panel assembly <b>14</b>, which is the mirror image of assembly <b>12</b>, is the same and this description applies to it also except as otherwise noted. Each door panel assembly includes a header <b>50</b> at its top, to which the trolleys are bolted or otherwise affixed. The header <b>50</b> is bolted or otherwise affixed to the track panel <b>52</b> of the assembly <b>12</b>. The header <b>50</b> has a beam section <b>54</b> which extends for substantially the entire width of the door panel assembly <b>12</b> and, in the area over the track panel <b>52</b> has flanges <b>56</b>, preferably on both sides of the panel <b>52</b> which are bolted to the panel <b>52</b>, or otherwise suitably affixed. Flanges <b>56</b> are provided on both sides of the panel <b>52</b> and the top of the panel <b>52</b> is inserted between the flanges <b>56</b>, and the bolts may either extend all the way from one flange <b>56</b> to the other, or the bolts may extend into the panel <b>52</b> through holes in each flange <b>56</b> if separate bolts are used. Separate bolts may be preferable in a refrigeration application so that heat is not conducted from one end of the bolt on one side of the door to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The entire door panel assembly including the track panel <b>52</b> and the swinging panel <b>58</b> is supported from the track <b>16</b> by the header <b>50</b>. Thus, the swinging panel <b>58</b> is essentially cantilevered from the track panel <b>52</b>. Suitable weather stripping or other sealing means (not shown for clarity) is preferably provided between the top of the door panel assembly and the extending portion of the header <b>50</b>, the extending portion being the portion that is inward from the flanges <b>56</b>, over the panel <b>58</b>, to seal off the area between the extending portion of the header <b>50</b> and the portion of the door panel assembly which is not directly affixed to the header <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, it is preferable that if the door panel assembly is to be used for a refrigerated application, that it be an insulating door. To that end, each door panel <b>52</b> and <b>58</b> has a core <b>62</b> (e.g., 4 inches thick) of an insulating material such as expanded polystyrene (eps). For strength and appearance, the core <b>62</b> is laminated on each of its two opposite side faces with a fiberglass skin <b>64</b>. Steel or other high strength material reinforcing strips <b>66</b> are laminated to the tops and to the bottoms of the fiberglass skins <b>64</b> of each panel <b>52</b> and <b>58</b>, as it is in these areas that the hinges are attached to the door panels <b>52</b> and <b>58</b>. The metal reinforcing strips <b>66</b> help prevent tear out of the hinges in the case of a severe impact. In addition, end caps <b>68</b> and <b>70</b>, which may be made of steel, another metal, or plastic, are preferably provided on the outward end of panel <b>52</b> and over the inward end of panel <b>58</b>. This construction also helps provide a door of low weight and therefore low inertia that requires a relatively low accelerating force to get out of the way when it is struck. Other constructions could also be used, and the panels could be hard sided or soft-sided.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The end cap <b>70</b> over the inward end of panel <b>58</b> mounts at its inward side, a fabric covered foam pad <b>72</b> which serves as the leading edge of the assembly <b>12</b>. The end caps <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are channels into which the outward end of the eps/fiberglass lamination of panel <b>52</b> and the inward end of the eps/fiberglass lamination of panel <b>58</b> are respectively inserted and adhered or otherwise fixedly attached. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D and <b>10</b>A, the inward or exposed end of each foam pad <b>72</b> may be radiused with a convexity, and tubes <b>73</b> and <b>75</b> may be provided in sleeves secured to the leading edges, one on one side and the other on the other side of the respective leading edges, on the respective assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, so that they overlap when the panels are closed to provide a better seal when closed. Also, since both leading edges are made of foam, they may be precompressed with each closing of the door, to create a better seal. Also, as is known in the art, each leading edge may be provided with a pressure tube <b>77</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10A</figref>) having a sensor that detects pressure changes in the tube <b>77</b> to detect if the leading edge has been compressed, for example by bumping into a vehicle, to trigger opening of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The panel <b>58</b> also has a gas spring attachment <b>74</b> and a center detent block <b>76</b> attached to its top. Any suitable means of attachment may be used, and as illustrated, the gas spring attachment <b>74</b> is attached by being mounted on a sheet metal yoke that is adhered to the plates <b>66</b> or otherwise affixed thereto, and the detent block <b>76</b> is also mounted on the bent-up flange of a yoke that is adhered or otherwise fixedly attached to the strips <b>66</b>. The yokes <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> may have legs which extend on both sides of the panel <b>58</b> for a very secure connection with adhesive, bolts, or other suitable means, or may be attached to the flanges <b>98</b> of the hinge <b>96</b> for a secure connection with the door panel <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> illustrate the gas spring <b>82</b>. The gas spring <b>82</b> is a constant force compression spring, and other types of compression springs or other centering mechanisms may be used to bias the panel <b>58</b> back into the plane of the panel <b>52</b> if it is swung one way or the other out of the plane of panel <b>52</b>. One end of the gas spring <b>82</b> is attached to the gas spring attachment <b>74</b>, and the other end is attached to the header <b>50</b> so that the hinge axis of the panel <b>58</b> relative to the panel <b>52</b> is on a line between the two ends of the gas spring when the panel <b>58</b> is aligned in the plane of the panel <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. It is also noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> that the inward edge of panel <b>52</b> has a seal <b>86</b> that presents an inward facing convex surface, and the outward end of panel <b>58</b> has a seal <b>88</b> with an outward facing concave surface that mates with the convex surface of the seal <b>86</b>, the radii of the concave and convex surfaces being centered on the hinge axis of the panel <b>58</b> relative to the panel <b>52</b>. This helps seal the space between the outward end of the panel <b>58</b> and the inward end of the panel <b>52</b> when the door is closed with the panel <b>58</b> in the plane of the panel <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. The gas spring <b>82</b> biases the panel <b>58</b> into the plane of the panel <b>52</b> regardless of whether the panel <b>58</b> is swung clockwise or counter-clockwise relative to the panel <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, heat tape <b>97</b>, preferably of the self-regulating type, may be provided at areas of the door where frost or ice may otherwise form. This may include, for example, on the cold side at the outside corner of the panel <b>52</b>, running vertically down the corner for substantially the height of the panel <b>52</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>), inside the seal <b>86</b> running vertically for substantially the height of the seal <b>86</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>), and in the bottom of each of the panels <b>52</b> and <b>58</b> running horizontally along the bottom surfaces, inside the door preferably (not shown). A bulb seal <b>99</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>) may also be provided at the corner of each panel <b>52</b> that extends toward the wall <b>30</b> of the opening in which the door is installed, so as to seal against the wall when the door is shut. The door may be installed in the opening so that is moves slightly away from the wall and from the floor so that the door seals only contact the adjacent walls and floor in the closed position of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The centered detent block <b>76</b> is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> and is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12C-E</figref>. The block itself is preferably made out of a hard and lubricious plastic material (e.g., UHMW polyethylene) so that it can slide easily on the lead-in ramps of the spring detent <b>90</b> and snap positively into engagement with the spring <b>90</b> in the center position. The spring <b>90</b> is bolted or otherwise suitably fastened to the header <b>50</b> by a bracket <b>92</b>. The block <b>76</b> (shown by itself in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref> relative to spring <b>90</b>) is attached to the top of the swinging panel <b>58</b> and rides up on the ramped sides of the spring <b>90</b> when it is returning to the centered position, and when it reaches the center of the spring <b>90</b>, it snaps into the centered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12C and 12D</figref>. The spring <b>90</b> flexes to release it from the centered position upon impact or other force sufficient to overcome the detent, in either direction. In addition, a magnet <b>101</b> can be embedded or fastened to the block <b>76</b> or elsewhere on the panel <b>72</b> and a magnetically actuated reed switch installed on the header <b>50</b> that is actuated by the magnet, so as to provide an electrical signal indicative of whether the panel <b>58</b> is in the plane of the panel <b>52</b> or is swung out of that plane.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B, and <b>11</b>, the hinges <b>96</b> are as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. To fit these to the door panels, the two (upper and lower) outward corners are cut out of the panel <b>52</b> to form a recess so as to substantially close the gap between the inward end of panel <b>52</b> and the outward end of swinging panel <b>58</b>. Any remaining gap is substantially closed by the seals <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> as described above. The hinge <b>96</b> has opposed yokes that receive the thickness of the panels <b>52</b> and <b>58</b>, over the reinforcing panels <b>66</b>, and the yoke flanges <b>98</b> of the hinge are bolted or otherwise suitably affixed to the respective panels <b>52</b> and <b>58</b>. On each side of the assembly <b>12</b>, both the upper hinge <b>96</b> at the upper corner of the panel <b>52</b> and the lower hinge <b>96</b> at the lower corner of the panel <b>52</b> may be covered, for example by a rubber or other material cover, on both sides of the hinge so as to weatherstrip the hinge area to prevent heat transfer or any significant open spaces at those locations. The axis of hinge pin <b>102</b> defines the vertical axis about which panel <b>58</b> hinges in or out relative to the panel <b>52</b>. The hinge pin <b>102</b> at the upper hinge <b>96</b> is coaxial with the hinge pin <b>102</b> at the lower hinge <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, at the bottom of each door panel assembly <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, there is preferably provided a rail <b>33</b> which is bolted or otherwise suitably affixed to the wall <b>30</b>. The rail <b>33</b> runs lengthwise for at least the length of travel of each door assembly <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> on the respective side of the doorway and serves to hold the respective door assembly <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> adjacent to the wall <b>30</b> for its entire back and forth travel, in a generally vertical orientation. Rail <b>33</b> defines a downwardly facing shoulder <b>110</b> which faces toward the wall <b>30</b> and behind which a keeper <b>114</b> is received from the bottom of the shoulder <b>110</b>. The keeper <b>114</b> is made of a hard and lubricious plastic material, for example UHMW polyethylene, and is fixed to the free end of a cantilever spring <b>116</b>. The cantilever spring <b>116</b> is secured to the bottom of the door panel <b>52</b> at the bottom outward corner with bolts or other suitable means, by means of plate <b>118</b>. A wear block <b>120</b> is also mounted on the inward side of the bottom outward corner of the panel <b>52</b>, which is also made of a hard and lubricious plastic material like UHMW polyethylene, which rubs on the outer surface <b>122</b> of the rail <b>33</b> as the door assembly <b>12</b> travels back and forth. The UHMW wear piece <b>120</b> may extend all the way across the thickness of the panel <b>52</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, with the plate <b>118</b> fitting in a groove of the wear piece <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In any event, the door assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, being fitted with the releasable connection provided by the rail <b>33</b> and spring <b>116</b> arrangement, can be easily dislodged from the rail <b>33</b> if it is hit on its inward side, i.e. its side facing the wall <b>30</b>. If so, the slightly angled surface <b>124</b> on the keeper <b>114</b> cams against the inwardly facing surface of the shoulder <b>110</b> to flex spring <b>116</b> downwardly as door assembly <b>12</b> pivots away from the wall <b>30</b>, about the horizontal axis provided by the wheels <b>32</b> and rail <b>34</b>. The door assemblies <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are thereby released from being held adjacent to the wall <b>30</b>. When the obstruction is removed, the door assemblies <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are free to rotate back to their position adjacent to the wall <b>30</b>, and when they do, the keeper <b>114</b> cams on the angled surface <b>126</b> of the rail <b>33</b>, which flexes the spring <b>116</b> downwardly and permits keeper <b>114</b> to reengage behind the inwardly facing surface of the shoulder <b>110</b>, back into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, re-engagement members <b>111</b> may be provided near the ends of the rail <b>33</b> that cam on the wear pieces <b>120</b> when the door is near fully opened to move the door panel assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> back toward the wall <b>30</b> and the keeper <b>114</b> back into re-engagement with the rail <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The leading edge may be approximately six inches, and the entire width of the second panel may be approximately 30 inches, for example, with the first panel that is supported by the trolleys from the track, also being about 30 inches wide or so, but any dimensions may be applied to a door of the invention. In addition, an impact plate <b>133</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may be provided covering at least the lower portion of each swinging panel <b>58</b> over the fiberglass skins, to absorb impacts and preserve the surface finish. The impact plates are preferably made of a tough material, such as ⅛ inch thick UHMW polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Many modifications and variations to the preferred embodiment described will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention should not be limited to the embodiment described, but should be defined by the claims which follow.</p>
