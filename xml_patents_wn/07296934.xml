<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optical transmission module and a manufacturing method thereof, and particularly relates to an optical transmission module having an optical element with an optical circuit formed therein and optical connection parts adapted to connect optical fibers to the optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, with a rapid progress in optical communications, enhancement of communication speed and transmission capacity has been promoted. Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM), which is a multiplexing technique using lights with various wavelengths and capable of supporting such enhancement, is gaining widespread use in optical communication systems. The WDM requires highly-accurate optical components for enabling multiplexing and demultiplexing of lights with a wavelength interval of 1 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is commonly known in the art of optical communications, various optical elements are used in transmission channels formed by optical fibers (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 05-264862). Among the optical components, waveguide components are remarkable in that they are mass-producible and applicable to LSI. Especially, expectations for Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC), which is one of the waveguide components, is high because it can be connected to optical fibers with a low optical transmission loss and can integrate a number of optical functions therein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A PLC substrate having such a PLC optically connected to optical fibers is therefore used in high-speed and large-capacity optical communications. The PLC substrate is connected to the optical fibers by fiber arrays, and the fiber arrays are connected to the PLC substrate by optical path forming resins.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, the optical elements having PLCs have been made of quartz, Pyrex (™), or the like. However, with recent developments for size and weight reduction and easier production, the core and cladding of optical elements having PLCs can be formed by laminating polymer resins with different refractive indexes on a silicon substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a perspective view of a related-art optical transmission module <b>10</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows side and top views of the optical transmission module <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The optical transmission module <b>10</b> comprises an optical element <b>30</b>, and fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> for connecting optical fibers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> to the optical element <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The fiber array <b>21</b> holds the optical fiber <b>11</b>, an end face of which is exposed from an end face of the fiber array <b>21</b> in the direction of an arrow X<b>2</b>. The fiber array <b>22</b> holds the optical fibers <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, an end face of each of which is exposed from an end face of the fiber array <b>22</b> in the direction of an arrow X<b>1</b>. The fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are typically made of quartz or a glass material. The end face of the fiber array <b>21</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>2</b> is bonded to the optical element <b>30</b> through an optical path forming resin <b>41</b> so as to match the end face of the optical fiber <b>11</b> and an end face of an optical path formed in the optical element <b>30</b>. The end face of the fiber array <b>22</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>1</b> is bonded to the optical element <b>30</b> through an optical path forming resin <b>42</b> so as to match the end faces of the optical fibers <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and end faces of optical paths formed in the optical element <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following describes the optical element <b>30</b> in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a perspective view of the optical element <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The optical element <b>30</b> is adapted to branch an incident light output and output branched lights form a waveguide, comprising a substrate <b>31</b>, a lower cladding layer <b>32</b>, a core <b>33</b>, and an upper cladding layer <b>34</b>. The substrate <b>31</b> is, for example, a silicon (Si) substrate. The lower cladding layer <b>32</b>, the core <b>33</b>, the upper cladding layer <b>34</b> are resin laminations formed on the substrate <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following describes a manufacturing method of the optical element <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, the lower cladding layer <b>32</b> is formed on the substrate <b>31</b>. The lower cladding layer <b>32</b> is typically made of transparent resin such as fluorinated polyimide. The lower cladding layer <b>32</b> is formed by, for example, forming a polyamic acid layer on the substrate <b>31</b> with a spin-coating method, and imidizing the layer through a heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Then, the core <b>33</b> is formed on the lower cladding layer <b>32</b>. The core <b>33</b> as a waveguide is made of the same fluorinated polyimide as the lower cladding layer <b>32</b> and the upper cladding layer <b>34</b>. The composition of the resin of the core <b>33</b> is adjusted to have a refractive index different from that of the lower cladding layer <b>32</b> and the upper cladding layer <b>34</b>. For example, when the refractive index of the lower cladding layer <b>32</b> and the upper cladding layer <b>34</b> is n<b>1</b> and the refractive index of the core <b>33</b> is n<b>2</b>, the composition of the resin is adjusted to have
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>n1&lt;n2.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Herein, the refractive index n<b>1</b> and n<b>2</b> are, for example, n<b>1</b>=1.525, n<b>2</b>=1.531.
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For forming the core <b>33</b>, a polyamic acid layer is formed uniformly on the lower cladding layer <b>32</b> with a spin-coating method, and the layer is imidized through a heat treatment to form a transparent resin layer. Then, the transparent resin layer is coated with a patterned resist, and is dry-etched by a RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) machine to have the lower cladding layer <b>32</b> exposed. In this process, a part coated with a photoresist remains unetched to keep the transparent resin layer thereunder. Then, the remaining photoresist is removed. In this way, the core <b>33</b> with a desired pattern is formed. The thickness of the core <b>33</b> is around 9 through 10 μm, which is substantially equal to the diameter of the optical fibers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Next, the upper cladding layer <b>34</b> is formed to cover the upper and side surfaces of the core <b>33</b>. The upper cladding layer <b>34</b> is made of the same fluorinated polyimide as the lower cladding layer <b>32</b>, and the composition thereof is adjusted to have the refractive index n<b>1</b>, which is the same refractive index as the lower cladding layer <b>32</b>. The upper cladding layer <b>34</b> is formed by, for example, forming a polyamic acid layer with a spin-coating method, and imidizing the layer through a heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this way, the optical element <b>30</b> having a waveguide with a desired pattern is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The optical element <b>30</b> having polymer resins with different refractive indexes on the silicon substrate cannot have a resin material on the upper, side, and bottom surfaces thereof due to a large influence of the refractive index. If the optical element <b>30</b> has the resin material on those surfaces, a light passing through the core <b>33</b> is lost. For this reason, the optical element <b>30</b> is connected to the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> only at the end faces thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, the end faces of the optical element <b>30</b> are small, so that the connection areas between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are also small. This makes connections between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> weak. Therefore, the optical transmission module <b>10</b> with a silicon substrate described above is disadvantageous in this respect.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An object of the present invention is to provide an optical transmission module and a manufacturing method thereof to overcome at least one disadvantage described above. The specific object of the present invention is to provide an optical transmission module and a manufacturing method thereof to strengthen connections between fiber arrays and an optical element with minimum optical loss.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical transmission module, comprising an optical element having an optical path formed therein, optical connection parts respectively arranged on both sides of the optical element so as to connect the optical element to plural optical fibers, and reinforcement parts applied to a part of or an entire circumference of respective connected portions between the optical element and the optical connection parts and cured to reinforce connections between the optical element and the optical connection parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The reinforcement parts are preferably made of a resin material with hardness lower than the hardness of a material of the optical element, a material of the optical connection parts, and an optical path forming resin connecting the optical element and the optical connection parts.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is preferable that the Young's modulus of the resin material of the reinforcement parts be approximately 9.0×10<sup>9 </sup>or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is also preferable that the Young's modulus of the resin materials of the reinforcement parts be approximately 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is also preferable that the reinforcement parts be respectively formed as fillets on the corresponding connected portions between the optical element and the optical connection parts.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a manufacturing method of an optical transmission module including an optical element having an optical path formed therein, and optical connection parts respectively arranged on both sides of the optical element so as to connect the optical element to plural optical fibers. The method comprises a connecting step of connecting the optical element to the optical connection parts by an optical path forming resin, and a reinforcing step of applying a resin to a part of or an entire circumference of connected portions between the optical element and the optical connection parts and curing the resin to reinforce connections between the optical element and the optical connection parts, after the connecting step in which the optical element and the optical connection parts are connected by the optical path forming resin.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the present invention, since there are reinforcement parts applied to a part of or an entire circumference of the respective connected portions between the optical element and the optical connection parts and cured to reinforce connections between the optical element and the optical connection parts, the connections between the optical element and the optical connection parts can be reinforced with minimum optical loss.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective view of an optical transmission module <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows side and top views of the optical transmission module <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, elements same as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> are denoted by the same reference numbers, and they are not further described here.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The optical transmission module <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment has a fillet-like reinforcement portion <b>111</b> around a connected portion between the fiber array <b>21</b> and the optical element <b>30</b>, and a reinforcement portion <b>112</b> around a connected portion between the fiber array <b>22</b> and the optical element <b>30</b>. The fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> correspond to optical connection parts in the following claims.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The reinforcement portion <b>111</b> is made of a resin material, such as a silicon-based resin material, with hardness lower than the resin material of the optical element <b>30</b>, the resin material of the fiber array <b>21</b>, and the optical path forming resin <b>41</b> connecting the optical element <b>30</b> to the fiber array <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing characteristics of optical loss at the reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> relative to the Young's modulus.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The optical loss has the characteristic as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in relation to Young's modulus of the reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>. For example, it was found from experiment that the optical loss at the connected portions between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is reduced when a resin material with the Young's modulus in a cured state of approximately 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>through 9.0×10<sup>9 </sup>is used as the resin material of the reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the first embodiment, the connection between the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and the optical element <b>30</b> is strengthened by forming the fillet-like reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> around the connected portions between the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and the optical element <b>30</b>. Especially, the optical loss is minimized when a silicon-based resin with the Young's modulus in a cured state of approximately 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>through 9.0×10<sup>9 </sup>is used as the reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The following describes a manufacturing method of the optical transmission module <b>100</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">First, the end face of the optical element <b>30</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>1</b> and the fiber array <b>21</b> are connected through the optical path forming resin <b>41</b> so as to match the optical paths thereof, and the optical path forming resin <b>41</b> is cured. Likewise, the end face of the optical element <b>30</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>2</b> and the fiber array <b>22</b> are connected through the optical path forming resin <b>42</b> so as to match the optical paths thereof, and the optical path forming resin <b>42</b> is cured. The fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are thus bonded to the optical element <b>30</b> respectively at the end faces in the directions of the arrow X<b>1</b> and the arrow X<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, a reinforcement resin material is applied to the entire circumference of the connected portion between the end face of the optical element <b>30</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>1</b> and the fiber array <b>21</b>, and cured through addition/condensation reactions by, for example, a heat treatment and an ultraviolet radiation to form the reinforcement portion <b>111</b>. Likewise, a reinforcement resin material is applied to the entire circumference of the connected portion between the end face of the optical element <b>30</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>2</b> and the fiber array <b>22</b>, and is cured through addition/condensation reactions by, for example, a heat treatment and an ultraviolet radiation to form the reinforcement portion <b>112</b>. In this way, the reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are respectively formed on the entire circumferences of the connected portions between the end faces of the optical element <b>30</b> in the directions of the arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since the reinforcement portions <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> formed on the connected portions between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are made of the resin material with hardness that minimizes the optical loss, i.e., with the Young's modulus of approximately 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>through 9.0×10<sup>9</sup>, the connections between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are strengthened while minimizing the optical loss at the connected portions between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and therearound.</p>

The reinforcement portion <b>212</b> is made of a resin material with the Young's modulus in a cured state of approximately 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>through 9.0×10<sup>9</sup>, which is applied and cured like a fillet on the edges of the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber array <b>21</b> in the direction of an arrow Z<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reinforcement portion <b>221</b> is made of a resin material with the Young's modulus in a cured state of approximately 1.0×10<sup>4 </sup>through 9.0×10<sup>9</sup>, which is applied and cured like a fillet on the edges of the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber array <b>22</b> in the direction of the arrow Z<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the second embodiment, since the reinforcement portions <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> are formed only on the edges of the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> in the directions of the arrows Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b>, the optical loss at the connected portions between the optical element <b>30</b> and the fiber arrays <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is reduced.</p>
