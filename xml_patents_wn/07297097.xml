<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates, in general, to lift type weight measuring centrifuges and, more particularly, to a lift type weight measuring centrifuge which is able to measure the weight of measurement object after spatially isolating the measurement object from a main body.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, centrifuges are apparatuses in which a rotor holding a bucket, in which a sample is placed, is rotated at high speed to apply high centrifugal force to the sample, so that a high density fraction is moved radially outwards and a low density fraction is moved radially inwards, thus separating the fractions from each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing a conventional automatic balancing centrifuge. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the automatic balancing centrifuge includes a base <b>110</b>, a centrifugal motor <b>120</b> which is supported by the base <b>110</b>, a rotor <b>130</b> which is coaxially coupled to the centrifugal motor <b>120</b> and has a rotor lever <b>160</b>, and a bucket <b>140</b> which has a predetermined volume to contain therein a desired sample <b>150</b> to be separated into fractions. The rotor <b>130</b> is provided with an upper housing <b>172</b> having a cubic cap shape and a lower housing <b>174</b> in which one rotor lever <b>160</b> is mounted. The rotor lever <b>160</b> has a lever central body <b>161</b> which is positioned at the center of the rotor lever <b>160</b>, and two rotating arms <b>162</b> which are coupled at opposite ends of the lever central body <b>161</b> by hinges <b>163</b>, thus being rotatable vertically. A pressure sensor <b>168</b> is mounted on a lower portion of each of the rotating arms <b>162</b> provided at the opposite ends of the lever central body <b>161</b>, so as to directly sense the pressure of the rotating arm <b>162</b>. The rotating arms <b>162</b> are balanced by the support of the pressure sensors <b>168</b>. Two lever guide holes <b>166</b> are provided at opposite sides on outer surfaces of the upper and lower housings <b>172</b> and <b>174</b>. The rotor lever <b>160</b> is inserted through the lever guide holes <b>166</b> and is horizontally movable in the lever guide holes <b>166</b> to maintain balance. In the drawings, the reference numeral <b>164</b> denotes a stop protrusion which is provided on each inner surface of the rotating arms <b>162</b> to hold the bucket <b>140</b>. The reference numeral <b>142</b> denotes a stop groove which is formed on the bucket <b>140</b> to engage with the stop protrusion <b>164</b>. In this construction, when measuring values of the opposite pressure sensors <b>168</b> are different in the state in which the samples <b>150</b> are placed in the buckets <b>140</b>, a lever moving motor <b>182</b> provided in the upper housing <b>172</b> is operated. Then, the rotor lever <b>160</b> is horizontally moved by the operation of the lever moving motor <b>182</b>, thus becoming balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to such a conventional automatic balancing centrifuge, imbalance of samples supported by the rotor lever is sensed prior to every centrifugal operation and, thereafter, the rotor lever is moved according to the imbalance sensing result, thus automatically balancing the centrifuge. Therefore, the samples are prevented from damage due to imbalance of the rotor and, as well, the lifetime of the automatic balancing centrifuge is extended. However, the conventional automatic balancing centrifuge is problematic in that because the weight sensor such as the pressure sensors are frequently struck by the buckets containing the measurement objects, the weight sensor is easily damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Technical Problem</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a lift type weight measuring apparatus which has a structure capable of separating a weight sensor from a measurement object so that the weight sensor is prevented from damage due to frequent contact between the weight sensor and the measurement object.</p>

The automatic balancing centrifuge further includes a rotor <b>330</b> which is provided with a rotor lever <b>340</b> and which is coaxially coupled to the centrifugal motor <b>322</b>, and a pair of buckets <b>360</b> containing therein samples to be separated into fractions. The rotor <b>330</b> may have the same construction as that of the above-mentioned conventional automatic balancing centrifuge. Each bucket <b>360</b> containing the sample has a pair of stop grooves <b>362</b>. Thus, when each bucket <b>360</b> is coupled to each of a plurality of rotating arms <b>342</b>, the stop grooves <b>362</b> of the bucket <b>360</b> engage with a pair of stop protrusions <b>344</b> of each rotating arm <b>342</b>, so that the bucket <b>360</b> is reliably supported by the rotating arm <b>342</b>. Here, because the stop protrusions <b>344</b> must not interference with each bucket <b>360</b> being weighed, each stop groove <b>362</b> of each bucket <b>360</b> must gradually enlarge in width and depth from top to bottom. In the drawings, the reference numeral <b>350</b> denotes a motor shaft which couples the centrifugal motor <b>322</b> to the rotor <b>330</b>. The reference numeral <b>400</b> denotes the lift type weight measuring apparatus of the present invention which is mounted on the base <b>310</b> of the centrifuge.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the lift type weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> also known as centrifuge includes a vertical frame <b>440</b> to which both an upper horizontal frame plate <b>442</b> and a lower horizontal frame plate <b>444</b> are fastened. The weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> further includes a lift drive motor <b>432</b> which is fastened to the lower horizontal frame plate <b>444</b>, and a rotating shaft <b>434</b> which is axially coupled to the lift drive motor <b>432</b> and, thus, is rotated by the operation of the lift drive motor <b>432</b>. The weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> further includes a central slide <b>436</b> which is screwed to the rotating shaft <b>434</b> to convert the rotation of the lift drive motor <b>432</b> into vertical linear movement. The weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> further includes an upper sensing plate <b>410</b> on which the bucket <b>360</b> is seated, and a weight sensor <b>422</b> which is coupled to a lower surface of the upper sensing plate <b>410</b> by a locking bolt to measure the weight of the bucket <b>360</b>. The weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> further includes a lower sensing plate <b>421</b> which is coupled to a lower end of the weight sensor <b>422</b> by a locking bolt and which is coupled to an upper end of the central slide <b>436</b>. The weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> further includes at least one guide <b>426</b> which is coupled to the upper horizontal frame plate <b>442</b> to help the lower sensing plate <b>421</b> correctly move vertically without shaking. Preferably, the weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> further includes a linear bush <b>424</b> to reduce friction between the guide <b>426</b> and the lower sensing plate <b>421</b> during the vertical movement of the lower sensing plate <b>421</b> by the operation of the lift drive motor <b>432</b>. Furthermore, it is preferred that the weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> include a position sensor <b>454</b> to correctly stop the upper sensing plate <b>410</b> at its desired higher or lower position. The position sensor <b>454</b> is supported by a position sensor support <b>452</b> which is coupled to the lower sensing plate <b>421</b>. A light emitting device <b>454</b><i>b </i>is provided on a side of the position sensor <b>454</b>. A light receiving device <b>454</b><i>a </i>is provided on the other side of the position sensor <b>454</b> to receive light emitted from the light emitting device <b>454</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the position sensor <b>454</b> senses a mark formed on a position sensing panel <b>456</b> which is attached to the upper horizontal frame plate <b>442</b>.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the meantime, the weight sensor <b>422</b> is embodied by a device, such as a strain gauge, piezoelectric sensor, etc. The position sensor <b>454</b> is variously embodied by a device, such as an interrupt type photocoupler, or a switch, etc. Furthermore, a metal lubricant may be used in place of the linear bush <b>424</b>. It is preferred to use a stepping motor as the lift drive motor <b>432</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an electrical block diagram of the lift type weight measuring apparatus of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an electrical construction of the lift type weight measuring apparatus of the present invention includes a position sensing unit <b>730</b> which is provided with both the position sensor <b>454</b> and its peripheral devices, and a weight sensing unit <b>720</b> which is the weight sensor <b>422</b> and its peripheral devices. The electrical construction of the lift type weight measuring apparatus further includes a key input unit <b>710</b> which is required to input various keys necessary for the weight measurement, and a display unit <b>740</b> which displays various kinds of information about the operation of the weight measuring apparatus. The electrical construction of the lift type weight measuring apparatus further includes a sensor moving unit <b>750</b> which vertically moves the upper sensing plate <b>410</b> using the lift drive motor <b>432</b>, and a control unit <b>700</b> which control the operation of the entire apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of a part of the centrifuge taken along the line IX-IX of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in which the bucket <b>360</b> having therein a sample to be separated is not lifted. Every rotating arm <b>342</b> of the centrifuge is controlled by the movement of the rotor lever <b>340</b>, such that the rotating arms <b>342</b> are in the same rotating track around the rotor <b>330</b>. One rotating arm <b>342</b> is placed at a predetermined position over the weight measuring apparatus <b>400</b> by the operation of both the centrifugal motor <b>322</b> and a constant position sensor (not shown). At this time, a predetermined space must exist between the bucket <b>360</b> containing the sample and the upper sensing plate <b>410</b> to allow spatial variation in the rotating track of the bucket <b>360</b> due to centrifugal force during the rotation of the rotor lever <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view showing another state of the lift type weight measuring apparatus during the weight measurement. In the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> the lift drive motor <b>432</b> is operated to measure the weight of the bucket <b>360</b> and lifts the lower sensing plate <b>421</b> upwards. At this time, the lift drive motor <b>432</b> is operated until the bucket <b>360</b>, which is raised by the upper sensing plate <b>410</b>, is placed at a predetermined position at which the bucket <b>360</b> does not interfere with its peripheral component, that is, the stop protrusions <b>344</b>. This position can be determined by the position sensor <b>454</b> which senses the upper light opening <b>456</b><i>b </i>of the position sensing panel <b>456</b>. The position signal sensed through the above-mentioned process is sent to the control unit <b>700</b>. The control unit <b>700</b> gives a control command to the sensor moving unit <b>750</b>, so that the rotation of the lift drive motor <b>432</b> is stopped. In this state, the weight sensing unit <b>720</b> senses the weight of the bucket <b>360</b> and transmits this weight sensing signal to the control unit <b>700</b>. Then, the control unit <b>700</b> temporarily stores the weight sensing signal and transmits it to a main controller (not shown) of the centrifuge. Thereafter, the control unit <b>700</b> outputs a control signal to the sensor moving unit <b>750</b> to reversely rotate the lift drive motor <b>432</b>, thus moving the lower sensing plate <b>421</b> downwards. In the downward movement of the lower sensing plate <b>421</b>, the position sensor <b>454</b> moves downwards along with the lower sensing plate <b>421</b> and senses the lower light opening <b>456</b><i>a </i>formed at the lower position on the position sensing panel <b>456</b>. Thereafter, this sensing signal is sent to the control unit <b>700</b>. Then, the control unit <b>700</b> gives a control command to the sensor moving unit <b>750</b> so that the rotation of the lift drive motor <b>432</b> stops. At this time, the stop grooves <b>362</b> of the bucket <b>360</b> engage with the stop protrusions <b>344</b> of the rotating arm <b>342</b> again. The rotor <b>330</b> becomes rotatable. Next, the control unit <b>700</b> transmits the result of the measured weight of the relevant bucket <b>360</b> to the main controller of the centrifuge. The main controller of the centrifuge rotates the rotating arms <b>342</b> to 180 degrees to measure the weight of the other bucket <b>360</b> which is hung on the other rotating arm <b>342</b>. Thereafter, the main controller notifies the control unit <b>700</b>. Then, the control unit <b>700</b> measures the weight of the relevant bucket <b>360</b> through the above-mentioned weight measuring process and transmits the result to the main controller. According to the result, the main controller moves the rotor lever <b>340</b> horizontally to balance the rotating arms <b>342</b> and, thereafter, executes a centrifugal process.</p>
