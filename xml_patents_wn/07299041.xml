<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to communications and more particularly to a method and device of selecting a communication system in a grey zone or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Mobile communication systems, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular communication systems and the like, may be limited in capacity by the mobile station or mobile terminal to base station communication path or link or the reverse link. As the number of mobile stations in a cell of a cellular mobile communication system increases, the quality of communications degrades in the reverse link more quickly than degradation in the forward link or communication path from the base station to the mobile station. The mobile station may be able to receive pages on the forward link, but a page response or access attempt on the reverse link may fail because of interference from other mobile stations communicating within the cell. This may be referred to as a grey zone condition. Under such conditions, the mobile station may not have sufficient signal strength or transmit power level on the forward link to hold on to a paging channel to which it is tuned. The paging channel could be temporarily lost but not for such a time period that the mobile station determines that the system may be lost and that a system reselection process needs to occur. The mobile station temporarily losing the paging channel can result in the mobile station failing to receive incoming calls. Although the mobile station senses the availability of service and a sufficiently strong signal, the mobile station may be unable to receive or respond to a page. Outgoing calls may also fail. If the forward link is such that receipt of the paging channel by the mobile station is frequently interrupted, there is a very high likelihood that an access attempt on the reverse link will fail and eventually the system may be lost. The grey zone condition described above can occur when a mobile station first powers up and acquires a most preferred system from a preferred roaming list (PRL) or the mobile station moves or roams into a cell or area and experiences the grey zone condition.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a need to provide a method and communication device to avoid the grey zone condition. Additionally, there is a need to provide a method and communication device to facilitate selecting another communication channel or system when a mobile station acquires a most preferred system with frequent interruptions in the forward link or when the mobile station moves or roams into a grey zone condition.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method of selecting a communication system may include receiving at least a quality indicator for a channel. Any channels on a channel scan list may be scanned in response to at least the quality indicator of the channel being below a predetermined threshold value, and another channel from the channel scan list may be acquired in response to the other channel having at least the quality indicator greater than or equal to the predetermined threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method of selecting a communication system includes monitoring an E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>(ratio of chip energy to interference energy) of a CDMA pilot channel. Any channels on a channel scan list may be scanned to acquire another communication system in response to the E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>of the CDMA pilot channel remaining below a predetermined threshold for a predetermined period of time.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following detailed description of preferred embodiments refers to the accompanying drawings which illustrate specific embodiments of the invention. Other embodiments having different structures and operations do not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are a block diagram of an example of a communication device <b>100</b> in which communication system selection may be implemented in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The communication device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is an example of a CDMA mobile station or cellular phone. However, the present invention may also be applicable to other types of communication devices and communication standards.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The communication device <b>100</b> may have an operator or user interface <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) to facilitate controlling operation of the communication device <b>100</b> including initiating and conducting phone calls and the like. The user interface <b>102</b> may include a display <b>104</b> to provide visual signals to the subscriber or user as to the status and operation of the communication device <b>100</b>. The user interface <b>102</b> may also include a keypad <b>106</b> and function buttons <b>108</b>, soft keys or the like. The display <b>104</b>, keypad <b>106</b> and function buttons <b>108</b> may be coupled to a microprocessor <b>110</b> or the like. The microprocessor <b>110</b> may manage overall operation of the communication device <b>100</b> under stored program control using software programs that may be stored in a memory <b>112</b>. The memory <b>112</b> or other data storage device or devices <b>113</b> may store a preferred roaming list <b>114</b>, a grey zone channel list <b>116</b> and a channel scan list <b>118</b>. The preferred roaming list <b>114</b> is a database that may include systems and channels in different geographical areas that are preferred systems or channels for the communication device <b>100</b> to acquire and to communicate over because of more favorable roaming charges, fees or the like. There may also be other reasons why a particular system or channel is in the preferred roaming list <b>114</b>. The systems and channels in the preferred roaming list <b>114</b> may be listed in order of preference or desirability, so that the communication device <b>100</b> will scan and attempt to acquire those systems or channels before others in a particular geographical area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The grey zone list <b>116</b> may include those channels or systems that are evaluated by the communication device <b>100</b> as possibly causing a grey zone condition or whose operating parameters or indicators of communication quality or reliability may fall below predetermined threshold values or a grey zone threshold value. Examples of such communication quality indicators or reliability indicators may include received chip energy to interference noise ratio (E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O</sub>) of a pilot channel, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or the like. The grey zone channel list <b>116</b> may include a record of the channel number and frequency of any channels placed on the grey zone list <b>116</b>. An E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O</sub>, RSSI or other communication quality indicator or parameter associated with the channel may also be recorded on the list <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a CDMA communication system, each bit of digital information or data may be coded into multiple chips of radio frequency energy that are transmitted over-the-air. Hence the chip energy to interference noise energy ratio (E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O</sub>) of a CDMA pilot channel is a measure or indicator of the communication quality or reliability of the CDMA system for the geographical location where the communication device <b>100</b> may be located at the time. The grey zone list <b>116</b> is a dynamic list because the communication device <b>100</b> may move from one geographical location to another and the conditions of the communication environment can differ from one location to another and over time as more or fewer communication devices communicate on a particular base station. When identification information for a channel is added to the grey zone channel list <b>116</b>, a timing parameter may be associated with the channel in the list <b>116</b>. The list <b>116</b> may be reviewed at selected time intervals and any channels with an expired timing parameter may be removed from the list <b>116</b> and made available for acquisition. Accordingly, channels in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> may have a settable life during which they remain in the list <b>116</b>. Grey zone behavior or conditions are dynamic and can vary with both time and geography. Setting the duration that a channel remains on the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> enables the communication device <b>100</b> to reacquire a more preferred communication system or channel that may have been placed in the grey zone list <b>116</b> because of a grey zone condition at a particular time or location of the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The predetermined threshold values or grey zone threshold values may be programmed into the communication device <b>100</b> at the time of manufacture or at any time. A communication service provider or carrier may program or reprogram the predetermined threshold values or grey zone threshold values by using known handset programming tools. Enhancements may be made to the over-the-air provisioning or programming standards to permit such threshold values or parameters to be programmed over-the-air.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The channel scan list <b>118</b> may include a group of channels for systems available in a geographical area that the communication device <b>100</b> can scan to initially acquire service in the geographical area, or to look for a new system or channel with better communication parameters or performance characteristics. For example, after the communication device <b>100</b> determines that it is in a possible grey zone, the communication device <b>100</b> may build the channel scan list <b>118</b> to look for a channel of an alternative system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The communication device <b>100</b> may also include a hysteresis timer <b>119</b> or the like (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The hysteresis timer <b>119</b> may be part of or incorporated into the microprocessor <b>110</b> or may be a separate component. As will be discussed in more detail below, the hysteresis timer <b>119</b> may be started when E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O</sub>, received signal strength or other communication quality indicator or signal falls below the predetermined threshold value or grey zone threshold value. After the hysteresis timer <b>119</b> expires or after a predetermined time period, E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other indicator may be checked again for the current channel. If E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other indicator is still below the predetermined threshold, the channel number and frequency or other identifier of the current channel may be added to or recorded in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b>, and the channel scan list <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) may be built and scanned for a new channel and system having an E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator above the predetermined threshold. Therefore, the hysteresis timer <b>119</b> may cause the communication device <b>100</b> to scan any channels on the channel scan list <b>118</b> in response to at least E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator of the current channel being below the predetermined threshold value for a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>O</sub>, received signal strength or other indicator may vary rapidly as the communication device <b>100</b> moves about. Accordingly, confirming that E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>received signal strength or other quality indicator consistently remains below the predetermined threshold for the predetermined time period prevents the communication device <b>100</b> from hopping between channels each time E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator may momentarily fall below the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The communication device <b>100</b> may also include an initial acquisition scan timer <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). As described in more detail below, the initial acquisition scan timer <b>120</b> may be started after a current channel is added to the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> and before the communication device <b>100</b> scans to acquire a new channel or system. If the initial acquisition scan timer <b>120</b> expires before the new channel or system is acquired, an initial acquisition scan may be performed by the communication device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the initial scan timer <b>120</b> may cause the communication device <b>100</b> to conduct an initial acquisition scan in response to the communication device <b>100</b> failing to acquire another channel from the channel scan list <b>118</b> after a selected period of time. An initial acquisition scan is substantially a complete scan of available channels that the communications device <b>100</b> may perform when first powered-up. The initial acquisition scan timer <b>120</b> may be part of or incorporated into the microprocessor <b>110</b> or may be a separate component.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The hysteresis timer <b>119</b> and the initial acquisition scan timer <b>120</b> may each be programmed during manufacturing or at any other time. A communication service provider or carrier may program or reprogram the hysteresis timer <b>119</b> and the initial acquisition scan timer <b>120</b> by using known handset programming tools, such as over-the-air programming or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The user interface <b>102</b> may also include a microphone <b>121</b> and a speaker <b>122</b>. The microphone <b>121</b> may be connected to a transmitter <b>124</b> to convert audio signals from a subscriber into pulse code modulated (PCM) signals for transmission over the air. The transmitter <b>124</b> may include an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>126</b> connected to the microphone <b>120</b> and the ADC <b>126</b> may be connected to a variable rate speech coder <b>128</b>. The variable rate speech coder <b>128</b> may compress the digital signals from the ADC <b>126</b> into blocks of data. The variable rate speech coder <b>128</b> may be connected to a channel coder <b>130</b> that may perform a ⅓ rate convolutional coding of the signal blocks, add control information and interleave the blocks to produce a baseband data signal. The baseband data signal may be applied to a channel spreader <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The channel spreader <b>132</b> may exclusive OR the baseband data signal with a unique subscriber code that may be referred to as a long code <b>133</b> to produce a private data signal. The data signal may be multiplexed or spread by a PseudoNoise (PN) code <b>134</b> and a Walsh code <b>135</b> that may be provided by the microprocessor <b>110</b>. The PN code <b>134</b> spreads the signal so that it is unique to other radio channels in the CDMA system and the Walsh code <b>135</b> provides the unique code which identifies the communication device <b>100</b> from other devices operating on the same radio channel. The resultant spread data signal may be applied to a modulator <b>136</b>. The modulator <b>136</b> may be an offset quadrature phase shift keying (O-QPSK) type modulator. The modulator <b>136</b> may mix the spread data signal with a radio signal from a radio frequency (RF) synthesizer <b>137</b> and a phase shifted signal from a phase shifter <b>138</b> to provide an RF signal at a desired frequency. The RF signal may be boosted by an RF amplifier <b>140</b> for transmission by an antenna assembly <b>142</b>. The gain of the RF amplifier <b>140</b> may be course adjusted by the receive signal level and fine adjusted by a control signal that may be received from a base station (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A radio signal received by the antenna assembly <b>142</b> may be down converted by a receiver <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) and applied to the speaker <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) to produce an audio signal for the subscriber or user. The receiver <b>144</b> may include an RF receiver amplifier <b>146</b> connected to the antenna assembly <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). A signal from a fixed RF oscillator <b>148</b> may be mixed by a multiplexer <b>150</b> with a signal from the RF synthesizer <b>137</b> to produce a reference frequency that may be applied to the RF receiver amplifier <b>146</b> for frequency down-conversion. An output signal from the RF receiver amplifier <b>146</b> may be digitized by an RF demodulator <b>152</b> and supplied to a rake receiver <b>154</b>. The rake receiver <b>154</b> may include a plurality of correlators (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) that may digitally decode the primary and delayed signals. A channel decoder <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) may extract data and control information from the signal from the rake receiver <b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The control information may be sent to the microprocessor <b>110</b> and the data information or blocks may be sent to a variable rate speech decoder <b>158</b>. The speech decoder <b>158</b> may convert the data blocks into a PCM signal and a digital-to-analog converter <b>160</b> may convert the PCM signal to an analog signal that may be produced into an audio signal by the speaker <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example of a plurality of communication systems in a geographical area in which communication system selection may be implemented in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A first communication system <b>200</b> and second communication system <b>202</b> may provide wireless or cellular communication service in a common geographical area <b>204</b>. The first communication system <b>200</b> and the second communication system <b>202</b> may each be a CDMA communication system or the like. The first communication system <b>200</b> may include at least one mobile switching center (MSC) <b>206</b>. The first MSC <b>206</b> may be connected to one or a plurality of base stations (BS) <b>208</b>A and <b>208</b>B. The MSC <b>206</b> may switch communication signals or telephone calls between the base stations <b>208</b> or between the base stations <b>208</b> and a public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>210</b>. The PSTN <b>210</b> may route communication signals or phone calls to a fixed telephone station or terminal <b>212</b> or to a MSC <b>214</b> of the second communication system <b>202</b>. The MSC <b>214</b> of the second system <b>202</b> may be connected to one or a plurality of base stations <b>216</b>A and <b>216</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The base station <b>208</b>B of the first communication system <b>200</b> may provide wireless or cellular communications to communication devices or mobile stations <b>218</b> located within a smaller geographical area <b>220</b> within the larger geographical area <b>204</b>. The smaller geographical area <b>220</b> may be referred to as a cell. The base station <b>216</b>B of the second communication system <b>202</b> may provide cellular communications to mobile stations <b>218</b> within another cell <b>222</b>. Each of the mobile stations <b>218</b> may be similar to the communication device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cells <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> may overlap or may have a substantially similar footprint or coverage area. The first communication system <b>200</b> may be a CDMA communication system operating around the 800 MHz band and the second communication system <b>202</b> may be a CDMA communication system operating around the 1900 MHz band. When a mobile station <b>218</b> moves into the cell <b>220</b> or first powers-up, the mobile station <b>218</b> will perform an initial acquisition scan to obtain wireless communications within the geographical area of cell <b>220</b>. The mobile station <b>218</b> may scan for communication channels of systems serving the cell <b>220</b> according to a preferred roaming list, such as list <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, to find a preferred system. If system <b>200</b> is a preferred CDMA system, a mobile station <b>218</b>A may first scan for a CDMA pilot channel <b>224</b>. After acquiring the pilot channel <b>224</b>, the mobile station <b>218</b>A may synchronize with the system <b>200</b> and update its communication parameters and channel decoding parameters from a CDMA synchronization channel <b>226</b>. Even though the mobile station <b>218</b>A may acquire a most preferred system, the quality of communication in a reverse link (from mobile station <b>218</b>A to BS <b>208</b>B) may degrade as the number of mobile stations <b>218</b> in the cell <b>220</b> increases creating a grey zone condition. The mobile station <b>218</b>A may be able to receive pages on the forward link (from BS <b>208</b>B to mobile station <b>218</b>A), but a page response or access attempt on the reverse link may fail because of interference from other mobile stations <b>218</b> within the cell <b>220</b>. Under grey zone conditions, the mobile station <b>218</b>A may not have sufficient signal strength or transmit power because of power control measures within the CDMA system <b>200</b> to hold on to a paging channel <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are a flow chart of a method <b>300</b> to perform selection of a communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention to avoid a grey zone condition or the like. The method <b>300</b> may be performed by a communication device like the communication device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> or mobile station <b>218</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In block <b>302</b>, the communication device <b>100</b> may acquire a CDMA channel or the like or the communication device <b>100</b> may be idle on a communication channel. In block <b>304</b>, the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may receive at least a pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>on a CDMA pilot channel or at least another quality indicator or signal from a communication system, such as communication system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In block <b>306</b>, a determination may be made if the received pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator or signal is less than a predetermined threshold value or grey zone threshold value. If the received pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator or signal is not less than the predetermined threshold value, the method <b>300</b> may move to block <b>308</b> and the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may continue to monitor the pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator or signal from the system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the received signal in block <b>304</b> is less than the predetermined threshold value or grey zone threshold value in block <b>306</b>, the method <b>300</b> may advance to block <b>310</b> and a hysteresis timer or the like may be started. The hysteresis timer may be the same as the timer <b>119</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. When the hysteresis timer expires in block <b>312</b> or after a predetermined time delay, the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may receive at least another pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator or signal in block <b>314</b>. If at least the other received pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator is not below the predetermined threshold value in decision block <b>316</b>, the method <b>300</b> may continue to monitor at least the pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator in block <b>308</b>. If the other received pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>or other quality indicator is below the predetermined threshold value in decision block <b>316</b>, the method <b>300</b> may advance to block <b>318</b>. In block <b>318</b>, the current channel to which the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> is tuned may be added to a grey zone channel list, such as grey zone channel list <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When a channel is added to the grey zone channel list <b>116</b>, the channel number may be recorded with the frequency, the RSSI and other communication parameters in the list <b>116</b>. Because the communication environment may change over time and as the mobile station <b>218</b> moves about within the cell <b>220</b> or system <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), a channel recorded in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> may have a settable life or timing parameter associated with it, and the channel may be removed from the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) after a predetermined period of time and made available again for acquisition by the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Under some circumstances, a system may send a global action message, service redirection message or the like to a mobile station to inform the mobile station that CDMA service or other communication service is available on a specific channel. If that channel is in the grey zone channel list of the mobile station, the mobile station may be programmed to not attempt to acquire communication service on that channel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After adding the current channel to the grey zone channel list in block <b>318</b>, an initial scan timer, such as initial scan timer <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, may be started in block <b>320</b>, and a channel scan list may be built or created in block <b>322</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). The channel scan list may be the same as the channel scan list <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The channel scan list may include channels on alternate communication systems, such as system <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the channel scan list may include a preferred roaming list, such as the preferred roaming list <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The channel scan list may be built from a system table and then referencing from the system table into an acquisition table (not shown in the Figures). The system table and acquisition table may be stored in the memory <b>112</b> or other data storage device <b>113</b> of the communication device <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The system table may be divided into geographical areas and may contain system identifications for systems in each geographical area. The communication device <b>100</b> determines the geographical area where it is located and then enters the acquisition table for specific channels for those systems in the system table for the specific geographical area. Channels may be selected from the acquisition table and placed on the channel scan list in an order based on predetermined rules so that the channels may be scanned in order of preference to minimize channel acquisition time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In block <b>324</b> the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may scan any channels in the channel scan list to acquire an alternate channel with a pilot E<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>O </sub>signal or other quality indicator signal greater than or equal to the predetermined threshold value. The communication device <b>100</b> may scan any channels in the channel scan list in a selected order, such as scanning the preferred roaming list <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) in order of preference first. While scanning, the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may skip any channels in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). In another embodiment of the present invention, the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may perform a microscan of any channels in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> in block <b>326</b>. The microscan may include receiving a received signal strength indication (RSSI) or other communication parameter for a channel in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b>. The RSSI or other communication parameter may be compared to one of a chosen threshold value or alternatively, the RSSI or other parameter may be compared to a previously received RSSI or other parameter for the channel that may be stored with the channel information in the grey zone channel list. If the RSSI or other parameter equals or exceeds the chosen threshold value or the RSSI or other parameter has improved by a predetermined level or amount compared to the previously received RSSI or other parameter, the associated channel may be able to provide adequate communication service without a possibility of entering a grey zone condition. A more complete scan or evaluation of the channel may be performed before the channel is acquired by the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> receives or initiates a call during the scanning process or prior to acquiring a new channel, the communication device <b>100</b> or mobile station <b>218</b> may conduct an initial acquisition scan upon call release. An initial acquisition scan is a more complete scan similar to that performed when the communication device <b>100</b> first powers-up. The initial acquisition scan may include all channels that the device <b>100</b> has most recently used including any channels in the grey zone channel list <b>116</b> because during the phone call, the communication device <b>100</b> may have moved and the communication environment may have changed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In decision block <b>328</b>, a determination may be made whether the initial scan timer has expired after a selected time period or a new channel has been acquired. If neither the initial scan timer has expired or a new channel has been acquired, the method <b>300</b> may continue to scan in block <b>330</b> and returns to block <b>324</b>. If the initial scan timer has expired or a new channel has been acquired, the method <b>300</b> may advance to block <b>332</b> where a determination is made if a new channel has been acquired or only the initial scan timer has expired. If a new channel has not been acquired, an initial acquisition scan may be performed in block <b>334</b>.
