<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to surgical fastener applying apparatus and, more particularly, to surgical fastener applying apparatus that include a deflection control system for controlling and/or reducing the rate of deflection of an anvil beam.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surgical fastener applying apparatus, for example, surgical stapling apparatus, have been developed in which a staple cartridge receiving half-section including a staple cartridge assembly provided at a distal end thereof, is operatively connected (e.g., pivotably connected) to an anvil half-section including an anvil provided at a distal end thereof. The staple cartridge assembly preferably includes a plurality of surgical staples which are ejectable therefrom. The staple cartridge assembly may be manufactured as an integral part of the staple cartridge receiving half-section, or the staple cartridge assembly may be designed and manufactured as a disposable loading unit for use in a reusable surgical stapling apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, when the distal end of the staple cartridge receiving half-section is approximated toward the distal end of the anvil half-section, to clamp tissue inserted therebetween in preparation for stapling, the opposing surfaces of the distal end of the staple cartridge assembly and the distal end of the anvil assembly are spaced apart by a predetermined distance which is pre-established and fixed for each surgical stapling apparatus. This spacing is sometimes referred to as the “tissue gap” of the surgical stapling apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since it is desirable that the “tissue gap” be substantially uniform and/or “fixed” (i.e., having the same dimension throughout the stapling operation), in order to form lines of uniform staples along the cartridge, the operator of the surgical stapling apparatus needs to ascertain whether the “tissue gap” is loaded with more or thicker tissue than recommended (i.e., overloaded) which may result in undesired or increased deflection of the distal end of the anvil half-section and/or the staple cartridge receiving half-section. As used herein, the term “deflection” is understood to include flexing, bending, deforming, biasing, skewing and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desirable that tissue having a thickness larger, preferably slightly larger, than the height of the “tissue gap” be clamped between the tissue contacting surface of the staple cartridge assembly and the anvil so that when the surgical stapling apparatus is clamped onto the tissue, the tissue substantially fills the entire height of the “tissue gap”. However, it has been noticed that clamping of such tissue between the tissue contacting surfaces of the distal ends of the anvil and staple cartridge receiving half-sections tends to cause the distal ends of the anvil and/or staple cartridge receiving half-sections to deflect. The greater the initial and/or resultant thickness of tissue clamped between the distal ends of the staple cartridge receiving and anvil half-section, especially adjacent and at their distal tips, the greater the degree of deflection of the distal end of the anvil half-section and/or the staple cartridge receiving half-section.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the past, the deflection at the distal end of the anvil half-section was reduced and/or eliminated by using a relatively heavier construction (i.e., thicker structural elements), a relatively larger construction or relatively stronger materials. These approaches increase the size and/or cost of the surgical stapling apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would be desirable to provide a surgical stapling apparatus that includes a deflection control system for controlling and/or reducing the rate and/or degree of deflection of the distal end of the anvil half-section when tissue is clamped between the distal ends of the anvil and staple cartridge receiving half-sections.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It would also be desirable to provide a surgical stapling apparatus that has a deflection control system which allows rapid initial deflection of the distal end of the anvil half-section to a specific value and which thereafter causes a decrease or reduction in the rate and/or degree of deflection in a predetermined manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would also be desirable to provide a surgical stapling apparatus that includes a deflection control system which allows rapid initial deflection of the distal end of the anvil half-section to efficaciously achieve the optimal tissue gap when clamping relatively thin tissue and which thereafter reduces the rate of deflection in relatively thicker tissue to maintain the tissue gap as close as possible to the optimal tissue gap.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Surgical stapling apparatus constructed in this manner would allow for rapid deflection of the distal end of the anvil half-section to a specific value followed by a decrease in the rate of deflection of the same. Accordingly, the distal end of the anvil half-section is able to deflect quickly to the optimal tissue gap in relatively thin tissue and deflect slowly in relatively thicker tissue to remain as close as possible to the optimal tissue gap.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a surgical fastener applying apparatus is provided including an anvil half-section including a distal end and a proximal end defining a longitudinal axis, a cartridge receiving half-section including a distal end, and a deflection control system operatively associated with the anvil half-section. The cartridge receiving half-section is desirably operatively couplable with the anvil half-section such that the distal end of the anvil half-section is movable into juxtaposed relation to the distal end of the cartridge receiving half-section. A tissue gap is defined between the distal end of the anvil half-section and the distal end of the cartridge receiving half-section when the anvil and cartridge half-sections are coupled together.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The deflection control system is configured and adapted to reinforce the distal end of the anvil half-section when a force is applied there in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the anvil half-section defines a tissue contacting surface. Accordingly, the deflection control system reinforces the distal end of the anvil half-section when a force is applied to the distal end of the anvil half-section in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis and normal to a plane defined by the tissue contacting surface of the anvil half-section.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the anvil half-section includes a U-shaped channel member having a pair of side walls interconnected by a base wall. In this embodiment, the deflection control system is operatively associated with the channel member. The deflection control system is desirably operatively disposed within the channel member.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment, the deflection control system can include a U-shaped channel section having a pair of side walls interconnected by a base wall. Preferably, the base wall of the channel section of the deflection control system is adjacent, more preferably in contact with the base wall of the channel member of the anvil half-section, and the side walls of the channel section are disposed interior of and adjacent the side walls of the channel member. It is envisioned that each side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel section has a height which is less than a height of a respective one of the pair of side walls of the channel member thereby defining a reveal along each side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel member. Preferably, the relative height of each side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel section is uniform along a length thereof, and each side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel section preferably has a uniform thickness along a length thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Desirably, at least a proximal end of the channel section is fixedly secured to a proximal end of the channel member.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is envisioned that the deflection control system can be a multi-stage system, e.g., a two-stage system, a three-stage system, a four-stage system, etc. In a two-stage system, the deflection control system begins reducing the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel member in a second stage of deflection. The second stage of deflection desirably takes effect when the reveal between the side walls of the channel member and the side walls of the channel section is about zero. Accordingly, the distal end of the channel member and the distal end of the channel section deflect concomitantly.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The deflection control system functions such that the greater the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel member, the greater the reduction in the rate at which the distal end of the channel section deflects. It is contemplated that the reveal between the distal end of the channel member and the distal end of the channel section can be zero.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the deflection control system can include a first U-shaped channel section having a pair of side walls interconnected by a base wall, wherein the base wall of the first channel section of the deflection control system is adjacent to or, more preferably in contact with the base wall of the channel member of the anvil half-section, and a second U-shaped channel section having a pair of side walls interconnected by a base wall, wherein the base wall of the second channel section of the deflection control system is adjacent to or, more preferably in contact with the base wall of the first channel section of the deflection control system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A distal end of each side wall of the pair of side walls of the first channel section can have a height which is less than a height of a respective side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel member thereby defining a first reveal along each of the pair of side walls of the channel member. In addition, each side wall of the pair of side walls of the second channel section can have a height which is less than a height of the respective side walls of the pair of side walls of the first channel section thereby defining a second reveal along a distal end of each side wall of the pair of side walls of the second channel section.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A proximal end of each of the first and second channel sections can be operatively fixedly secured to a proximal end the channel member. It is contemplated that the height of the distal end of each side wall of the pair of side walls of the first channel section and the height of a corresponding distal end of each side wall of the pair of side walls of the second channel section are uniform along each of the lengths thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this embodiment the deflection control system is a three-stage system. In a three-stage system the deflection control system begins reducing the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel section in a second stage of deflection, and in a third stage of deflection the deflection control system reduces the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel member by an additional amount. In operation, the second stage of deflection engages when the first reveal between the side walls of the channel member and the side walls of the first channel section is about zero, whereby the distal end of the channel member and the distal end of the first channel section deflect concomitantly. The third stage of deflection engages when the second reveal between the side walls of the first channel section and the side walls of the second channel section is about zero, whereby the distal end of the channel member, the distal end of the first channel section and the distal end of the second channel section deflect concomitantly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another embodiment the deflection control system includes a pair of reinforcing ribs each disposed along an inner surface of a respective side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel member. Each rib of the pair of reinforcing ribs of the deflection control system has a height which is less than the height of the respective side walls of the channel member thereby defining a reveal along each of the pair of side walls of the channel member. It is envisioned that a proximal end of each of the pair of reinforcing ribs is pinned to a portion of the proximal end of the channel member.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, a proximal end of the deflection control system is fixedly secured to a portion of the proximal end of the channel member and a portion of the distal end of the deflection control system is longitudinally slidingly coupled to the channel member. The deflection control system can include at least one, preferably a plurality of, reinforcing plate(s) adjacent, preferably in contact with the base wall of the channel member.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, the surgical fastener applying apparatus can further include a pin member fixedly secured to the base wall of the channel member. The distal end of each of the plurality of reinforcing plates is slidingly coupled to the channel member by the pin member extending through a plurality of elongate longitudinally oriented slots formed, one each, in the plurality of respective reinforcing plates. The elongate slots preferably increase in length from the reinforcing plate which is closest to the base wall of the channel member to the reinforcing plate which is furthest from the base wall of the channel member. The slots of the plates each have a proximal edge, and desirably the proximal edges are in registration with one another. The pin member desirably includes a head secured to an end thereof that is opposite to the base wall. The head engages the reinforcement plates and forces the distal end of each of the reinforcing plates to deflect concomitantly with the distal end of channel member.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, as the distal end of the channel member and the deflection control system deflect in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis, the distal end of at least one of the plurality of reinforcing plates translates in a longitudinal direction. The deflection control system is a multi-stage system which begins to incrementally reduce the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel member as a distal end of each elongate slot of each respective reinforcing plate engages the pin member. The deflection control system incrementally reduces the rate at which the distal end of the channel member deflects.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, surgical fastener applying apparatus can be provided with a pair of juxtaposed shoulders each extending from an inner surface of the side walls of the channel member in a distal end thereof. Each reinforcing plate can include an elongate recesses formed along each lateral side thereof and in operative engagement with a respective one of the pair of shoulders. The elongate recesses preferably increase in length from the reinforcing plate which is closest to the base wall of the channel member to the reinforcing plate which is furthest from the base wall of the channel member. Each of the elongate recesses has a proximal edge and wherein the proximal edges are in registration with one another. Each shoulder preferably includes a head portion secured to an end thereof, the head portion being configured and dimensioned to force the distal end of each of the reinforcing plates to deflect concomitantly with the distal end of channel member.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation, as the distal end of the channel member and the deflection system deflect in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis the distal end of each of the plurality of reinforcing plates translates in a longitudinal direction. The deflection control system is a multi-stage system, wherein the deflection control system begins to incrementally reduce the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel member as a distal end of each elongate recess of each respective reinforcing plate engages a respective shoulder, the deflection control system incrementally reduces the rate at which the distal end of the channel member deflects.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a deflection control system is provided for a surgical fastener applying apparatus that includes an anvil half-section having a channel member and a cartridge receiving half-section operatively couplable to the anvil half-section. The deflection control system includes an elongate reinforcing assembly having a proximal end operatively engaged with a proximal end of the channel member and a distal end operatively associated with a distal end of the channel member, wherein the reinforcing assembly incrementally reduces deflection of the distal end of the channel member when forces are applied to the distal end of the channel member in a direction transverse to a longitudinal axis of the channel member and normal to a tissue contacting surface of the anvil half-section.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a surgical fastener applying apparatus is provided. It includes an anvil half-section including a distal end and a proximal end defining a longitudinal axis, the anvil half-section including a channel member having pair of juxtaposed side walls interconnected by a base wall, each side wall deforming a through hole having a diameter. The apparatus further includes a cartridge receiving half-section including a distal end, wherein the cartridge receiving half-section is couplable with the anvil half-section such that the distal end of the anvil half-section is movable into juxtaposed relation to the distal end of the cartridge receiving half-section. The distal ends of the anvil and cartridge half-sections can be pivotable about a pivot axis transverse to the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The surgical fastener applying apparatus further includes a deflection control system operatively associated with the anvil half-section for reinforcing the distal end of the anvil half-section when a force is applied to the distal end of the anvil half-section in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis. The deflection control system most preferably includes a pair of reinforcing ribs having a distal end and a proximal end. The distal end of each reinforcing rib is fixedly secured to an inner surface of a respective side wall of the pair of side walls of the channel member and the proximal end of each reinforcing rib extends beyond the pivot axis. The proximal end of each reinforcing rib defines a hole in registration with the through hole defined in the side walls of the channel member. The holes are desirably positioned proximal of the pivot axis. The deflection control system further includes a cam member extending through the holes formed in each side wall of the channel member and each reinforcing rib, the cam having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the through hole formed in each reinforcing rib to thereby define a reveal between each reinforcing rib and the cam member.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This deflection control system is a two-stage system. Accordingly, in operation, the deflection control system begins reducing the degree and the rate of deflection of the distal end of the channel member in a second stage of deflection. The second stage of deflection takes effect when the reveal between an upper portion of the hole formed in each reinforcing rib and an upper portion of the cam is zero.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed surgical fastener applying apparatus will now be described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements. In the drawings and in the description which follows, the term “proximal” will refer to the end of the surgical fastener applying apparatus which is closest to the operator, while the term “distal” will refer to the end of the surgical fastener applying apparatus which is furthest from the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a surgical fastener applying apparatus, in accordance with the present disclosure, is shown generally as <b>100</b>. Apparatus <b>100</b> is particularly adapted to apply surgical staples and includes a cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, an anvil half-section <b>104</b> operatively coupled to cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, a staple cartridge assembly <b>106</b> fixedly or removably supported in a distal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>of cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b> and an anvil plate <b>108</b> fixedly or removably supported on a distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For purposes of illustration, the present disclosure describes beam deflection control systems with specific reference to a surgical fastener applying apparatus, preferably a surgical stapler. It is envisioned, however, that the beam deflection control system and illustrative embodiments herein may be incorporated in any surgical fastener applying apparatus having at least one cantilevered beam member which may be subject to deflection under an applied load which has a force component transverse to the longitudinal axis of the beam. It is further envisioned that the beam deflection control system and illustrative embodiments disclosed herein may be incorporated into and/or equally applied to endoscopic, laparoscopic as well as open type surgical instruments. The “beam” referred to in “beam deflection control system” can be distal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>of cartridge half-section <b>102</b>, and/or distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b>, although most of the discussion herein will refer to the distal end of the anvil half-section because, of the two, typically it is the member which deflects the most.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when anvil half-section <b>104</b> is operatively coupled to cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, a tissue gap “G” exists between distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and distal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>of cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>. Tissue gap “G” is typically set to a predetermined dimension during the manufacture of surgical stapling apparatus <b>100</b> to allow for desired staple formation. Preferably, tissue gap “G” is tapered, i.e., narrower adjacent a distal end of apparatus <b>100</b> than at a location proximal of the distal end of apparatus <b>100</b>. As described above with regard to previous surgical fastener applying apparatus, when distal ends <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and distal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>of cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b> are clamped onto tissue, a deflection force is exerted thereon, in the directions indicated by arrows “Y” (i.e., in directions transverse to the longitudinal axis of the surgical fastener applying apparatus), tending to cause distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and/or distal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>of cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b> to deflect, e.g., in the direction of arrows “Y”. As is known in the art, the degree of deflection of distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b> tend to increase at locations or in portions increasingly closer to the distal tips thereof. As is also known in the art, the thicker the tissue to be clamped the greater the deflection force exerted. Also, tissue thickness can vary, e.g., increase, during approximation and stapling. This can be due, e.g., to tissue fluid flow typically toward the distal tip of the apparatus during approximation of distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil and cartridge receiving half-sections <b>104</b>, <b>102</b>, especially those that are pivotably mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, the greater the degree of deflection in the direction of arrows “Y”, the greater the likelihood that the dimension of the distal end of tissue gap “G” may vary from its predetermined setting. As a result, it may occur that staples (not shown) fired from staple cartridge assembly <b>106</b> may form non-uniformly along the length of anvil plate <b>108</b>. In the region where the dimension of tissue gap “G” remains or is close to the predetermined setting, i.e., near intermediate point <b>112</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) the legs of the staples will form as intended. However, it may occur that if excessively thick over-indicated tissue is inadvertently fastened, the dimension of tissue gap “G” may increase beyond its predetermined setting, e.g., near the distal tip of anvil plate <b>108</b>, and there is a possibility that in that area the legs of the staples may not form as desired. The purpose of this disclosure is to reduce the possibility of or prevent this from occurring. Elsewise stated, the purpose of this disclosure is to increase the possibility that even if excessively thick over-indicated tissue is encountered, deflection will be minimized or prevented, to enhance the possibility of and provide for acceptable staple formation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, anvil half-section <b>104</b> includes an anvil half-section channel member <b>112</b> having a distal end <b>112</b><i>a</i>, a proximal end <b>112</b><i>b </i>and a transition or intermediate point <b>112</b><i>c</i>. Channel member <b>112</b> has a substantially U-shaped transverse cross-sectional profile defined by a pair of substantially parallel juxtaposed side walls <b>114</b> interconnected by a base wall <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Anvil plate <b>108</b> is preferably configured and dimensioned to fit over side walls <b>114</b> of distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, anvil plate <b>108</b> includes a pair of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> each having a plurality of staple forming pockets <b>120</b> (i.e., anvil pockets, anvil depressions, etc.) formed therein. Preferably, anvil plate <b>108</b> includes a knife track <b>122</b> extending longitudinally between the pair of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b>. Preferably, knife track <b>122</b> interconnects and separates the pair of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> from one another. Anvil plate <b>108</b> further includes a pair of substantially parallel juxtaposed upstanding side walls <b>124</b> extending, one each, from a lateral side edge of the pair of anvil surfaces <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Anvil half-section <b>104</b> further includes a distal end cap <b>126</b> adapted to be snap-fit onto or into the distal tip of channel member <b>112</b>. Preferably, end cap <b>126</b> is tapered to facilitate insertion of the distal tip into the target surgical site. Anvil half-section <b>104</b> can also include an end cap <b>128</b> to be received between a pair of spaced apart juxtaposed flanges <b>130</b> (one shown) extending from proximal end <b>112</b><i>b </i>of channel member <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Anvil half-section <b>104</b> can further include a contoured hand grip <b>132</b> configured and adapted to be snap-fit over proximal end <b>112</b><i>b </i>of channel member <b>112</b>. Hand grip <b>132</b> desirably provides an operator of surgical stapling apparatus <b>100</b> with improved control and an increased degree of manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, anvil half-section <b>104</b> includes a deflection control system, generally designated <b>140</b> for reducing the rate of deflection of distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b> as the force in direction “Y” increases and as the deflection distance of distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b> increases. In this embodiment, deflection control system <b>140</b> includes a substantially U-shaped channel section <b>142</b> disposed between side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, channel section <b>142</b> is defined by a pair of parallel spaced apart juxtaposed side walls <b>144</b> interconnected by a base wall <b>146</b>. In particular, side walls <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> preferably have a height which is less than a height of side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b> thus defining a reveal <b>150</b> having a height “X”.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Height “X” of reveal <b>150</b> can be uniform or vary along the entire length of distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b> and distal end <b>142</b><i>a </i>of channel section <b>142</b>. Although, height “X” can taper in either a distal or a proximal direction, preferably it tapers in a distal direction, e.g., from being narrow or zero near the distal tip to a greater height near transition point <b>112</b><i>c</i>. Reveal <b>150</b> can have discrete regions or lengths, each of which, has a different height “X”. Preferably, height “X” is from about 0.004 inches to about 0.10 inches, more preferably from about 0.004 inches to about 0.006 inches. As will be described in greater detail below, when height “X” is about 0.004 inches to about 0.006 inches, distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> becomes stiffer sooner as compared to when height “X” is greater than 0.006 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Channel section <b>142</b> extends from distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b> to a portion of proximal end <b>112</b><i>b</i>. Channel section <b>142</b> is fixedly secured to channel member <b>112</b> preferably at least in a region proximal of but adjacent intermediate point <b>112</b><i>c </i>to allow channel section <b>142</b> to be free to float within channel member <b>112</b> in a region distal of intermediate point <b>112</b><i>c </i>(i.e., distal end <b>112</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is envisioned that channel section <b>142</b> can be secured at such locations to channel member <b>112</b> at suitable specific predetermined locations along the length thereof. In particular, side walls <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> can be secured to corresponding side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b>, and base wall <b>146</b> of channel section <b>142</b> can be secured to base wall <b>116</b> of channel member <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Channel section <b>142</b> is preferably secured to channel member <b>112</b> by pinning (i.e., by extending a pin through channel section <b>142</b> and into an adjacent element or structure of apparatus <b>100</b>), however, it is envisioned that channel section <b>142</b> can be secured to channel member <b>112</b> via any number of known techniques, such as, for example, welding, soldering, gluing, peening and the like. Most preferably, channel section <b>142</b> is, as will be explained, welded to channel member <b>112</b> and a cam <b>400</b> can extend through side walls <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> to pin channel section <b>142</b> to side walls <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Channel section <b>142</b> is made from a rigid material which is resistant to bending, such as, for example, steel. While steel is preferred, it is contemplated that channel section <b>142</b> can be fabricated from other materials, such as, for example, titanium, polycarbonate, fiberglass, resins and the like, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is further contemplated that each side wall <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> have a pre-selected thickness. A relatively smaller thickness provides less rigidity while a relatively larger thickness provides increased rigidity. It is still further contemplated that each side wall <b>144</b> can have a uniform or varying thickness along its length.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In operation, channel section <b>142</b> increases the rigidity of channel member <b>112</b> (i.e., reduces the rate of deflection) after channel member <b>112</b> has undergone a predetermined amount of deflection in direction “Y” (e.g., transverse to a longitudinal axis of apparatus <b>100</b> and substantially normal to the plane of the tissue contacting surface of anvil <b>108</b>) thereby reducing the rate of deflection of distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b>. As will be used herein, the recitation “tissue having a relatively smaller thickness” is understood to mean tissue having a thickness which will not tend to cause distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to deflect an amount sufficient to result in the operation of deflection control system <b>140</b>. Also, the recitation “tissue having a relatively larger thickness” is understood to mean tissue having a thickness which will tend to cause distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to deflect an amount sufficient to result in the operation of deflection control system <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Surgical stapling apparatus <b>100</b> preferably is initially set-up such that tissue gap “G” has a slight taper from a proximal end to a distal end (i.e., tissue gap “G” reduces in height from the proximal end to the distal end). In this manner, when tissue having a relatively smaller thickness is clamped between the distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, the distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and/or cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b> will deflect an amount sufficient to cause tissue gap “G” to have a substantially uniform dimension from proximal end to distal end. As such, the staples which are fired from staple cartridge assembly <b>106</b> are substantially uniformly formed from the proximal end of staple cartridge assembly <b>106</b> to the distal end of staple cartridge assembly <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When tissue having a relatively larger thickness is clamped between distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, channel section <b>142</b> of deflection control system <b>140</b> causes distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to undergo a two-stage deflection. In the first stage of deflection the deflection force acts solely on edge surfaces <b>114</b><i>a </i>of side walls <b>114</b>, oriented in the direction of the tissue to be clamped, of channel member <b>112</b> resulting in distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> undergoing an initial rate of deflection in direction “Y”, until height “X” of reveal <b>150</b>, between side walls <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> and side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b>, is reduced to zero (i.e., the height of side walls <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> are even with the height of side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Edge surfaces <b>114</b><i>a </i>can be in direct contact with the tissue or, more preferably they are oriented in the direction of the tissue and are rather in direct contact with undersurface of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> of anvil plate <b>108</b> which in turn are in contact with the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, during the first stage of deflection, the height of tissue gap “G” is urged from its initial tapered configuration to a second configuration which is less tapered (i.e., less angled). At this point, edge surfaces <b>144</b><i>a </i>of side walls <b>144</b> of channel section <b>142</b> and edge surfaces <b>114</b><i>a </i>of side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b> are in contact with the underside of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> of anvil plate <b>108</b> thereby making distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> stiffer and/or more rigid thus reducing the tendency of distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to deflect.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Once height “X” of reveal <b>150</b> reaches zero, each edge surface <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>144</b><i>a </i>of side walls <b>114</b> and <b>144</b>, respectively, is in contact with the underside of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> of anvil plate <b>108</b> and distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and undergoes a second stage of deflection. In other words, the deflecting force now acts on side walls <b>114</b> and <b>144</b> in order to urge and deflect distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b>. Since the deflecting force must now act on both side walls <b>114</b> and <b>144</b>, distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> is effectively reinforced and stiffened from this time forward.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the second stage, deflection control system <b>140</b> causes distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to undergo a rate of deflection which is less than the initial rate of deflection. In addition, during the second stage of deflection, the height of tissue gap “G” is urged from its tapered configuration to a configuration that is less tapered or has a substantially uniform dimension (i.e., uniform height) from the distal end to the proximal end. Deflection control system <b>140</b> in effect prevents the distal end of tissue gap “G” from having a reverse tapered configuration (i.e., the distal end having a larger height than the proximal end).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a deflection control system, for controlling and/or incrementally reducing the rate of deflection of distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b>, in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, is shown generally as <b>240</b>. Deflection control system <b>240</b> is a dual layered substantially U-shaped channel section <b>242</b> configured and dimensioned to be disposed in and between side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b>. Channel section <b>242</b> includes an outer channel section <b>242</b><i>a </i>and an inner channel section <b>242</b><i>b</i>. Outer channel section <b>242</b><i>a </i>is defined by a pair of parallel spaced apart juxtaposed side walls <b>244</b><i>a </i>interconnected by a base wall <b>246</b><i>a</i>. In particular, side walls <b>244</b><i>a </i>of channel section <b>242</b><i>a </i>preferably have a height which is less than a height of side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b> thus deforming a first reveal <b>250</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Inner channel section <b>242</b><i>b </i>is defined by a pair of parallel spaced apart juxtaposed side walls <b>244</b><i>b </i>interconnected by a base wall <b>246</b><i>b</i>.

Preferably, inner channel section <b>242</b><i>b </i>is pinned by a cam member (not shown) near intersecting point <b>112</b><i>c</i>, secured to outer channel section <b>242</b><i>a </i>at a region proximal of intermediate point <b>112</b><i>c </i>and is secured at a region near the distal tip (see FIG. <b>4</b>,). Inner channel section <b>242</b><i>b </i>is likewise preferably secured to outer channel section <b>242</b><i>a </i>via pinning or in any manner as described above with regard to channel section <b>142</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When tissue having a relatively smaller thickness is clamped between distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b> deflection control system <b>240</b> functions basically the same manner as deflection control system <b>140</b>. When tissue having a relatively larger thickness is clamped between distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, channel section <b>242</b> of deflection control system <b>240</b> causes distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to undergo a three-stage deflection.

At this point, edge surfaces <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>245</b><i>a </i>of respective side walls <b>114</b> and <b>244</b><i>a </i>are each in contact with the underside of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> of anvil plate <b>108</b> thereby making distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> stiffer and/or more rigid thus reducing its tendency to deflect.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Once reveal <b>250</b><i>a </i>reaches zero, each edge surface <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>245</b><i>a </i>of side walls <b>114</b> and <b>244</b><i>a</i>, respectively, is in contact with the underside of tissue contacting surfaces <b>118</b> of anvil plate <b>108</b> and distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> undergoes a second stage of deflection.

Preferably, a pin or cam member <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>18</b>-<b>21</b> and <b>23</b>) extends through aligned holes H′ of channel member <b>112</b> and through holes H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b>, and in turn extend transversely through side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b> of anvil half-section <b>104</b>. Such a cam member <b>400</b> and the manner in which it operates is disclosed in International Appl. Ser. No. PCT/US03/08342 filed on Mar. 13, 2003, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Preferably, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, through-hole H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> has a diameter “D1” and the portion of cam <b>400</b> extending through through-hole H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> has a diameter “D2” which is less than diameter “D1” of through-hole H″. In a preferred embodiment, diameter “D1” of through-hole H″ is about 0.203 inches and diameter “D2” of the portion of cam <b>400</b> extending through-hole H″ is about 0.200 inches thereby defining a reveal of about 0.003 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In operation, when tissue having a relatively smaller thickness is clamped between distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> will tend to deflect an amount sufficient for tissue gap “G” to have a substantially uniform dimension from the proximal end to the distal end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">When or as tissue having a relatively larger thickness is clamped between distal ends <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and cartridge receiving half-section <b>102</b>, deflection control system <b>640</b> causes distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to undergo a two-stage deflection. The rate of deflection is established when distal end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of channel member <b>112</b> and distal end <b>344</b><i>b </i>of reinforcing ribs <b>344</b> are loaded with a force. When apparatus <b>100</b> is clamped onto relatively thin tissue, the rate of deflection will be at a maximum to allow the tissue gap “G” to be set relatively quickly. This maximum rate of deflection is attained from the existent of the reveal between through-hole H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> and the portion of cam <b>400</b> extending through through-hole H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b>. When apparatus <b>100</b> is clamped onto relatively thicker tissue, the rate of deflection needs to be reduced and/or at a minimum in order to maintain the proper tissue gap “G” for staple formation. This reduced rate of deflection is attained as a result of the size of the reveal between through-hole H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> and the portion of cam <b>400</b> extending through through-hole H″ of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> being reduced to zero. As will be described in greater detail below, once the reveal is reduced to zero the rate of deflection is decreased to a desired and/or optimum rate.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the first stage of deflection the deflection force acts on edge surfaces <b>114</b><i>a </i>of side walls <b>114</b> of channel member <b>112</b> resulting in distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> undergoing an initial rate of deflection in direction “Y”. Since each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> is welded to side walls <b>114</b>, each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> travels with channel member <b>112</b>. Moreover, since distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> is urged in the direction of arrow “Y”, as distal end <b>344</b><i>b </i>of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> is displaced in direction “Y”, proximal end <b>344</b><i>c </i>of each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> is displaced in a direction opposite to direction “Y” thereby engaging an upper portion of the rim <b>404</b> of through-hole H″ formed in each reinforcing rib <b>344</b> towards an upper portion <b>402</b> of cam <b>400</b> extending through-hole H″ and minimizing the reveal that exists therebetween. This first stage of deflection continues until the reveal between upper portion of rim <b>404</b> of through-hole H″ and upper portion <b>402</b> of cam <b>400</b> extending therethrough is reduced to zero. Once the reveal between upper portion of rim <b>404</b> of through-hole H″ and upper portion <b>402</b> of cam <b>400</b> is reduced to zero and upper portion of rim <b>404</b> of through-hole H″ contacts with upper portion <b>402</b> of cam <b>400</b> extending therethrough, distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> undergoes a second stage of deflection.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the second stage of deflection, deflection control system <b>640</b> causes distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> to undergo a rate of deflection which is less than the initial rate of deflection. In operation, since upper portion <b>404</b> of hole H″ is in contact with upper portion <b>402</b> of cam <b>400</b> extending therethrough, proximal end <b>344</b><i>c </i>is prevented from moving further in the direction opposite to arrow “Y”. Accordingly, since distal end <b>344</b><i>b </i>of reinforcing ribs <b>344</b> are urged in the direction of arrow “Y”, the prevention of movement of proximal end <b>344</b><i>c </i>of reinforcing ribs <b>344</b> in the direction opposite to direction “Y” prevents movement of distal end <b>344</b><i>b </i>of reinforcing ribs <b>344</b> in direction “Y”, thereby reinforcing distal end <b>104</b><i>a </i>of anvil half-section <b>104</b> and reducing the rate of deflection thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Deflection control system <b>640</b> in effect prevents the distal end of tissue gap “G” from having a reverse tapered configuration (i.e., the distal end having a larger height than the proximal end).</p>
