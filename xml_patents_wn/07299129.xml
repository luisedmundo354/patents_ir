<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to navigational devices, and in particular to navigational devices as part of a combined multi-functional system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A natural progression in devices is to build more function or even to combine more functions into one device. In the past ten years, for example, mobile communications, personal data assistants, and portable navigational devices have boomed. Currently, millions use cellular phones on a daily basis. Cellular phones have become so inexpensive that college students can readily afford them. Cellular phones have been given added capability. Some have been provided with paging capability, for example. Recently, cellular phones have been provided with the ability to interface with the internet. Current cell phones also have calendaring capabilities built in and some are now being combined with personal data assistants (“PDAs”).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">PDAs are now also exceedingly popular. The first PDA-type devices merely held a listing of contacts and may have had a calendar function. Now PDAs, in addition to holding contact data and a calendar, hold e-mail. PDAs have now been provided with the capability to respond to e-mail and are linked or synchronized with a computer periodically so any e-mail answers can be ported over to a computer for sending. Calendar changes are also synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Navigational devices represent yet another technology that has boomed as of late and which is now becoming popular and affordable. Previously, navigational devices were expensive and far from portable or hand-held. Most navigational devices could only be found on ships and airplanes. Now, navigational devices are popular options in luxury cars and navigational devices have become popular with outdoorsman of all types. Fisherman have them to mark out there favorite fishing holes, for example. These devices have also been combined with other devices, such as depth finders or fish finders which are popular with anglers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, PDAs and navigational devices, such as global positioning systems (“GPS”), have been combined. There are problems with such combined devices. For example, current combination devices which include a PDA and a GPS are confusing to use. One of the more confusing aspects is switching between the software applications needed for the GPS and the software applications needed for the PDA.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Still another problem is that the GPS or navigational devices generally use more power than other portable technologies that can be included in a portable, electronic device. The hardware needed to acquire signals from satellites is generally much more needy of power than the power needed to keep a cellular phone or a PDA operating. Thus, one of the problems associated with marrying a GPS with another device is that the length between charges for the other device may decline drastically. In other words, the more power hungry GPS portion of a combination device will discharge the batteries faster than a separate PDA, cellular phone or other device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are also problems with maintaining a relatively small size while still having the necessary capability to acquire the satellite signals needed to determine position on the GPS portion of the device. A GPS generally needs a fairly substantial antenna. Incorporating the antenna into the housing of a combined GPS and PDA may wreck havoc with the size of the device. As a result, all combination models are provided with an external GPS antenna. Using a patch antenna in such hand-held devices is advantageous since these are more low profile. However, there is a problem with fixing the antenna into a device since the antenna is generally most effective orientated a specific way with the satellites rather than oriented with respect to a housing or the case of the combined device. For example, a patch antenna is most effective if it is essentially parallel with the earth's surface. Many of the housings are made to be used in a hand-held mode. When holding the housing the housing is generally horizontally orientated. If a hand-held unit is to be mounted in an automobile, the mounting orientation is limited to more horizontal orientations so that the antenna is effective. A large problem with mounting a device with a fixed antenna so that the antenna is effective at receiving GPS signals generally makes the display almost impossible for the driver to see. As a result, an antenna fixed with respect to the housing may suffer in one use as compared to another. Providing a movable antenna also presents the problems of keeping the antenna at a position, especially in a vibrating environment such as driving down a dusty washboard gravel road.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is always a problem with carrying separate devices. Each one needs a power cord, different batteries and other different accessories. So there is always a need for combined functions in one device. What is needed is a portable, hand-held electronic device that is user friendly and generally easy to use. For example, one that switches from one application to another with ease or even automatically. What is also needed is a device that includes a power savings mode so that the user is not continually recharging the device rather than using it. There is still a further need for a device that is small enough that it is handy to use and store in a pocket or purse. There is also a need for a device that minimizes the number of auxiliary accessories that must be carried. Specifically, there is also a need for a device that includes a GPS or other navigational device with other devices. Such a device needs an antenna which is part of the device but which is also positionable to more than one position. Also needed is a device which can operate in a hand-held orientation or in a car-mounted orientation. The device also needs to be neat and which is free of wires routed externally about the housing. The device also needs to be durable. There is also a need for a navigational route planning device which rapidly and efficiently generates a route plan, especially when a route was not completed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The embodiments of the present invention include a portable electronic device having a housing, a processor located within the housing, a memory in communication with the processor, and a display in communication with the processor. The display is positioned on a surface of the housing. The portable electronic device has a first component, and a second component. One of the first and second components include a navigational component. The navigational component further includes an antenna attached to the housing. The antenna is a patch antenna having a width of about 1 inch and a length of about 1 inch. The antenna is movable between a stowed position and a signal acquisition position. The navigational component has a detection mechanism which indicates the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The navigational component also includes an operational component which is activated in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. In some embodiments, the operational component includes a global position information acquisition component which is enabled in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The operational component includes a set of instructions executable by the processor for processing signals acquired by the antenna. The set of instructions is enabled when the detection mechanism indicates the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The set of instructions is disabled in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna has been moved from the signal acquisition position to the stowed position. The display switches to the user interface associated with the navigational component in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The navigational component is a positioning system which uses at least three signals to triangulate a position, such as a GPS.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also disclosed are embodiments that include a navigation system that has a mass storage device adapted to store navigation data, a server adapted to communicate with the mass storage, and the portable, multi-function electronic device discussed in the previous paragraph. The navigational device has an operational component which is activated in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The operational component includes a power savings mode which is enabled in response to the detection mechanism indicating that the antenna position has been changed to the stowed position from the signal acquisition position. The power savings mode includes halting a signal acquisition process. The operational component includes a set of software instructions executed by the processor or hardwired combinatorial logic.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, embodiments of the invention provide for a device having a navigational component and one or more other f unctions, such as a PDA function or a cellular phone function. The portable, hand-held electronic device is user friendly since one function switches to another essentially automatically. The portable, hand-held electronics device includes a power savings mode so that the user is not continually recharging the device rather than using it. The device is small enough to be handy to use and stores in a pocket or purse. The device includes a GPS or other navigational device with other devices. The GPS antenna is low profile and is positionable to more than one position so that the device can operate in a hand-held orientation or in a car-mounted orientation. The device is durable, and free of wires routed externally about the housing. Routing the connector between the antenna and hardware within the case provides for a neat, uncluttered design.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present invention further include a hand held device, such as a portable global positioning device, that has a personal digital assistant (PDA) capability (e.g., a PDA component operable to perform one or more PDA functions), a global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver operative with the PDA capability, an antenna coupled to the GPS receiver, a housing containing the PDA capability and the GPS receiver, a subhousing containing the antenna, the subhousing being pivotally attached to the housing, and an actuator to control the movement and position of the subhousing relative the housing, where the actuator allows the subhousing to pivot from a stowed position to a released position relative the housing. At least a portion of the actuator is accessible through a surface of the housing to allow the actuator to be moved so as to release the subhousing from the stowed position into the released position. In one embodiment, the actuator includes a release lever having a contact surface, a latch, and an elongate shaft there between. The contact surface is accessible through the housing to slide adjacent the housing from a latching position in which the latch releasably holds the subhousing in the stowed position to a release position such that the subhousing moves to the released position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The actuator further includes a mechanical linkage pivotally attaching the housing and the subhousing, where the mechanical linkage includes a cam mechanism that can act to move the subhousing from the stowed position to the released position. The mechanical linkage allows the subhousing to travel outwardly and upwardly from a back wall of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the cam mechanism includes a first cam associated with the housing, the first cam having a surface forming detents. The cam mechanism further includes a second cam associated with the subhousing, the second cam having a surface forming detents that can seat and un-seat with the surface of the first cam when the subhousing is in the released position or a number of other predetermined positions. The cam mechanism further includes a spring and a spring housing coupled to the second cam, where the spring housing includes a sleeve to receive the spring. The spring housing also has a surface forming a key, where the spring housing is at least partially positioned within a socket of the subhousing. In one embodiment, the key prevents rotational motion of the spring housing in the subhousing as the subhousing is moved relative the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As the subhousing is moved relative the housing, the detents of the first and second cams can move between seated and un-seated positions. When the cams are in their unseated position the detents are inclined at an angle and biased by the spring to allow for subsequent movement of the second cam relative the first cam. For example, as the subhousing moves from the released position to the stowed position the surface of the first and second cams un-seat to be inclined at an angle and biased by the spring to allow for the subhousing to move from the stowed position to the released position. The subhousing can subsequently be moved into one or more additional predetermined positions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The embodiments of the portable global positioning device further include navigational capabilities (e.g., a navigation component operable to perform one or more navigation functions) operative with the GPS receiver, and a detection mechanism that indicates when the subhousing is in the released position. In one embodiment, the detection mechanism can trigger activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing is in the released position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A display is in communication with the navigational capabilities and the PDA capability so that the navigational capabilities are displayed when the subhousing is in the released position. In an additional embodiment, the detection mechanism can also indicate when the subhousing is in the stowed position, where the detection mechanism triggers de-activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing is in the stowed position. In one embodiment, the detection mechanism includes a Hall Effect switch.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the present invention further include a method that includes providing PDA components operable to perform one or more PDA functions in a housing; providing navigation components operable to perform one or more navigation functions in the housing; providing a GPS antenna in a subhousing, the GPS antenna in communication with the navigation components; and coupling the housing and the subhousing with an actuator that controls a position of the subhousing relative the housing, where the actuator allows the subhousing to pivot from a stowed position to a released position relative the housing. In one embodiment, coupling the housing and the subhousing with the actuator includes installing a mechanical linkage pivotally attaching the housing and the subhousing, the mechanical linkage having the cam mechanism to move the subhousing from the stowed position to the released position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">At least a portion of the actuator can be moved to release the subhousing from the stowed position into the released position. A switch can also be installed in the housing, where the switch changes states when the subhousing moves from the stowed position to the released position. When the switch changes states (e.g., when the subhousing moves from the stowed position to the released position or visa versa) a predetermined sequence of one or more PDA functions and one or more navigation can be preformed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the present invention further include a method that includes forming the housing for the PDA components; forming the subhousing for the GPS antenna; and coupling the subhousing to the housing for the PDA components with the actuator, where the subhousing moves between the stowed position and the released position relative the housing through the use of the actuator. In one embodiment, coupling the subhousing to the housing includes providing the mechanical linkage to pivotally attach the housing and the subhousing, the mechanical linkage having the cam mechanism to move the subhousing from the stowed position to the released position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the present invention further include a method of operating the hand-held device described herein. For example, the method can include uncoupling a latch to release the subhousing that is pivotally attach to the housing and mechanically urging the subhousing from the stowed position into the released position relative the housing after uncoupling the latch. As described herein, mechanically urging the subhousing includes converting kinetic movement of a spring into rotational motion of the subhousing relative the housing through an actuator joining the subhousing and the housing. In addition, the method can further include providing the actuator with predetermined seated positions for the subhousing relative the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other embodiments, aspects, advantages, and features of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the following description of the invention and referenced drawings or by practice of the invention. The aspects, advantages, and features of the invention are realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities, procedures, and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention can be practiced. The embodiments are intended to describe aspects of the invention in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments can be utilized and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The following description and figures use a reference numeral convention where the first digit of the reference numeral corresponds to the figure and the following two digits correspond to like elements throughout the specification. For example, the housing of a portable, hand-held, electronic device of the present invention has a reference number of <b>218</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>418</b>, <b>518</b> etc., corresponding to the housing X<b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, etc. where X is the number of the figure in which the reference numeral appears.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One type of navigational system includes Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Such systems are known and have a variety of uses. In general, GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system capable of determining continuous position, velocity, time, and in some instances direction information for an unlimited number of users. Formally known as NAVSTAR, the GPS incorporates a plurality of satellites which orbit the earth in extremely precise orbits. Based on these precise orbits, GPS satellites can relay their location to any number of receiving units.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The GPS system is implemented when a device specially equipped to receive GPS data begins scanning radio frequencies for GPS satellite signals. Upon receiving a radio signal from a GPS satellite, the device can determine the precise location of that satellite via one of different conventional methods. The device will continue scanning for signals until it has acquired at least three different satellite signals. Implementing geometrical triangulation, the receiver utilizes the three known positions to determine its own two-dimensional position relative to the satellites. Additionally, acquiring a fourth satellite signal will allow the receiving device to calculate its three-dimensional position by the same geometrical calculation. The positioning and velocity data can be updated in real time on a continuous basis by an unlimited number of users.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In fact, although GPS enabled devices are often used to describe navigational devices, it will be readily appreciated that satellites need not be used at all to determine a geographic position of a receiving unit, since cellular towers or any customized transmitting radio frequency towers can be deployed and combined in groups of three or more. With such a configuration, any standard geometric triangulation algorithm can be used to determine the exact location of the receiving unit. In this way, personal hand-held devices, cell phones, intelligent appliances, intelligent apparel, and others can be readily located geographically, if appropriately equipped to be a receiving unit.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one representative view of a GPS denoted generally by reference numeral <b>100</b>. A plurality of satellites <b>120</b> are in orbit about the Earth <b>124</b>. The orbit of each satellite <b>120</b> is not necessarily synchronous with the orbits of other satellites <b>120</b> and, in fact, is likely asynchronous. A Device that includes a GPS receiver <b>140</b> of the present invention is shown receiving spread spectrum GPS satellite signals <b>160</b> from the various satellites <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The spread spectrum signals <b>160</b> continuously transmitted from each satellite <b>120</b> utilize a highly accurate frequency standard accomplished with an extremely accurate atomic clock. Each satellite <b>120</b>, as part of its data signal transmission <b>160</b>, transmits a data stream indicative of that particular satellite <b>120</b>. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art that the Device that includes a GPS receiver <b>140</b> must acquire spread spectrum GPS satellite signals <b>160</b> from at least three satellites <b>120</b> for the Device that includes a GPS receiver <b>140</b> to calculate its two-dimensional position by triangulation. Acquisition of an additional signal <b>160</b>, resulting in signals <b>160</b> from a total of four satellites <b>120</b>, permits Device that includes a GPS receiver <b>140</b> to calculate its three-dimensional position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Of course as previously presented and as is readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, GPS satellites and GPS receiving devices are not required by the tenets of the present invention, since any receiving device capable or receiving the location from at least three transmitting locations can perform basic triangulation calculations to determine the relative position of the receiving device with respect to the transmitting locations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, at least three cellular towers can each transmit their location information to a receiving cellular phone, or any other receiving device, and if the phones or devices are equipped to perform the triangulation algorithm, then the location of the cellular phone or device can be readily resolved. By further way of example, an amusement park or entertainment facility can deploy three or more transmitting radio frequency devices and provide users with receiving units capable of performing a triangulation algorithm to determine the receiving unit's location within the amusement park or entertainment facility. In this way, it is readily apparent that a receiving unit need not be exclusively GPS enabled to benefit from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrate views of one embodiment of an electronic navigational device <b>210</b> according to the teachings of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrate the top surface of the navigational device, a side view and an end view of the navigational device <b>210</b>. The navigational device <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> includes a personal digital assistant (“PDA”) with integrated GPS receiver according to the teachings of the present invention. The GPS integrated PDA operates with an operating system (“OS”) such as, for example, the well-known Palm or Pocket PC operating systems, or the lesser-used Linux OS. The GPS integrated PDA <b>210</b> can also include other devices contained in a housing <b>218</b>, such as an internal cellular transceiver. The GPS integrated PDA <b>210</b> also includes an integrated GPS patch antenna <b>214</b>. The patch antenna <b>214</b> is housed within a subhousing <b>240</b> which moves or flips with respect to the housing <b>218</b> (the movement of the subhousing will be detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>). The housing <b>218</b> is generally rectangular with a low profile and has a front face <b>220</b> extending from a top end <b>222</b> to a bottom end <b>224</b>. Visible through front face <b>220</b> is a display screen <b>226</b>, which is touch sensitive and responsive to a stylus <b>230</b> (shown stored in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) or a finger touch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrate the stylus <b>230</b> nested within housing <b>218</b> for storage and convenient access in a conventional manner. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a number of control buttons, or input keys <b>228</b> positioned toward the bottom end <b>224</b>. The invention, however, is not so limited by the position of the control buttons. It should be noted that the input keys <b>228</b> can be positioned toward the top end <b>222</b> or at any other suitable location. The end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates a map data cartridge bay slot <b>232</b> and headphone jack <b>234</b> provided at the top end <b>222</b> of the housing <b>218</b>. Again, it should be noted that a map data cartridge bay slot <b>232</b> and headphone jack <b>234</b> could also be provided at the bottom end <b>224</b>, separately at opposite ends, or at any other suitable location.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> illustrates another side view of the embodiment of a hand-held, multi-function electronic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The side view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is the side opposite the side shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> illustrates another end view of the embodiment of a hand-held, multi-function electronic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The end view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> is the end opposite the end shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be understood that the structure of GPS integrated PDA <b>210</b> is shown as illustrative of one type of integrated PDA navigation device. Other physical structures, such as a cellular telephone and a vehicle-mounted unit are contemplated within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the back surface <b>350</b> of the electronic navigational device <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the subhousing <b>340</b> which includes the antenna <b>314</b>, has been moved or flipped to an open position where the subhousing <b>340</b> makes approximately a 110° angle with respect to the back surface <b>350</b> of the navigational device <b>310</b>. The patch antenna <b>314</b> is contained within the subhousing <b>340</b>. The subhousing <b>340</b> and contained patch antenna <b>314</b> rotate upon a hinge <b>300</b> which will be further detailed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>. The hinge allows the subhousing <b>340</b> to be open to one of many positions. However, the hinge itself, includes a feature which allows the subhousing <b>340</b> to preferentially stop at one of two positions. In the first position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the subhousing makes approximately a 110° angle with respect to the back surface <b>350</b> of the navigational device <b>310</b>. This orientation is needed when the navigational device <b>310</b> is to be mounted within a car. It should be noted that the patch antenna <b>314</b>, in order to be most effective, has to essentially be parallel to the surface of the earth. When the PDA or navigational device <b>310</b> that includes a PDA is mounted in an automobile, the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> results in the patch antenna <b>314</b> housed within the subhousing <b>340</b> to be essentially parallel to the surface of the earth to provide for reception of radio signals from one of several satellites used in a GPS system. The housing <b>318</b> includes a cavity or depression <b>352</b> which corresponds to the size of the subhousing <b>340</b>. The cavity or depression <b>352</b> also includes a latch <b>354</b> for catching a mating feature <b>344</b> on the subhousing <b>340</b> when the subhousing <b>340</b> is stowed within the housing <b>318</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plunger <b>622</b> which is discussed in further detail in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a perspective view of the back of a hand-held multi-functional electronic device <b>410</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, with the movable subhousing <b>440</b> and enclosed patch antenna <b>414</b> in another open position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the subhousing <b>440</b> has moved through approximately 180° and is essentially flat with respect to the back surface <b>450</b> of the navigational device or multi-functional electronic device <b>410</b>. Again, noting that the patch antenna, in order to be most effective, has to essentially be parallel with respect to the surface of the earth, this particular orientation of the patch antenna <b>414</b> provides for effective reception of radio signals from satellite antennas when the navigational device is used in a hand-held mode. In other words, when a user is holding a multi-functional electronic device that includes a navigational device <b>410</b>, the user generally holds the PDA-shaped device in a orientation that is essentially flat or parallel to the surface of the earth. Therefore, the subhousing <b>440</b>, including the patch antenna <b>414</b>, is flipped to a position where both the housing <b>418</b> and the subhousing <b>440</b> are essentially parallel to the surface of the earth. As mentioned previously, the subhousing <b>440</b> is attached to the housing <b>418</b> with the hinge <b>400</b>. The hinge <b>400</b> has several preferred open positions which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The housing <b>418</b> includes a cavity or depression <b>452</b> which corresponds to the size of the subhousing <b>440</b>. The cavity or depression <b>452</b> also includes a latch <b>454</b> for catching a mating feature <b>444</b> on the subhousing <b>440</b>. It should be noted that having two preferred open positions so that the patch antenna is always substantially parallel with the surface of the earth or perpendicular to the signals from the satellites provides for the best possible reception of the signals from the satellite. By having the subhousing capable of more than one orientation and actually going to one of two preferred orientations, the patch antenna <b>414</b> can be made somewhat smaller than a patch antenna having a fixed orientation with respect to a housing. In this particular application, the patch antenna is approximately 20 mm and fits within the housing <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a back view of a hand-held multi-functional electronic device <b>510</b> with the movable subhousing <b>540</b> in a closed position. A hinge <b>500</b> allows the subhousing <b>540</b> to move with respect to the housing <b>518</b>. In the closed position, the latch opening and the latch are engaged (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> as elements <b>344</b>, <b>354</b> and <b>444</b>, <b>454</b>). In various embodiments, the latch and the latch opening are engaged with a snap fit between housing <b>518</b> and the subhousing <b>540</b>. The invention, however, is not so limited. In various embodiments, the housing <b>518</b> also includes an access depression <b>560</b>. The access depression <b>560</b> allows access to below the surface of the subhousing <b>540</b> such that an edge of the subhousing can be reached and such that the subhousing <b>540</b> can be moved from the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to an open position such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. It should be noted that the closed position may also be referred to as a stowed position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a multi-functional electronic device <b>600</b> according to various embodiments of the present invention. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a housing <b>618</b> and a subhousing <b>640</b> are associated with the multi-functional electronic device <b>600</b>. As noted above, in various embodiments, the multi-function electronic device <b>600</b> includes a hand held PDA <b>600</b> having integrated GPS capabilities. The perspective view embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a back surface <b>650</b> of the housing <b>618</b>. In addition, a depression, or indentation <b>652</b> is illustrated in the back surface <b>650</b> of the housing <b>618</b>. As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, in various embodiments the indentation <b>652</b> is configured so that the subhousing <b>640</b> can seat flushly into the back surface <b>650</b> of the housing <b>618</b> when the subhousing <b>640</b> is in a first, or stowed position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, in the various embodiments the subhousing <b>640</b> includes a flip-up antenna which is pivotally attached at <b>655</b> to the housing <b>618</b>. In various embodiments, as has been described herein, the subhousing <b>640</b> includes a GPS antenna as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the GPS antenna is shown as <b>654</b> in a cut-away section view <b>653</b>. In various embodiments, the subhousing <b>640</b> includes a patch GPS antenna <b>654</b> as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The invention, however, is not limited to a patch GPS antenna in the subhousing <b>640</b>. Other suitable types of GPS antennas, located in the subhousing <b>640</b> are also considered within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> further illustrates another cut-away section view <b>656</b> provided to reveal one or more components located beneath the indentation <b>652</b> which receives the subhousing <b>640</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the one or more components revealed in the cut-away <b>656</b> beneath the indentation <b>652</b> includes at least one component <b>658</b> which is part of a Hall Effect switch as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In various embodiments, the at least one component <b>658</b> located beneath the indentation <b>652</b> includes the detection mechanism <b>658</b> of a Hall Effect switch as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. That is, the component <b>658</b> can be a sensor operable to detect the presence of a magnetic field. In this configuration, and as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the subhousing <b>640</b> includes a magnet <b>660</b> located within the subhousing <b>640</b> and positioned to oppose the detection mechanism <b>658</b> when the subhousing <b>640</b> is in a first, or stowed position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Other configurations and placement embodiments are considered within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, when the subhousing <b>640</b> is in a first, or stowed position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) a magnetic field produced by the magnet <b>660</b> can trigger the detection mechanism <b>658</b> and register a first state and/or produce a first signal representative of the positioning of the subhousing <b>640</b>, e.g. in a collapsed, closed or stowed position. Likewise, as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, when the subhousing <b>640</b> is in one or more second positions (such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) a magnetic field produced by the magnet <b>660</b> can be sufficiently removed, or distanced, from the detection mechanism <b>658</b> such that the detection mechanism can register a second state and/or produce a second signal representative of the positioning of the subhousing <b>640</b>, e.g. in an open, extended, expanded, or flipped-up location in the one or more second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, the Hall Effect switch components described above, e.g. <b>658</b> and <b>660</b>, are but one form of detect switch which can be implemented with the various embodiments of the present invention to provide an indication of a location and/or position of the subhousing <b>640</b>. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to Hall Effect switches as the sole means for detecting the position of the subhousing <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As noted above, however, various embodiments include a Hall Effect switch mechanism to indicate a position or location of the subhousing <b>640</b>. By way of example and not by way of limitation, a Hall Effect switch, including components <b>658</b> and <b>660</b>, have been shown to register a first state and/or produce a first signal when the subhousing <b>640</b> is in the first, or stowed position. Likewise, the Hall Effect switch embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, has been shown to register a second state and/or produce a second signal when the subhousing is in one or more second positions (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, in various embodiments the first and/or second registered states as well as the first and/or second signals can be received and/or detected by other components, operated upon by one or more sets of computer executable instructions to interact with, initiate and/or control other functions within the PDA <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In various embodiments, by way of example and not by way of limitation, when the subhousing is in the first, or stowed position, the first registered state and/or first signal produced by the Hall Effect switch embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can function to cease providing power to a GPS receiver (e.g. as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and the GPS antenna <b>654</b>. In various embodiments, this feature can function as a power savings mode. In various embodiments, the first registered state and/or first signal produce by the Hall Effect switch can be received and/or detected by other components as well as operated upon by one or more sets of computer executable instructions to cause the PDA to automatically transition to one or more PDA functions available on PDA <b>600</b>. For example, upon registering a first state and/or producing a first signal from the Hall Effect switch, the PDA <b>600</b> can in various embodiments automatically transition to a calendar function, a to-do list function, and/or an address book function, among others. In various embodiments, the first state and/or first signal can cause the PDA <b>600</b> to transition to a pre-defined and/or pre-selected interface for one or more PDA functions. The invention, however, is not limited to the aspects and features presented above.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a similar manner, in various embodiments by way of example and not by way of limitation, when the subhousing is positioned in one or more second positions (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>), a second registered state and/or second signal produced by the Hall Effect switch embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can function to provide power to a GPS receiver (e.g. as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and the GPS antenna <b>654</b>. In various embodiments, this feature can function as a power savings mode to provide power to the GPS receiver and antenna combination only when they are intended for use. In various embodiments, the second registered state and/or second signal produce by the Hall Effect switch can be received and/or detected by other components as well as operated upon by one or more sets of computer executable instructions to cause the PDA <b>600</b> to automatically transition to one or more navigation functions available on PDA <b>600</b>. For example, upon registering a second state and/or producing a second signal from the Hall Effect switch, the PDA <b>600</b> can in various embodiments automatically transition to a routing function, a locating function, and/or a tracking function, among others. In various embodiments, the second state and/or second signal can cause the PDA <b>600</b> to transition to a pre-defined and/or pre-selected interface for one or more navigation functions. The invention, however, is similarly not limited to the aspects and features presented above. As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, a detection mechanism, whether a Hall Effect switch or otherwise, is included in various embodiments of the present invention to activate one or more hardware and/or software components of the PDA <b>600</b> as the same are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In various embodiments, in addition to enabling software, a microprocessor (as discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) can remember selected preferences of a user. For example, the user may use a specific graphical user interface more often than other graphical user interfaces available for the software component of the navigational component of the PDA <b>600</b>. The scope of the embodiments of the invention provide for operating systems which can run several software applications simultaneously, e.g. so that the software that is not primarily being used at the time on the PDA <b>600</b> can run in the background rather than being totally turned off or not run. In various embodiments, a feature of automatically switching to the software application that is most likely to be used makes for very simple operation. In embodiments with a position detection mechanism, such as described in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a state and/or signal can indicate which particular function is most likely to be used and software applications can be switched automatically so that a user does not have to be involved with switching the software functions and selecting new graphical user interfaces.</p>

Associated with each spring loaded detent <b>720</b>, <b>722</b>, is a cam follower <b>730</b>, <b>732</b>. The hinge <b>700</b> also includes a first end piece <b>740</b> and a second end piece <b>742</b> which engages openings within the housing <b>718</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows further detail of one side of the hinge <b>800</b> which corresponds to a blown-up portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> will be used to further detail the hinge mechanism <b>800</b>. One side of the hinge <b>800</b> will be discussed. Specifically, the side of hinge shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> will be discussed, and it should be noted that the other side of the hinge <b>800</b> is similar. Rather than discuss both sides of the hinge <b>800</b>, one side is discussed for the sake of clarity. The spring loaded detent <b>820</b> includes a first end <b>824</b> and a second end <b>826</b>. The second end includes a shoulder <b>827</b>, as well as a cam <b>828</b>. The second end <b>826</b>, shoulder <b>827</b>, and cam <b>828</b> engage the cam follower <b>830</b>. The cam follower <b>830</b>, in turn, engages the end <b>840</b> of the hinge <b>800</b>, which engages the housing <b>818</b>. The spring <b>810</b> fits over the first end <b>824</b> of the spring loaded detent <b>820</b>. The spring is positioned to produce a force at both ends of the hinge. The force acts through the spring loaded detent <b>820</b>, the cam follower <b>830</b>, and the end piece <b>840</b> so as to produce a force at the opening <b>842</b> in the housing <b>818</b>. Therefore, the spring produces a compressive force which forces the end of the hinge <b>840</b> into the opening <b>842</b>. The spring produces a friction force at the end <b>840</b> that rotates within the opening <b>842</b> of the housing. This is very advantageous to have the hinge <b>800</b> be spring loaded using the spring <b>810</b>. This spring loading provides a compressive force between the hinge <b>800</b> and specifically the end <b>840</b>, and the housing <b>818</b>, and specifically the opening <b>842</b> within the housing. This is particularly significant when the portable hand-held device is being used in an environment that has vibration. One such environment that may be prone to having vibration is within a car. Older cars may vibrate or even newer cars may pass over terrain that imparts vibration to the interior surface of the car. One such terrain might be a washboard surface on a gravel road or chuck holes in the road or any number of road irregularities. The spring <b>810</b> of the hinge <b>800</b> produces a force to keep the hinge <b>800</b> at a specific location. The spring <b>810</b> imparts a force so that there is friction between the end <b>840</b> and the opening <b>842</b> within the housing <b>818</b>. The friction produces a force which resists movement of the subhousing (as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) with respect to the housing <b>818</b>, especially in environments that might have vibration. The hinge <b>800</b>, and specifically the spring loaded detent <b>820</b>, includes a cam surface <b>828</b>. The cam surface <b>828</b> includes a couple of lobes with detents therein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Yet another feature of the hinge <b>800</b> is the fact that it includes a hollow opening within the hinge. The hollow opening is sized so that a connector between an antenna (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) located inside of the housing <b>818</b> can pass through the opening within the hinge <b>800</b>. This provides for a much cleaner design which is less prone to failure since the connector or cable needed to connect the antenna with the hardware within the housing <b>818</b> is not exposed. Not only is the design cleaner, but it also provides for a more reliable and robust design since the user is not able, or less able, to inadvertently damage this connector. In various embodiments, the connector can include a coaxial cable connector.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a cam <b>900</b> taken along cut-line <b>9</b>-<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The invention is not limited to the cam <b>900</b> embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Various embodiments include any cam member, associated with a hinge between a housing and a subhousing containing a GPS antenna according to the various embodiments, which is operable to cause a pivotally attached subhousing to tend toward one or more particular positions including the first position and the one or more second positions as the same have been described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cam <b>900</b> includes a cam surface <b>927</b> operable in association with a spring-loaded detent, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or otherwise, to engage a cam follower. The cam surface <b>927</b> includes a first detent <b>910</b> and a second detent <b>920</b>. The first detent <b>910</b> is positioned so that the subhousing as it is rotated with respect to the housing will stop in a first position, which is approximately 110° from the backside surface of the multi-functional device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the subhousing in such a position with respect to the housing. The second detent <b>920</b> will tend to position the subhousing <b>940</b> at a position which is essentially <b>180</b> <b>0</b> from the stowed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The detents <b>910</b>, <b>920</b> are helpful in that they provide for preferred open positions of the subhousing with respect to the housing. The detents <b>910</b> and <b>920</b> are selected so that the patch antenna within the subhousing will be in a preferred orientation in a certain unit so that it will maximize reception of signals from various satellites associated with a GPS system. Although only two detents <b>910</b>, <b>920</b> are shown, it should be noted that more detents could be used if there were other positions of the subhousing with respect to the housing that may be preferred.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> provide exploded views of a portion of the housing <b>1218</b> and subhousing <b>1214</b> which includes the patch antenna <b>1201</b> associated with the hand-held portable global positioning device <b>1200</b>. The subhousing <b>1214</b> is pivotally attached to the housing <b>1218</b> through an actuator <b>1203</b> that can be used to release and move the subhousing <b>1214</b> in a “flip-open” fashion. This “flip-open” aspect of the actuator <b>1203</b> includes a mechanical linkage <b>1205</b> for controlling the movement and position of the subhousing <b>1214</b> relative the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Different portions of the actuator <b>1203</b> are integrated into, and work in conjunction with, the mechanical linkage <b>1205</b>, the housing <b>1218</b>, and the subhousing <b>1214</b> to control the movement of the subhousing <b>1214</b> relative the housing <b>1218</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the actuator <b>1203</b> can be used to release the subhousing <b>1214</b> from its stowed position from the cavity <b>1252</b> in a back wall of the housing <b>1218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>) into a released position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). This movement is accomplished through the actuator <b>1203</b>, and in particular the mechanical linkage <b>1205</b>, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one embodiment, the portions of the actuator <b>1203</b> integrated into and working with the housing <b>1218</b> and subhousing <b>1214</b> include a release lever <b>1207</b>. The release level <b>1207</b> has a contact surface <b>1209</b>, a latch <b>1211</b>, and an elongate shaft <b>1213</b> connecting the latch <b>1211</b> and the contact surface <b>1209</b>. As illustrated, the contact surface <b>1209</b> can be positioned within and accessible through an opening <b>1215</b> in the housing <b>1218</b>. For example, the back surface <b>1250</b> of the housing <b>1218</b> can provide the opening <b>1215</b>. The opening <b>1215</b> could also be positioned along a side surface <b>1217</b> of the housing <b>1218</b>. Alternatively, at least a portion of the back surface <b>1250</b> and the side surface <b>1217</b> of the housing <b>1218</b> can provide the opening <b>1215</b>. Regardless of its position, the release lever <b>1207</b> is at least partially accessible (e.g., the contact surface <b>1209</b>) through the opening <b>1215</b> in the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As illustrated, the contact surface <b>1209</b> is accessible through the opening <b>1215</b> with the latch <b>1211</b> and the elongate shaft <b>1213</b> positioned within the housing <b>1218</b>. The contact surface <b>1209</b> can move within the opening <b>1215</b> to allow the user to engage or disengage the latch <b>1211</b> that holds the subhousing <b>1214</b> in the stowed position. For example, the release lever <b>1207</b> can slide adjacent and parallel to the back surface <b>1250</b> within the opening <b>1215</b> to engage or disengage the latch <b>1211</b> releasably holding the subhousing <b>1214</b> in the stowed position.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The subhousing <b>1214</b> further includes a surface <b>1219</b> that provides a latch face <b>1221</b> to engage and disengage the latch <b>1211</b> of the release lever <b>1207</b>. As will be appreciated, the latch <b>1211</b> and the latch face <b>1221</b> can have a number of configurations so long as they are configured to allow the subhousing <b>1214</b> to latch in the stowed position and to unlatch so as to allow the subhousing <b>1214</b> to move into the released position.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The release lever <b>1207</b> further includes retention members <b>1223</b> extending from a rear surface <b>1225</b> of the release lever <b>1207</b>. In one embodiment, the retention members <b>1223</b> are configured to interlock with guide members <b>1227</b> secured within the housing <b>1218</b>. For example, the retention members <b>1223</b> and the guide members <b>1227</b> include surface structures that interlock with each other to allow for their relative movement along a plane. In other words, interlocking surface structures on the retention members <b>1223</b> and the guide members <b>1227</b> engage each other to allow for the release lever <b>1207</b> to slide within the opening without disengaging from the housing <b>1218</b>. For example, the retention member <b>1223</b> can include a ridge configured to seat and ride in a channel in the guide member <b>1227</b>. As will be appreciated, a benefit of the design of the release lever <b>1207</b> is that the release lever <b>1207</b> can be installed into the housing <b>1218</b>, as described herein, by sliding the release lever <b>1207</b> through the opening <b>1215</b> from the outside of the housing <b>1218</b> and then “snapping” the release lever <b>1207</b> into place without the need for additional fasteners or extra parts.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As illustrated, the retention members <b>1223</b> extend from the rear face <b>1225</b> of the release lever <b>1207</b>. Similarly, the guide members <b>1227</b> extend from the housing <b>1218</b>. In coupling the release lever <b>1207</b> to the housing <b>1218</b> the retention members <b>1223</b> are aligned with the guide members <b>1227</b> so that when pressure is applied between the release lever <b>1207</b> and the housing <b>1218</b> the retention members <b>1223</b> and/or the guide members <b>1227</b> flex to allow the surfaces to pass each other until the surface structures engage to fasten the release lever <b>1207</b> to the housing <b>1218</b>. Once fastened, the retention members <b>1223</b> and the guide members <b>1227</b> help to guide the travel of the release lever <b>1207</b> as it slides within the opening <b>1215</b> to engage or disengage the latch <b>1211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The release level <b>1207</b> further includes a spring post <b>1229</b> extending from the elongate shaft <b>1213</b> and a spring <b>1231</b>. As illustrated, the spring <b>1231</b> is located between an internal surface of the housing <b>1218</b> and the elongate shaft <b>1213</b> of the release lever <b>1207</b>. In this position the spring <b>1231</b> urges the latch <b>1211</b> to maintain a latching position relative the latch face <b>1221</b>. As will be appreciated, as the subhousing <b>1214</b> is moved into its stored position, the spring <b>1231</b> can resiliently compresses as the latch face <b>1221</b> of subhousing <b>1214</b> contacts, slides over and engages the latch <b>1211</b>. To move the subhousing into its released position, the user can slide the contact surface <b>1209</b> within the opening <b>1215</b> to move the release lever into a release position where the latch <b>1211</b> disengages from the subhousing <b>1214</b>. The spring <b>1231</b> can then return the contact surface <b>1209</b> and the latch <b>1211</b> back to their latching position relative the latch face <b>1221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one embodiment, the release lever <b>1207</b> can include a support member <b>1233</b> associated with the latch <b>1211</b>. The support member <b>1233</b> can assist in preventing the latch <b>1211</b> from deflecting into a position that will not allow the latch face <b>1221</b> of subhousing <b>1214</b> to engage and latch with the latch <b>1211</b> to achieve the stowed position. In other words, the support member <b>1233</b> helps to keep the latch <b>1211</b> and the latch face <b>1221</b> aligned as the subhousing <b>1214</b> engages and latches with the housing <b>1218</b>. As illustrated, the support member <b>1233</b> can be positioned between the latch <b>1211</b> and a surface within the housing <b>1218</b>. As will be appreciated, the support member <b>1233</b> can either be attached, or integral, to the latch <b>1211</b> or attached within the housing <b>1214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> further show an embodiment of the mechanical linkage <b>1205</b> for controlling the movement and position of the subhousing <b>1214</b> relative the housing <b>1218</b>. As discussed herein, the release lever <b>1207</b> can be used to release the subhousing <b>1214</b> from the stowed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>) so it can move to its released position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). In one embodiment, the structure of the mechanical linkage <b>1205</b> provides the rotational force to “flip-open” the subhousing <b>1214</b> into its released position.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As illustrated, the mechanical linkage <b>1203</b> pivotally attaches the housing <b>1218</b> and the subhousing <b>1214</b>, where the mechanical linkage <b>1203</b> includes a cam mechanism <b>1235</b> to move the subhousing <b>1214</b> from the stowed position to the released position. As illustrated, the mechanical linkage <b>1203</b> provides a pivot point <b>1237</b> around which the subhousing <b>1214</b> travels outwardly and upwardly in an arc like fashion from the back surface <b>1250</b> of the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The cam mechanism <b>1235</b> includes a first cam <b>1245</b> and a second cam <b>1247</b>, where the first and second cams <b>1245</b> and <b>1247</b> interact to direct the subhousing <b>1214</b> into one or more predetermined positions. In the present embodiment, the first cam <b>1245</b> includes a surface <b>1249</b> having detents <b>1251</b>. The second cam <b>1247</b> also includes a surface <b>1253</b> having detents <b>1255</b>, where the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> can move between a seated relationship to an un-seated relationship when the subhousing <b>1214</b> is moved relative the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment, the seated relationship of the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> define a number of predetermined positions for the subhousing <b>1214</b> relative the housing <b>128</b>. For example, in the stowed position the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> are in an unseated relationship such that the cam mechanism <b>1235</b> urges the subhousing <b>1214</b> towards its released position. Once in its released position, the subhousing <b>1214</b> can be rotated into other predetermined position defined by the different seated relationship of the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b>. For example, the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> can allow for the subhousing <b>1214</b> to be at a fifty six (56), a one hundred one (101), or a one hundred forty six (146) degree position relative the housing <b>1218</b> when the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> are in one of their seated relationships.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, the subhousing <b>1214</b> can also be positioned at a one hundred eighty (180) degree position relative the housing <b>1218</b>. In one embodiment, a physical stop prevents the subhousing <b>1214</b> from moving beyond the one hundred eighty (180) degree relative position even though the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> are in an unseated relationship urging the subhousing <b>1214</b> beyond the one hundred eighty (180) degree relative position. In one embodiment, the physical stop can include the subhousing <b>1214</b> physically contacting the housing <b>1218</b> at the one hundred eighty (180) degree relative position thereby preventing further rotation there beyond. As illustrated, the first cam <b>1245</b> is associated with the housing <b>1218</b>. In one embodiment, the first cam <b>1245</b> can be formed as a portion of the housing <b>1218</b>. In other words, the first cam <b>1245</b> is formed as an integral part of the housing <b>1218</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the first cam <b>1245</b> can be a separate part that is placed within a socket of the housing <b>1218</b> that is configured to receive the cam <b>1245</b>. With respect to this later configuration, both the first cam <b>1245</b> and the socket to receive the cam <b>1245</b> include one or more surfaces, such as a key, to prevent the first cam <b>1245</b> from rotating within the socket of the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The cam mechanism <b>1241</b> further includes a spring <b>1257</b> and a spring housing <b>1259</b> having a sleeve <b>1261</b> to receive the spring <b>1257</b>. The spring housing <b>1259</b> is coupled to the second cam <b>1247</b>. For example, the spring housing <b>1259</b> and the second cam <b>1247</b> can be formed from a single molded piece of material (e.g., a thermoplastic). The spring housing <b>1259</b> and the second cam <b>1247</b> can also be joined by a connector, such as a pin or an adhesive (e.g., chemical adhesive or thermal boding).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The spring housing <b>1259</b> is at least partially positioned within a socket <b>1269</b> of the subhousing <b>1214</b>. In the present example, the spring housing <b>1259</b> and the second cam <b>1247</b> are prevented from rotating relative the subhousing <b>1214</b> as it moves relative the housing <b>1218</b> by the presence of a key <b>1271</b> formed by surfaces of the socket <b>1269</b> and the spring housing <b>1259</b>. The spring housing <b>1259</b> and the second cam <b>1247</b> are, however, free to slide laterally within the socket <b>1269</b> as the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> of the cams <b>1245</b> and <b>1247</b> move between their seated and un-seated positions.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As illustrated, the spring <b>1257</b> can be positioned within the sleeve <b>1261</b> of the spring housing <b>1259</b>. When subhousing <b>1214</b> has been coupled to the housing <b>1218</b>, the spring <b>1257</b> can be under compression to urge the spring housing <b>1259</b>, and the second cam <b>1247</b> towards the first cam <b>1245</b>. For example, the spring <b>1257</b> can be under compression when the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> of the first and second cams <b>1245</b> and <b>1247</b> are seated. In the unseated position, the spring <b>1257</b> is placed under additional compressive force as the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> unseat moving the spring housing <b>1259</b> away from the first cam <b>1245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As will be appreciated, the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> on the surfaces <b>1249</b> and <b>1253</b> can include a number or combination of shapes that can seat and unseat as described herein. For example, the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> can include a serpentine profile having a series of convex and concave surfaces that can seat and unseat as described. As will be appreciated, as the subhousing <b>1218</b> is moved into a position that unseats the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> the spring <b>1257</b> compresses thereby urging the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> of the cam faces to reseat. Depending upon their relative positions, the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> can urge the first cam <b>1245</b> and the second cam <b>1247</b> back towards the position from which they were originally seated or to a seated position that provides another of the predetermined positions discussed herein. As will be appreciated, which direction the <b>1257</b> spring urges the subhousing <b>1214</b> will depend on which half of the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> the cams <b>1245</b> and <b>1247</b> are unseated on.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The embodiments of the portable global positioning device <b>1200</b> further include navigational capabilities (e.g., a navigation component operable to perform one or more navigation functions) operative with the GPS receiver (e.g. as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), and a detection mechanism <b>1258</b> that indicates when the subhousing is in the released position, where the detection mechanism <b>1258</b> triggers activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing <b>1214</b> is in the released position. A display (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is in communication with the navigational capabilities and the PDA capability so that the navigational capabilities are displayed when the subhousing <b>1218</b> is in the released position. In an additional embodiment, the detection mechanism <b>1258</b> can also indicate when the subhousing <b>1218</b> is in the stowed position, where the detection mechanism <b>1258</b> triggers de-activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing <b>1218</b> is in the stowed position. In one embodiment, the detection mechanism <b>1258</b> includes a Hall Effect switch, as discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Embodiments of the present invention further include a method of producing the portable global positioning device <b>1200</b>. For example, the method can include providing PDA components operable to perform one or more PDA functions, as discussed herein, and providing navigation components operable to perform one or more navigation functions, as discussed herein, in the housing <b>1218</b>. In addition, the GPS patch antenna <b>1201</b> can be provided in a subhousing <b>1214</b>, where the GPS antenna is in communication with the navigation components within the housing <b>1218</b>. In one embodiment, the GPS patch antenna <b>1201</b> can be coupled to the navigation components within the housing <b>1218</b> by a lead that passes through an opening in the spring housing <b>1259</b> and the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, the housing <b>1218</b> and the subhousing <b>1214</b> are coupled through the actuator <b>1203</b> that controls the movement and position of the subhousing <b>1218</b> relative the housing <b>1214</b>, as discussed herein. In one embodiment, coupling the housing <b>1218</b> and the subhousing <b>1214</b> includes compressing the second cams <b>1247</b> to the surface <b>1253</b> of the detents <b>1255</b> so that the cams <b>1247</b> do not extend beyond the edge of the socket <b>1269</b>. The subhousing <b>1214</b> can then be positioned within the cavity <b>1252</b> in the back wall of the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Embodiments of the present invention further include a method of operating the hand-held portable global positioning device <b>1200</b> described herein. For example, the method can include uncoupling the latch <b>1211</b> that holds the subhousing <b>1214</b> in the stowed position to release the subhousing <b>1214</b> that is pivotally attach to the housing <b>1218</b>. The actuator <b>1203</b> then mechanically urges the subhousing <b>1214</b> from the stowed position into the released position relative the housing <b>1218</b> after uncoupling the latch <b>1211</b>. As described herein, mechanically urging the subhousing includes converting kinetic movement of the spring <b>1257</b> into rotational motion of the subhousing relative the housing through the actuator <b>1203</b>, and in particular the cams <b>1245</b> and <b>1247</b>, joining the subhousing <b>1214</b> and the housing <b>1218</b>. In addition, the method can further include providing the cams <b>1245</b> and <b>1247</b> of the actuator <b>1203</b> with predetermined seated positions (e.g., the seated relationships of the detents <b>1251</b> and <b>1255</b> discussed herein) for the subhousing <b>1214</b> relative the housing <b>1218</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In summary, disclosed is a multi-function, hand-held portable electronic device including a housing, a processor located within the housing, a memory in communication with the processor, and a display in communication with the processor. The display is positioned on a surface of the housing. The electronic device includes a display in communication with the processor and positioned on a surface of the housing.

The navigational component includes an antenna attached to the housing and movable between a stowed position and a signal acquisition position. A detection mechanism indicates the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. An operational component of the navigational component is activated in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The multi-function, portable, hand-held device is also part of a navigational system. The navigation system includes a mass storage device adapted to store navigation data, a server adapted to communicate with the mass storage, and a portable, multi-function electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The invention provides for a single device having a navigational component and one or more other functions, such as a PDA function or a cellular phone function. The portable, hand-held electronic device is user friendly since one function switches to another essentially automatically. The portable, hand-held electronics device includes a power savings mode so that the user is not continually recharging the device rather than using it. The device is small enough that it is handy to use and stores in a pocket or purse. The device includes a GPS or other navigational device with other devices. The GPS antenna is low profile and is positionable to more than one position so that the device can operate in a hand-held orientation or in a car-mounted orientation. The device is durable, and free of wires routed externally about the housing. Routing the connector between the antenna and hardware within the case provides for a neat, uncluttered design.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The above systems, devices and methods have been described, by way of example and not by way of limitation, with respect to reducing memory capacity requirements, increasing processor throughput, and improving overall ease of user interaction with a navigation device. That is, the systems, devices, functional data, and methods provide for generating a projected route in connection with a navigational device which is more efficient and accurate than current systems, devices, and methods, without requiring more expensive system resources. The systems, devices, functional data, and methods of the present invention offer an improved generated projected route which provide more understandable, accurate and timely capabilities in a navigation device while utilizing less resources.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive.
