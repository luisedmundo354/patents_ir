<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed herein is a radio transmission device comprising data inputting means for inputting transmission data, data storing means for storing the inputted transmission data temporarily, data compression means for reading data from the data storing means to compress the data, and data transmitting means for transmitting the compressed data through a radio line. With this configuration, a real-time signal in a radio transmission system, in which effective throughput is not guaranteed like ACL link of Bluetooth can be transmitted and received. Delay of data transmission caused by a change in throughput of the line is absorbed by the data storing means. In addition, controlling a compression rate in response to the change in throughput enables transmission with an optimum data rate.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, a radio transmitting/receiving system, and a storage medium, which are used for transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image by means of a radio communication method. In particular, the present invention relates to a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, a radio transmitting/receiving system, and a storage medium, which are used for transmitting a real time signal while keeping data quality of the signal by means of a radio communication method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More specifically, the present invention relates to a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, and a radio transmitting/receiving system, which are used for transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image in a radio transmission system where effective throughput fluctuates (that is to say, it is not guaranteed) like ACL link (Asynchronous Connection Less Link) of Bluetooth. In particular, the present invention relates to a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, and a radio transmitting/receiving system, which are capable of transmitting a real time signal while keeping its data quality in a transmission system where effective throughput fluctuates like the ACL link of the Bluetooth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, short-distance radio communication technology is becoming highlighted. According to this kind of radio communication method, cordless communication between equipment and a terminal can be established. Therefore, connection work between pieces of equipment is simplified. In addition, because it is not necessary to choose an installation location for each equipment, this kind of radio communication method is very convenient. Short-distance radio communication is also highly expected to be a transmission medium, which is placed in a local location where construction of a network cable is not realistic like, for example, a home network, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the short-distance radio communication can be used for the following: data exchange between pieces of portable information equipment; and transmission of data and sound between a main body of a telephone (or a portable music player) and a headset, between a main phone and a cordless handset, and between others.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">“Bluetooth”, which is a representative example of the short-distance radio communication, uses a radio frequency of 2.45 GHz band. Data transmission speed is 1 Mbps as a whole, in which a synchronous transmission channel of 64 kbps available for telephone voice transmission and an asynchronous transmission channel for data transmission are provided. The former synchronous transmission channel adopts SCO (Synchronous Connection Oriented Link) transmission method, and is applied to line connection. On the other hand, the latter asynchronous transmission channel adopts ACL (Asynchronous Connection Less Link) transmission method, and is applied to data transmission using packet switching.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A range of connection between pieces of equipment by the Bluetooth is about 10 m. However, the range can be extended up to 100 m using an additional amplifier. The Bluetooth is based on point-to-point connection between master equipment and slave equipment, or point-to-multipoint connection. In the latter case, one master can communicate with seven slaves at a maximum by means of the SCO or the ACL method.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, there may be an application that communicates between pieces of equipment for handling a real time signal such as sound and image (high fidelity audio, etc.) using the Bluetooth.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, there is a high possibility that transmission throughput fluctuates on a radio transmission channel. Therefore, in order to transmit a real time signal without interruption of sound and image by means of the radio communication method, it is necessary to make enough allowance for line quality. As a result, maximum throughput of a line cannot be used effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Concerning information communication, in general, on the transmission side, transmission data is encoded and compressed; and on the receiving side, received data is decoded (to be more specific, Codec processing is performed). In addition, a compression rate is changed in response to the line quality. However, in this case, the change is based on the concept that when allowance of throughput becomes small, the data compression rate is increased. Because of it, it is necessary to know the allowance of throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">At this point, the following case will be considered: a real time signal such as sound and image is transmitted using the short-distance radio communication such as the Bluetooth.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, the Bluetooth has two kinds of transmission methods: the SCO and the ACL. If the SCO method based on line connection is used, no retransmission request is issued regardless of whether or not there is an error correction. Therefore, sound quality and image quality are not guaranteed. In contrast to this, the ACL is a packet transmission method. When an error occurs (or when the error is not corrected by error correction), an error-free state is realized by packet retransmission. Therefore, sound quality and image quality can be guaranteed. In other words, the ACL method can be said to be suitable for transmission of a real time signal because data quality is guaranteed, and because sound and image can be transmitted satisfactorily without interruption.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, the ACL method is a link of Best Effort type. Therefore, as a trade-off for guarantee of data quality, a situation, in which latency and throughput cannot be guaranteed when line quality decreases, occurs (for example, when utilizing radio communication at home, operation of ordinary home electric appliances such as microwave oven causes effective throughput to change to a large extent).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other words, the ACL link in the Bluetooth is a communication system in which effective throughput changes. There is no way of knowing a real-ability value of throughput. Therefore, a mechanism, which determines a data compression rate in response to allowance of throughput, does not hold.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the present invention is to provide a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, a radio transmitting/receiving system, and a storage medium, that are outstanding and capable of transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image while keeping its data quality.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of the present invention is to provide, in a radio transmission system of which effective throughput fluctuates (that is to say, it is not guaranteed) like ACL link of Bluetooth, a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, and a radio transmitting/receiving system, that are outstanding and capable of transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image while keeping data quality.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another object of the present invention is to provide, in a transmission system of which effective throughput fluctuates like ACL link of Bluetooth, a radio transmission device, a radio receiving device, and a radio transmitting/receiving system, that are outstanding and capable of transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image while keeping data quality by changing a data compression rate dynamically during a transmission period.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is devised to take the above-mentioned problems into consideration. A first aspect is a radio transmission device, or method, for transmitting data through a radio line. In this case, said radio transmission device, or method, comprises data inputting means, or step, for inputting transmission data, input data storing means, or step, for storing the inputted transmission data temporarily, data compression means, or step, for reading the temporarily stored data by means of a first-in first-out method to compress the data, and data transmitting means, or step, for transmitting the compressed data through the radio line.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A second aspect of the present invention is a radio transmitting device, or method, for transmitting data through a radio line. In this case, said radio transmitting device, or method, comprises data inputting means, or step, for inputting transmission data, data compressing means, or step, for compressing the inputted transmission data, compressed data storing means, or step, for storing the compressed data temporarily, and data transmitting means, or step, for transmitting the compressed data through the radio line.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this case, the radio line is, for example, ACL link in Bluetooth. As regards the radio line, a transmission path is unstable. In addition, the ACL link belongs to a Best Effort type that controls retransmission when a transmission-data error occurs. Therefore, effective throughput is not guaranteed. According to the radio transmission device, or method, relating to the first aspect of the present invention, a delay in data transmission resulting from a fluctuation of throughput on the line is absorbed as the input data storing means, or step, accumulates transmission data, which is continuously inputted, temporarily by means of the first-in first-out method.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Embodiments of the present invention will be detailed with reference to drawings as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a configuration of a radio transmitting/receiving system <b>1</b> that is provided as an embodiment of the present invention. The radio transmitting/receiving system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be suitably applied to transmission of an audio signal as a real time signal. The radio transmitting/receiving system <b>1</b> comprises a pair of units: a radio transmission side <b>10</b>, and a radio receiving side <b>20</b>. The radio transmission side <b>10</b> and the radio receiving side <b>20</b> are connected to each other using, for example, a short-distance radio line such as a Bluetooth line (described above).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The radio transmission side <b>10</b> may use a real-time signal source including an analog input from a microphone or other audio input devices, and may also use a real-time signal source from a broadcast receiver. Or, the radio transmission side <b>10</b> may use a signal, which is reproduced from a recording medium such as CD (Compact Disc), as a signal source.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the other hand, as regards the radio receiving side <b>20</b>, there is a case where an audio output device such as a speaker and a headphone are connected so that audio listening becomes possible in real time. Or, there is a case where an audio signal is recorded in a recording medium such as MD and CD-R as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The radio transmission side <b>10</b> comprises: an input FIFO memory <b>11</b> for temporarily storing a real-time audio signal that is supplied from an audio signal source using a first-in first-out method; an encoding unit <b>12</b> for encoding and compressing the audio signal; a packet buffer <b>13</b> for temporarily storing only one packet of the encoded data; and a BT transmission unit <b>14</b> for transmitting the packet through the Bluetooth line.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The input FIFO memory <b>11</b> comprises buffers that are arranged using the first-in first-out method. Each of the buffers accumulates audio data, of which quantity is equivalent to for example 0.5 seconds. However, if an audio signal is inputted as an analogue signal, the audio signal is converted into a digital signal using an A/D converter before writing it to the input FIFO memory <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A compression method, which is adopted by the encoding unit <b>12</b>, is not particularly limited when realizing the present invention. However, in order to realize CD quality, it is desirable to adopt, for example, ATRAC (Adaptive transform acoustic coding), ATRAC3, AAC, MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer-III), ADPCM, and the like. A bit rate is about 64 to 400 kbps.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The BT transmission unit <b>14</b> performs best-effort-type packet communication with the radio receiving side <b>20</b> through the Bluetooth line using an ACL link of Bluetooth. As a throughput of the ACL link in the Bluetooth line, about 700 kbps can be obtained under ideal communication conditions. However, the throughput will decrease gradually depending on the conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates a protocol stack structure in the Bluetooth line. This protocol stack comprises a RF layer, a baseband (BB) layer, a link manager (LM) layer, and a L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) layer in order starting from the lowest layer. This corresponds to a physical layer and a data link layer in OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) basic reference model.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the L2CAP layer, when an error occurs (or when the error is not recovered by error correction), procedures of packet retransmission are performed between transmission and reception to realize an errorless state. In other word, if quality of the transmission line decreases, an error occurrence rate increases. In proportion to this, packet retransmission occurs frequently resulting in a decrease in effective throughput of the Bluetooth line.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again, a configuration of the radio receiving side <b>20</b> will be described. The radio receiving side comprises: a BT receiving unit <b>21</b> for receiving a packet through the Bluetooth line; a packet buffer <b>22</b>; a decoding unit <b>23</b> for decoding and decompressing the received encoded data; and an output FIFO memory <b>24</b> for temporarily storing the decoded audio signal using the first-in first-out method.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The BT receiving unit <b>21</b> performs best-effort-type packet communication with the radio transmission side <b>10</b> through the Bluetooth line using the ACL link of Bluetooth. To be more specific, when failing in reception of a packet, the BT receiving unit <b>21</b> issues a packet retransmission request to the BT transmission unit <b>14</b>. If quality of the transmission line decreases, an error occurrence rate increases. In proportion to this, packet retransmission occurs frequently resulting in a decrease in the effective throughput (as described above).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The decoding unit <b>23</b> decodes and decompresses the encoded data that has been received. The decoding and decompressing are supported by the encoding method adopted in the encoding unit <b>12</b>. As an encoding method, ATRAC, ATRAC3, AAC, MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer-III), ADPCM, and the like, are adopted (as described above).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The output FIFO memory <b>24</b> comprises buffers that are arranged using the first-in first-out method. Each of the buffers accumulates audio data, of which quantity is equivalent to for example 0.5 seconds, and temporarily stores the decoded audio signal using the first-in first-out method.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The audio signal, which has been accumulated in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b>, is read at a sampling cycle for example, and is D/A converted into an analog signal before it is audio output through the speaker. Or, the audio signal, which is kept as a digital signal without D/A conversion, is recorded in a recording medium such as MD and CD-R.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, even if the effective throughput on the Bluetooth line connected between the radio transmission side <b>10</b> and the radio receiving side <b>20</b> decreases, the radio transmission side <b>10</b> can avoid a loss of data by accumulating the real-time audio signal in the input FIFO memory <b>11</b>. In addition, even if receiving data is interrupted on the radio receiving side <b>20</b>, it is possible to prevent interruption of the audio data (frame dropping) by outputting the data accumulated in the output. FIFO memory <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Generally, writing and reading operations of the FIFO memory are controlled using a writing pointer (hereinafter referred to as WP) indicating a location, that is, an address, where the next data is written, and using a reading pointer (hereinafter referred to as RP) indicating an address where the next data is read. Moreover, a difference between the WP and the RP is equivalent to quantity of data that is currently accumulated in the FIFO memory. In other word, if the difference between the WP and the RP exceeds a memory size, data cannot be written any more, which will result in a loss of data.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Here, operation of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> and the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates processing procedures for controlling a writing pointer WP of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b>, which are used when a real-time audio signal is handled, in the form of a flowchart. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates processing procedures for controlling a reading pointer RP of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> in the form of a flowchart. Operation characteristics of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">An audio signal, which is inputted in a real time system, A/D converted at every sampling cycle, and is written to an address indicated by the writing pointer WP of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> (step S<b>1</b>). After that, the WP is incremented by one (step S<b>2</b>), and similar processing is repeatedly performed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">On the other hand, the packet buffer <b>13</b> on the output side of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> is checked (step S<b>11</b>). If the packet buffer <b>13</b> is in a state in which transmission is permitted, only one encoded frame is read from an address indicated by the reading pointer RP of the input FIFO memory (step S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">After the read data is encoded and compressed in the encoding unit <b>12</b> (step S<b>13</b>), the data is written to the packet buffer <b>13</b> (step S<b>14</b>). Then, the process will be in a transmission waiting state.</p>

However, the radio transmission device may be configured to be equipped with both of the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> and the reproduction-speed control unit <b>16</b>. In such a case, it is possible to respond to a change in the effective throughput in the Bluetooth line by adjusting both of the data compression rate and the data reproduction speed. In addition, the device configuration can also be simplified by sharing the WP reading unit, the RP reading unit, the address comparing unit, and the effective throughput judging unit between the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> and the reproduction-speed control unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> schematically illustrates another configuration example <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> of the radio receiving side. The radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is one type of a device that does not output a real-time audio signal but records an audio signal in a recording medium such as MD and CD-R. The radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> is based on the assumption that the effective throughput of the Bluetooth line decreases causing a situation in which only the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> is not enough to catch up with data receiving for data recording operation. This configuration example has a mechanism for adjusting data recording speed in a media recording unit in response to a decrease in the effective throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">There is no means for measuring the effective throughput in the Bluetooth line directly. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is so devised that the effective throughput is judged according to quantity of the accumulated data in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b>. More specifically, when the quantity of the accumulated data increases, the data recording speed is increased to prevent the quantity of the accumulated data in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> from exceeding a given value. As a result, even if the effective throughput decreases, a loss of data can be avoided, and a size of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> can also be reduced. The quantity of the accumulated data in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> (more specifically, throughput) is determined by a difference between the writing pointer WP and the reading pointer. If the radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> has a function of recording received data in a medium, recording speed should be controlled in response to fluctuations of a network line connected to the radio transmission side <b>10</b>. Therefore, judgment of throughput is required.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">As compared with the radio receiving side <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> has a configuration in which a recording-speed control unit <b>25</b> is added. This recording-speed control unit <b>25</b> comprises: a WP reading unit <b>25</b>A and a RP reading unit <b>25</b>B, which read addresses of the writing pointer WP and the reading pointer RP of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> respectively; an address comparing unit <b>25</b>C for comparing an address value of the WP with that of the RP; an effective throughput judging unit <b>25</b>D; and a recording-speed specifying unit <b>25</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The address comparing unit <b>25</b>C compares pointer addresses, which are supplied from the WP reading unit <b>25</b>A and the RP reading unit <b>25</b>B respectively, to judge which is larger.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The effective throughput judging unit <b>25</b>D judges the effective throughput of the Bluetooth line according to a difference between the address value of the writing pointer WP and the address value of the reading pointer RP.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The recording-speed specifying unit <b>25</b>E specifies data recording speed, which is used when recording data in a recording medium, in the media recording unit according to a result of the judgment by the effective throughput judging unit <b>25</b>D. More specifically, by specifying a higher recording speed in response to a recoverly in the effective throughput, data is read from the output FIFO memory <b>11</b> at higher speed to decrease the quantity of the accumulated data.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates processing procedures for controlling data recording speed, which are used when recording in the recording medium, in the media recording unit by the recording-speed control unit <b>25</b> in the form of a flowchart. Operation of the recording-speed control unit <b>25</b> will be described with reference to the flowchart as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the first place, the address comparing unit <b>25</b>C compares an address value of the writing pointer WP with an address value of the reading pointer RP in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b>, and checks whether or not quantity of accumulated data has exceeded 50% of a size of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> (step S<b>61</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">If a difference between the WP and the RP exceeds 50% of the size of the output FIFO memory <b>11</b>, the effective throughput judging unit <b>25</b>D judges that the effective throughput of the Bluetooth line has improved. The recording-speed specifying unit <b>25</b>E increases the data recording speed in the media recording unit by one stage according to a result of the judgment (step S<b>62</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">However, the numerical value of 50% does not relate directly to the points of the present invention. Therefore, an appropriate threshold value can be set as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Next, the address comparing unit <b>25</b>C compares an address value of the writing pointer WP with an address value of the reading pointer RP in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b>, and checks whether or not quantity of the accumulated data has become less than 10% of the size of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> (step S<b>63</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">If a difference between the WP and the RP becomes less than 10% of the size of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b>, the effective throughput judging unit <b>25</b>D judges that the effective throughput of the Bluetooth line is decreasing. In such a case, it is meaningless to keep high data recording. Because of it, the recording-speed specifying unit <b>25</b>E decreases the data recording speed in the media recording unit by one stage according to a result of the judgment (step S<b>64</b>). In this connection, a unit by which the data recording speed is increased or decreased can be used arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Data is written to the recording medium according to a specified data recording speed (step S<b>65</b>). After that, the process returns to the step S<b>61</b> again, and the same processing as that described above is performed repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Processing operation of the writing pointer WP and the reading pointer RP in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> of the radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is basically similar to processing procedures described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. However, as opposed to a case where an audio signal inputted in a real time system is handled, data is not always read in constant quantity at every given sampling cycle. An address of the reading pointer RP of the output FIFO memory <b>25</b>, therefore, does not always increment in proportion to time.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates how the writing pointer WP and the reading pointer RP in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> of the radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> change. However, in the illustrated example, it is assumed that medium recording speed is switched to single speed, double speed, and stop in stages for convenience of explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a difference between the writing pointer WP and the reading pointer RP becomes small as compared with the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This avoids a situation in which a mistake in recording received data, or the like, occurs. In addition to it, this can reduce a size of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> furthermore.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> schematically illustrates another configuration example <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> of the radio receiving side. The radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is different from the radio receiving side <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the radio receiving side <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>, an output FIFO memory <b>26</b> is placed in a position before a decoding unit <b>23</b>. According to such a configuration, only compressed data is accumulated in the output FIFO memory <b>26</b>. Because of it, as compared with the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where data after decoding is accumulated, the memory size can be reduced significantly. In the case of such a configuration, it is necessary to place a data buffer <b>27</b> additionally after the decoding unit <b>23</b>. However, although a size of the data buffer <b>27</b> should be taken into consideration in addition to the output FIFO memory <b>26</b>, it is possible to make its total memory size lower than that of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates processing procedures for controlling a writing pointer WP of the output FIFO memory <b>26</b> in the form of a flowchart. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates processing procedures for controlling a reading pointer RP of the output FIFO memory <b>26</b> in the form of a flowchart. Operation characteristics of the output FIFO memory <b>26</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Whether or not the packet buffer <b>22</b> is full is checked on the input side of the output FIFO memory <b>26</b> (step S<b>71</b>). Whether or not the packet buffer <b>22</b> is full depends on the effective throughput of the Bluetooth line.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">If the packet buffer <b>22</b> is full, a data frame, which is equivalent to one buffered packet, is transmitted and written to the output FIFO memory <b>26</b> (step S<b>72</b>). In addition to it, an address value of the writing pointer WP is incremented by M that is equivalent to the written data frame (step S<b>73</b>). After that, the process returns to the step S<b>71</b>, and the same processing as that described above is performed repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">On the other hand, on the output side of the output FIFO memory <b>26</b>, whether or not an output of the previous frame (for example, audio output, and recording in a recording medium) has been completed is checked (step S<b>81</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">If the output of the previous frame has been completed, data equivalent to one audio frame is read from the output FIFO memory <b>26</b>, and then transmitted to the decoding unit <b>23</b> in the subsequent stage (step S<b>82</b>), where the data is decoded and decompressed (step S<b>83</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The decoded frame is temporarily stored in the data buffer in the subsequent stage (step S<b>84</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">An address value of the reading pointer RP of the output FIFO memory <b>26</b> is incremented by a value equivalent to the read data. Then, the process returns to the step S<b>81</b>, and the same processing as that described above is performed repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">If decoded data is audio output, data equivalent to one sample is read from the data buffer <b>27</b> at every sampling cycle, and is transmitted to the D/A converter.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A through 22D</figref> illustrate operation, which is accompanied by a change in the effective throughput in the radio transmitting/receiving system <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, in the form of a time chart.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> illustrates a change in the Bluetooth line by means of modeling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> exemplifies a case where a signal is transmitted at 500 kbps. In this figure, it is assumed that comparatively light degradation of line quality occurs at the timing shown by *1, and that comparatively heavy degradation of line quality occurs at the timing shown by *2. In this connection, it is also assumed that sound is not output in the radio receiving side <b>20</b> for 0.5 seconds after sound source reproduction is started in the radio transmission side <b>10</b>, and that only data accumulation to the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22B</figref>, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>D indicate quantity of accumulated data in the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> of the radio transmission side <b>10</b>, quantity of accumulated data in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> of the radio receiving side <b>20</b>, and transition with time between on/off of output sound respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Output sound is not output for 0.5 seconds after sound source reproduction is started on the radio transmission side <b>10</b>. Data is accumulated in the buffer, that is to say, in the output FIFO buffer memory <b>24</b>. To be more specific, a transmission memory is empty in a steady state. On the other hand, a receiving memory is full.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">At the timing shown by *1, as a result that comparatively light degradation of line quality occurred, shortage of throughput is accumulated in the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> as the transmission memory on the radio transmission side <b>10</b>. On the other hand, on the radio receiving side <b>20</b>, the output sound is reproduced without interruption by supplementing with the data accumulated in the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> as the receiving memory.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In addition, at the timing shown by *2, as a result that comparatively heavy degradation of line quality occurs, the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> overflows in an example of the radio transmission side <b>10</b>. After the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> on the radio receiving side <b>20</b> becomes empty, sound interruption occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A through 22D</figref>, a part indicated by a broken line within a timing period indicated by *2 shows operation characteristics obtained when the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In this case, it is so devised that data compression rate in the encoding unit <b>12</b> is increased in stages (that is to say, data rate is decreased) every time quantity of accumulated data in the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> exceeds 50% of a memory size on the radio transmission side <b>10</b>. Moreover, it is also so devised that data compression rate is decreased in stages every time quantity of the accumulated data in the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> becomes lower than 10% of the memory size.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">It is to be noted that the compression rate may be switched, for example, at every frame cycle of encoding processing. However, how to switch the compression rate is not limited to this. Switching of the compression rate may be controlled adaptively at arbitrary time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">By changing the data compression rate dynamically according to a change in the effective throughput using the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), the data rate can be decreased before the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> overflows as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, the situation in which the output FIFO memory <b>25</b> becomes empty is avoided. In addition to it, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref>, the interruption of output sound can also be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In addition, it is possible to use the highest data rate in response to effective throughput through operation of the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b>. Therefore, data transmission of high sound quality can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">It is desirable that the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> is placed in a position before the encoding unit <b>12</b>. That is because switching of data compression rate can be reflected immediately. In contrast to this, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> can be placed before or behind the decoding unit <b>23</b>. A size of the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> can be saved by placing the output FIFO memory <b>24</b> before the decoding unit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">If an input signal source is provided not by a real time system but a recording medium system, and if variable speed reproduction is possible, a size of the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> can be reduced, or the input FIFO memory <b>11</b> can be omitted. In this case, data compression rate in the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> is judged and controlled as follows: if medium reproduction speed is controlled to be slower than standard speed, or stopped, the medium reproduction speed is controlled so that data compression rate increases; and if the medium reproduction speed is controlled to be faster than standard speed, the medium reproduction speed is controlled so that the compression rate decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">It is to be noted that, in the time chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A through 22D</figref>, effect of avoiding sound interruption during the timing period indicated by *2 can be achieved in like manner even if not the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> but the reproduction-speed control unit <b>16</b> is used, or even if both of the compression-rate control unit <b>15</b> and the reproduction-speed control unit <b>16</b> are used.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Up to this point, the present invention was described in detail with reference to the specific embodiments. However, it is obvious that a person skilled in the art can correct or substitute the embodiments within a range that does not deviate from the points of the present invention. In other words, the present invention was disclosed in the form of exemplification. The present invention, therefore, should not be interpreted in a limited manner. In order to judge the points of the present invention, “What is claimed is:” described at the outset should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">As described above in detail, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide the radio transmission device, the radio receiving device, the radio transmitting/receiving system, and the storage medium, that are outstanding and capable of transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image while keeping its data quality.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In addition, in the radio transmission system, of which effective throughput fluctuates (that is to say, it is not guaranteed) like the ACL link of the Bluetooth, the present invention can provides the radio transmission device, the radio receiving device, the radio transmitting/receiving system, and the storage medium, which are outstanding and capable of transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image while keeping data quality.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In addition, in the transmission system, of which effective throughput fluctuates like the ACL link of the Bluetooth, the present invention can provides the radio transmission device, the radio receiving device, the radio transmitting/receiving system, and the storage medium, which are outstanding and capable of transmitting a real time signal such as sound and image while keeping data quality by changing its data compression rate dynamically during a transmission period.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">According to the radio transmitting/receiving system of the present invention, even if throughput of a line decreases, real-time data can be transmitted successfully without causing sound interruption, frame dropping, or the like. Moreover, a signal of high sound quality or of high image quality can be transmitted in response to effective throughput of a line.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Concerning the radio transmitting/receiving system according to the present invention, if effective throughput of a line decreases, a loss of a real-time signal such as sound interruption and frame dropping can be prevented by using easy compression rate control on a transmitting side.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In addition, according to the radio transmitting/receiving system of the present invention, sizes of memories, which accumulate transmission data temporarily on the sending side and on the receiving side respectively, can be reduced. Moreover, it is possible to cope with instantaneous interruption of the line.</p>
