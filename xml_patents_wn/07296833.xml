<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to automobile vehicle bumpers, and more particularly, to energy absorbing vehicle bumper systems.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A known standard which bumper systems often are designed to meet is the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS). For example, some energy absorbing bumper systems attempt to reduce vehicle damage as a result of a low speed impact by managing impact energy and intrusion while not exceeding a rail load limit of the vehicle. In addition, some bumper systems attempt to reduce pedestrian injury as a result of an impact.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A bumper system typically includes a beam that extends widthwise across the front or rear of a vehicle and is mounted to rails that extend in a lengthwise direction. The beam typically is steel, and the steel beam is very stiff and provides structural strength and rigidity. To improve the energy absorbing efficiency of a bumper system, some bumper systems also include shock absorbers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The efficiency of an energy absorbing bumper system, or assembly, is defined as the amount of energy absorbed over distance, or the amount of energy absorbed over load. A high efficiency bumper system absorbs more energy over a shorter distance than a low energy absorber. High efficiency is achieved by building load quickly to just under the rail load limit and maintaining that load constant until the impact energy has been dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To improve the energy absorbing efficiency, shock absorbers sometimes are positioned, for example, between the steel bumper beam and the vehicle rails. The shock absorbers are intended to absorb at least some of the energy resulting from an impact. Adding shock absorbers to a bumper assembly results in an added cost and complexity as compared to a steel beam. The shocks also add weight to the bumper assembly, which is also undesirable since such added weight may reduce the overall fuel efficiency of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, there is a need to incorporate pedestrian protection aspects into bumper systems in cars having multiple design constraints. Design constraints can include, for example, limited package space, small bumper beam height, constrained vertical space above and below the bumper beam and the lack of space to place a suitable back support for an under-bar like structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A bumper system that includes a tunable energy absorber having an integrated underbar is described below in detail. In an example embodiment, an energy absorber of the non-foam type is attached to a beam. The beam is fabricated, for example, from steel, aluminum, or glass mat thermoplastic (GMT). The energy absorber, in the example embodiment, is fabricated from Xenoy® material and is tunable so as to meet desired impact criteria, e.g., pedestrian and low speed impacts. More particularly, the energy absorber with integrated underbar, in one embodiment, is mounted to the bumper beam on top and to the fascia mounting holes at the bottom. A connecting tower integral to the one-piece energy absorber joins the upper portion of the energy absorber and the underbar. The underbar derives stiffness from the upper energy absorber portion through the connecting tower. Because of this, the one-piece energy absorber doesn't require any support from the back for the underbar and in the process saves considerable space in an aggressive packaging environment, simplifies the design and integrates parts. The support by the underbar to the lower leg during an impact event considerably reduces the rotation of the leg and at the same time provides flexibility to restrict acceleration in a tight package space. In other embodiments, where the integrated underbar is not mounted on fascia mounts, the required stiffness for the underbar can be obtained through the tower or from a different material than the upper portion. The transition between the upper portion of the energy absorber and the connecting tower holds the two pieces together in low speed impact, but shears off in high-speed impact. In another embodiment, a stiffer, but more brittle material like a glass filled material for the underbar can also give the required higher stiffness during low speed impact, but would fail under high speed impact.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although the bumper system is described below with reference to specific materials (e.g. Xenoy® material (commercially available from General Electric Company, Pittsfield, Mass.) for the energy absorber), the system is not limited to practice with such materials and other materials can be used. For example, the beam need not necessarily be a steel, aluminum, or GMT compression molded beam, and other materials and fabrication techniques can be utilized. Generally, the energy absorber is selecting from materials that result in efficient energy absorption, and the beam materials and fabrication technique are selected to result in a stiff beam.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional schematic illustration of an exemplary embodiment of a bumper system <b>20</b>. System <b>20</b> includes an energy absorber <b>22</b> and a beam <b>24</b>. Energy absorber <b>22</b> is positioned between beam <b>24</b> and a fascia <b>26</b> which, when assembled, form a vehicle bumper. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, beam <b>24</b> is attached to lengthwise extending frame rails (not shown) of an automobile vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Fascia <b>26</b> typically is generally formed from a thermoplastic material amenable to finishing utilizing conventional vehicle painting and/or coating techniques. Generally, fascia <b>26</b> envelops both energy absorber <b>22</b> and reinforcing beam <b>24</b> such that neither component is visible once attached to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Beam <b>24</b>, in the example embodiment, is fabricated from extruded aluminum. In other embodiments, beam <b>24</b> is fabricated from roll formed steel or a compression molded glass mat thermoplastic (GMT). Beam <b>24</b> can have one of multiple geometries, including being configured as a B-section, a D-section, an I-beam, or having a C or W cross-sectional shape. The geometry of beam <b>24</b> is selected to provide a desired section modulus depending on the particular application in which the beam is to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, energy absorber <b>22</b> includes an upper portion <b>30</b>, an underbar <b>32</b>, and a plurality of connecting towers <b>34</b> that connect underbar <b>32</b> to upper portion <b>30</b>. Energy absorber upper portion <b>30</b> includes a frame portion <b>50</b> having first and second longitudinally extending flanges <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively which are used to attach energy absorber <b>22</b> to beam <b>24</b>. Upper portion <b>30</b> further includes a body <b>58</b> that extends outward from frame portion <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Energy absorber upper portion body <b>58</b>, includes a plurality of crush lobes <b>60</b> extending from frame <b>50</b> between flanges <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. Each crush lobe <b>60</b> is spaced apart from each other and includes a first transverse wall <b>62</b> and a second transverse wall <b>64</b>. Transverse walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> are rippled and include alternating raised areas <b>66</b> and depressed areas <b>68</b> which provide the transverse walls with an added degree of stiffness to resist deflection upon impact. Transverse walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> can further include a plurality of windows or openings <b>70</b>. The width and depth dimensions of the ripples, as well as the dimensions of openings <b>70</b>, can be modified to achieve different stiffness characteristics as desired. Each crush lobe <b>60</b> also includes a first side wall <b>72</b> and a second side wall <b>74</b>. An outer wall <b>76</b> extends between the distal ends of transverse walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, and side walls <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In further exemplary embodiments, side walls <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> and transverse walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> vary linearly in thickness from a first front-most portion <b>78</b> to a rearmost portion <b>80</b>. In one embodiment, the wall thickness varies from about 1 millimeter (mm) to about 7 mm, in another embodiment, from about 1.5 mm to about 5 mm, and still another embodiment, from about 2.5 mm to about 3.5 mm. In further embodiments, the thickness of the walls is constant from front-most portion <b>78</b> to rearmost portion <b>80</b> and is between about 1 mm to about 7 mm. In still further embodiments, the thickness of the walls are stepped. Particularly, the thickness of the walls of front-most portion <b>78</b> is constant and the thickness of the walls of rearmost portion <b>80</b> is constant with the walls of rearmost portion <b>80</b> thicker than the walls of front-most portion <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Crush lobes <b>60</b> are tunable in that by selecting a thickness of each portion <b>78</b> and <b>80</b>, the response of crush lobes can be altered. For example, front portion <b>78</b> of crush lobes <b>60</b> is tuned, and tunable, to absorb pedestrian leg from impact, and rear portion <b>80</b> is tuned, and tunable, for low speed and pendulum impact.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each crush lobe <b>60</b> can, of course, have any one of a number of different geometries depending on the impact energy requirements for the vehicle. Each crush lobe <b>60</b> has an axial crush mode in both barrier and pendulum impacts according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) and also has a stiffness tunability in order to meet the desired impact load deflection criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another aspect in appropriately tuning energy absorber <b>22</b> is the selection of the thermoplastic resin to be employed. The resin employed may be a low modulus, medium modulus or high modulus material as needed. By carefully considering each of these variables, energy absorbers meeting the desired energy impact objectives can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The characteristics of the material utilized to form energy absorber <b>22</b> include high toughness/ductility, thermally stable, high energy absorption capacity, a good modulus-to-elongation ratio and recyclability. While the energy absorbers may be molded in segments, the absorbers also can be of unitary construction made from a tough plastic material. An example material for the absorbers is XENOY® material, as referenced above. Of course, other engineered thermoplastic resins can be used. Typical engineering thermoplastic resins include, but are not limited to, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polycarbonate, polycarbonate/ABS blend, a copolycarbonate-polyester, acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA), acrylonitrile-(ethylene-polypropylene diamine modified)-styrene (AES), phenylene ether resins, blends of polyphenylene ether/polyamide (NORYL GTX® from General Electric Company), blends of polycarbonate/PET/PBT, polybutylene terephthalate and impact modifier (XENOY® resin from General Electric Company), polyamides, phenylene sulfide resins, polyvinyl chloride PVC, high impact polystyrene (HIPS), low/high density polyethylene, polypropylene and thermoplastic olefins (TPO).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the exemplary embodiment, underbar <b>32</b> has a C-shaped cross-section. In alternate embodiments, underbar <b>32</b> can have any suitable cross-sectional shape, for example, cylindrical, rectangular, square, polygonal, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Connecting towers <b>34</b> connect underbar <b>32</b> to upper portion <b>30</b> of energy absorber <b>22</b> and provide stiffness to underbar <b>32</b> without the need of a backing support beam. Connecting towers <b>34</b> can have any suitable shape. In the exemplary embodiment, connecting tower <b>34</b> has a substantially C-shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>. In an alternate embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, connecting tower <b>34</b> is C-shaped and further includes strengthening ribs <b>84</b>. In another alternate embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, connecting tower <b>34</b> has a substantially W-shape. In another embodiment, connecting tower <b>34</b> includes a molded-in metal backbone <b>35</b> for added strength (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The metal backbone <b>35</b> is overmolded by the thermoplastic material used to form connecting tower <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, underbar <b>32</b> can be attached to fascia <b>26</b> for stability. In other embodiments, where integrated underbar <b>32</b> is not mounted to fascia <b>26</b>, the required stiffness for underbar <b>32</b> is obtained through connecting tower <b>34</b>. Also, underbar <b>32</b> can be formed from a different thermoplastic material than upper portion <b>30</b> of energy absorber <b>22</b>. Further, the transition between upper portion <b>30</b> of energy absorber <b>22</b> and connecting tower <b>34</b> can include a design feature that holds the upper portion <b>30</b> and connecting tower <b>34</b> together in a low speed impact event, but shears off in an high-speed impact event. In another embodiment, underbar <b>32</b> can be formed from a stiffer, but more brittle material like a glass filled thermoplastic material that provide the desired higher stiffness during low speed impact, but that fails under high speed impact.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.</p>
