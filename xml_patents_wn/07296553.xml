<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims priority to Malaysian Patent Application No. PI 20054776, filed Oct. 11, 2005, which application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a balancer apparatus for suppressing vibrations in an engine and, more particularly, to a compact balancer apparatus which suppresses or cancels out inertial force and/or inertial couple forces induced by pistons, connecting rods, shafts and the like when the engine is running.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When individual movable portions of an engine become off balance during operation, vibrations occur. Such vibrations generate noise, contribute to wear, and may be felt by the operator or occupants of a vehicle containing the engine. To reduce these vibrations, a balancer assembly is typically used to cancel or suppress vibrations of the engine. The balancer assembly operates by providing vibrations opposite to the engine vibrations so that the vibrations cancel each other or reduce the overall magnitude of the engine vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The balancer assemblies include balancers that produce measured vibrations. Most balancer assemblies include at least two shafts wherein one of the shafts is driven by the crank shaft and the other shaft is driven by either the crank shaft or the other balancer. The vibrations produced by the balancer assemblies are measured for time and intensity. To effectively cancel or reduce the effect of an engine vibration, the vibration produced by the balancer assembly is timed to occur at the same time the engine vibration is expected to occur. More specifically, the vibration produced by the balancer assembly is opposite in magnitude to the engine vibration so that the vibrations cancel each other or the vibrations produced by the balancer assembly causes an overall reduction in vibrations. The intensity of the vibration produced by the balancer assembly is generally determined by the mass of the balancers, which is set by the radius and length of the balancer. Each of the balancers is generally symmetrical with one gear and an identical balance weight to provide calculated countering or suppression vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One problem with existing balancer assemblies is that the mass required to produce sufficient vibrations makes it difficult to assemble a compact balancer assembly for use in today's compact engines and engine compartments. Most balancer assemblies include balancers with radiuses or lengths that are too large to be easily configured for today's compact engines and engine compartments or are not as effective as desired in reducing engine vibrations. Most balancers are long, bulky, and heavy. Therefore, there is a need for a compact balancer assembly that has sufficient mass to provide sufficient cancellation or suppression of engine vibrations while yet fitting into compact engine compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem with many existing balancer shafts is that the long, bulky, and heavy balancers require bulky, heavy and rigid housings. With the balancers being placed in a housing, and that housing being generally placed within an oil sump, the balancer assemblies, including the housing, require a large portion of the volume of the oil sump on today's compact engines. This may require an increased oil sump size, which may cause problems in today's space restricted engine compartments. Another problem is that due to a large housing, especially when the oil sump has been designed to fit within a compact engine compartment, the maximum oil volume that can be filled into the oil sump is generally less than desired due to the large portion of the oil sump volume required by the housing. The housing for the balancers may also restrict the movement of airflow in and above the oil sump and thereby potentially causes significant power reduction in the engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to a balancer apparatus for suppressing vibrations in an engine and, more particularly, to a compact balancer apparatus which suppresses or cancels inertial force and/or inertial couple forces induced by pistons, connecting rods, shafts and the like when the engine is running. The balancer apparatus can be used on a large variety of internal combustion engines having a various number of pistons, and is particularly suited four cylinder engines and more particularly suited for inline-four cylinder engines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The balancer apparatus generally includes a first balancer having a first balance weight and a second balancer having a second balance weight, wherein the first and second balance weights are not identical. The first balancer includes a driven gear and a secondary driving gear, while the second balancer includes a secondary driven gear engaging the secondary driving gear. The second balance weight includes a primary balance portion and a secondary balance portion set back from the primary balance portion. More specifically, the primary balance portion and the secondary balance portion define a setback cutout that allows the driven gear to fit within the setback cutout when the first balancer is operationally coupled the second balancer. This interrelationship of the balancers allows for a more compact balancer assembly. Each of the balancers has a center of gravity, and when arranged in the housing, the center of gravities are aligned along the axes. Of course, because the balancer assembly creates vibrations the center of gravities alignment laterally from the axes may be different.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, claims, and drawings. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A balancer assembly <b>10</b>, mounted on an internal combustion engine (not shown) and operably connected to the crankshaft <b>12</b> of the engine, through the crankshaft gear <b>14</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The balancer assembly <b>10</b> generally includes a first balancer <b>40</b> operably coupled to a second balancer <b>60</b>. The first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> are asymmetrical and secured within a cover assembly <b>20</b>. The asymmetrical shape of the first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> allows for a compact yet efficient balancer assembly <b>10</b> for suppressing or reducing engine vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cover assembly <b>20</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes an upper cover <b>22</b>, a lower cover <b>26</b>, and a fastener assembly <b>28</b>. The fastener assembly <b>28</b> fastens both the upper cover <b>22</b> to the lower cover <b>26</b> as well as the cover assembly <b>20</b> to the engine. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper cover <b>22</b> includes a gear recess <b>24</b> to allow the crankshaft gear <b>14</b> to be coupled to the first balancer <b>40</b>. The cover assembly <b>20</b> may further include end caps <b>30</b> and bearings <b>34</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Of course, the end caps <b>30</b> may also be made integral with either the upper cover <b>22</b> or the lower cover <b>26</b>. It should be readily recognizable by one skilled in the art that the balancer assembly <b>10</b> may be formed without the upper cover <b>22</b> by making portions of the upper cover <b>22</b> integral to the engine. Furthermore, the balancer assembly <b>10</b> may be formed without the cover assembly <b>20</b> if the balancer assembly <b>10</b>, specifically the first balancer <b>40</b> and the second balancer <b>60</b>, are placed within the envelope of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As discussed above, the balancer assembly <b>10</b> includes a first balancer <b>40</b> and a second balancer <b>60</b>. The first balancer <b>40</b> includes a driven gear <b>46</b> having a driven gear radius <b>48</b> and a secondary driving gear <b>50</b>. The second balancer <b>60</b> includes a secondary driven gear <b>66</b> which operably engages the secondary driving gear <b>50</b>. During operation of the engine, the crankshaft <b>12</b> is turned through movement of the pistons within the engine thereby turning the crankshaft gear <b>14</b>. The crankshaft gear <b>14</b> operationally engages the driven gear <b>46</b> on the first balancer <b>40</b>. As the driven gear <b>46</b> is rotated by the crankshaft gear <b>14</b>, the secondary driving gear <b>50</b> operationally engaging the secondary driven gear <b>66</b> turns the second balancer <b>60</b>. The first balancer <b>40</b> includes a first balance weight <b>52</b> and the second balancer <b>60</b> includes a second balance weight <b>72</b>, to create vibrations in the balancer assembly <b>10</b> that offset vibrations in the engine thereby canceling, suppressing, or reducing engine vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first balancer <b>40</b> includes a first shaft <b>42</b> having a first length <b>44</b>. The driven gear <b>46</b> and the secondary driving gear <b>50</b> are arranged on the first shaft <b>42</b> to have a first longitudinal distance <b>45</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as the distance between the outer edges of the driven gear <b>46</b> and the secondary driving gear <b>50</b>. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first balance weight <b>52</b> is located between the driven gear <b>46</b> and secondary driving gear <b>50</b>. The first center of gravity <b>54</b> is aligned along the first length <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The first balance weight <b>52</b> may further include a stiffening rib <b>58</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The stiffening rib <b>58</b> stiffens the balancer shaft. Although not illustrated, portions <b>59</b> of the shaft <b>42</b> may be machined to revise rotational mass or adjust the center of gravity <b>54</b> to further adjust the vibration provided by the first balancer <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second balancer <b>60</b> generally includes a second shaft <b>62</b> having a second axis <b>86</b> and a second length <b>64</b>. In the illustrated embodiment and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second length <b>64</b> is approximately identical to the first length <b>44</b>, although the lengths may vary without departing from the spirit of the invention. The second balancer <b>60</b> further includes a second balance weight <b>72</b>. The second balance weight <b>72</b> is asymmetrical to the first balance weight <b>52</b> or different from the first balance weight <b>52</b>. By forming the second balance weight <b>72</b> asymmetrical to the first balance weight <b>52</b>, a compact yet efficient balancer apparatus <b>10</b> may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second balance weight <b>72</b> may be generally divided into a primary balance portion <b>74</b> having a primary radius <b>75</b> and a secondary balance portion <b>76</b> having a secondary radius <b>77</b>. If desired for balancing, the radiuses <b>75</b>, <b>77</b> may vary between the illustrated radius in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and the illustrated radius in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. More specifically, if needed, to provide additional balancing, the radius of the balancer can be larger where labeled as <b>75</b>, <b>77</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, than in FIG. <b>6</b>, because the sides of the balancer may be formed or machined to be smaller thereby giving the balance weight a somewhat elliptical rather than circular shape. The secondary balance portion <b>76</b> is designed to be cut-out or set back <b>78</b> from the primary balance portion <b>74</b> thereby allowing the first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> to fit compactly together. The set back or cut-out <b>78</b> provides room for the driven gear <b>46</b> when the first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> are assembled and rotated within the cover assembly <b>20</b> and spaced a minimal lateral distance <b>102</b> apart so that the first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> may be placed in a compact arrangement. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sum of the driven gear radius <b>48</b> and the primary radius <b>75</b> are greater than the lateral distance <b>102</b>. Therefore, the cut-out <b>78</b> allows the first balancer <b>40</b> to be placed in a closer proximity to the second balancer <b>60</b> than is possible without the cut-out <b>78</b>. Furthermore, the primary balance portion <b>74</b> may extend toward the first balancer <b>40</b> within the circumference that could be defined by the driven gear radius <b>48</b>, without interfering with the first balancer <b>40</b> when they are placed and rotated at the set lateral distance <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second balancer <b>60</b> further includes a second center of gravity <b>84</b> arranged longitudinally along the second length <b>64</b> and a second longitudinal distance <b>82</b> which extends along the second length <b>64</b> between the outer edge of the secondary driven gear <b>66</b> and the outer edge of the second balance weight <b>72</b>. For efficient and optimal operation, the center of gravities <b>54</b>, <b>84</b> are longitudinally aligned when the balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> are placed within the housing. This alignment may be accomplished by aligning the first center of gravity <b>54</b> along the first length <b>44</b> at approximately the same point that the second center of gravity <b>84</b> is aligned along the second length <b>64</b>. Even if the center of gravities <b>54</b>, <b>84</b> are not aligned at identical points along the lengths <b>44</b>, <b>64</b>, when the balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> are placed within the housing, the center of gravities <b>54</b>, <b>84</b> are aligned longitudinally within the housing. In the illustrated embodiment, the first center of gravity <b>54</b> and the second center of gravity <b>84</b> are located approximately in the middle of the first and second longitudinal distances or the first and second lengths. This arrangement allows the load from the rotating balancers to be distributed equally to the bearings on both ends. Therefore, the center of gravities <b>54</b>, <b>84</b> are generally longitudinally aligned for efficient operation when placed in the cover assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second balance weight <b>72</b> is specifically formed to align the second center of gravity <b>84</b> with the first center of gravity <b>54</b>, longitudinally when assembled into the housing, even though the second balancer <b>60</b> does not include a second gear such as the driven gear <b>46</b> on the first balancer <b>40</b>. The second center of gravity <b>84</b> is partially aligned by a second stiffening rib <b>88</b>. Even though the secondary balance portion <b>76</b> has a secondary radius <b>77</b> which is smaller than the primary radius <b>75</b> of the primary balance portion <b>74</b>, the second stiffening rib <b>88</b> is designed to compensate for the reduced mass of the second balancer <b>60</b> that only has one gear. The second stiffening rib <b>88</b> is designed to move the center of gravity into alignment longitudinally with the first center of gravity <b>54</b>. The second stiffening rib <b>88</b> includes a primary stiffening portion <b>90</b> and a secondary stiffening portion <b>92</b>. The primary stiffening portion <b>90</b> also strengthens the surface in contact with the housing to prevent the shaft from excessive longitudinal movement. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the primary stiffening portion <b>90</b> is enlarged from the secondary stiffening portion <b>92</b> thereby moving the center of gravity <b>84</b> longitudinally along or approximately parallel to the second axis. To further align the center of gravity <b>84</b> with the first center of gravity <b>54</b>, the second balance weight <b>72</b> on the primary balance portion <b>74</b> and extending into the secondary balance portion <b>76</b> defines a recess <b>80</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This recess <b>80</b> provides the final alignment of the second center of gravity <b>84</b> to compensate for the reduced secondary radius <b>77</b> necessitated by the compact design of the balancer assembly <b>10</b>. Of course, if needed, further recesses may be drilled or machined to further align the center of gravities <b>54</b> and <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The compact design of the first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> allows a fairly constant clearance gap <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> between both the driven gear <b>46</b> and the secondary balance portion <b>76</b>, and the first balance weight <b>52</b> and the primary balance portion <b>74</b> of the second balance weight <b>72</b>. The minimization of this clearance gap <b>100</b> further ensures that the balancer assembly <b>10</b> is as compact as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The balancers are generally formed by nodular cast iron. It is also possible to use powdered metal sintering process for forming the whole balancer <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> or a subassembly of the first and second balancers <b>40</b>, <b>60</b>. After the casting or the sintering process, the raw parts will be machined into shape with specified tolerance. As portions of the shaft <b>42</b> and <b>62</b> will engage the bearings <b>34</b>, it is desirable to machine these as is well known in the art to prevent excessive wear or excessive friction. The gears <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>66</b> are also machined to specification. Depending on the dimensional stability of the raw part, the balancer outer edge may be machined to provide accurate location of the center of gravity as well as accurate masses for the balancing purposes. Machining generally sets the final location of the first center of gravity <b>54</b> and second center of gravity <b>84</b> to the desired position. However if the center of gravities are not properly set after machining, further machining such as drilling a small release into the balance weights <b>52</b>, <b>72</b> may be performed to further align the center of gravities <b>54</b>, <b>84</b>.</p>
