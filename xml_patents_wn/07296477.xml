<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A composite material has a laminated structure of fiber-reinforced resin layers and films of a shape-memory alloy. A predetermined strain has been applied to each film. A damage sensor has a film of an alloy of nickel and titanium. An electric circuit is bonded to the film, and strain gages are connected to the electric circuit. The damage sensor can be laminated to the resin layers in place of the film of the shape-memory alloy. Damage to the composite material is suppressed as follows: A current is applied to the films of the shape-memory alloy, to monitor change in electric resistance of the films. The damage is located in response to the change in electric resistance. Another current is applied to a film of the shape-memory alloy for which the change is larger than the other films to generate heat for deforming the film to generate shrinking stress or shear stress to the damage.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to composite materials and a method of controlling damage to composite materials, and a damage sensor for detecting damage to composite materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Composite materials are used for next-generation aircraft, satellites, space stations, skyscrapers, public infrastructures, high-speed vehicles, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Design tolerance for composite materials is set about one-fourth of the strength which the materials have by nature because the materials are prone to damage due to impact loads.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are new types of composite materials to raise design tolerance for safety improvement. A material that suppresses damage or a sensor that detects an impact load and damage, is embedded in the composite materials.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Unexamined-Patent Publication No. 1994(6)-212018 discloses a polymer-based advanced composite material. The material has at least one type of shape-memory alloys arranged over or inside the raw material of the composite material. Each shape-memory alloy has been deformed at a temperature equal to or lower than a specific temperature at which reverse transformation completes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Japanese Unexamined-Patent Publication No. 1995(7)-48637 discloses a metal-based composite material. The material has at least one type of shape-memory alloys mixed or arranged inside the raw material of the composite material. Each shape-memory alloy exhibits thermoelastic transformation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Japanese Unexamined-Patent Publication No. 1996(8)-15208 discloses a damage detection system for composite materials. A fine wire of NiTi-shape-memory alloy is embedded in laminated composite materials. A current flows through the fine wire to detect change in electrical resistance of the fine wire, which will occur when composite materials crack, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The shape-memory alloys disclosed by the Publication Nos. 1994(6)-212018 and 1995(7)-48637 may become foreign substances to composite materials after embedded to cause false defects, thus weakening the strength of the materials.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These publications disclose usage of NiTi-shape-memory alloys as an actuator to suppress development of cracks on composite materials. Also taught is a strain gage and a piezoelectric transducer that can be used as a damage sensor. However, there is no disclosure of how to use these sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The damage detection system disclosed by the Publication No. 1996(8)-15208 uses different materials for damage detection and suppression. A shrinkage uniformly occurring to a fine wire of shape-memory alloy suppresses transverse cracks.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This system, however, hardly detects change in the characteristics of the fine wire when the change becomes small as the wire lengthens, and also hardly locates the position of damage to the composite material, which causes the change.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, this system cannot protect composite materials from delamination which tends to occur due to impact loads when the materials have a low design tolerance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the foregoing disadvantages, a purpose of the present invention is to provide a composite material having shape-memory alloys, for suppressing damage to the material, and a method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a damage sensor for detecting damage to a composite material, and a method of fabricating the damage sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides a composite material. The composite material includes at least two fiber-reinforced resin layers, and at least one film of a shape-memory alloy provided between the layers. A predetermined strain has been applied to the film.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, the present invention provides a damage sensor. The damage sensor includes a film of an alloy of nickel and titanium. At least one electric circuit is bonded to the film, and at least one strain gage is connected to the electric circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, the present invention provides a composite material. The composite material includes at least two fiber-reinforced resin layers, and a damage sensor provided between the layers. The damage sensor has a film of an alloy of nickel and titanium. A predetermined strain has been applied to the film. A least one electric circuit is bonded to the film, and at least one strain gage is connected to the electric circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Still furthermore, the present invention provides a method of controlling damage to a composite material. A current is applied to films of a shape-memory alloy provided between fiber-reinforced resin layers of the composite material. A predetermined strain has been applied to each film. Change in electric resistance of the films is monitored by the current. Damage to the composite material is located in response to the change in electric resistance. Another current is applied to a film of the shape-memory alloy for which the change is larger than the other films to generate heat for deforming the film to generate pressure or shear stress to the damage.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, the present invention provides a method of fabricating a damage sensor. A predetermined strain is applied to an NiTi-alloy film. The strain-applied NiTi-alloy film is soaked with an acidic aqueous solution to remove an oxide film that has coated the NiTi-alloy film. The oxide film-removed NiTi-film is coated with a protective film. A film of an electric circuit with strain gages is bonded to the protective film-coated NiTi-film.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A shape-memory alloy is a metal, so that its electrical resistance is decided according to the cross sectional area. Thus, a constant small current always flowing through a shape-memory alloy will change the electrical resistance when the alloy cracks inside, to cause strain locally. The damage to the inside of the alloy can be detected by monitoring the output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Output voltage variation according to the degree of damage can be stored on computer to be used as reference data for damage detection.</p>

This imbalance of stress is transformed into strain to the thin films <b>2</b> of the shape-memory alloy. The thin films are then deformed to generate change in electrical resistance. The damaged position of the composite panel can be located by detecting which of the thin films for which the electrical resistance has been varying.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">On location of damage, a current is flown through the thin film <b>2</b> that corresponds to the damaged position, to heat the film over the transformation temperature.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The composite panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is made of fiber-reinforced resin films <b>3</b><i>b </i>to <b>3</b><i>g </i>and thin films <b>2</b><i>b </i>to <b>2</b><i>f </i>of shaped-memory alloy, laminated by turns.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In detail, when the fiber-reinforced resin film <b>11</b><i>e </i>is delaminated, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the stress pre-applied to the film <b>11</b><i>e </i>and the stress caused by damage become out of balance. This imbalance of stress is transformed into to strain to the NiTi-alloy film <b>20</b> of the damage sensor <b>10</b><i>d </i>and <b>10</b><i>e</i>.

Which of the fiber-reinforced resin films <b>11</b><i>b </i>to <b>11</b><i>g </i>has been damaged can be located by detecting which of the film <b>20</b> of the sensors on which the electrical resistance has been varying.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the fiber-reinforced resin film <b>11</b><i>e </i>is delaminated, as illustrated, there will be a big change in electrical resistance of the films <b>20</b> of the sensor <b>10</b><i>d </i>and <b>11</b><i>e </i>located over and under the resin film <b>11</b><i>e</i>, and also some change in electrical resistance of the films <b>20</b> of the other sensors.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A method of locating damage to the composite panel <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is disclosed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A several strain patterns of relative values that exhibit change in strain detected by several strain gages according to the positions of damage are stored as reference patterns in an instrument of measuring and analyzing strain detected by strain gages.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The strain detected by the strain gages of the damage sensors <b>10</b><i>b </i>to <b>10</b><i>f </i>are transformed into relative values to obtain strain patterns. The strain patterns are then compared with the reference patterns, to locate the damaged position the composite panel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">For example, when the fibers of any fiber-reinforced resin film (<b>11</b><i>b </i>to <b>11</b><i>g</i>) are cut in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the stress of transverse crack to cause crack, the strain detected by the strain gages <b>40</b> that surround the crack increases. The degree of the damage is detected according to the strength of detected strain.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">When delamination occurs, the strain detected by the strain gages surrounding the delaminated portion increases, while the strain detected by other strain gages decreases. And hence, this delamination is distinguished with damage in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the stress of transverse crack. The delamination can be detected for its location and degree in the same way as for the crack made in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the stress of transverse crack.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A strain contour line map can be used as strain patterns. In detail, strain of several points on the composite panel <b>100</b> are detected. The maximum strain value and the corresponding point are detected. The strain value on each point is divided by the maximum strain value to obtain relative values (values relative to the maximum value). The relative values are stored in the strain measuring and analyzing instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A strain contour line map is then obtained by using the relative values. The strain contour line map is compared with a reference contour line map that has been obtained by simulation and stored in the instrument, to locate an exact location of damage. Or, the center of the strain contour line map obtained from the measured strain can be detected as the location of damage.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A method of estimating the location of damage is disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">For example, the location of damage on plane is estimated by using three strain gages aligned in the same direction Dir. A quadratic curve is obtained by the detected stain to find out the maximum strain point. Obtained next is a line Y orthogonal to the direction Dir. Another quadratic curve is obtained by the detected stain in the direction orthogonal to the direction Dir to find out the maximum strain point. A line X that passes this maximum point and is parallel to the direction Dir, is obtained. The intersection point of the lines X and Y is estimated as the damaged position.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The location of a transverse crack is easily estimated because the strain values of strain gages located between the crack abruptly increase.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">There are many cases where an exact location and degree of damage are not required. For such cases, the location of damage can be estimated by the strain gage that outputs the maximum strain, and the degree of damage can be estimated according to the sum of strain values detected on the periphery of the damage.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Like the damage control method for the composite panel <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the output voltage variation from the damage sensor can be stored on computer, to be used as reference data for damage detection.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">When there is a change in a strain pattern for no damage, damage can be detected by a strain gage that generates an output larger than the others, and the portion close to the strain gage or surrounded by this gage and other gages can be estimated as the damaged position.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As disclosed above, the type and location and degree of damage can be estimated according to the relationship between the electrical resistance and the type of damage, such as, transverse crack and delamination, location and degree of damage and the distribution of the electric resistance.</p>

A shape recovery function of the shape-memory alloy is used to suppress damage, thus achieving recovery of the damaged portion.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The damage control method for composite material according to the present invention monitors change in electric resistance of the films of shape-memory alloys to locate a damaged position, and applies a current to the film corresponding to the damaged position, which generates heat for deforming the corresponding film to generate pressure or shear stress, thus achieving control or suppression of damage to the composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the damage sensor has strain gages on electric circuits bonded to a film of NiTi-shape-memory alloy, thus achieving detection of damage to a composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The damage sensor is fabricated by removing an oxide film from a strain-applied NiTi-alloy film and oxidizing the NiTi-alloy by anodic oxidation to form an anodic oxide film on the NiTi-alloy film, thus improving the adhesion of the NiTi-alloy film to the film of electric circuit with strain gages.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The damage sensor is fabricated, instead of anodic oxidation, by coating the oxide film-removed NiTi-alloy film with titanium and a chemical conversion film by chemical conversion coating. This process also improves the adhesion of the NiTi-alloy film to the film of electric circuit with strain gages.</p>
