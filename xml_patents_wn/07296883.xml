<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an ink jet recording ink composition with good reliability and print quality, a high OD value, and good fixability that affords excellent smear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention also relates to an ink jet recording ink composition that affords good reliability and fixability, produces a recorded image with a high OD value that represents high print quality, and furthermore can impart gloss.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ink jet recording is a printing method in which droplets of ink are sprayed and made to adhere to a recording medium such as paper. The ink used for this purpose is generally produced by dissolving any of various water-soluble dyes in water alone or in both water and a water-soluble organic solvent. The images formed by such inks containing water-soluble dyes are generally held to have poor resistance to water and light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, an ink obtained by dispersing a pigment in an aqueous medium has excellent resistance to water and light. For instance, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications S64-6074 and S64-31881 propose aqueous pigment inks in which carbon black is dispersed with a surfactant or a polymer dispersant (Patent Documents 1 and 2). With these inks, however, if the colorant content in the ink is increased in order to raise the print density of the recorded matter, this is sometimes accompanied by a sharp increase in ink viscosity as well. Also, an excessively large amount of surfactant or polymer dispersant must be used for the carbon black to be stably dispersed in the ink, which can sometimes lead to a decrease in print stability due to foaming or a decrease in the anti-foaming property of the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve these problems, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications H8-3498 and H10-120958 have disclosed a self-dispersing carbon black dispersion in which at least a specific amount of surface-activated hydrogen or a salt thereof is introduced to the carbon black surface so that just the carbon black can be dispersed in an aqueous solvent without having to use a surfactant, polymer dispersant, or the like (Patent Documents 3 and 4). Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H10-110127 discloses a method in which sulfonic acid groups are introduced to the carbon black surface (Patent Document 5). Further, an ink jet ink containing the above-mentioned surface-modified carbon black and a glycol ether has been proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H10-95941 (Patent Document 6).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A variety of these so-called self-dispersing pigments that need no dispersant have been developed, each with its own advantages, such as those with which the OD (optical density) value increases when these pigments are used as colorants in inks, or which are easy to handle because the viscosity of the ink has been adjusted to a suitable range, or which do not require that miscibility with dispersants or various added solvents be taken into account. These pigments are generally anionic surface-modified types in which carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, sulfone groups, ammonium groups, or other such hydrophilic functional groups are bonded, either directly or via alkyl groups, aryl groups, or the like, to the surface of the pigment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unfortunately, with an ink jet recording ink composition in which a self-dispersing pigment such as these is used, the OD value is high, but the fixability of the ink to the recording medium (and particularly the fixability of the pigment in the ink) is inadequate, which is a problem in that it results in poor smear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, gloss has in recent years come to be required of images formed on special paper or other such recording media by an ink jet recording ink composition.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ink jet recording ink composition of the present invention will now be described in detail through preferred embodiments thereof (best modes for carrying out the invention).</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EMBODIMENT A</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ink jet recording ink composition in Embodiment A is used as a recording liquid that is discharged in the form of droplets from the printer head of an ink jet printer in order to form a recorded image of text, graphics, etc., on paper or another such recording medium by what is known as ink jet recording. (The ink jet recording ink composition of this Embodiment A will hereinafter also be referred to simply as “the ink composition of Embodiment A.”)</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ink composition of Embodiment A comprises at least a self-dispersing pigment, resin particles whose glass transition point is at least 10° C., and resin particles whose glass transition point is 0° C. or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Because the ink composition of Embodiment A is constituted as above, the satisfactory OD value of the image formed of the ink composition resulting from the self-dispersing pigment is maintained while the characteristics of each of the two types of resin particles with different glass transition points (Tg) are taken advantage of, which strikes a good balance between OD value and fixability in the ink composition, while particularly enhancing both the OD value and the fixability. Also, the ink composition of Embodiment A constituted as above affords good reliability, print quality (bleeding, etc.), and smear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The self-dispersing pigment used in Embodiment A is a pigment that has been treated so as to have on its surface one or more types of functional group (dispersibility-imparting group) selected from the group consisting of —COOH, —CHO, —OH, —SO<sub>3</sub>H, and salts of these, and that can be uniformly dispersed in an aqueous ink composition without the separate addition of a dispersant. The term “dispersion” as used here refers to a state in which the self-dispersing pigment is stably present in water without any dispersant, and encompasses not only a state of being dispersed, but also a state of being dissolved. An ink composition containing a self-dispersing pigment will have higher dispersion stability and afford a more suitable viscosity of the ink composition as compared to an ordinary ink composition containing a pigment other than a self-dispersing pigment and a dispersant. This allows more pigment to be contained, and permits an image of text, graphics, etc., with excellent color expression to be formed on ordinary paper in particular. Furthermore, with an ink composition containing a self-dispersing pigment, the addition of a penetrant (discussed below) that is effective at enhancing print quality will not lower the fluidity, so print quality can be improved by using such a penetrant.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The pigment that forms the self-dispersing pigment can be the same as that in ordinary ink jet recording ink compositions, examples of which include carbon black, azo lake, insoluble azo pigments, condensed azo pigments, chelate azo pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, perylene pigments, perinone pigments, quinacridone pigments, thioindigo pigments, isoindolinone pigments, quinophthalone pigments, dioxazine pigments, anthraquinone pigments, nitro pigments, nitroso pigments, aniline black, and other such organic pigments, and titanium white, zinc white, lead white, carbon blacks, red iron oxide, vermilion, cadmium red, chrome yellow, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, cobalt violet, zinc chromate, and other such inorganic pigments. Even pigments which are not listed in the color index can be used if they are dispersible in an aqueous phase. Of these, the use of azo lake, insoluble azo pigments, condensed azo pigments, chelate azo pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, perylene pigments, perinone pigments, quinacridone pigments, thioindigo pigments, isoindolinone pigments, quinophthalone pigments, dioxazine pigments, anthraquinone pigments, and carbon blacks is particularly favorable. By “pigment” is herein meant a granular solid that is usually insoluble in water, other solvents, oils, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The self-dispersing pigment can be prepared, for example, by coordinating, grafting, or otherwise chemically bonding functional groups or molecules containing functional groups to the surface of the pigment by means of a vacuum plasma or other such physical treatment or a chemical treatment. For instance, this pigment can be obtained by the method described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H8-3498. The self-dispersing pigment can also be a commercially available product, favorable examples of which include Microjet CW1 and CW2 made by Orient Chemical Industries, and CAB-O-JET 200 and 300 made by Cabot.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, the self-dispersing pigment can be prepared as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">One Method for Preparing Self-dispersing Pigment (Pigment Surface Oxidation Treatment and Sulfonation Treatment)</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A pigment is added to a solvent, and this is either dispersed under high-speed shear with a high-speed mixer or the like, or dispersed by impact with a bead mill, jet mill, or the like, which yields a pigment dispersion in the form of a slurry. While this pigment dispersion is being slowly stirred, a treatment agent containing sulfur (such as sulfamic acid, fuming sulfuric acid, chlorosulfuric acid, fluorosulfuric acid, or amidosulfuric acid) is added, the pigment dispersion is heat treated at 60 to 200° C., and the above-mentioned dispersibility-imparting groups are introduced at the pigment surface. The solvent is removed from this pigment dispersion, after which the dispersion is repeatedly washed with water and filtered by ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, centrifugation, ordinary filtration, or the like to remove the treatment agent containing sulfur and obtain a self-dispersing pigment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In terms of enhancing ink storage stability and preventing nozzle clogging, the average particle size of the self-dispersing pigment is preferably between 10 and 300 nm, more preferably between 40 and 150 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In terms of obtaining a satisfactory OD value and the liquid stability of the ink composition, the self-dispersing pigment is preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment A in an amount of 2 to 15 wt %, and preferably 4 to 10 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The resin particles whose glass transition point is at least 10° C. (hereinafter also referred to as “high Tg resin particles”) used in Embodiment A will not form a film at normal temperature, so the resin remains in the form of a solid or microparticles on the recording medium, preventing the pigment from undesirably penetrating into the recording medium, and this raises the OD value. The glass transition point (Tg) of the high Tg resin particles is thus at least 10° C., but for the effect thereof to be realized more effectively, this point is at least 10° C. but no higher than 150° C., with a range of at least 20° C. but no higher than 150° C. being particularly good.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The resin particles whose glass transition point is 0° C. or lower (hereinafter also referred to as “low Tg resin particles”) used in Embodiment A will spread out over the recording medium, and the pigment (the colorant) can be fixed on the recording medium. The glass transition point (Tg) of the low Tg resin particles is thus 0° C. or lower, but for the effect thereof to be realized more effectively, this point is 0° C. or lower but at least −80° C., with a range of −10° C. or lower but at least −80° C. being particularly good.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The glass transition point (Tg) in Embodiment A can be measured by a standard method, such as using a thermal analyzer such as a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). An example of a thermal analyzer is the SSC5000 made by Seiko Electronics. If the resin is a copolymer, the glass transition point (Tg) can be evaluated as the calculated glass transition point. The glass transition point (Tg) of a copolymer and the method for evaluating the same are as follows. The glass transition point (Tg) of a copolymer having a specific monomer composition can be found by calculating from Fox's equation. With the Fox equation, the Tg of a copolymer is calculated on the basis of the Tg of homopolymers of the monomers making up the copolymer. This is discussed in detail in Bulletin of the American Physical Society, Series 2, Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 123 (1956). The concept of the term “calculated glass transition point” as used in the Specification of the present invention encompasses the glass transition point calculated by Fox's equation. The Tg values for the homopolymers of the various monomers that serve as the basis for calculating the Tg of a copolymer by Fox's equation can be the numerical values listed in Polymer Data Handbook, Basic Edition (edited by the Polymer Society), pp. 525–546, or can be obtained by measurement according to a standard method.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In Embodiment A, examples of resins that can be used as the high Tg resin particles and low Tg resin particles include acrylic resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, and polyolefin resins, although this list is not intended to be comprehensive. These resins can be used singly or in combinations of two or more types, and the high Tg resin particles and low Tg resin particles may both be from the same family of resins, or resins from different families may be combined, but at least either the high Tg resin particles or the low Tg resin particles are preferably added to the ink composition in the form of an emulsion of resin particles obtained by the emulsion polymerization of an unsaturated monomer (such as what is known as an “acrylic emulsion”). The reason for this is that the dispersal of the resin particles may be inadequate when the resin particles are added to the ink composition in their original form, so using them in the form of an emulsion is preferable in terms of manufacturing an ink composition. From the standpoint of the storage stability of the ink composition, the emulsion is preferably an acrylic emulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An emulsion (such as an acrylic emulsion) of resin particles can be obtained by a known emulsion polymerization method. For instance, it can be obtained by the emulsion polymerization of an unsaturated monomer (such as an unsaturated vinyl monomer) in water and in the presence of a polymerization initiator and a surfactant.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Examples of the unsaturated monomer include those used in standard emulsion polymerization methods, such as acrylic ester monomers, methacrylic ester monomers, aromatic vinyl monomers, vinyl ester monomers, vinylcyan compound monomers, halogenated monomers, olefin monomers, and diene monomers.

These can be used singly or in mixtures of two or more types.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition to the polymerization initiator and surfactant used in the emulsion polymerization, a chain transfer agent, a neutralizer, or the like may also be used according to standard methods. Particularly favorable as neutralizers are ammonia and inorganic alkali hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In Embodiment A, the high Tg resin particles and the low Tg resin particles may be made into a micropowder and mixed with other components of the ink composition, but preferably the resin particles are mixed with the other components of the ink composition after first being dispersed in an aqueous medium and put into the form of an emulsion (polymer emulsion).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In Embodiment A, the high Tg resin particles are preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment A in an amount of 0.5 to 5 wt %, and more preferably 1 to 4 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Meanwhile, the low Tg resin particles are preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment A in an amount of 0.5 to 10 wt %, and more preferably 1 to 6 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In these preferred ranges for the resin particle content, the upper limit is set from the standpoint of the suitable ink jet properties of the ink composition and of reliability (clogging, discharge stability, etc.), and the lower limit is set from the standpoint of more effectively obtaining the effects of the present invention (high OD value, fixability, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In terms of striking a good balance between OD value and fixability, the weight ratio (former:latter) between the high Tg resin particles and the low Tg resin particles is preferably from 10/1 to 1/10.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0086">From the standpoint of increasing the dispersion stability of the self-dispersing pigment, it is preferable for the emulsion to be an anionic type. From the same point of view, when a pigment whose surface is cationic (such as one dispersed with a cation group by a surface treatment) is used, it is preferable for the emulsion to be cationic.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0087">The emulsion is manufactured as follows, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0106">If the surface of the self-dispersing pigment is anionic, the pH of the ink composition of Embodiment A is preferably from 6 to 11, and more preferably 7 to 10, in terms of raising the print density and maintaining liquid stability. To adjust the pH to within this range, it is preferable to add a pH regulator such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, or another such inorganic base, or ammonia, triethanolamine, ethyldiethanolamine, diethylethanolamine, tripropanolamine, or another such tertiary amine having 6 to 10 carbons. The pH regulator can be just one type or a combination of two or more, and is preferably used in an amount of 0.01 to 2 wt % in the ink composition of Embodiment A.</p>

For example, a mixture (ink) obtained by combining the various components discussed above may be filtered with a metal filter, membrane filter, or other such filter to remove particles of 300 nm or larger. Performing this treatment yields an ink composition of better reliability, that will not clog the nozzle.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0113">Also, Embodiment A provides a recording method with which an image is formed on a recording medium by using the above-mentioned ink composition. An example of the recording method of Embodiment A is to discharge droplets of the above-mentioned ink composition by an ink jet recording process and cause these droplets to adhere to the recording medium so as to accomplish printing. When the recording method of Embodiment A is performed, the ink composition can be discharged at a higher level of reliability, the print quality of the formed image is better, and the resulting image has a high OD value, good fixability, and excellent smear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0114">Embodiment A also provides recorded matter comprising an image formed on a recording medium using the above-mentioned ink composition. The recorded matter of Embodiment A has good print quality, a high OD value, good fixability, and excellent smear resistance.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EMBODIMENT B</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0115">The ink composition of Embodiment B comprises at least a self-dispersing pigment, resin particles whose average size is less than 100 nm, and resin particles whose average size is from 100 to 250 nm. (The ink jet recording ink composition of this Embodiment B will hereinafter also be referred to simply as “the ink composition of Embodiment B.”)</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0116">Unless otherwise specified, those items discussed in detail for Embodiment A above are the same as those for the ink composition of Embodiment B. Therefore, those items discussed in detail for Embodiment A above can be suitably applied to the ink composition of Embodiment B as well.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0117">Because the ink composition of Embodiment B is constituted as above, the satisfactory OD value of the image formed of the ink composition resulting from the self-dispersing pigment is maintained while the characteristics of each of the two types of resin particles with different average sizes are taken advantage of, which improves the reliability of the ink composition, imparts fixability, and also imparts gloss and smear resistance to the recorded image. Also, the ink composition of Embodiment B constituted as above allows an image of good print quality to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0118">The resin particles whose average size is less than 100 nm used in Embodiment B (hereinafter referred to as “small resin particles”) preferably have an average size of at least 50 nm but less than 100 nm, because the OD value of the recorded image will be higher and gloss further increased this way.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0119">Meanwhile, the resin particles whose average size is 100 to 250 nm used in Embodiment B (hereinafter referred to as “large resin particles”) preferably have an average size of at least 100 nm but no more than 200 nm, again because the OD value of the recorded image will be higher and gloss further increased this way.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0120">The average particle size can be obtained by particle size measurement using a Microtrac UPA150 (made by Microtrac), or an LPA3100, which is a particle size distribution measurement device (made by Otsuka Electronics).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0121">The average size of the resin particles can be adjusted, for example, by varying the conditions under which the resin particles are synthesized (such as temperature, catalyst, and surfactant) or, if the resin particles are a copolymer, the proportions (addition ratios) of the monomers that form the copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0122">The resins used for the small resin particles and large resin particles in Embodiment B are preferably types that are insoluble in water or have poor solubility in water, which increases the fixability of the ink composition to the recording medium and allows text, graphics, or other images to be formed with excellent smear resistance on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0123">There are no particular restrictions on the above-mentioned resins, but examples include acrylic resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, and polyolefin resins. These resins can be used singly or in combinations of two or more. The small resin particles and the large resin particles may both be from the same family of resins, or resins from different families may be combined, but at least either the small resin particles or the large resin particles are preferably added to the ink composition in the form of an emulsion of resin particles obtained by the emulsion polymerization of an unsaturated monomer (known as an “acrylic emulsion”). The reason for this is that the dispersal of the resin particles may be inadequate when the resin particles are added to the ink composition in their original form, so using them in the form of an emulsion is preferable in terms of manufacturing an ink composition. From the standpoint of the storage stability of the ink composition, the emulsion is preferably an acrylic emulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0124">From the standpoint of film formability at normal temperature, the emulsion preferably contains resin particles whose minimum film-formation temperature (MFT) is 20° C. or lower, and more preferably from −5 to 10° C. The MFT of the resin particles in the emulsion can be adjusted to within the above range by a method in which the Tg of the resin particles is adjusted to within the range given above, or a method in which a commercially available MFT depressor is used.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0125">The MFT can be measured with an MFT tester. An example is the MFT tester used in Embodiment C below.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0126">In Embodiment B, the small resin particles are preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment B in an amount of 0.1 to 5 wt %, and more preferably 0.5 to 5 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0127">Meanwhile, the large resin particles are preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment B in an amount of 0.5 to 5 wt %, and more preferably 1 to 4 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0128">In these preferred ranges for the resin particle content, the upper limit is set from the standpoint of the suitable ink jet properties of the ink composition and of reliability (clogging, discharge stability, etc.), and the lower limit is set from the standpoint of more effectively obtaining the effects of Embodiment B (high OD value, fixability, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0129">In terms of being able to form a recorded image that strikes a good balance between OD value and fixability, the weight ratio (former:latter) between the small resin particles and the large resin particles is preferably from 1/1 to 1/10.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0130">From the standpoint of increasing the OD value and gloss of the recorded image, the small resin particles and large resin particles preferably have a glass transition point (Tg) of −50 to 50° C., and more preferably −30 to 30° C.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0131">There are no particular restrictions on the recording medium on which an image is formed with the ink composition of Embodiment B, and any of various recording media can be used, such as ordinary paper, ink jet recording paper, plastic, film, or metal. With the ink composition of Embodiment B, an image with better gloss can be obtained, particularly when an image is formed on ink jet recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0132">Also, the ink composition of Embodiment B provides a recording method with which an image is formed on a recording medium by using the above-mentioned ink composition. An example of the recording method of Embodiment B is to discharge droplets of the above-mentioned ink composition by an ink jet recording process and cause these droplets to adhere to the recording medium so as to accomplish printing. When the recording method of Embodiment B is performed, the ink composition can be discharged at a higher level of reliability, the print quality of the formed image is better, and the resulting image has a high OD value, good fixability, excellent smear resistance, and is glossy.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0133">Embodiment B also provides recorded matter comprising an image formed on a recording medium using the above-mentioned ink composition. The recorded matter of Embodiment B has good print quality, a high OD value, good fixability, excellent smear resistance, and is glossy.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0134">The applications of the ink composition of Embodiment B, the details about the self-dispersing pigment, the pigment used, the preparation method, the ability to commercially available products, the average particle size, the content amounts, and so forth, as well as preferred embodiments thereof, are the same as for the ink composition of Embodiment A described above.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0135">Also, regarding the small resin particles and large resin particles, their structure, blend embodiments, type of resin particle emulsion (in a preferred blend embodiment), manufacturing method, manufacturing examples, components used in the manufacture thereof, method for being mixed into the ink composition, and method for measuring the glass transition point (Tg) are the same as those given for the high Tg resin particles and low Tg resin particles used in the ink composition of Embodiment A above.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0136">Furthermore, the other components of the ink composition of Embodiment B, such as water or another solvent, an acetylene glycol surfactant or other surfactant, a penetrant, a water-soluble glycol, a saccharide, a mildew retardant or preservative, a chelating agent, a pH regulator, a surface tension regulator, and a viscosity regulator, as well as other additives and the content amounts thereof, and the method for preparing the ink composition, the type of color, and the favorable ranges for pH value, surface tension, and viscosity, are all the same as those given for the ink composition of Embodiment A above.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EMBODIMENT C</heading>
<p id="p-0135" num="0137">The ink composition of Embodiment B comprises at least a self-dispersing pigment, resin particles whose minimum film-formation temperature (MFT) is at least 20° C., and resin particles whose minimum film-formation temperature (MFT) is 10° C. or lower. (The ink jet recording ink composition of this Embodiment C will hereinafter also be referred to simply as “the ink composition of Embodiment C.”)</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0138">Because the ink composition of Embodiment C is constituted as above, the satisfactory OD value of the image formed of the ink composition resulting from the self-dispersing pigment is maintained while the characteristics of each of the two types of resin particles with different minimum film-formation temperatures (MFT) (hereinafter also referred to simply as “MFT”) are taken advantage of, which strikes a good balance between the OD value and fixability in the ink composition, while also particularly increasing both the OD value and fixability. Also, the ink composition of Embodiment C constituted as above affords good reliability, print quality (bleeding, etc.), and smear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0139">The resin particles whose MFT is at least 20° C. (hereinafter also referred to as “high MFT resin particles”) used in Embodiment C will not form a film at normal temperature, so the resin remains in the form of a solid or microparticles on the recording medium, preventing the pigment from undesirably penetrating into the recording medium, and this raises the OD value. The MFT of the high MFT resin particles is thus at least 20° C., but for the effect thereof to be realized more effectively, the MFT is at least 20° C. but no higher than 150° C., with a range of at least 35° C. but no higher than 130° C. being particularly good.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">The resin particles whose MFT is 10° C. or lower (hereinafter also referred to as “low MFT resin particles”) used in Embodiment C will spread out over the recording medium, and the pigment (the colorant) can be fixed on the recording medium. The MFT of the low MFT resin particles is thus 10° C. or lower, but for the effect thereof to be realized more effectively, the MFT is preferably 5° C. or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">In Embodiment C, the MFT is the value obtained by measuring with a “Film Formation Temperature Tester” (made by Imoto Seisakusho), a “TP-801 MFT Tester” (Made by Tester Sangyo), or another such MFT measurement apparatus. It can also be measured by the method set forth in JIS K 6828-1996. The MFT can also be adjusted, for example, by controlling the Tg (glass transition point) of the resin particles, or, particularly if the resin particles are a copolymer, the proportions (addition ratios) of the monomers that form the copolymer. A film-formation auxiliary can also be added to the high MFT resin particles in order to prepare the low MFT resin particles. This is because adding a film-formation auxiliary lowers the temperature at which the resin particles form a film, that is, the MFT.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">Any organic solvent that has affinity with the resin can be used as this film-formation auxiliary, examples of which include methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, methyl carbitol, ethyl carbitol, butyl carbitol, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether and other such alkyl ethers, and benzyl alcohol, although this list is not intended to be comprehensive. Commercially available film-formation auxiliaries and organic solvents can also be used, and these may be used singly or in combinations of two or more types.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">There are no particular restrictions on the resins used for the high MFT resin particles and low MFT resin particles in Embodiment C, but examples include acrylic resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, and polyolefin resins. These resins can be used singly or in combinations of two or more. The high MFT resin particles and low MFT resin particles may both be from the same family of resins, or resins from different families may be combined, but at least either the high MFT resin particles or the low MFT resin particles are preferably added to the ink composition in the form of an emulsion of resin particles obtained by the emulsion polymerization of an unsaturated monomer (known as an “acrylic emulsion”). The reason for this is that the dispersal of the resin particles may be inadequate when the resin particles are added to the ink composition in their original form, so using them in the form of an emulsion is preferable in terms of manufacturing an ink composition. From the standpoint of the storage stability of the ink composition, the emulsion is preferably an acrylic emulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">In Embodiment C, the high MFT resin particles are preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment C in an amount of 0.5 to 5 wt %, and more preferably 1 to 4 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145">Meanwhile, the low MFT resin particles are preferably contained in the ink composition of Embodiment C in an amount of 0.5 to 10 wt %, and more preferably 0.5 to 6 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146">In these preferred ranges for the resin particle content, the upper limit is set from the standpoint of the suitable ink jet properties of the ink composition and of reliability (clogging, discharge stability, etc.), and the lower limit is set from the standpoint of more effectively obtaining the effects of the present invention (high OD value, fixability, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">In terms of striking a good balance between OD value and fixability, the weight ratio (former:latter) between the high MFT resin particles and the low MFT resin particles is preferably from 10/1 to 1/10.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0148">From the standpoint of dispersion stability in the ink composition, the high MFT resin particles and low MFT resin particles preferably have an average size of 50 to 250 nm, and particularly 60 to 250 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0149">Fixability on the recording medium and glossiness can be further enhanced by combining with an organic solvent whose solubility in water is low.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">This organic solvent whose solubility in water is low is preferably an organic solvent whose solubility in water at 25° C. is 10 wt % or less. Resin particles whose MFT is close to room temperature or higher do not readily form a film (or do not form a film at all) at room temperature all by themselves, and therefore play almost no part in fixability. However, if such particles are used together with an organic solvent whose solubility in water at 25° C. is 10 wt % or less, the solvent has the effect of promoting film formation at room temperature, and this, combined with the effect of also using the low MFT resin particles, further increases fixability. This organic solvent also has the effect of swelling the resin particles and making the recording surface smoother, which increases gloss. An organic solvent having a function such as this is generally called a film-formation auxiliary, and the function thereof is surmised to be as follows. An organic solvent whose solubility in water at 25° C. is 10 wt % or less is believed to be present in an aqueous ink composition in a form in which it is incorporated into the domain of the resin particles, which are more highly hydrophobic. If the resin particles are dispersed in an aqueous medium in the form of an aqueous emulsion, then the solvent is incorporated such that it swells the resin particles to a certain extent. Accordingly, the ink composition is more stable, and there is no major decrease in storage stability or discharge stability. When printing is performed by causing this ink composition to adhere to paper or another recording medium, the incorporated organic solvent is released from the resin particle domain by evaporating or by penetrating into the recording medium, which triggers the resin particles into forming a film and smoothes the adhesion of the resin film.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">The organic solvent whose solubility in water at 25° C. is 10 wt % or less can be any solvent commonly known as a film-formation auxiliary, specific examples of which include 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate, benzyl alcohol, dibutyl phthalate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, and triethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate. These organic solvents may be used singly, or a mixture of a plurality of types of organic solvent may be used. If there are structural isomers, the solvent may be used in the form of a monomer or as a mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">The amount in which the organic solvent whose solubility in water at 25° C. is 10 wt % or less is added will depend on the types of resin particles being combined, but from the standpoints of increasing the film formation promotion effect and increasing the storage stability and discharge stability of the ink composition, a range of 0.1 to 30 wt % with respect to the resin particles is preferable, and a range of 0.1 to 20 wt % is even better.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">Embodiment C also provides a recording method with which an image is formed on a recording medium by using the above-mentioned ink composition. An example of the recording method of Embodiment C is to discharge droplets of the above-mentioned ink composition by an ink jet recording process and cause these droplets to adhere to the recording medium so as to accomplish printing. When the recording method of Embodiment C is performed, the ink composition can be discharged at a higher level of reliability, the print quality of the formed image is better, and the resulting image has a high OD value, good fixability, and excellent smear resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0158">The present invention was described in detail above through three embodiments, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and other embodiments are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">With the ink composition of the present invention, it is possible for the two types of resin particles with mutually different properties to be resin particles whose zeta potential at a pH of 6 is from 10 to −10 mV, and resin particles whose zeta potential at a pH of 6 is from −20 to −55 mV.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">“Zeta potential” as used in this Specification is a value measured with a Zetasizer 3000 (made by Malvern).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">The effect of the present invention can also be achieved by using two types of resin particles having different zeta potentials, and in particular the present invention provides an ink composition with good dispersion stability, with no clumping or precipitation occurring in the ink composition, and with which a good OD value and fixability on a paper surface can be achieved.</p>
