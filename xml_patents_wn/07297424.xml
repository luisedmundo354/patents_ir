<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a fuel cell stack comprising a plurality of fuel cell units each composed of a solid polymer ion exchange membrane interposed between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode, the plurality of fuel cell units being stacked in the horizontal direction with separators intervening therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the solid polymer type fuel cell comprises a fuel cell unit including an anode electrode and a cathode electrode disposed opposingly on both sides of an ion exchange membrane composed of a polymer ion exchange membrane (cation exchange membrane) respectively, the fuel cell unit being interposed between separators. Usually, the solid polymer type fuel cell is used as a fuel cell stack comprising a predetermined number of the fuel cell units and a predetermined number of the separators which are stacked with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a fuel cell stack, a fuel gas such as a hydrogen-containing gas, which is supplied to the anode electrode, is converted into hydrogen ion on the catalyst electrode, and the ion is moved toward the cathode electrode via the ion exchange membrane which is appropriately humidified. The electron, which is generated during this process, is extracted for an external circuit, and the electron is utilized as DC electric energy. An oxygen-containing gas such as a gas containing oxygen or air is supplied to the cathode electrode. Therefore, the hydrogen ion, the electron, and the oxygen gas are reacted with each other on the cathode electrode, and thus water is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the fuel cell stack as described above is intended to be carried on a vehicle or the like, it is necessary that each of the fuel cell units is designed to have a large power generation area in order to obtain desired electric power. As a result, the entire fuel cell stack has a considerably large size. However, the appropriate place to accommodate the fuel cell stack for the vehicle is under the floor. It is desirable that the vehicle-carried type fuel cell stack is constructed to have a rectangular configuration with a horizontal length longer than a vertical length in which the dimension in the height direction is designed to be low. In view of this fact, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,326, a fuel cell stack is known, in which fuel cell units each having a rectangular configuration are constructed, and the plurality of fuel cell units are stacked by being interposed between separators.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the case of the conventional technique described above, a reaction gas flow passage and a cooling medium flow passage are provided on an identical surface of the separator. The cooling medium flow passage interposes the reaction gas flow passage, and it extends linearly in the direction of the long side. For this reason, it is impossible to supply the cooling water to the entire power generation surface. It is feared that the power generation surface cannot be cooled efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the cooling medium flow passage extends in the longitudinal direction of the rectangular separator. As a result, the following problem is pointed out. That is, the cooling medium flow passage is lengthy, the large pressure loss is generated, and the temperature distribution arises in the separator surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, it is conceived that a single fuel cell stack is constructed by stacking a considerably large number of fuel cell units in order to obtain desired electric power. However, the following inconvenience arises. That is, the length of the fuel cell stack in the stacking direction is considerably lengthy, and it is impossible to uniformly supply the fuel gas to the respective fuel cell units.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the above, a fuel cell system is adopted, which is constructed by preparing a plurality of fuel cell stacks and connecting the respective fuel cell stacks in series by the aid of a manifold. For example, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 8-171926, four stacks (fuel cell stacks) are prepared. Two of the stacks, which are arranged in two rows in the stacking direction respectively, are arranged in series by installing a supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like. The supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like is provided, at mutually opposing vertical surfaces at both ends, with holes for supplying/discharging the fuel and the like with respect to the two stacks respectively. Further, the supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like is formed with flow passages for making communication between the respective holes at the inside of the supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the conventional technique described above, the respective two stacks are juxtaposed and arranged on the both end surfaces of the supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like. A pressurizing mechanism is arranged on an end surface disposed on a side opposite to the supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like of each of the stacks so that the stacks are pressurized in the stacking direction. Further, an upper case and a lower case are installed to upper and lower portions of the stack. Therefore, the following problem is pointed out. That is, the assembling operation for the entire fuel cell is complicated, and the arrangement of the supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like is considerably complicated. The supply/discharge member for the fuel and the like has a large size and a complicated structure, and the production cost is expensive.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A general object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell stack which makes it possible to suppress the dimension in the height direction of an entire fuel cell stack to be low, and cool the power generation surface uniformly and smoothly.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, an oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>a</i>, a fuel gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>b</i>, and a cooling medium supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>c </i>are provided in the fuel cell stack <b>240</b>.

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the second embodiment constructed as described above, the air and the fuel gas are supplied to the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the fuel gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>b </i>from the lower portions at the both ends in the lateral direction in the fuel cell stack <b>240</b>.

The air, which is not used, is discharged to the oxygen-containing gas outlet <b>56</b><i>b </i>via the second oxygen-containing gas flow passage grooves <b>65</b>. The air is discharged from the upper portion at the both end in the lateral direction of the fuel cell stack <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">On the other hand, the fuel gas is introduced into the first fuel gas flow passage grooves <b>72</b> in the surface <b>244</b><i>a </i>of the second separator <b>244</b>, and it is moved in the direction of the antigravity while meandering in the horizontal direction. The fuel gas, which is not used, is discharged from the upper portion at the both end in the lateral direction of the fuel cell stack <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As described above, in the second embodiment, the supply side portions are provided at the lower portions of the fuel cell stack <b>240</b> for the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the fuel gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>b</i>, in the same manner as the supply side portions of the cooling medium supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>c</i>. Accordingly, the temperatures of the fuel gas and the air to be supplied can be set to be low corresponding to the temperature of the cooling medium on the inlet side. As a result, it is possible to decrease the humidifying amount for the fuel gas and the air. Therefore, it is easy to miniaturize a humidifying apparatus (not shown) for humidifying the fuel gas and the air. An effect is obtained such that it is possible to simplify the entire equipment and reduce the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The discharge side portions of the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the fuel gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>b </i>are provided at the upper portions at the both ends in the lateral direction of the fuel cell stack <b>240</b>. Therefore, when the piping (not shown), which is connected to the outlet of each of the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the fuel gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>b</i>, is arranged at a position lower than the outlet in order to avoid any counter flow of produced water, it is possible to effectively ensure the space in the height direction. Accordingly, the following advantage is obtained. That is, even when the placing surface for the fuel cell stack <b>240</b> is the floor surface, especially as in a case of the use for being carried on the vehicle, the piping on the outlet side can be arranged in an effectively lowered state for the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the fuel gas supply/discharge passage <b>138</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the fuel cell stack according to the present invention, the fuel cell unit is constructed to have the rectangular configuration having the horizontal length longer than the vertical length. The fuel gas supply/discharge passage and the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge passage, which are disposed at the upper and lower portions at the both ends in the lateral direction, are provided in the fuel cell stack. Accordingly, the entire fuel cell stack can be effectively designed to have the low dimension in the height direction. Therefore, for example, the fuel cell stack can be easily carried in the low space such as those under the floor of the automobile body.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the fuel cell stack according to the present invention, the fuel gas supply/discharge port and the oxygen-containing gas supply/discharge port are provided at the upper and lower portions at the both ends in the lateral direction. The plurality of cooling medium supply ports and the plurality of cooling medium discharge ports are provided at the upper and lower portions. Accordingly, the entire fuel cell stack can be designed to have the structure having the horizontal length longer than the vertical length. Further, the cooling medium flows from the lower portion to the upper portion. Accordingly, the air, which co-exists in the cooling medium in the mixed manner, can be smoothly discharged. The cooling medium flow passage is shortened. Thus, it is possible to reduce the pressure loss, and it is possible to avoid the occurrence of the temperature distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, in the fuel cell system according to the present invention, the supply/discharge passages for the fuel gas and the like are provided symmetrically to one another in the first and second fuel cell stacks. The supply/discharge ports for the fuel gas and the oxygen-containing gas, which are disposed at the upper and lower portions at the both ends in the lateral direction, are provided symmetrically to one another on the mutually adjoining vertical surfaces. The supply/discharge ports for the cooling medium are provided and disposed at the inner positions in the upper and lower directions and in the right and left directions. Accordingly, the dimension in the height direction of the fuel cell stack can be effectively shortened. It is possible to effectively utilize the space on the upper side of the fuel cell system. Further, the supply/discharge ports for the fuel gas, the oxygen-containing gas, and the cooling medium are provided symmetrically on the identical vertical surfaces of the first and second fuel cell stacks. Therefore, the piping operation is simplified, and it is easy to simplify the manifold structure.</p>
