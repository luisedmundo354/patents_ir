<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Quantizers of delta sigma modulators include comparators to quantize a quantizer input signal. Each comparator compares a respective reference signal to the quantizer input signal. A logic processing module determines a quantizer output signal based upon the comparison. During subsequent periods of time, a comparator offset converter alters “reference signal-to-comparator input terminal” associations to reroute respective reference signals from one arrangement of comparator input terminals of at least two (2) of the comparators to a different arrangement of comparator input terminals. The comparator offset converter can randomly alter the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations. The comparator offset converter can maintain a 1:1 reference signal-to-comparator input terminal relationship. By maintaining the 1:1 ratio of reference signal-to-comparator input terminal and randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations, the comparator offset converter effectively converts the comparator offset voltage nonlinearities into energies and frequencies that can be constructively processed and improve signal-to-noise ratios.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to the field of information processing, and more specifically to a signal processing system and method for converting comparator offset noise in delta sigma modulator analog-to-digital comparators into multi-spectral noise.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many signal processing systems include delta sigma modulators to quantize an input signal into one or more bits. Delta sigma modulators trade-off increased noise in the form of quantization error in exchange for high sample rates and noise shaping. “Delta-sigma modulators” are also commonly referred to using other interchangeable terms such as “sigma-delta modulators”, “delta-sigma converters”, “sigma delta converters”, and “noise shapers”.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) delta sigma modulator <b>100</b> that receives an analog input signal x(t) and converts the input signal x(t) into a series of low resolution, digital output pulses q(n), where t represents an instant in time, n is an integer and represents the n<sup>th </sup>sample. In general, the delta sigma modulator <b>100</b> quantizes a difference between the current input signal x(t) and an analog version of the previous quantizer output signal, i.e. q(t−1). In the feedback loop of delta sigma modulator <b>100</b>, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <b>108</b> converts each delayed (z<sup>−1</sup>) output signal q(n−1) into an analog signal q(t−1). The feedback loop of delta sigma modulator <b>100</b> also includes dynamic element matching <b>106</b> to correct nonlinearities in the DAC <b>108</b> signal q(n−1).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The noise shaping loop filter <b>102</b> processes a difference between input signal x(t) and the delayed output signal q(t−1) to generate a loop filter output signal/quantizer input signal V<sub>LF</sub>. During each output cycle of delta sigma modulator operation, quantizer <b>104</b> quantizes signal V<sub>LF </sub>to generate output signal q(n), generally in the form of digital data. When loop filter <b>102</b> is a continuous time filter, the quantizer <b>104</b> represents a relatively low-accuracy ADC converter operating at an oversampling rate, such as a rate of 64:1. Quantizer <b>104</b> can provide multi-bit or one-bit output quantization levels. The quantization level step size, Δ, represents the difference between each quantization level. One-bit quantizers have only two quantization levels specified as {−Δ/2, Δ/2} or {−1,1}. Shreier and Temes, <i>Understanding Delta</i>-<i>Sigma Signal Converters</i>, IEEE Press, 2005 (referred to herein as “Shreier &amp; Temes”) describes conventional delta-sigma modulators in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Multi-bit ADC delta sigma modulators exhibit some well-known advantages over single bit ADC delta sigma modulators such as reduced quantization noise. However, quantizer design continues to represent one of the significant challenges confronting delta sigma modulator designers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a flash-type quantizer <b>200</b>, which represents one embodiment of quantizer <b>104</b>. Quantizer <b>200</b> includes r comparators <b>202</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>202</b>.<i>r−</i>1, each having a first input connected to the output of loop filter <b>102</b> to receive quantizer input signal V<sub>LF</sub>. “r” is a positive integer representing the number of comparators in delta sigma modulator <b>100</b>. Each of the comparators <b>202</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>202</b>.<i>r−</i>1 includes a second input to receive respective reference voltages V<sub>0 </sub>through V<sub>r−1</sub>. The reference voltages serve as reference signals to quantize the quantizer input signal V<sub>LF</sub>. A resistor string reference ladder of r−1 resistors <b>204</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>204</b>.<i>r−</i>1 of value R generates uniform voltage drops across at least reference resistors <b>204</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>204</b>.<i>r−</i>1 to generate respective reference voltages V<sub>0 </sub>through V<sub>r−1</sub>. The end resistors <b>204</b>.<b>0</b> and <b>204</b>.<i>r </i>have values that can be used to scale the quantization levels (also referred to as a “quantizer step”). For example, the largest quantizer threshold may be 1.2 V, but the available reference may be 2.5 V, so resistors <b>204</b>.<b>0</b> and <b>204</b>.<i>r </i>are set to achieve the desired scale. A reference voltage of +Vref to −Vref is applied across the reference resistors <b>204</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>204</b>.r. +/−Vref is, for example, +/−1.5 Volts (V).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Each of comparators <b>202</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>202</b>.<i>r−</i>1 compares the quantizer input signal V<sub>LF </sub>with respective reference voltages V<sub>0 </sub>through V<sub>r−1</sub>. The i<sup>th </sup>comparator <b>202</b>.i generates a logical zero (e.g. 0V) when the i<sup>th </sup>reference voltage V<sub>i </sub>is less than or equal to the loop filter output/quantizer input signal V<sub>LF </sub>and a logical one (e.g. +2.5 V) when V<sub>i</sub>&gt;V<sub>LF</sub>. Once during each output cycle of quantizer <b>104</b> operation, digital encoder <b>206</b> encodes the output signals of comparators <b>202</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>202</b>.<i>r−</i>1 into a digital (discrete) output signal q(n).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Increasing the number of comparators in quantizer <b>104</b>, i.e. increasing the value of r, yields a higher quality output signal q(n) (e.g. less quantization noise) and higher signal bandwidth capabilities. Each time r doubles, delta sigma modulator <b>100</b> typically achieves a 6 dB quantization noise improvement. However, disadvantages also accompany increasing the number of comparators in quantizer <b>104</b>. For example, increasing the number of comparators requires more physical area to implement and more power to operate. Additionally, increasing the number of comparators decreases voltage spacing between adjacent reference voltages V<sub>i </sub>and V<sub>i+1 </sub>and increases the relative effects of non-idealities, such as comparator offset voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Comparator offset voltages represent the minimum direct current (DC) input voltage that would have to be applied to input terminals of the comparator to cause the comparator to transition state. Thus, comparator offset voltages can cause error in the comparator outputs, especially when the difference between the reference input signals of adjacent comparators is small. Accordingly, as the relative effects of quantizer non-idealities increase, the nonidealities cause increasing delta sigma modulator error. The non-linearity can cause harmonic distortion, especially at high signal frequencies, increased noise, and modulation of noise with the direct current (DC) input level, all of which are undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An example with the number of comparators equal to r=16 illustrates effects of comparator nonidealities. Assuming seventeen (17) quantization levels, normalized to −8, −7, −6, . . . , −1, 0, +1, +2, . . . , +8, the input reference voltages V<sub>0 </sub>through V<sub>15 </sub>to respective comparators <b>202</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>202</b>.<i>r−</i>1 scale to normalized values of −7.5, −6.5, −5.5, . . . , −0.5, +0.5, . . . , +5.5, +6.5, +7.5. Each of the actual reference voltages V<sub>−v.5 </sub>scale with the analog system reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>. For example, if level −8 corresponds to −1.5 V and level +8 corresponds to +1.5 V, then the respective comparator input voltage references V<sub>0 </sub>through V<sub>15 </sub>for comparators <b>202</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>202</b>.<i>r−</i>1 are −7.5/8*1.5, −6.5/8*1.5, . . . , +6.5/8*1.5, and +7.5/8*1.5V. Thus, as the number of comparators increases, the voltage reference spacing decreases for a given reference voltage +/−V<sub>ref</sub>. It follows that as the number of comparators increases, eventually non-linearities, such as comparator offset voltages, of the flash-type quantizer <b>200</b> eventually counteract any advantage obtained by increasing the number of comparators. Additionally, in an integrated circuit, chip area is valuable. Increasing the number of comparators requires more chip area and, thus, can become a dominant disadvantage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Despite developments in quantizer technology, ADC delta sigma modulator quantizer design can still be improved to reduce the effects of comparator non-idealities, such as comparator offset voltages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the present invention, a signal processing system includes an analog-to-digital delta sigma modulator. The delta sigma modulator includes a loop filter, coupled to the multiple comparators, to provide an input signal to be quantized. The delta sigma modulator also includes multiple comparators coupled to the loop filter, each of the comparators having two input terminals to respectively receive a reference signal and the input signal to be quantized and each comparator having an offset. The delta sigma modulator also includes a comparator offset converter, coupled to the N comparators, to reroute N respective reference signals from a first arrangement of comparator input terminals to a second arrangement of comparator input terminals to convert the comparator offsets into noise, wherein N is an integer greater than one (1).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of converting delta sigma modulator comparator offsets into noise includes receiving N reference signals on a first arrangement of input terminals of N respective comparators of the delta sigma modulator during a first period of time, wherein N is an integer greater than one (1). The method also includes rerouting the N reference signals to a second arrangement of input terminals of the respective comparators of the delta sigma modulator during a second period of time to convert the comparator offsets into noise.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further embodiment of the present invention, a method of converting delta sigma modulator comparator offsets into noise includes receiving N reference signals on input terminals of N respective comparators of the delta sigma modulator during a first delta sigma modulator output cycle, wherein each reference signal is associated with one of the comparator input terminals to form a reference signal-to-comparator input terminal association to convert the comparator offsets into noise and N is an integer greater than (1). The method also includes altering at least one of the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations during a next delta sigma modulator output cycle.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The quantizers of delta sigma modulators in the signal processing systems described herein utilize multiple comparators to quantize a quantizer input signal. Each comparator compares a respective reference signal to the quantizer input signal. A logic processing module determines a quantizer output signal based upon the comparison. During subsequent periods of time, a comparator offset converter alters “reference signal-to-comparator input terminal” associations to reroute respective reference signals from one arrangement of comparator input terminals of at least two (2) of the comparators to a different arrangement of comparator input terminals. In at least one embodiment, the comparator offset converter randomly changes the arrangement of comparator input terminals from one time period to the next time period. In other words, the comparator offset converter randomly alters the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations during subsequent time periods.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The comparator offset converter can maintain a 1:1 reference signal-to-comparator input terminal relationship, i.e., one input terminal of each comparator receives one reference signal. By maintaining the 1:1 ratio of reference signal-to-comparator input terminal and randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations, the comparator offset converter effectively converts the comparator offset voltage nonlinearities into energies and frequencies that can be constructively processed and, in at least one embodiment, improve signal-to-noise ratios. In at least one embodiment, the comparator offset voltages are converted into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise. The multi-spectral noise can be part of system dithering and is severely attenuated by the loop filter. Multi-spectral noise refers to noise having energy that is distributed among multiple frequencies with approximately equal energy levels. “White noise” is, in general, noise having energy that is approximately constant for each frequency within a given frequency range, such as 0 to ½ a delta sigma modulator sample rate.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In at least one embodiment, the comparator voltage offset reducer includes a comparator offset converter that alters the routing of reference signals to input terminals of the comparators during subsequent periods of time. The comparator offset converter includes one or more multiplexers to change which of the respective reference signals that each of the one or more comparators receives during subsequent periods of time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In at least one embodiment, the comparator voltage offset reducer includes a chopping circuit. The chopping circuit includes multiplexers coupled to the input terminals of the comparators to effectively toggle the inputs of the comparators. The chopping circuit receives a random chopping control signal to cause the chopping circuit to randomly toggle the comparator input terminals. Toggling the comparator input terminals effectively converts the comparator offset voltage into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise. The chopping control signal can be exclusively OR'ed with each of the respective comparator outputs to restore proper polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment, randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations and chopping circuits can be respectively utilized with a subset of the comparators in the quantizer. For example, in one embodiment, only reference signals to adjacent pairs of comparators are randomly altered and/or only a limited number of comparator input terminals are randomly chopped. This limited scope of randomization and chopping has lower complexity implementation but achieves only limited offset related performance improvements.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, the chopping circuit and comparator offset converter are combined to obtain an even better whitening of the additive comparator offset.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts one embodiment of a delta sigma modulator <b>300</b> with comparator offset noise conversion capabilities. Delta sigma modulator <b>300</b> includes a quantizer <b>301</b> to quantize an output signal of loop filter <b>310</b>. In one embodiment, loop filter is a j<sup>th </sup>order analog filter, where j represents the order of loop filter <b>310</b> and is an integer greater than one (1). The digital quantizer output signal q(n) is fed back through optional dynamic element matching elements (DEMS) <b>312</b> and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <b>314</b> to generate a delayed, analog loop filter input signal q(t−1). Loop filter <b>310</b> provides noise shaping to a difference between analog input signal x(t) and analog, loop filter input signal q(t−1). Embodiments of loop filter <b>310</b>, DEMs <b>312</b>, and DAC <b>314</b> are described in more detail in Shreier &amp; Temes. Quantizer <b>301</b> can be incorporated into any ADC delta sigma modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Quantizer <b>301</b> includes a comparator offset converter <b>303</b> to convert non-idealities of comparator voltage offsets of comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>302</b>.M−1 into multi-spectral noise with frequencies and energy levels that can be constructively processed by delta sigma modulator <b>300</b>, where “M” is the number of comparators. During subsequent periods of time, a comparator offset converter alters “reference signal-to-comparator input terminal” associations to reroute respective reference signals from one arrangement of comparator input terminals of at least two (2) of the comparators to a different arrangement of comparator input terminals. The arrangement of comparator input terminals refers to the 1:1 associations of reference signals to comparator input terminals during a period of time. In at least one embodiment, reference signals are randomly rerouted to different comparator input terminals during subsequent periods of time to form 1:1 associations of reference signals to comparator input terminals that differ from one period of time to the next period of time. The comparator offset voltages are thereby converted into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Quantizer <b>301</b> also includes a reference signal generator <b>308</b> to generate the reference signals V<sub>r0 </sub>through V<sub>rM−1</sub>. Each of comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>302</b>.M−1 (“<b>302</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>302</b>.M−1”) includes an input terminal to receive a quantizer input voltage V<sub>in</sub>(t). “V<sub>in</sub>(t)” represents the quantizer input signal at any instant in time t. The quantizer input signal V<sub>in</sub>(t) is generally the direct output of a loop filter, such as loop filter <b>310</b>, and is the signal to be quantized by quantizer <b>301</b>. The comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>302</b>.M−1 also each include an input terminal to receive a respective reference signal V<sub>r0</sub>, V<sub>r1</sub>, . . . , V<sub>rM−1</sub>. During each approximation cycle, the comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>302</b>.M−1 compare the quantizer input signal V<sub>in </sub>to the respective reference signals generated by reference signal generator <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon each comparison between the quantizer input signal and a reference signal, comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>302</b>.M−1 provide respective comparator output signals V<sub>c0</sub>, V<sub>c1</sub>, . . . , V<sub>cM−1 </sub>(collectively referred to as “comparison data”) that represent the outcome of the respective comparisons. In at least one embodiment, the comparator output signal V<sub>ci </sub>of the i<sup>th </sup>comparator <b>302</b>.i is a logical one (1) if the input signal V<sub>in </sub>is greater than the reference signal provided to the i<sup>th </sup>comparator <b>302</b>.i, and is a logical zero (0) if the input signal V<sub>in </sub>is less than or equal to the reference signal provided to the i<sup>th </sup>comparator <b>302</b>.i, where iε{0, 1, . . . , M−1}.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Quantizer <b>301</b> includes a logic processing module <b>306</b> to (i) receive the comparator output signals V<sub>c0</sub>, V<sub>c1</sub>, . . . , V<sub>cM−1 </sub>of each of respective comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b>-<b>302</b>.M−1 and (ii) encode the outputs of comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>302</b>.M−1 as the quantizer output signal q(n). Based on the values of each of the applied reference signals and the comparator output signals V<sub>c0</sub>, V<sub>c1</sub>, . . . , V<sub>cM−1</sub>, logic processing module <b>306</b> determines an estimation of the current value of the quantizer input signal V<sub>in</sub>(t). In at least one embodiment, the logic processing component <b>306</b> is a base 1 to base 2 encoder (unary to binary conversion).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts circuitry <b>400</b> with a reference signal generator <b>402</b>, which represents one embodiment of reference signal generator <b>308</b>. Circuitry <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also depicts comparator offset converter <b>404</b>, which represents one embodiment of comparator offset converter <b>303</b>. In at least one embodiment, reference signal generator <b>402</b> includes a resistor string reference ladder <b>406</b> of M−1 reference resistors in series to generate uniform voltage drops across each of the reference resistors. The value of the end resistors in resistor string reference ladder <b>406</b> are selected for proper scaling of the reference signals V<sub>r0</sub>, V<sub>r1</sub>, . . . , V<sub>rM−1 </sub>to achieve the desired quantization levels. In at least one embodiment, each of reference resistors <b>406</b> has a resistance of R. The value of R is a matter of design choice and depends upon, for example, the value of reference voltage Vref and properties of the particular resistors used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To generate the reference signals <b>410</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>410</b>.M−1, a reference voltage of +Vref to −Vref is applied across the reference resistors in resistor string reference ladder <b>406</b>. “+/−Vref” is, for example, +/−1.5 Volts (V). The resistor string reference ladder <b>406</b> is preferably designed, as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, to have differential non-linearity and integral non-linearity characteristics that are acceptable for the intended use of the quantizer <b>401</b>. In other embodiments, reference signal generator <b>402</b> uses other types of impedances, such as capacitors, or other circuit component types to generate the selected reference signals V<sub>r0</sub>, V<sub>r1</sub>, . . . , V<sub>rM−1</sub>. In at least one embodiment, the reference signals are generated upon request using configurable components.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The voltage signals from resistor string reference ladder <b>406</b> are applied to comparator offset converter <b>404</b>. The comparator offset converter <b>404</b> alters the routing of reference signals to input terminals of at least two of the comparators during subsequent periods of time. In at least one embodiment, altering of the routing of reference signals to comparator input terminal maintains a 1:1 reference signal-to-comparator input terminal relationship, i.e. each comparator input receives one reference signal. Additionally, the particular sequence of alternate routings of reference signals to comparator input terminals converts the comparator offset voltages into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise. The additive noise can be part of delta sigma modulator <b>300</b> dithering. In at least one embodiment, to convert the comparator offset voltages into additive noise, the particular sequence of alternate routings is random or at least pseudo-random (collectively referred to herein as “random”).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The comparator offset converter <b>404</b> can connect any of the reference signals <b>406</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>406</b>.M−1 to any respective input terminal of comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>302</b>.M−1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The routing signal generator <b>304</b> generates routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>to control the routing of reference signals to comparator input terminals. Routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>controls the input-output connections of one or more multiplexers to alter reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations during subsequent periods of time, i.e. change the particular respective reference signal that each of the one or more comparators receives during subsequent periods of time. The values of routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>are generated to preferably cause random rerouting of the reference signals. The particular subsequent periods of time are a matter of design choice. In the preferred embodiment, each successive approximation cycle represents a subsequent period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>is generated, for example, internally by routing signal generator <b>304</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or externally by, for example, a random number generator. Thus, the routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>controls the particular sequence and particular routings of reference signals to comparator input terminals. In at least one embodiment, the routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>produces a random sequence of alternate routings during subsequent time periods. Converter <b>404</b> maintains a 1:1 reference signal-to-comparator input terminal relationship, i.e., an input terminal of each comparator receives one reference signal. By maintaining the 1:1 ratio of reference signal-to-comparator input terminal and randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations, the comparator offset converter <b>404</b> effectively converts the comparator offset voltage nonlinearities into additive white noise.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a reference signal router <b>500</b>, which represents one embodiment of comparator offset converter <b>404</b>. The reference signal router <b>500</b> includes M number of M input, 1 output analog multiplexers <b>502</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>502</b>.M−1. The routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>can be represented by an M×M array of bits. The i<sup>th </sup>row of bits, {S<sub>rs.i.0</sub>, S<sub>rs.i.1</sub>, . . . S<sub>rs.i.M−1</sub>}, controls the routing of the reference signals <b>410</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>410</b>.M−1 to the i<sup>th </sup>comparator <b>302</b>.i. For example, during a first period of time, if the bits {S<sub>rs.1.0</sub>, S<sub>rs.i.1</sub>, . . . , S<sub>rs.i.M−1</sub>} of control signal S<sub>rs </sub>equal {0, 1, 0, . . . , 0}, reference signal <b>410</b>.<b>2</b> is connected to an input terminal of comparator <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>, bits {S<sub>rs.M−1.0</sub>, S<sub>rs.M.1</sub>, . . . . S<sub>rs.M.M−1</sub>} equal {1, 0, 0, . . . , 0}, reference signal <b>410</b>.<b>0</b> is connected to an input terminal of comparator <b>302</b>.M−11, and so on, during the first period of time the reference signals <b>410</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>410</b>.M−1 are routed to a first arrangement of comparator input terminals. During a second period of time, the values of the bits of routing S<sub>rs </sub>are changed (preferably randomly changed) so that the reference signals <b>410</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>410</b>.M−1 are routed to a second arrangement of comparator input terminals. The process of altering the routing of reference signals to comparator input terminals during subsequent periods of time continues so that the comparator offset voltages are converted into additive white noise.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In at least one embodiment, the values of each bit in the routing signal S<sub>rs </sub>are set to produce a random sequence of alternate routings during subsequent time periods to convert the comparator offset voltage nonidealities into additive white noise. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> show the implementation where all reference signals are flexibly re-routed. For an M signal implementation, this requires M<sup>2 </sup>analog switches in the multiplexers, and M! routing possibilities. Satisfactory results can be obtained with a subset of these routings, i.e., 16 signals can be re-routed in groups of 4, requiring 64 switches, instead of 256. In the case of 4 to 4 routing, there are 24 possible routings which maintain the 1:1 rule. A subset of these routings may be used. If 16 routings are used, there is minimal degradation in performance, but it is easier to create a random number from 0-15 than from 0-23. These design trade-off allow the designer to trade circuit complexity for performance. Even with simple re-routing schemes, the performance will be significantly enhanced beyond no random re-routing. As an example, the following routing scheme could be used. The example will be for the four (4) comparator case. “x” is set as a 4-bit random number from a pseudo-random number generator. Voltages vr<b>0</b>,vr<b>1</b>,vr<b>2</b>,vr<b>3</b> are the voltages presented to the four (4) comparators.</p>

The chopping circuit <b>700</b> includes switches <b>702</b> connected to the input terminals of the i<sup>th </sup>comparator <b>302</b>.i to effectively chop (i.e. toggle) the input signals V<sub>in</sub>(t) and the i<sup>th </sup>reference signal V<sub>ri </sub>to comparator <b>302</b>.i. Chopping control signals Φ<sub>chA </sub>and Φ<sub>chB </sub>control the toggling of input signals V<sub>in</sub>(t) and V<sub>ri </sub>by, for example, ensuring nonoverlapping conductivity of switches <b>702</b> and <b>704</b>. By randomly changing the values of control signals Φ<sub>chA </sub>and Φ<sub>chB </sub>and, thus, randomly toggling the input terminals of comparator <b>302</b>.i, chopping circuit <b>700</b> effectively converts the comparator offset voltage into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an exemplary timing diagram <b>800</b> for the chopping circuit <b>700</b> during exemplary subsequent periods of time T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. In at least one embodiment, when control signals Φ<sub>chA </sub>and Φ<sub>chB </sub>are “high” (i.e. logical one (1)), respective switches <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> conduct, and switches <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> become nonconductive when respective control signals Φ<sub>chA </sub>and Φ<sub>chB </sub>are “low” (i.e. a logical zero (0)).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During period T<sub>2</sub>, when switches <b>704</b> are conductive, the polarity of the output of converter <b>302</b>.i is inverted. Thus, during period T<sub>2</sub>, to restore proper polarity to the output of comparator <b>302</b>.i, logic processing module <b>306</b> includes logic devices such as exclusive OR gates. For example, connecting the output of converter <b>302</b>.i and the chopping control signal Φ<sub>chB </sub>to respective inputs of exclusive OR gate <b>706</b>.i, the output of exclusive OR gate <b>706</b>.i maintains proper polarity, iε{0, 1, . . . , M−1}. Used alone, the chopping technique removes quantizer non-linearity, but still exhibits noise modulation with dc level. This non-linearity removal may be sufficient improvement for many applications.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts a combined reference signal router/chopping circuit matrix <b>902</b>, which is one embodiment of comparator offset converter <b>404</b>. Reference signal router <b>904</b>, in at least one embodiment, is reference signal router <b>500</b>, and, in at least one embodiment, is reference signal router <b>600</b>. In at least one embodiment, chopping circuit <b>906</b> is chopping circuit <b>700</b>. Chopping circuit <b>906</b> receives the rerouted reference signals <b>410</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>410</b>.M−1 from reference signal router <b>904</b> and provides the toggled, rerouted reference signals V<sub>r0 </sub>through V<sub>rM−1 </sub>and quantizer input signal V<sub>in</sub>(t) to input terminals of respective comparators <b>302</b>.<b>0</b> through <b>302</b>.M−1. In at least one embodiment, the combined reference signal router/chopping circuit <b>902</b> provides improved conversion of comparator offset voltages to additive, multi-spectral noise than reference signal router <b>500</b>, reference signal router <b>600</b>, or chopping circuit <b>700</b> alone.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, a comparator offset converter randomly alters the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations. In at least one embodiment, the comparator offset converter maintains a 1:1 reference signal-to-comparator input terminal relationship. By maintaining the 1:1 ratio of reference signal-to-comparator input terminal and randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations, the comparator offset converter effectively converts the comparator offset voltage nonlinearities into energies and frequencies that can be constructively processed and, in at least one embodiment, improve signal-to-noise ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a signal processing system <b>1000</b> that includes delta sigma modulator <b>300</b>. The signal processing system <b>1000</b> is particularly useful for high-end audio applications. Signal processing system <b>1000</b> processes an input signal x(t) generated by an input signal source <b>1002</b>. The input signal x(t) may be an audio signal, a video signal, an audio plus video signal, and/or other signal type. The input signal x(t) is, for example, an analog signal generated by a microphone. Generally, input signal x(t) undergoes some preprocessing <b>1004</b> prior to being modulated by delta sigma modulator <b>300</b>. Exemplary preprocessing includes low pass filtering to attenuate out-of-band signals. Signal processing system <b>1000</b> also generally includes post-processing <b>1006</b>, such as low-pass filtering the output signals q(n). Additional post-processing can include recording of the averaged, digital output onto a recording medium or providing the averaged, digital output to a device that utilizes digital signals such as a digital audio recorder and/or player.</p>
