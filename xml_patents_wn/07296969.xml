<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a propeller system, and more particularly to a bearing system for a pitch change system therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typical propeller pitch change systems utilize a scotch yoke type mechanism to convert linear motion of a hydraulic piston into the rotational motion of the propeller blades such that a dynamic interface is required between the propeller blade pin, roller bearing and the yoke assembly. As horsepower increases, the loads imposed on the pitch change system correspondingly increase. This increase in load necessarily requires a size increase in the pitch change components due to the high contact stresses associated with the interaction of the roller bearings with the yoke assembly. Increasing roller size to reduce the contact stress to a reasonable level eventually becomes size prohibitive with regard to maintenance and assembly. That is, blade removal would be prohibited as the roller becomes too large to pass through the hub blade retention opening.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various pitch change systems avoid this sizing limitation by utilizing links with self-aligning spherical bearings which connect the yoke assembly with the propeller blade trunnion pin. Although effective, a somewhat complicated system with multiple linkages is required which may increase maintenance demands.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a pitch change system which accommodates significant horsepower, facilitates maintenance, and minimizes the pitch change system physical envelope.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A pitch change system according to the present invention includes a yoke assembly which receives a pitch trunnion that extends from each propeller blade assembly. The pitch trunnion is offset from the blade axis such that as the yoke assembly transits axially along the axis, the pitch trunnion is rotated about the blade axis to effectuate a pitch change in the blade assembly. Each pitch trunnion is received within a respective bearing assembly mounted in the yoke assembly. The bearing assemblies are mounted between a forward yoke plate and an aft yoke plate mounted to a sliding yoke shaft. A spacer is mounted between each adjacent bearing assembly to position and restrain each bearing assembly between the yoke plates.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the bearing assemblies includes a generally rectilinear outer race and a spherical inner race inside diameter to receive a pitch trunnion pin. The rectilinear outer race is retained by the adjacent spacers and the yoke plates which reduces contact stresses to acceptable levels for high load applications. A clearance is provided between the rectilinear outer race and the spacers to accommodate blade and pitch trunnion tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In operation, axial moment of the yoke assembly and movement of the pitch trunnion pin is accommodated by the bearing assemblies. The bearing assemblies articulate and translate along the pitch trunnion pin as well as permit rotation of the actuator and the yoke assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention therefore provides a pitch change system which accommodates significant horsepower, facilitates maintenance, and minimizes the pitch change system physical envelope.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a general perspective view of a propeller system <b>20</b> driven by a gas turbine engine (illustrated schematically at <b>22</b>) which rotates a turbine output shaft <b>24</b> at a high speed. The turbine output shaft <b>24</b> drives a gear reduction gearbox (illustrated somewhat schematically at <b>26</b>) which decrease shaft rotation speed and increase output torque. The gearbox <b>26</b> drives a propeller shaft <b>28</b> which rotates a propeller assembly hub <b>30</b> with a plurality of blade assemblies <b>32</b> which extend therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Axis A is substantially perpendicular to a plane P which is defined by the blade assemblies <b>32</b>. It should be understood that although a propeller system typical of a turboprop aircraft is illustrated in the disclosed embodiment, various prop/rotor systems including tilt rotor and tilt wing systems will benefit from the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a schematic sectional view of the propeller system <b>20</b> is illustrated. A main pump <b>36</b>, for actuating the various mechanism disclosed herein, provides hydraulic pressure. Main pump <b>36</b> provides a pressure indicated generally by the appropriately shaded areas and more specifically by the P<sub>subscript</sub>designations. The main pump <b>36</b> provides fluid pressure to a transfer bearing <b>38</b> through a pressure regulating valve <b>42</b> and an electrically driven control valve <b>45</b>. A high pressure relief valve <b>46</b> and a feather system <b>44</b> are also preferably located between the main pump <b>36</b> and the transfer bearing <b>38</b>. It should be understood that various actuation systems may be utilized with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Generally, by selectively communicating coarse pitch change pressure P<sub>C </sub>and fine pitch change pressure P<sub>f </sub>speed governing, synchrophasing, beta control, feathering and unfeathering of the blade assemblies <b>32</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A pitch change actuator assembly <b>40</b> contains a pitch change actuator piston <b>48</b> located between a coarse pitch actuator chamber P<sub>C </sub>and a fine pitch actuator chamber P<sub>f </sub>which are respectively supplied with coarse pitch change pressure P<sub>C </sub>and fine pitch change pressure P<sub>f </sub>such that the pitch change actuator piston <b>48</b> is axially driven by differential pressure therebetween. The pitch change actuator assembly <b>40</b> preferably includes a housing portion <b>41</b> which forms a portion of the propeller hub assembly <b>30</b> (also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The pitch change actuator piston <b>48</b> translates along axis A to drive a pitch change system <b>50</b> and effectuate a pitch change in each of the blade assemblies <b>32</b>. Translation of the pitch change system <b>50</b> pitches the blade assemblies <b>32</b> between high (feather) and low (reverse) pitch positions, also referred to as course and fine pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pitch change system <b>50</b> includes a yoke assembly <b>52</b> which receives a pitch trunnion <b>54</b> which extends from each blade assembly <b>32</b>. The pitch trunnion <b>54</b> is offset from the blade axis B such that as the yoke assembly <b>52</b> transits axially along axis A, the pitch trunnion <b>54</b> is rotated in an arcuate manner about axis B to effectuate a pitch change in the blade assembly <b>32</b>. The yoke assembly <b>52</b> is generally free to rotate about axis A but is rotationally positioned by the pitch trunnions <b>54</b> as the hydraulic pressure from the pitch change actuator piston <b>48</b> connected thereto positions the yoke assembly <b>52</b> axially along axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each pitch trunnion <b>54</b> is received within a respective bearing assembly <b>56</b> mounted in the yoke assembly <b>52</b>. The bearing assemblies <b>56</b> are mounted between a forward yoke plate <b>60</b> and an aft yoke plate <b>62</b> which extend about a sliding yoke shaft <b>64</b>. A spacer <b>66</b> is mounted between each adjacent bearing assembly <b>56</b> to position and restrain each bearing assembly <b>56</b> between the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The aft yoke plate <b>62</b> as disclosed in the illustrated embodiment is not mounted directly to the yoke shaft <b>64</b>, but mounts to the spacers <b>66</b> in the form of a backing plate for the forward yoke plate <b>60</b>. It should be understood, however, that various plate and non-plate arrangements as well as continuous and discontinuous retentions will be usable as an aft yoke-plate with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each spacer <b>66</b> is preferably fastened between the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> with threaded fasteners f such as bolts or the like such that as the yoke assembly <b>52</b> transits axially and rotates about axis A as a unit. The fasteners f, yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, and spacers <b>66</b> pull blade assemblies <b>32</b> to a common blade angle. It should be understood that the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> may also be formed directly to the sliding yoke shaft <b>64</b> and that the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and/or the spacers <b>66</b> may be internal components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each spacer <b>66</b> includes an extension <b>67</b> to restrain the adjacent bearing assembly <b>56</b> in a direction generally parallel to axis B. That is, the primary loads on the bearing assemblies <b>56</b> are generally parallel to axis A and are accommodated by the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> such that the extension <b>67</b> need just primarily retain the bearing assemblies <b>56</b> along the pitch trunnion against centrifugal forces.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the bearing assemblies <b>56</b> includes a generally rectilinear outer race <b>68</b> and a spherical inner race inside diameter <b>72</b> to receive the pitch trunnion <b>54</b>. The rectilinear outer race <b>68</b> is preferably a square shape which is retained by the adjacent spacers <b>66</b> and the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The rectilinear outer race <b>68</b> significantly reduces contact stresses to acceptable levels for high load applications.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, a clearance C (also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5C</figref>) is provided at least between the rectilinear outer race <b>68</b> and the spacers <b>66</b> generally transverse to the pitch trunnion pin axis P to accommodate blade and pitch trunnion tolerances. That is, tolerances between axis B and axis P are readily accommodated by the clearance C. It should be understood that the clearances may also be provided. The rotation of the yoke about axis A accommodates motion of the pitch trunnion <b>54</b> as the blade assembly <b>32</b> pitches through a pitch change angle between Lmin to Lmax as it pitches from Feather+(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 6A</figref>) to Top Dead Center (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6B</figref>) and on to Reverse−(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 6C</figref>). It should be understood that once the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b> is installed within the bearing assemblies <b>56</b>, the bearing assembly <b>56</b> is constrained fore and aft along axis A through the yoke plates <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> to a predetermined pitch tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 6A</figref>, the yoke assembly <b>52</b> is located in a forward position (+) such that the blade assembly <b>32</b> is located in the Feather position. The bearing assembly <b>56</b> is located on a pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b> of the pitch trunnion <b>54</b> which defines the axis P generally parallel to axis B. The bearing assembly <b>56</b> is displaced along axis P on the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b> outward from the axis A. That is, the bearing assembly <b>56</b> is slidingly located toward a circumferentially outward position relative to pitch pin <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the fine pitch actuator chamber PF is supplied with fine pitch change pressure P<sub>f</sub>, the pitch change actuator piston <b>48</b> is driven aft such that the yoke assembly <b>52</b> transits axially along axis A. As the yoke assembly <b>52</b> transits axially, the pitch trunnion <b>54</b> and thus the blade assemblies <b>32</b> are pitched about axis B to pitch each blade assembly <b>32</b> toward the Top Dead Center (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6B</figref>). Commensurate therewith, and in response thereto, the yoke assembly <b>52</b> slightly rotates about axis A and the bearing assembly <b>56</b> is displaced outward along axis P on the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b>. The rotation of the yoke assembly <b>52</b> about axis A is in response to the blade assembly <b>32</b> pitching motion to accommodate the arcuate motion of the pitch trunnion axis P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>). The generally rectilinear outer race <b>68</b>, being retained by the spacers <b>66</b>, articulates about the spherical inner race inside diameter <b>72</b> which maintains axial relationship to the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b>. That is, the rotation of the yoke assembly <b>52</b> is accommodated by the articulation the generally rectilinear outer race <b>68</b> relative the spherical inner race inside diameter <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As the fine pitch actuator chamber PF is further supplied with fine pitch change pressure P<sub>f</sub>, the pitch change actuator piston <b>48</b> continues aft and the yoke assembly <b>52</b> transits further axially along axis A. As the yoke assembly <b>52</b> continues to transit axially, the pitch trunnion <b>54</b> and thus the blade assembly <b>32</b> is pitched about axis B to pitch the blade assembly <b>32</b> through the Top Dead Center (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6B</figref>) and toward the Reverse position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 6C</figref>). Notably, the bearing assembly <b>56</b> is displaced inward along axis P on the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b> in response to the arcuate motion of the pitch trunnion <b>54</b> about axis B.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Axial movement of the yoke assembly <b>52</b> results in articulation of the bearing assemblies <b>56</b> about the blade axis B and translation up and down the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b> axis P, while maintaining a fixed radial distance to axis A. Generally, the Top Dead Center position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6B</figref>) defines the bearing assembly <b>56</b> furthest inboard position relative to the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b> while the Feather (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 6A</figref>) the Reverse position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 6C</figref>) defines the bearing assembly <b>56</b> position furthest outboard relative to the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Assembly of the pitch change system <b>50</b> is generally accomplished by locating the aft yoke plate <b>62</b> inside the hub assembly <b>30</b> prior to installing the blade assemblies <b>32</b>. The bearing assemblies <b>56</b> are placed on the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b>, then the spacers <b>66</b> are separately fastened to the aft yoke plate <b>62</b> between adjacent bearing assemblies <b>56</b>. The pitch actuator assembly <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is then installed by bolting the forward yoke plate <b>60</b> to the aft yoke plate <b>62</b>. The hub assembly <b>30</b> is then completed by attaching the dome. Notably, blade assembly <b>32</b> is facilitated as the bearing assembles <b>52</b> may be readily passed through a hub blade retention opening while integrally attached to the pitch trunnion pin <b>70</b>.</p>
