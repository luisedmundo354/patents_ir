<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A switching power supply circuit which can achieve enhancement of the power conversion efficiency is disclosed. In a composite resonance converter wherein a current resonance type converter constructed on the primary side and a primary side partial voltage resonance circuit are combined, a primary side DC input rectification circuit is formed from a full-wave rectification circuit. Further, a gap G of the core of an insulating converter transformer (PIT) is set to 2.0 mm to set the coupling coefficient of the primary winding (N<b>1</b>) and the secondary winding (N<b>2</b>) to approximately 0.81 of a loose coupling state. Further, the numbers of turns of the primary winding (N<b>1</b>) and the secondary winding (N<b>2</b>) are selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding (N<b>2</b>) is 2 V or less. With the configuration, if the leakage inductance (L<b>1</b><i>l</i>) of the primary winding (N<b>1</b>) and the leakage inductance (L<b>2</b><i>l</i>) of the secondary winding (N<b>2</b>) are increased, then reduction of the primary side current (I<b>1</b>) in a light load condition can be achieved and the switching output current (IQ<b>1</b>), (IQ<b>2</b>) can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a switching power supply circuit provided as a power supply in various electronic apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various switching power supply circuits are widely known including, for example, a switching power supply circuit of the flyback converter type or the forward converter type. The switching converters of the types mentioned are restricted in suppression of switching noise because the switching operation waveform is a rectangular waveform. Further, it is known that the switching converters are limited in enhancement in the power conversion efficiency from their operation characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, various switching power supply circuits which rely upon various resonance type converters have been proposed by the applicant of the present application. According to the resonance type converters, a high power conversion efficiency can be obtained readily, and low noise is achieved because the switching operation waveform is a sine waveform. Further, the resonance type converters have a merit also that they can be formed from a comparatively small number of parts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a circuit diagram showing an example of a configuration of a power supply circuit which can be configured based on the invention proposed formerly by the applicant of the present application. The power supply circuit adopts a self-excited current resonance type converter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The switching power supply circuit shown in this figure includes, as a rectification circuit system for producing a DC input voltage (rectified smoothed voltage Ei) from a commercial AC power supply (AC input voltage VAC), a voltage doubler rectification circuit including two rectification diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of the low speed recovery type and two smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b> and Ci<b>2</b> connected in such a manner as seen in the figure. In the voltage doubler rectification circuit, a rectified smoothed voltage Ei corresponding to twice the AC input voltage VAC is generated across the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b> and Ci<b>2</b> connected in series.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this instance, the secondary side DC output voltage E<b>01</b> is branched and inputted also to a control circuit <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As switching operation of the power supply circuit having the configuration described above, when a commercial AC power supply is made available first, starting current is supplied to the base of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>, for example, through the starting resistors RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b>, and, for example, if the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on first, then the switching element Q<b>2</b> is controlled so as to be turned off. Then, resonance current flows as an output of the switching element Q<b>1</b> through the resonance current detection winding NA→primary winding N<b>1</b>→primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>. The switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are controlled so that the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on and the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes zero. Then, resonance current in the reverse direction flows through the switching element Q<b>2</b>. Thereafter, self-excited switching operation wherein the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are turned on alternately is started.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> repeat on/off operations alternately using the terminal voltage of the smoothing capacitor Ci as an operation power supply in this manner, drive current having a waveform proximate to a resonance current waveform is supplied to the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT and an alternating output is obtained at the secondary windings N<b>2</b> and N<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The constant voltage control by the orthogonal control transformer PRT is performed in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, if the secondary side DC output voltage E<b>01</b> is varied by a variation of the AC input voltage or the load power, then the control circuit <b>1</b> variably controls the level of the control current to flow to the control winding NC in response to the variation of the secondary side DC output voltage E<b>01</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By an influence of magnetic fluxes which are generated in the orthogonal control transformer PRT by the control current, the state of a saturation tendency of the orthogonal control transformer PRT changes, which acts to vary the inductance of the driving windings NB<b>1</b> and NB<b>2</b>. As a result, the conditions of the self-excited oscillation circuit are varied to control the switching frequency fs to vary.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the power supply circuit shown in the figure, the switching frequency fs is set in a frequency region higher than the resonance frequency of the series resonance circuit of the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and the primary winding N<b>1</b>, and, for example, if the switching frequency fs becomes higher, then the switching frequency fs is spaced away from the resonance frequency of the series resonance circuit. Consequently, the resonance impedance of the primary side series resonance circuit to the switching output becomes higher.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since the resonance impedance becomes higher in this manner, the drive current to be supplied to the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the primary side series resonance circuit is suppressed, and as a result, the secondary side DC output voltage is suppressed thereby to achieve constant voltage control.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, if the commercial AC power supply is made available and starting current is supplied, for example, through the starting resistor RS<b>1</b> to the base of the switching element Q<b>1</b> to turn on the switching element Q<b>1</b>, then the switching element Q<b>2</b> is controlled so as to be turned off. Then, as an output of the switching element Q<b>1</b>, resonance current flows along the primary winding N<b>1</b>→primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>, and the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are controlled such that the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on while the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off in the proximity of a point of time when the resonance current becomes equal to zero. Thereafter, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are controlled so as to be alternately turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Consequently, within a period TON within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is on and another period TOFF within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is off, the collector-emitter voltage VQ<b>2</b> of the switching element Q<b>2</b> has such a waveform as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, and switching current IQ<b>2</b> having such a waveform as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> flows to the collector of the switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In response to the switching operations of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing to the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> has a sine waveform according to the switching period as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.

An alternating voltage is excited also in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> by an alternating voltage generated in accordance with current flowing through the primary winding N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, in response to the alternating voltage generated in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> in such a manner as described above, such a waveform as shown in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is obtained as that of an inter-terminal voltage V<b>2</b> between the input terminal of the positive electrode side and the input terminal of the negative electrode side of the bridge rectification circuit DBR connected to the secondary winding N<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this instance, the collector-emitter voltage VQ<b>2</b> of the switching element Q<b>12</b> within a period TON within which the switching element Q<b>12</b> is on and another period TOFF within which the switching element Q<b>12</b> is off has such a waveform as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, and switching current IQ<b>2</b> having such a waveform as shown in (b) of FIG. <b>27</b> flows to the collector of the switching element Q<b>12</b>. In this instance, as can be seen from comparison with the waveform shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the period A exhibits an expansion.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows variation characteristics of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC), switching frequency fs and switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> with respect to a load power variation of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Here, the characteristics under the conditions of the AC input voltage VAC=100 V and the load power Po=0 W to 125 W are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this instance, it can be seen that the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) has a tendency that it increases as the load increases. In particular, although the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) in this instance is, for example, approximately 92% when the load power Po is Po=125 W, when the load power Po ix Po=50 W, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) drops to approximately 89%, and when the load power Po is Po=25 W, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) further drops to approximately 82.5%. In this instance, the AC input power in the no-load condition is 4.2 W.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Meanwhile, the switching frequency fs has a tendency that it increases proportionally as the load decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, the peak values of the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> when the load power Po is Po=125 W is 3.5 Ap, and the peak values of the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> when the load power Po is Po=25 W is 3.0 Ap.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the configuration of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, when the load power Po is Po=25 W, resonance current of the positive polarity is caused to flow by the leakage inductance component L<b>1</b><i>l </i>(L<b>1</b><i>l</i>=42 μH) of the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the capacitance of the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>, and the period B within which power transmission to the load side is performed becomes shorter. Then, the power non-transmission period A within which sawtooth waveform current of the negative polarity is caused to flow by the exciting inductance L<b>1</b> (L<b>1</b>=165 μH) of the primary winding N<b>1</b> becomes longer. As a result, with the power supply circuit of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) in a low load condition drops.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is to be noted that the measurement results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 to 28</figref> are obtained by selecting part elements of the power supply circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">First, with regard to the insulating converter transformer PIT, the gap G is set to G=1.0 mm to select the coupling coefficient k of k=0.87. Then, the primary winding N<b>1</b>=24 T, secondary winding N<b>2</b>=23 T+23 T, and tertiary winding N<b>4</b>=2 T are wound.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>=0.068 μF and the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp=470 μF are selected.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is to be noted that, as another related art relating to the present invention, for example, the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 8-066025 can be listed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Incidentally, with a power supply circuit constructed as a current resonance type converter of the half bridge type so as to obtain a DC input voltage by means of a full-wave rectification circuit, there is a limitation to enhancement of the power conversion efficiency. More particularly, the load power with which a power conversion efficiency of approximately 92% can be assured is approximately 120 W in the maximum. For example, within a range of the load power of 125 W to 150 W in a heavier load condition, the power conversion efficiency is equal to or lower than 92%.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Therefore, if it is tried to obtain a higher power conversion efficiency with a power supply circuit which can cope with, for example, maximum load power of 150 W or more, then the power supply circuit is configured so as to obtain a DC input voltage by means of a voltage doubler rectification circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. By the configuration, the power conversion efficiency can be enhanced to approximately 93%. However, in this instance, it is necessary to incorporate two smoothing capacitors in the voltage doubler rectification circuit, and the part cost becomes higher as the voltage withstanding property of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> and the resonance capacitors increases.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, as a problem common to the related art power supply circuits described above, particularly the power conversion efficiency drops as the load power decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, taking the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> as an example, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) is approximately 89% when the load power Po is Po=50 W and approximately 82.5% when the load power Po is Po=25 W. Also in a no-load condition wherein the load power Po is Po=0 W, the AC input power is approximately 4.2 W.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this manner, for the composite resonance type converters which include a current resonance type converter described above as the related art converters, a higher power conversion efficiency is demanded within a range from a heavy load condition to a light load condition.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, according to the present invention, taking the subject described above into consideration, a switching power supply circuit is configured in the following manner.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to the configuration described above, the switching power supply circuit of the present invention has a basic configuration as a composite resonance type converter wherein a current resonance type switching converter and a primary side partial voltage resonance circuit are combined on the primary side. In addition, a gap of a predetermined length or more is formed in the core of the converter transformer such that the primary winding and the secondary winding have a loose coupling state with a coupling coefficient equal to or lower than a required value. Further, the numbers of turns of the primary winding and the secondary winding are selected such that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding is set to a voltage with which secondary side current to flow through the secondary side of the converter transformer exhibits a continuous operation mode. Consequently, since the primary side series resonance current to flow through the primary winding can be reduced together with a decrease of the load power, reduction of the power loss on the primary side can be achieved and enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, the switching power supply circuit of the present invention can be constructed in the following manner.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">By a partial voltage resonance action of the partial voltage resonance circuit, also the waveform of the primary side series resonance current to flow through the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> can be made an M-shaped waveform, and the current waveform of the current flowing through the switching element can be made an M-shaped waveform. Consequently, the peak level of the primary side series resonance current to flow through the primary side or the current to flow through the switching element where the load power is within a range from 200 W to 0 W can be lowered, and enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency can be achieved.</p>

It is to be noted that the windings are wound in such winding directions that voltages of the same polarity are excited in the driving winding NB<b>1</b> and the driving winding NB<b>4</b> and in the driving winding NB<b>2</b> and the driving winding NB<b>3</b> and besides voltages of the opposite polarities are excited in the driving winding NB<b>1</b> and the driving winding NB<b>2</b> and in the driving winding NB<b>3</b> and the driving winding NB<b>4</b>. The number of turns (turn number) of the resonance current detection winding NA is, for example, approximately 1 T (turn).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In this instance, since a switching output obtained at the resonance current detection winding NA of the drive transformer PRT is induced in the driving windings NB<b>1</b> to NB<b>4</b> through a transformer coupling, an alternating voltage as a drive voltage is generated in the driving windings NB<b>1</b> to NB<b>4</b>. This drive voltage is outputted as drive current from each series resonance circuit which forms a self-oscillation drive circuit to the base of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> through the base current limiting resistors RB<b>1</b> to RB<b>4</b>. Consequently, each of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> performs switching operation in a switching frequency determined by the resonance frequency of the series resonance circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The insulating converter transformer PIT transmits the switching outputs of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> to the secondary side.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT is connected at one end thereof to a node between the emitter of the switching element Q<b>1</b> and the collector of the switching element Q<b>2</b> through the series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and the resonance current detection winding NA. The primary winding N<b>1</b> is connected at the other end thereof to a node between the emitter of the switching element Q<b>3</b> and the collector of the switching element Q<b>4</b>. Consequently, a switching output is obtained at the primary winding N<b>1</b> as the set of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> and the set of the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> alternately perform switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Further, the capacitance of the series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and the leakage inductance component of the insulating converter transformer PIT including the inductance component of the primary winding N<b>1</b> form a primary side series resonance circuit for making operation of the primary side switching converter as that of the current resonance type.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In this manner, with the primary side switching converter shown in the figure, operation of the current resonance type and partial voltage resonance operation described above are obtained compositely.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The switching operation of the present power supply circuit is, for example, such as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">First, if the commercial AC power supply AC is made available, then base current for starting is supplied to the base of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b>, for example, through the starting resistors RS<b>1</b> to RS<b>4</b>. Here, since voltages of the opposite polarities to each other are excited, for example, in the driving windings NB<b>1</b> and NB<b>4</b> and the driving windings NB<b>2</b> and NB<b>3</b> of the drive transformer PRT, if the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned on first, then the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are controlled so as to be turned off. Then, the self-oscillation driving circuits of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> perform self-oscillation operation by resonance operation using the alternating voltages excited in the driving windings NB<b>1</b> to NB<b>4</b> as sources. Consequently, the set of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> and the set of the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are controlled so as to be turned on/off alternately. In other words, they perform switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Then, for example, when the switching elements Q<b>1</b> are Q<b>4</b> are on, resonance current flows, as a switching output of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b>, to the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> through the resonance current detection winding NA. Then, in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes “0”, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned off and the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are turned on. Consequently, resonance current flows in the opposite direction through the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b>. Thereafter, self-excited switching operation wherein the set of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> and the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are alternately turned on by ZVS and ZCS is repeated. Further, when the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> perform turn-on/off operation, current flows through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitors Cp<b>1</b> and Cp<b>2</b> within a short period of time upon turning on and turning off of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b>. In other words, partial resonance operation is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Although a detailed structure is hereinafter described, a gap G of 1.5 mm or more is formed in a central magnetic leg of a core which forms the insulating converter transformer PIT.

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A bridge rectification circuit DBR and a smoothing capacitor C<b>01</b> are connected in such a manner as seen in the figure to the secondary winding N<b>2</b> to form a full-wave rectification circuit.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Further, on the secondary side, the secondary winding N<b>3</b> is wound further. The secondary winding N<b>3</b> is connected at a center tap point thereof to the secondary side ground. Further, the secondary winding N<b>3</b> is connected at one end thereof to the anode of a diode D<b>01</b> and at the other end thereof to another diode D<b>02</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The cathodes of the diodes D<b>01</b> and D<b>02</b> are connected to the positive electrode side of the smoothing capacitor C<b>02</b> thereby to form a full-wave rectification smoothing circuit to obtain a secondary side DC output voltage E<b>02</b> which is, for example, a low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The control circuit <b>1</b> varies the control current (DC current) level to be supplied to the control winding NC in response to a level variation of the secondary side DC output voltage E<b>01</b> to variably control the inductances LB<b>1</b> to LB<b>4</b> of the driving windings NB<b>1</b> to NB<b>4</b> wound on the drive transformer PRT. Consequently, the resonance condition of a series resonance circuit in each self-oscillation driving circuit is varied by the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> formed including the inductances LB<b>1</b> to LB<b>4</b> of the driving windings NB<b>1</b> to NB<b>4</b> to vary the switching frequency of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> to achieve stabilization of the secondary side DC output voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0178">It is to be noted that, when to obtain the measurement results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, part elements of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are selected in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">First, as regards the insulating converter transformer PIT, the gap G is set to G=1.5 mm to select the coupling coefficient k=0.81. Further, the primary winding N<b>1</b>=20 T, secondary winding N<b>2</b>=75 T, exciting inductance L<b>1</b>=95 μH, leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l</i>=32 μH, exciting inductance L<b>2</b>=950 μH, and leakage inductance L<b>2</b><i>l</i>=318 μH are selected. Further, the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>=0.092 μF is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, operation of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> of the power supply circuit is indicated by the collector-emitter voltage VQ<b>1</b> of the switching element Q<b>1</b> illustrated in (a) of the figure, switching current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>4</b> illustrated in (c) of the figure and the switching current IQ<b>2</b> and IQ<b>3</b> illustrated in (d) of the figure. In this instance, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> perform switching operation such that they exhibit an on state within a period TON and exhibit an off state within a period TOFF.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Here, if the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned on, then resonance current flows along a path of the switching element Q<b>1</b>→primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>→primary winding N<b>1</b>→switching element Q<b>4</b>. Then, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> are controlled such that the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are turned on and the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned off in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes equal to zero. Consequently, the resonance current flows along a path of the switching element Q<b>3</b>→primary winding N<b>1</b>→primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>→switching element Q<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> are controlled such that the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> and the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are turned on alternately.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Further, through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp<b>1</b> connected in parallel to the switching element Q<b>2</b>, such resonance current ICP as illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> flows within a short period of time within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on or turned off. Further, though not shown in the figure, also through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp<b>2</b> connected to the switching element Q<b>4</b>, partial resonance current flows within a short period of time within which the switching element Q<b>4</b> is turned on or turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Consequently, switching current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>4</b> flowing through the collector-emitter of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> has such a waveform as illustrated in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Further, the switching current IQ<b>2</b> and IQ<b>3</b> flowing through the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> has a waveform having a phase displaced by 180 degrees from that of the switching current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>4</b> and has such a waveform as shown in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In this instance, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> has such a sine waveform as shown in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> in the negative direction flows through the switching element Q<b>1</b> while the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> in the positive direction flows through the switching element Q<b>2</b>. In other words, drive current having a waveform proximate to a resonance current waveform is supplied to the primary winding N<b>1</b> connected in series to the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> as the set of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> and the set of the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> perform on/off operations alternately. An alternating voltage is excited also in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> by an alternating voltage generated in response to the current flowing through the primary winding N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Then, the inter-terminal voltage V<b>2</b> between the positive side input terminal and the negative side input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit DBR connected to the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is obtained with such a waveform as shown in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in response to the alternating voltage generated in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> in such a manner as described above. In short, a waveform which is clamped at the absolute value level of the rectified smoothed voltage E<b>0</b> within a period within which rectification current flows through the bridge rectification circuit DBR is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Current ID having such a waveform as shown in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is outputted from the bridge rectification circuit DBR. In this instance, a continuous operation mode wherein the secondary side current ID flows continuously to the bridge rectification circuit DBR is exhibited as seen from (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Here, for example, in the related art power supply circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, a so-called discontinuous operation mode is exhibited wherein the secondary side current ID flows to the bridge rectification circuit DBR on the secondary side only within a series resonance period between the leakage inductance component L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT and the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In this instance, since the power non-transmission period increases as the load becomes lighter, even if the load power Po decreases, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> does not decrease and also the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> flowing through the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> does not decrease as described hereinabove. As a result, in the related art power supply circuits, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) drops as the load power Po decreases as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In contrast, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as the load power Po decreases, the leakage inductance component L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>2</b><i>l </i>of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT increase when compared with those of the related art power supply circuits, and the secondary side current ID flowing through the bridge rectification circuit DBR exhibits a continuous operation mode as shown in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">As a result, since the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing to the primary winding N<b>1</b> can be decreased as the load power Po decreases, it is possible to achieve reduction of the power loss on the primary side and achieve enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC). As a characteristic of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC), it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that a higher value than that of the characteristic, for example, illustrated as the related art in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is obtained over a substantially overall corresponding load variation range. Particularly, in the present embodiment, for example, up to the load power Po=approximately 50 W, the power conversion efficiency exhibits a tendency that it increases as the load decreases, and also where the load power Po is Po=50 W or less, for example, where the load power Po is Po=25 W, a power conversion efficiency of 92% or more is secured. In short, according to the present embodiment, particularly the problem of the related art that the power conversion efficiency drops as the load decreases is improved excellently.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">According to an experiment, while, with the related art power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) at the load power Po=200 W (in a heavy load state) is approximately 91%, with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be enhanced up to approximately 93.0%.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Further, where the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are compared with each other, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be enhanced from approximately 92.4% to approximately 93.6% at the load power Po=150 W, from approximately 92.0% to approximately 94.3% at the load power Po=100 W, from approximately 87.0% to 95.0% at the load power Po=50 W, and from approximately 82.0% to approximately 94.0% at the load power Po=25 W.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">As a result, when compared with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can achieve reduction to approximately 3.2 W at the load power Po=200 W, to approximately 2.1 W at the load power Po=150 W, to approximately 2.7 W at the load power Po=100 W, to approximately 4.9 W at the load power Po=50 W, and to approximately 3.9 W at the load power Po=25 W.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Further, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since the input rectification circuit which forms the input rectification smoothing circuit can be formed from a full-wave rectification circuit, the input rectification smoothing circuit requires only one smoothing capacitor. Further, since the switching element can be formed from a full-bridge coupling, also the voltage withstanding property of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> can be selected within a range from 400 V to 200 V, reduction of the cost of the circuit can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Furthermore, since the switching characteristic of the switching elements is enhanced, heat generation by the switching element decreases, and there is an advantage also that the radiator plate for the switching elements can be formed with a reduced size or can be eliminated.</p>

<p id="p-0234" num="0233">As can be recognized from comparison between the operation waveforms illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> with the operation waveforms of the related art power supply circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, in the power supply circuit as the related art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the secondary side current ID flowing through the secondary side bridge rectification circuit DBR exhibits a discontinuous operation mode as seen from (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In contrast, the secondary side current ID which flows through the secondary side bridge rectification circuit DBR of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> exhibits a continuous operation mode as seen in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Further, in this instance, the current waveform of the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT is a sine waveform, and as a result, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> drops linearly.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">In particular, in the related art power supply circuits, the exciting inductance L<b>1</b> of the primary winding N<b>1</b> is L<b>1</b>=165 μH; the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b> is L<b>1</b><i>l</i>=41 μH; the exciting inductance L<b>2</b> of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is L<b>2</b>=171 μH; and the leakage inductance L<b>2</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>2</b> is L<b>2</b><i>l</i>=43 μH, and the secondary side current ID flows only within a series resonance period of the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>. Therefore, even if the load power Po decreases, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> does not drop, and the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> does not drop.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">In contrast, with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as the load power Po decreases, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT drops and the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> drops. Therefore, the switching loss of the switching elements Q<b>11</b> and Q<b>12</b> drops, and the power conversion efficiency can be enhanced significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In this manner, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT is set greater than ever to set the coupling coefficient k to approximately 0.84 or less and besides the number of turns of the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is increased to set the induced voltage V<b>2</b> per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> to V<b>2</b>=3 V/T or less (for example, 1.8 V/T). Since the secondary side current ID to flow through the bridge rectification circuit DBR is thereby caused to operate in a continuous operation mode to achieve reduction of the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b>, for example, even in a light load state wherein the load power Po is approximately 5% of the maximum load power (200 W), enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be anticipated.</p>

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Further, while, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the variation of the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> is 3.5 Ap to 2.8 Ap within the range of the load power Po=0 W to 125 W as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the variation of the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be reduced to 3.2 Ap to 0.8 Ap as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0254" num="0253">A primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp is connected in parallel between the collector and the emitter of the switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Also in this instance, a parallel resonance circuit (partial voltage resonance circuit) is formed from the capacitance of the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp and the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The drive transformer PRT is provided to drive the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> to switch and variably control the switching frequency to obtain a constant voltage.</p>

It is to be noted that the driving winding NB<b>1</b> and the driving winding NB<b>2</b> are wound in such winding directions that voltages of the opposite polarities to each other are excited therein.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Also in this instance, the insulating converter transformer PIT transmits a switching output of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> to the secondary side.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT is connected at a winding starting end portion thereof to the collector of the switching element Q<b>1</b> and at a winding ending end portion thereof to a node (switching output point) between the emitter of the switching element Q<b>1</b> and the collector of the switching element Q<b>2</b> through a series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and the resonance current detection winding ND. Consequently, a switching output is obtained at the primary winding N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Also in this instance, the capacitance of the series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT including the primary winding N<b>1</b> form a primary side series resonance circuit for making operation of the primary side switching converter as that of the current resonance type.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">In this manner, also the primary side switching converter shown in the figure adopts a configuration as a composite resonance type converter wherein operation of the current resonance type and the partial voltage resonance operation described above are obtained compositely.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The switching operation of the power supply circuit is, for example, such as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">First, if the commercial AC power supply AC is made available, then base current for starting the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> is supplied to the bases of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>, for example, through the starting resistors Rs<b>1</b> and Rs<b>2</b>. Here, since voltages of the opposite polarities to each other are excited, for example, in the driving windings NB<b>1</b> and NB<b>2</b> of the drive transformer PRT, if it is assumed that the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on first, then the switching element Q<b>2</b> is controlled so as to be turned off. Then, the self-excited oscillation drive circuits of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> perform self-oscillation operation by resonance operation using alternating voltages excited in the driving windings NB<b>1</b> and NB<b>2</b> as sources, respectively. As a result, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are controlled so as to be turned on/off alternately. In other words, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> perform switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Then, for example, when the switching element Q<b>1</b> is on, resonance current flows as a switching output of the switching element Q<b>1</b> to the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> through the resonance current detection winding ND, and the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off and the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current comes to “0”. Consequently, resonance current in the reverse direction flows through the switching element Q<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the self-excited switching operation wherein the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are turned on alternately by ZVS and ZCS is repeated. Further, when the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> perform on/off operation, current flows through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp within a short period of time upon turning off of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. In short, partial resonance voltage operation is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">A secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT. For example, a film capacitor is adopted for the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b>. The capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> form a secondary side partial voltage resonance circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Therefore, since an alternating voltage is excited in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT, partial resonance (voltage resonance) operation is obtained on the secondary side.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In other words, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is configured as a composite resonance type converter wherein current resonance operation and partial voltage resonance operation are obtained on the primary side and partial voltage resonance operation is obtained also on the secondary side.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">To the secondary winding N<b>2</b> described above, a bridge rectification circuit DBR and a smoothing capacitor C<b>01</b> are connected to form a full-wave rectification circuit similarly as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A secondary side DC output voltage E<b>01</b> is obtained across the smoothing capacitor C<b>01</b> by full-wave rectification operation of the full-wave rectification circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Also in the power supply circuit as the third embodiment having such a configuration as described above, if the insulating converter transformer PIT has a coupling coefficient k of approximately 0.81 which exhibits a loose coupling state and the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is 3 V or less, for example, 1.8 V/T or less while the capacitance value of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is 3,300 pF, then the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) at the load power Po=200 W can be 93% or more in addition to enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) in a low load state wherein the load power is, for example, approximately 5% of the maximum load power.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Further, while, in the related art power supply circuits, the AC input power at the load power Po=0 W is approximately 4.2 W, the AC input power may be 2.2 W with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Accordingly, in this instance, there is an advantage also that the AC input power when the load power is 0 W can be reduced by approximately 2.0 W.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">It is described above that the switching power supply circuits described as the first to third embodiments above have been described taking a case wherein, as regards the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT, the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> or the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be approximately 1.8 V/T as an example, the effects described above can be obtained if the number of turns of the primary winding N<b>1</b> or the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be approximately 3 V/T or less.</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Further, according to the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT is set so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be 5 V or more and a secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b> such that a secondary side partial voltage resonance circuit is formed from the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance of the secondary winding N<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0279" num="0278">It is to be noted that, when to obtain the measurement results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, part elements of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are selected in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">First, as regards the insulating converter transformer PIT, the gap G is set to G=2.0 mm to select the coupling coefficient k=0.81. Further, the primary winding N<b>1</b>=secondary winding N<b>2</b>=23 T, the exciting inductances L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>=145 μH, and the leakage inductances L<b>1</b><i>l </i>and L<b>2</b><i>l</i>=43 μH are selected.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Further, the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>=0.082 μF and the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b>=3,300 pF are selected.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, operation of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is indicated by a collector-emitter voltage VQ<b>1</b> of the switching element Q<b>1</b> shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, switching current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>4</b> illustrated in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and switching current IQ<b>2</b> and IQ<b>3</b> shown in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this instance, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> perform switching operation such that they are on within a period TON and are off within another period TOFF.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Here, if the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned on, then resonance current flows along a path of the switching element Q<b>1</b>→primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>→primary winding N<b>1</b>→switching element Q<b>4</b>. Then, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> are controlled such that the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are turned on and the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned off in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes equal to zero. Consequently, resonance current now flows along another path of the switching element Q<b>3</b>→primary winding N<b>1</b>→primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>→switching element Q<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> are controlled such that the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> and the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> are turned on alternately.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Meanwhile, to a primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp<b>1</b> connected in parallel to the switching element Q<b>2</b>, such partial resonance current ICP as seen in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> flows within a short period within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on or turned off. Further, though not shown, also to another primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp<b>2</b> connected to the switching element Q<b>4</b>, partial resonance current flows within a short period within which the switching element Q<b>4</b> is turned on or turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Further, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, switching current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>4</b> flowing between the collector and the emitter of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> has an M-shaped waveform as seen in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> wherein the current level decreases in the proximity substantially of the center of a period TON within which the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> are turned on. Also the switching current IQ<b>2</b> and IQ<b>3</b> flowing through the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> has such an M-shaped waveform as seen in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> which is displaced by 180 degrees in phase from that of the switching current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Accordingly, if the waveforms of the switching current IQ<b>1</b> to IQ<b>4</b> shown in (c) and (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and the waveform of the current IQ<b>2</b> of the power supply circuit as a related art shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> are compared with each other, then it can be seen that the peak value of the primary side current of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> exhibits a decrease by an amount provided by the M-shaped waveform of the switching current IQ<b>1</b> to IQ<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">It arises from the following factors that the switching current IQ<b>1</b> to IQ<b>4</b> flowing between the collector and the emitter of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has an M-shaped waveform in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">First, as regards the configuration, the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT is expanded from the conventional one to achieve decrease of the coupling coefficient k. Further, the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is selected so that an induced voltage V<b>2</b> per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be, for example, 5.9 V/T (=135 V/23 T) or more. Furthermore, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">As a result, by a partial voltage resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>2</b><i>l </i>of the secondary winding N<b>2</b>, a period within which the partial voltage resonance current IC<b>2</b> flows through the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is obtained within a period within which the rectification current ID is off. In this instance, the partial voltage resonance current IC<b>2</b> flows within a period within which the rectification diode which forms the bridge rectification circuit DBR on the secondary side is turned off and the rectification current ID does not flow as seen from (f) and (h) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this instance, the current flowing through the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is composite current of the rectification current ID and the partial voltage resonance current IC<b>2</b>, and the composite current waveform exhibits an M shape. Consequently, also the series resonance current flowing through the primary winding N<b>1</b> which is magnetically coupled to the secondary winding N<b>2</b> has an M-shaped waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">In this instance, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> in the positive polarity direction flows through the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> while the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> in the negative pole direction flows through the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b>. In other words, when the set of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b> and the set of the switching elements Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b> exhibit turning on/off alternately, drive current having a waveform proximate to a resonance current waveform is supplied to the primary winding N<b>1</b> connected in series to the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>. Then, an alternating voltage is excited also in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> by an alternating voltage generated in response to the current flowing through the primary winding N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Then, the inter-terminal voltage V<b>2</b> obtained between the positive electrode side input terminal and the negative electrode side input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit DBR connected to the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is obtained with such a waveform as shown in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in accordance with the alternating voltage generated in the secondary winding N<b>2</b> in such a manner as described above. In short, a waveform which is clamped at the absolute value level of the rectified smoothed voltage E<b>0</b> within a period within which rectification current flows through the bridge rectification circuit DBR.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Further, rectification current ID having such a waveform as shown in (h) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is outputted from the bridge rectification circuit DBR. Further, since, in the proximity of the zero cross at which the induced voltage V<b>2</b> generated in the bridge rectification circuit DBR exhibits the zero level, such partial voltage resonance current IC<b>2</b> as illustrated in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> flows through the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b>, the rectification current ID on the secondary side exhibits a discontinuous mode. However, from the primary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT, it looks that current according to a continuous mode flows through the secondary winding.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Further, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is controlled such that the switching frequency fs decreases as the load power Po becomes heavier as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In short, it can be recognized that constant voltage control of the secondary side DC output voltage E<b>01</b> is performed through switching frequency control.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">More particularly, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT is expanded from 1.0 mm of the conventional example to 2.0 mm to decrease the coupling coefficient k from 0.87 to 0.81. Then, the induced voltage V<b>2</b> per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is set to V<b>2</b>=5.9 V/T and the capacitance value of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is selectively set to 3300 pF.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">In this manner, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, while the current flowing on the secondary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT exhibits a discontinuous mode, in this instance, also the waveform of the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> can be made an M-shaped waveform by a partial voltage resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>2</b><i>l </i>of the secondary winding N<b>2</b>. Thus, also the current waveform of the switching current IQ<b>1</b> to IQ<b>4</b> flowing through the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> can be made an M-shaped waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Consequently, the peak level of the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> and IQ<b>1</b> to IQ<b>4</b> flowing on the primary side within the range of the load power Po of Po=200 W to 0 W can be lowered, and enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) at the load power Po=200 W to 0 W can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">According to an experiment, while, with the related art power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) at the load power Po=200 W (in a heavy load condition) is approximately 91.8%, with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be enhanced up to approximately 93.0%.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Further, where the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are compared with each other, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be enhanced from approximately 92.4% to approximately 93.6% at the load power Po=150 W, from approximately 92.0% to approximately 94.0% at the load power Po=100 W, from approximately 87.0% to 93.0% at the load power Po=50 W, and from approximately 82.0% to approximately 91.3% at the load power Po=25 W. Further, also the input power in a no-load state wherein the load power Po is Po=0 W can be reduced from approximately 3.5 W to approximately 1.7 W.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">As a result, when compared with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can achieve reduction of the AC input power by approximately 4.8 W at the load power Po=200 W, by approximately 2.0 W at the load power Po=150 W, by approximately 2.3 W at the load power Po=100 W, by approximately 3.7 W at the load power Po=50 W, by approximately 3.1 W at the load power Po=25 W, and by approximately 1.8 W at the load power Po=0 W.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Further, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, since the input rectification circuit which forms the input rectification smoothing circuit can be formed from a full-wave rectification circuit similarly as in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the input rectification smoothing circuit requires only one smoothing capacitor. Further, since the switching element is formed from a full-bridge coupling, also the voltage withstanding property of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> can be selected within a range from 400 V to 200 V, and consequently, reduction of the cost of the circuit can be achieved. Further, since also the switching characteristics of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> are enhanced, heat generation by the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> can be reduced. Consequently, there is an advantage also that the necessity for a heat radiating plate for the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Further, a secondary side circuit having such a configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be applied also to the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">However, with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to prevent abnormal oscillation operation in a low load condition, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0304" num="0303">In this instance, the secondary windings N<b>2</b>+N<b>3</b>=23 T is selected. Further, a low capacitance capacitor of 1,000 pF is selectively used for the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b>.</p>

Further, the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be 5 V or more, and the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">In this instance, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> is provide with such an M-shaped waveform as shown in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by a parallel resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Consequently, where the related art power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is compared, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> exhibits a lower peak value of the switching current IQ<b>2</b> and the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b>, and enhancement of the power conversion efficiency is achieved over a range of the load power Po=0 W to 125 W.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">In particular, in order to increase the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b> and set the induced voltage V<b>2</b> per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> to V<b>2</b>=5.87 V/T, the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT is expanded from 1.0 mm of the conventional one to 1.5 mm to decrease the coupling coefficient k from 0.87 to 0.84.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Further, the number of turns of the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT is increased from 24 T to 28 T. Consequently, the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b> is increased from 42 μH to 56 μH.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Further, as the capacitance value of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> in this instance, 1,200 pF is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Further, in this instance, a voltage V<b>1</b> of a waveform wherein the polarity is reversed between the period TON and the period TOFF as seen in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is obtained across the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT. Further, since such secondary side rectification current ID as shown in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> flows between the center tap of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and the secondary side ground, the inter-terminal voltage V<b>2</b> between the winding starting end side of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and the secondary side ground is obtained as an output of such a waveform as shown in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a waveform diagram illustrating operation under the conditions of the AC input voltage VAC=100 V and the load power Po=25 W within a switching period for comparison with the waveform diagram within a switching period shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In this instance, the collector-emitter voltage VQ<b>2</b> of the switching element Q<b>12</b> within a period TON within which the switching element Q<b>12</b> is on and another period TOFF within which the switching element Q<b>12</b> is off has such a waveform as illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and collector current IQ<b>2</b> having such a waveform as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> flows to the collector of the switching element Q<b>12</b>. Also in this instance, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> has such a waveform as shown in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> because of a parallel resonance action of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">In this instance, a voltage V<b>1</b> of such a waveform as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is obtained across the primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT. Further, since such rectification current ID as illustrated in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> flows between the center tap of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and the secondary side ground, the induced voltage V<b>2</b> between the winding starting end side of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and the secondary side ground is obtained as an output of such a waveform as shown in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">In this manner, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the primary side series resonance current I<b>1</b> flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> is provided with an M-shaped waveform by a parallel resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> and the leakage inductance L<b>1</b><i>l </i>of the primary winding N<b>1</b>. Consequently, the switching output current IQ<b>1</b> and IQ<b>2</b> flowing through the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> can be provided with an M-shaped waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">Consequently, as can be seen from a characteristic diagram of the power supply circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and the characteristic diagram of the power supply circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> exhibits enhancement of the power conversion efficiency over the range of the load power Po=0 W to 125 W. It can be seen that the power conversion efficiency is enhanced particularly where the load is light.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">According to an experiment, while, with the related art power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) at the load power Po=125 W is approximately 92.0%, with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be enhanced up to approximately 93.1%.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">Further, where the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> and the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are compared with each other, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) can be enhanced from approximately 92.0 to approximately 93.7% at the load power Po=100 W, from approximately 91.5% to approximately 93.4% at the load power Po=75 W, from approximately 89.0% to 92.1% at the load power Po=50 W, and from approximately 82.5% to approximately 85.8% at the load power Po=25 W. Further, also the input power in a no-load state wherein the load power Po is Po=0 W can be reduced from approximately 4.2 W to approximately 1.7 W.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">As a result, when compared with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> can achieve reduction of the AC input power by approximately 1.6 W at the load power Po=125 W, by approximately 2.0 W at the load power Po=100 W, by approximately 1.7 W at the load power Po=75 W, by approximately 1.9 W at the load power Po=50 W, by approximately 1.2 W at the load power Po=25 W, and by approximately 2.5 W at the load power Po=0 W.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is controlled such that the switching frequency fs becomes lower as the load power Po becomes heavier. In other words, the switching frequency fs has a proportionally rising tendency as the switching frequency fs becomes lighter.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Thus, for example, the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to the variation of the load power Po=125 W to 25 W of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is from approximately 61.7 kHz to 64.9 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">In contrast, the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to the variation of the load power Po=125 W to 25 W of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is from approximately 62.5 kHz to 65.8 kHz. Accordingly, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the control ranges of the switching frequency fs with respect to the variation of the load power Po=125 W to 25 W are substantially equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">Further, while the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to an input voltage variation (85 V to 140 V) of the AC input voltage VAC at the load power Po=125 W is from approximately 52.1 kHz to 76.9 kHz with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, but is from approximately 58.8 kHz to 74.6 kHz with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Accordingly, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has an advantage that the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to the input voltage variation at the load power Po=125 W is smaller by approximately 9 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">A switching power supply circuit as a sixth embodiment of the present invention is described. It is to be noted that the power supply circuit of the sixth embodiment has a circuit configuration same as that of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and therefore, the power supply circuit of the sixth embodiment is omitted in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">However, in the power supply circuit described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in order to prevent abnormal oscillation operation in a low load condition to achieve stable operation, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b>. However, in the power supply circuit according to the sixth embodiment, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> is provided in order to artificially obtain a continuous operation mode in which the secondary side current flowing through the secondary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT flows continuously. In short, also the sixth embodiment has a configuration which includes the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> for obtaining operation and action similar to those of the fourth and fifth embodiments described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a waveform diagram illustrating operation of the power supply circuit as the sixth embodiment within a switching period. Here, operation waveforms under the conditions of the AC input voltage VAC=100 V and the load power Po=200 W are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">First, the switching output current (drain current) IQ<b>2</b> flowing through the switching element Q<b>2</b> flows within a period TON within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is on and exhibits the zero level within another period TOFF within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is off as seen in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Meanwhile, the inter-terminal voltage VQ<b>2</b> of the switching element Q<b>2</b> to which the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp is connected in parallel is obtained with a waveform which is clamped at the level of the DC input voltage Ei within the period TOFF within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is off and exhibits the zero level within the period TON within which the switching element Q<b>2</b> is on as seen in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">Further, since the switching operation described above is obtained, the primary winding current I<b>1</b> of a waveform shown in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> flows through the primary winding N<b>1</b>. The primary winding current I<b>1</b> has a waveform whose polarity is reversed in accordance with the switching period such that it has the positive polarity within the period TON but has the negative polarity within the period TOFF as seen in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Further, the inter-terminal voltage V<b>1</b> of the primary winding N<b>1</b> at this time has such a waveform as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">Meanwhile, on the secondary side of the power supply circuit, such secondary side current ID as shown in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> flows between the center tap of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and the secondary side ground, and the voltage V<b>2</b> of such a waveform as shown in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is obtained between the winding starting end side of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and the secondary side ground. Further, the secondary side current I<b>2</b> flowing through the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is shown in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Furthermore, the partial voltage resonance current IC<b>2</b> of such a waveform as shown in (h) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> flows through the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C<b>2</b> connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Thus, since also the power supply circuit as the sixth embodiment having such a configuration as described above has characteristics similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, enhancement of the power conversion efficiency over a range from a light load condition to a heavy load (200 W) condition, which is an effect similar to that of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">It is to be noted that, in the switching power supply circuits as the fourth to sixth embodiments described above, as regards the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT, the number of turns of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> or the primary winding N<b>1</b> is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be approximately 5.9 V/T or 5.87 V/T. However, if the number of turns of the primary winding N<b>1</b> or the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> may be approximately 5 V/T, then the effects described above are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">It is to be noted that, while the power supply circuits of the embodiments described above have a configuration which keeps the secondary side DC output voltage as a constant voltage through the switching frequency control as a constant voltage control section, they may otherwise have a different configuration for constant voltage control, for example, which includes a series regulator.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">Furthermore, a power supply circuit based on the concept of the present invention can achieve intended action and effects even if the configuration for keeping the secondary side DC output voltage as a constant voltage is omitted. Accordingly, when to construct the power supply circuit based on the present invention, it can be said that it is not always necessary to provide the configuration for keeping the secondary side DC output voltage as a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Further, the switching power supply circuit according to the present invention is not limited to the configurations of the embodiments described above, but the constants of the part elements of essential part may be altered suitably to appropriate values in accordance with various conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Further, while, in the first and fourth embodiments, a self-excited oscillation circuit is provided for the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b>, for example, where the switching elements Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>4</b> are each formed from a MOS-FET or an IGBT, they may be configured correspondingly so as to perform switching operation from a separately excited oscillation circuit. On the contrary, although, as regards the power supply circuits which include the half-bridge system by two switching elements, only a configuration of the separately excited type as in the case of the second embodiment is described, they may otherwise be formed as those of the self-excited type.</p>
