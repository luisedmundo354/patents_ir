<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to tools and particularly to a tool adapted to remove a wheel assembly from a vehicle chassis for automotive maintenance and repair. More specifically, the invention relates to a durable, inexpensive, and reconfigurable apparatus for removal of the wheel assembly from the vehicle chasses of a plurality of original equipment manufacturer (hereafter also referred to as “OEM”) automotive product lines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the various automotive vehicle industries, including for purposes of illustration but not limitation, wheel and brake servicing and repair, those with skill in the art have long-recognized the need for an improved method of removing the various components of a wheel assembly without damage that can occur to, for example without limitation, the rotors, hubs, bearings, spindles, and axles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the past, service personnel, technicians, and mechanics have had to resort to blow torches, mallets, hammers, pry bars, and the like to remove and break free the various wheel assembly components that may be seized together from the accumulation of dirt, dust, moisture, and from corrosion and cold welding that can occur from various forces, loads, and galvanic and frictional interaction between the wheel assembly components. Such corrosive and cold welding type seizing is further exacerbated by the combined effect of heavy load conditions experienced by many types of consumer, commercial, industrial, and military vehicles. Some technicians and mechanics also attempt to pull the assembly apart by securing pulling devices to one of the wheel assembly engagement members, typically referred to as studs or lugs by those having skill in the art. This method does not evenly distribute the pulling forces to the wheel assembly and often results in deformation and damage to the engagement members and to the wheel assembly, which can require replacement of the deformed and damaged parts, which further adds to and increases the labor and part maintenance costs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Occasionally, vehicle manufacturers will suggest alternative removal methods including, for example, the installation of longer bolts or studs from the rear of the assembly that can be employed to force apart the components of the wheel assembly from the wheel hub, spindle, or axle. However, this method is generally ineffective to combat severely corroded parts and is generally incompatible for use with most OEM vehicle configurations such as, for example, four-wheel drive vehicles that incorporate complex axle component assemblies and difficult to access service configurations and vehicle locations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result of such difficulty and in light of the increased expense and ineffectiveness of most prior art devices, mechanics generally resort to the pry bar, hammer, and mallet methods that typically impart unevenly applied impact forces, which most often deforms and damages the wheel assembly components including the hub, rotor, bearings, axle, and spindle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As noted herein, the problem of seized wheel assembly components is especially common in vehicles that are adapted to carry frequently heavy loads and that are subject to particularly severe shock loads such as those experienced in off-road and various industrial and construction applications and environments. Removing the seized components of load carrying vehicles can take dozens of forceful hammer blows to the rotor, and often requires the use of a torch to create temperature differentials across and between the seized parts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In severely corroded and seized situations, the torch is used to actually cut the non-removable parts from the assembly so that replacement components can be supplied. This torch removal technique is dangerous, time consuming, exhausting, and many times will cause damage to the components that would only otherwise require removal and servicing. As a result of such problems in removing and servicing various types of wheel assemblies and related components, many service facilities expend many extra man-hours each day removing seized components. Further, despite their best efforts, the technicians and mechanics often cannot avoid irreparable damage to the wheel assembly components during removal, the costs of which are borne in part by the facility, any warranty provider, and often in most part by the customer or vehicle owner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What has been needed but as yet unavailable is a device that addresses some of the long-standing problems in the art. Some attempts have been made to improve devices for use in other technology areas. For example, the value of a slide hammer type device in imparting tensile impulse loads has been attempted in the automotive services industry.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Prior art devices and methods for applying tensile impulse loads have not been compatible for wide spread uses and do not properly impart effective and efficient axial forces. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,106,012 to Corner and U.S. Pat. No. 3,003,230 to Fornes, slide hammer devices are incorporated in axle pullers. Even earlier, U.S. Pat. No. 2,377,304 to Appel incorporated a slide hammer into a device for pulling sleeves from internal combustion engines.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">More recently, U.S. Pat. No. 4,283,827 to Abel utilized a slide hammer device in a tool for removing axle spindles. While these devices attempt to impart effective tensile impulse loads on the object intended to be pulled apart or removed, none of the attempts to date have offered the reliable and novel aspects contemplated by the present invention, nor have they been compatible for use with the myriad OEM vehicles and components presently in the marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Instead, the prior art devices have been markedly limited in application and compatibility and when not entirely effective for the intended or desired purpose, such devices have often failed to establish any effective solution to the particularly troublesome seized wheel assembly components that may be severely corroded and welded together. The limited attempts of the prior art that have sought to address the particular issues related to one type of wheel assembly have been unable to operate with wheel assembly designs other than the one or two configurations contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The need remains for an apparatus that can be easily setup and reconfigured to ensure substantially axial transfer of generally uniform forces, that can be utilized on a variety of vehicles, and that can more readily remove and separate the components of a corroded wheel assembly, while minimizing or eliminating potential damage to the assembly during unseizing and separation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention meets the above described and other needs without adding any complexity, inefficiencies, or significant costs to implementation in existing applications and environments. In fact, the preferred apparatus according to the present invention can be implemented with relatively low-cost materials and components that can be easily adapted according to the principles of the present invention. The various embodiments of the present invention disclosed are readily adapted for preferable ease of manufacture, low fabrication and setup costs, effectiveness of operation, and for wide compatibility with various OEM components. Further, service personnel, technicians, and mechanics can employ the device and apparatus according to the principles of the instant invention without any additional training and without any additional tooling or equipment other than the improved wheel assembly removal apparatus and the various configurations thereof that are contemplated herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In its most general configuration, the present invention advances the state of the art with a variety of new capabilities and overcomes many of the shortcomings of prior devices in new and novel ways. In one of the many preferable configurations, the wheel assembly removal apparatus incorporates, among other elements, a slide hammer assembly that includes a hammer secured to a hollow slide tube. The hollow slide tube receives a slide shaft upon which the hollow slide tube and hammer can be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The slide shaft incorporates a hammer stop near the distal end and a distally projecting support extension. A coupler is formed at the proximal end of the slide shaft and is configured to releasably engage an interchangeable rotor securing tool. The interchangeable rotor securing or connecting tool releasably attaches to the coupler at the distal end and to a rim mounting surface at the proximal end. The term “interchangeable rotor securing tool” used throughout contemplates embodiments adapted to attach to a variety of differently configured wheel rim mounting surfaces, including wheel hubs, rotors, and other wheel assembly components and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In operation, a user rapidly accelerates the hammer and slide tube, also referred to as the slide hammer assembly, from the proximal end of the slide shaft to impact the hammer stop, which creates an operational impact load when the hammer strikes the hammer stop and the linear momentum of the hammer is transferred to the shaft through the stop. The impact load is transferred through the slide shaft, the coupler, and the interchangeable rotor securing tool to the rim mounting surface, rotor, or other wheel assembly component. The impact load breaks loose the seized components of the wheel assembly, which may include, for example, wheel bearings, hub, rotor, and axle components, from the spindle and axle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one of many variations of the instant invention, the apparatus includes a plurality of engagement hole patterns, each containing at least two engagement holes formed on the interchangeable rotor securing tool. More specifically, one embodiment of the interchangeable rotor securing tool may preferably include a four engagement hole pattern, a six engagement hole pattern, an eight engagement hole pattern on a single tool, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, the interchangeable rotor securing tool may include a three engagement hole pattern, a five engagement hole pattern, an eight engagement hole pattern on a single tool, and combinations thereof. Alternatively, each of the plurality of engagement hole patterns may be formed on individual interchangeable rotor securing tools. These engagement hole patterns are not limited to aligning with engagement members, but may also align with the bearing removal bolt patterns of many vehicles. Such engagement members can include OEM wheel lugs as well as fasteners inserted through holes formed in the wheel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The coupler is adapted to enable a single slide hammer assembly to be used with any number of interchangeable rotor securing tools for enhancing compatibility. Therefore, one slide hammer assembly may be used with any number of interchangeable rotor securing tools, which can be adapted for both foreign and domestic vehicles, including for example cars, trucks, vans, buses, aircraft, and recreation and military vehicles. The coupler may take the form of a male threaded connection on the slide shaft for engagement by a female threaded receiver on the interchangeable rotor securing tool. Alternatively, one with skill in the art can recognize that the coupler may be formed to include quick release type fasteners, cotter pin type fasteners, bayonet fasteners, and any number of other recognized joining methods.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additional embodiments of the interchangeable rotor securing tool are adapted so that the tool can be securely coupled to the rim mounting surface to transfer a substantially axial impact load approximately uniformly to the rim mounting surface. This modification may be used with any of the preceding embodiments and incorporates an interchangeable rotor securing tool that is adapted to be in contact with a substantial portion of the rim mounting surface, rather than being limited to engaging only one engagement member. Then, with the engagement members received through one of the engagement hole patterns and fastened to the tool, the slide shaft is preferably applied to be approximately orthogonal to the rim mounting surface and will transfer substantially axial operational impact loads.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While it is preferable that all the engagement members be fastened to the tool to maximize the load distribution and minimize the potential for damaging the engagement members, the apparatus can function when fastened to at least one engagement member. Additionally, the substantial amount of contact area between the rim mounting surface and the tool, when properly connected, ensures a substantially distributed load transfer interface for the uniform transfer of separation impact loads from the tool to the rim mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the apparatus also preferably can include a support extension at the distal end of the slide shaft. The support extension allows the operator to rest the distal end of the apparatus on a support device during setup and operation, such as a jack stand. Therefore, the operator does not have to support the weight of the apparatus during setup or while in use. Additionally, with the support extension on a jack stand, the operator can ensure that the slide shaft is generally orthogonal to the plane of the rim mounting surface to maximize kinetic energy and load transfer efficiency. An additional variation of the support extension may include a distal end connection for securing additional tools. The apparatus may then be used as a tool to impart compressive impulse forces.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A further variation of any of the preceding embodiments may also include a dual hand operation mechanism. The mechanism requires that both of the operator's hands be on the moving portion of the apparatus, namely the hollow slide tube and hammer, prior to allowing the moving portion to slide on the slide shaft. This mechanism minimizes the possibility of the operator getting a hand caught between the hammer and the hammer stop.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Any of the preceding configurations and embodiments may also be adapted to include any one of a number of releasably engagable retainer assemblies. The retainer assembly loosely retains the wheel assembly to the vehicle chassis so that the operator, apparatus, and the wheel assembly are controlled when the impact load breaks free the seized components. The retainer assembly may in one variation include at least one fastener. One such embodiment incorporates at least one retainer bolt that loosely secures the wheel assembly to the vehicle chassis during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, in one of many possible applications in the example of commercial truck vehicles, the OEM bolts that are used to tightly secure the bearing of the wheel assembly to the steering knuckle or chassis are removed and replaced with extra long bolts, such as bolts that are approximately 2″ to 8″, or longer as needed, which enable the wheel assembly to break free when the impact load is applied while being loosely connected to the vehicle chassis. Further, the retainer bolts restrain the wheel assembly and apparatus to the vehicle to control the breakaway of the wheel assembly from the vehicle and prevent the wheel assembly and the apparatus from dropping to the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, further embodiments of the releasably engagable retainer assembly incorporates at least one flexible and adjustable retainer device. The flexible and adjustable retainer device may preferably include chains, wire ropes, elastomeric restraints, bungees, and any number of strap-like devices. These flexible and adjustable retainer devices may be releasably engaged by the interchangeable rotor securing tool or the slide shaft and may be wrapped around and through the wheel assembly chassis mount, steering knuckle, or virtually any vehicle chassis member that is securely attached to the vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Any of the preceding configurations and embodiments may also be adapted to include a means for attaching the releasably engagable retainer assembly to the apparatus when not in use. One such embodiment may include retainer bolt recesses formed into the hammer stop in which the retainer bolts may be secured when the apparatus is not in use. Additional embodiments may include retainer bolt recesses in the hammer, interchangeable rotor securing tool, or the device support extension. Similar attachment means may be incorporated into the flexible adjustable retainer device embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In yet another contemplated modification to any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the instant invention is also directed to an automotive wheel assembly removal apparatus that includes an interchangeable rotor securing tool that is mounted to the coupler of the slide shaft as before, but that is formed with a plurality of engagement slots adapted to facilitate compatibility with a wide variety of possible vehicle chassis wheel assemblies having various rotor plate dimensions. In this variation of the other embodiments described herein, the slots cooperate to receive a plurality of rocker clamps each adjustably secured to a respective one of the plurality of engagement slots. Preferably, the rocker clamps are threaded to be fastened to the slots with a bolt, or the clamps are formed with a through hole to be secured to the slots with a nut, bolt, and washer fastener configuration. In this configuration, the slots of the interchangeable rotor securing tool cooperate with the rocker clamps to be adjustable so that the removal apparatus can be configured for securing to wheel assemblies having rotor plates with any thickness and any diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the instant alternative to any of the embodiments described herein, the wheel assembly removal apparatus may further incorporate at least one axle impact bar that is sized and adapted to transfer the operational impact load of the removal apparatus directly to an axle of the wheel assembly. Preferably the axel impact bar is received within the interchangeable rotor securing tool to transfer the contemplated impact loads from the securing tool and or the slide hammer shaft to the axle of the wheel assembly. More specifically, the axle impact bar can be sized so that it engages the axle and the slide shaft whereby, during operation, the impact loads are directly communicated to the axle of the wheel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A configuration is further contemplated where the axle impact bar is threadably received into the interchangeable rotor securing tool and or the slide shaft and similarly received into the axle of the wheel assembly. In this arrangement, the slide shaft may also be further configured with one or more rotation handles that can facilitate threading of the axle impact bar into the axle of the wheel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to any of the preceding variation and modifications, the instant invention also contemplates configurations adapted to be used in conjunction with heating sources such as a torch, which may be necessary for use in unseizing and removing a troublesome vehicle wheel assembly. More particularly, one or more apertures may be formed in the interchangeable rotor securing tool that is sized to receive, for purposes of example without limitation, the nozzle of an acetylene torch or the like, that can be positioned to heat one or more components of the seized wheel assembly during operation of the wheel assembly removal apparatus so as to further increase the stresses across the component interfaces of the seized wheel assembly while the impact loads of the slide hammer are imposed on the wheel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Any of the preferred embodiments of the invention and modifications and variations thereof can be further adapted to incorporate a tensioner assembly with a second interchangeable rotor securing tool. The tensioner assembly is preferably adapted to preload in tension the rotor or vehicle component to be removed in bias against the vehicle chassis and or wheel assembly undergoing maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tensioner assembly typically will incorporate a cross bar received about the second interchangeable rotor securing tool, which is arranged to establish the preload, usually from a pneudraulic plunger cylinder, between the removal tool as attached to the rotor or other component to be removed, and the vehicle chassis and or wheel assembly. The tensioner assembly will also preferably include, among other components, a series of compressively loaded and adjustable push links and tensily loaded tension rods and or a tension cylinder, as well as possibly useful push rods.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">These variations, modifications, and alterations of the various preferred embodiments may be used either alone or in combination with one another as can be better understood by those with skill in the art with reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying figures and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, in the various figures and drawings, the following reference symbols and letters are used to identify significant features, dimensions, objects, and arrangements of elements described herein below in connection with the several figures and illustrations: A, AR, CS, HS, JS, Li, L, L′, R, RM, M, SK, and WA.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The wheel assembly removal apparatus according to the present invention demonstrates a significant step forward in the field of vehicle maintenance tools, and more specifically in the field of wheel assembly removal tools. Many undesirable, ineffective, and unsuccessful attempts have been made to create a wheel assembly removal apparatus having the convenience and efficiency of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The preferred wheel assembly removal apparatus has wide application for all wheel based vehicles that incorporate wheel or rotating assemblies that are subject to removal for maintenance and replacement. The preferred configurations and described alternatives, modifications, and variations of the wheel assembly removal apparatus of the instant invention overcome prior shortcomings and accomplish new and novel solutions to the prior art problems with vastly improved configurations and arrangements of inventive elements that are uniquely configured, and which demonstrate previously unavailable capabilities, and wide compatibility for use with any original equipment manufacturer (OEM) vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference now to the accompanying figures and specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one of the many preferable configurations, the wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b> incorporates, among other elements, a slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> that includes a hammer <b>120</b> secured to a hollow slide tube <b>130</b>. The hollow slide tube <b>130</b> is received on a hollow or solid slide shaft <b>140</b> upon which the hollow slide tube <b>130</b> and hammer <b>120</b> can be moved, as indicated generally by arrows identified by reference letter M.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The slide shaft <b>140</b> incorporates a hammer stop <b>150</b> near the distal end <b>142</b> and a distally projecting support extension <b>145</b>. A coupler <b>160</b> is formed at the proximal end <b>144</b> of the slide shaft <b>140</b> and is configured to releasably engage an interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>. The interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> releasably attaches to the coupler <b>160</b> at the distal end <b>172</b> and to a rim mounting surface RM at the proximal end <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In additional alternative, optional, and preferred configurations, the coupler <b>160</b>, instead of being incorporated in the form of the extending stem with distal end <b>172</b>, may be formed as an integral and flush feature. More specifically, the rotor securing tool <b>170</b> may take the form of a large, flat disk with threads or other attachment features included in a generally central bore approximately in the same position as the coupler <b>160</b> shown in the various figures. One possibly desirable variation can simply incorporate a centrally formed countersunk or through bore that can further include internal threads or other interlocking features to releasably attach proximal end <b>144</b> to the modified coupling feature.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In operation, a user rapidly accelerates the hammer <b>120</b> and hollow slide tube <b>130</b> to generate linear momentum, from the proximal end <b>144</b> of the slide shaft <b>140</b> to impact the hammer stop <b>150</b>, which creates an operational impact load, denoted generally by the arrow identified by the reference letter Li, as the hammer <b>120</b> strikes the hammer stop <b>150</b>. The user may grip the hollow slide tube <b>130</b> or the hammer <b>120</b> to accelerate the hammer assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this way, the user creates and transfers the momentum of the accelerated slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> to the wheel assembly WA. Those with skill in the art can understand that the resulting impact load Li is transferred through the slide shaft <b>140</b>, the coupler <b>160</b>, and the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> to the rim mounting surface RM. It has been found that repeated operation of the apparatus <b>100</b> in this way can unseize and separate even the most tightly joined wheel assembly components.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">One variation of the preceding embodiment includes a plurality of bearings (not shown) in the slide tube <b>130</b>. The addition of such bearings reduces the friction between the slide shaft <b>140</b> and the slide tube <b>130</b>. Alternatively, the slide shaft <b>140</b> may include a plurality of bearings upon which the slide tube <b>130</b> travels. Further, the slide tube <b>130</b> and slide shaft <b>140</b> may include a low friction coating.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Yet another embodiment of the apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> incorporates a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder (not shown) as the slide shaft <b>140</b>. A pneumatic cylinder may be used as the slide shaft <b>140</b> by simply adding a compressed air connection port at either end of the hollow slide tube <b>140</b>. The modified slide shaft <b>140</b> would preferably contain a pneumatic piston that may be connected to the slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> in a number of ways recognizable by one with skill in the art. This embodiment would allow the operator to operate the apparatus <b>100</b> remotely and to stand clear of all moving components of the apparatus <b>100</b>, as well as the wheel assembly WA, as it is separated.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The rim mounting surface varies with the type of OEM vehicle. Typically, in one example, the rim mounting surface RM is either on the rotor R or the hub. One with skill in the art can recognize that the wheel assembly WA generally includes a spindle (not shown), a wheel bearing (not shown), a hub (not shown), and a rotor R. The particular wheel assembly WA depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> illustrates a configuration wherein the rotor R is located on the wheel side of the hub, also the side wherein the apparatus <b>100</b> attaches in the referenced figures.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, there are other types of vehicles in which the hub is on the wheel side of the rotor R, such as late model full size Dodge brand trucks, wherein the wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b> is equally effective. The impact load Li generated during operation of the apparatus <b>100</b> breaks loose the seized components of the wheel assembly WA, which may include, for example, wheel bearings, hub, rotor R, and axle components, from the spindle and axle A.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The apparatus <b>100</b> may be constructed out of virtually any durable and relatively strong and fatigue resistant material. One preferable embodiment utilizes commercially available carbon steel components due to the low cost of carbon steels and their durability and high strength. The apparatus may be constructed out of corrosion resistant and spark resistant materials for use in hazardous environments. Also, the various components of the apparatus <b>100</b> may be furnished in a variety of finishes, including for example a painted finish, a coated finish, a dielectric coating, a plated finish, or a galvanized coating.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The preferred embodiment is light enough that a single person can carry and set-up the apparatus <b>100</b>. Additionally, a high ratio of the weight of the slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> to the apparatus <b>100</b> weight is preferred. Accordingly, a hollow slide shaft <b>140</b> and a small hammer stop <b>150</b> are preferred. In this way, the momentum of the moving slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> is transferred, on impact with the hammer stop <b>150</b>, mostly to the wheel assembly WA and energy is not unduly wasted in accelerating unnecessary mass of the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one of many variations of the instant invention, the apparatus <b>100</b> also preferably includes a plurality of engagement hole patterns <b>180</b>, each containing at least two engagement holes, formed on the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>. More specifically, one embodiment of the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> may preferably include a four engagement hole pattern, a six engagement hole pattern, and an eight engagement hole pattern, or more, and all incorporated on a single tool <b>170</b>. Similarly, additional holes may be formed to facilitate removal of other components of the wheel assembly, such as, for purposes of example but not for purposes of limitation, a wheel bearing assembly. In this instance, additional hole patterns such as hole pattern <b>190</b> can be included, which can be used for bolts used to engage wheel bearing components that may need repair and removal via the impact load removal techniques described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Alternatively, the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> may include a three engagement hole pattern, a five engagement hole pattern, an eight engagement hole pattern on a single tool <b>170</b>, and combinations thereon. Further, each of the plurality of engagement hole patterns <b>180</b> may be formed on individual interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">These engagement hole patterns <b>180</b> are not limited to aligning with engagement members <b>200</b>, but may also align with the wheel bearing (not shown) removal bolt patterns of many vehicles, such as hole pattern <b>190</b>. Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, additional modifications are illustrated that include a three engagement hole pattern and a six engagement hole pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a modified embodiment that incorporates a three engagement hole pattern and an eight engagement hole pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The coupler <b>160</b> is preferably adapted to enhance compatibility in that it enables a single slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> to be used with any number of interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>. Therefore, one slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> may be used with any number of interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> that are adapted for both foreign and domestic vehicles, including for example, cars, trucks, vans, buses, aircraft, recreation and military vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The coupler <b>160</b> may take the form of a male threaded connection on the slide shaft <b>140</b> for engagement by a female threaded receiver on the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>. Alternatively, one with skill in the art would recognize that the coupler <b>160</b> may be formed to include quick release type fasteners, cotter pin type fasteners, bayonet fasteners, and any number of other recognized joining methods.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Additional embodiments of the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> allow the tool to be securely connected to or coupled to the rim mounting surface to transfer a substantially axial impact load Li approximately uniformly to the rim mounting surface RM. This variation may be used with any of the preceding embodiments and incorporates an interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> that is adapted to be in contact with a substantial portion of the rim mounting surface RM, in addition to engaging the engagement members <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While it is preferably that all the engagement members <b>200</b> be fastened to the apparatus <b>100</b> to maximize the load distribution and minimize the potential for damaging the engagement members <b>200</b>, the apparatus <b>100</b> can function when fastened to at least one engagement member <b>200</b>. Then, with the engagement members <b>200</b> extending through at least one of the engagement hole patterns <b>180</b> and fastened to the rotor securing tool <b>170</b>, the slide shaft <b>140</b> is preferably approximately orthogonal to the rim mounting surface RM and will transfer a substantially axial operational impact load Li. Additionally, the substantial amount of contact area of the rim mounting surface RM and the securing tool <b>170</b>, when properly connected, ensures a substantially distributed load transfer interface for the uniform transfer of loads from the rotor securing tool <b>170</b> to the rim mounting surface RM.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the apparatus <b>100</b> also preferably can include a support extension <b>145</b> at the distal end of the slide shaft <b>140</b>. The support extension <b>145</b> allows the operator to rest the distal end of the apparatus <b>100</b> on a jack stand JS. As described before, the operator does not have to support the weight of the apparatus <b>100</b> while in use and during setup. Additionally, with the support extension <b>145</b> on a jack stand JS the operator can ensure that the slide shaft <b>140</b> is substantially level, if desired, and substantially orthogonal to the rim mounting surface RM to therefore transfer the greatest amount of axial force.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An additional variation of the support extension <b>145</b> may include a distal end connection for securing additional tools. The apparatus <b>100</b> may then be used as a tool to impart compressive impulse forces and may be used, for example, to unseize axles by driving them toward the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A further variation of any of the preceding embodiments may also include a dual hand operation mechanism <b>230</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The mechanism <b>230</b> operates best with hands of the operator grasping the moving portion of the apparatus <b>100</b>, namely the hollow slide hammer assembly <b>110</b>, prior to accelerating the slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> on the slide shaft <b>140</b>. This mechanism <b>230</b> minimizes the possibility of the operator getting one a hand caught between the slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> and the hammer stop <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">One embodiment of the dual hand operation mechanism includes two spring loaded handles secured to the hammer <b>120</b>. A pin (not shown) extends from the handles through the hammer <b>120</b> to the slide shaft <b>140</b>. In this embodiment the slide shaft <b>140</b> includes a plurality of ledges (not shown) that engage the pins.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To slide the slide tube <b>130</b> and hammer <b>120</b> along the slide shaft <b>140</b>, the user must place one hand on each handle and pull the handles, and therefore the push pins, outward away from the slide shaft <b>140</b>, therefore disengaging the pins and ledges. One with skill in the art would recognize the myriad of potential dual hand mechanisms <b>230</b> that may be successfully applied to this apparatus <b>100</b> in the context of the preceding descriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A further variation of any of the preceding embodiments may include a non-slip gripping surface on the hollow slide tube <b>130</b>, the hammer <b>120</b>, and the operation mechanism <b>230</b>. The surface textures may include, for example, work and grip surfaces that are also formed to have stipple and or dimple patterns of raised portions. Further, the hollow slide tube <b>130</b> and the operation mechanism <b>230</b> may include grip type devices that conform to the shape of a hand gripping a cylindrical object.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Any of the preceding configurations and embodiments may also be adapted to include any one of a number of releasably engagable retainer assemblies. This retainer assembly <b>205</b> loosely retains the wheel assembly WA to the vehicle chassis so that the operator, apparatus <b>100</b>, and the wheel assembly WA are controlled when the impact load Li breaks free the seized components.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The retainer assembly <b>205</b> may, in one variation, include at least one fastener. One such embodiment incorporates at least one retainer bolt <b>210</b> that loosely secures the wheel assembly WA to the vehicle chassis during operation. For example, in one of many possible applications as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the OEM bolts that are used to tightly secure the bearing of the wheel assembly WA to the steering knuckle SK or chassis are removed and replaced with at least one fastener that may be extra long bolts, such as bolts approximately 2″ to 8″ long, or longer as needed, which enable the wheel assembly to break free when the impact load Li is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, the retainer bolts <b>210</b> restrain the wheel assembly WA and apparatus <b>100</b> to the vehicle to control the breakaway of the wheel assembly WA from the vehicle and prevent the wheel assembly WA and the apparatus from dropping to the ground. In other alternative arrangements, the at least one fastener or retainer bolt <b>210</b> can also include a lug nut, an expandable bolt, a locking shear pin, a flexible strap, any of which can be used alone, in place of, or in combination with the at least one fastener, as well as in combinations of any of such components. Additionally, a jack stand JS may be located under the coupler <b>160</b> to control the weight of the wheel assembly WA and the apparatus <b>100</b> when the wheel assembly WA breaks free.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Also, further embodiments of the releasably engagable retainer assembly <b>205</b> incorporates at least one flexible and adjustable retainer device <b>220</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The flexible and adjustable retainer device <b>220</b> may preferably be formed from chains, wire ropes, elastomeric restraints, bungees, and any number of strap like devices and combinations thereof. These flexible adjustable retainer devices <b>220</b> may be releasably engaged by the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b> or the slide shaft <b>140</b> and may be wrapped around and through the wheel assembly chassis mount, steering knuckle SK, or virtually any vehicle member that is securely attached to the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Any of the preceding configurations and embodiments may also be adapted to include a means for attaching the releasably engagable retainer assembly <b>205</b> to the apparatus <b>100</b> when not in use. One such embodiment may include retainer bolt recesses formed into the hammer stop <b>150</b> as a storage holder <b>207</b> in which the retainer bolts <b>210</b> may be secured when the apparatus is not in use, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Additional embodiments may include retainer bolt recesses in the hammer <b>120</b>, interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>, or the device support extension <b>145</b>. Similar attachment means may be incorporated into the flexible adjustable retainer device <b>220</b> embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As represented in the various figures, the wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b> is not necessarily shown to scale but is shown in one of many possible and equally desirable representative relative dimensional proportions, as will be apparent to those with skill in the art. For example, although the wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b> is shown to have generally cylindrical components, any of a wide variety of equally suitable cross-sectionally shaped profiles are available and would be compatible for purposes of and contemplated by the wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention in any of its described and contemplated embodiments, variations, and modified forms.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With continued reference to the preceding various figures, reference is now also specifically made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, which illustrate another alternative variation that can be included in whole or in part with any of the preceding embodiments and alternatives thereto already described herein. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, those having skill in the art may be able to further understand that the instant invention is also directed to an automotive wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b>′ having an interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> that is similar in certain respects to other embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, unlike previous variations and modifications, the instant alternative arrangement of the securing tool <b>250</b> incorporates a housing <b>255</b> of tool <b>250</b> that is preferably formed with a plurality or two or more engagement slots <b>260</b> that are adapted to establish an adjustment capability to the interchangeable securing tool <b>250</b>. In this modified variation, the housing <b>255</b> of tool <b>250</b> establishes in interior recess that is seated over lugs and hub portions of the contemplated wheel assembly(ies) WA and is further configured to be coupled against the rotor or rotor plate R thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Additionally, the instant alternative arrangement <b>100</b>′ further incorporates a plurality or two or more rocker clamps <b>265</b> that cooperate with the slots <b>260</b> to clamp a component such as the rotor plate R (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) thereby securing the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> to the wheel assembly WA. As can be understood with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rocker clamps <b>265</b> can be fastened to the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> with bolts <b>270</b> that can be threaded into the rocker clamps <b>265</b> or that can be fastened with nuts (not shown) through holes that may alternatively be formed in the rocker clamps (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In this arrangement <b>100</b>′, the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> can be adapted for use with rotor plates such as rotor R as well as any number of differently configured rotor plates having various thicknesses and diametrical dimensions and configurations. For purposes of establishing compatibility with a vast range of wheel assemblies, including wheel assembly WA, the rocker clamps <b>265</b> may incorporate one or more reliefs or recessed portions <b>287</b>, <b>288</b> that can be shaped and sized so that the rocker clamps <b>265</b> can be positioned inside certain portions of the contemplated wheel assemblies without interference from components and structural features of such wheel assemblies. In this way, fewer components of the wheel assemblies must be removed for purposes of operating the wheel assembly removal apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>′ according to the principles of the instant invention.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the instant modification also contemplates incorporation of an optional or preferred axle impact shaft, pin, bar, or rod <b>280</b> that can be releasably and interchangeably mounted into a slide shaft <b>140</b>′ with threads <b>285</b> or any other similarly capable fastening means. The axle impact bar <b>280</b> may also be adapted to releasably and or threadably engage the axle A of the wheel assembly WA by having a diameter small enough so as to be received in a recess AR of the axle A, which is sometimes also or alternatively referred to by those skilled in the art as a hard point or axle center point.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Also, axle impact bar <b>280</b> may also be optionally or preferably adapted with axle A threads <b>290</b> that are adapted to be threaded into OEM service threads that may be formed in the axle recess AR. In this additional configuration, the slide shaft <b>140</b>′ may be further adapted with a rotation handle <b>295</b> to facilitate threading the axle impact bar into the axle threads of axle recess AR. Yet other variations may incorporate an integrally formed or otherwise attached wrench socket <b>297</b> or the like, such as a ¾″ socket, that can be actuated to rotate the slide shaft <b>140</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the configuration wherein the axle impact bar, rod, or pin <b>280</b> is configured without threads about any portion thereof (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), a modified axle impact rod <b>280</b>′ is described that is slidably and rotatably received in the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> within a slide shaft recess <b>300</b> that is formed in the slide shaft <b>140</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In variations of the solid core shaft <b>140</b>′, the instant modification may also incorporate a similar construction that employs a hollow tube-type shaft (not shown) whereby the axle <b>280</b>′ can be extracted using an elongated pin inserted through the opposite end of the hollow shaft that can be used to impact the axle bar <b>280</b>′ if it becomes jammed during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the instant arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, the axle impact bar or rod <b>280</b>′ may also further preferably or optionally incorporate a shoulder portion <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that can be seated against a hard steel seat washer <b>310</b> that can in turn be seated against the proximate end <b>315</b> of the slide shaft <b>140</b>′. In this modification, the axle rod <b>280</b>′ may be sized whereby the slide shaft recess <b>300</b> projects further than the received portion of the axle rod or bar <b>280</b>′ so that the axle bar <b>280</b>′ does not bottom out within the recess <b>300</b> and thereby become deformed and jammed into the recess <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In this way, in addition to forming the recess <b>300</b> to be diametrically larger than the received portion of the axle bar <b>280</b>′, deformation of the axle bar or rod <b>280</b>′ can in most operational circumstances be limited to exterior portions proximate the shoulder portion <b>305</b> instead of portions received within the recess <b>300</b>, which can prevent the axle bar or rod from becoming jammed into the recess <b>300</b>. For stress relief and to minimize deformation during operation, the proximate end <b>315</b> may be further modified to incorporate a blend or chamfer <b>320</b>. In addition to incorporating any of the preceding anti-deformation and anti-jamming features and capabilities, the opposite end of the axle rod or bar <b>280</b>′ may also be preferably or optionally configured to have a reduced cross-section <b>325</b> having a point <b>327</b> that can be sized and adapted to automatically seat into the center or hard point axle recess AR of the axle A.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this alternative non-threaded configuration of the axle bar or rod <b>280</b>′, the operator or user of the contemplated axle impact bar <b>280</b>′ can be assured that all operational impact loads, e.g. Li, are directed along the most desirable load pathway. For example, it can be desirable to have the operational impact load, such as Li, imparted upon the axle A only in one direction while the impact loads imparted upon the rotor R are desirable only in the opposite direction such that the components may be more quickly separated from one another in circumstances where they have become seized or otherwise undesirably joined together.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">With continued reference also again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, those having skill in the art will recognize that the stroke <b>330</b> of the hammer (such as hammer <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>) moving in the direction of arrow denoted generally by arrow <b>340</b> can, in particular coupling configurations of the securing tool <b>250</b> and housing <b>255</b>, impart a shock load and transfer the linear momentum of the hammer stroke primarily or only to the axle bar or rod <b>280</b>′ without any significant force being transmitted through the housing <b>255</b> of tool <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b>, as is further detailed hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the context of the structural configuration needed to accomplish this possibly preferred capability, the alternative axle rod, pin, bar, or shaft <b>280</b>′ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is incorporated into the assembly of interchangeable tool <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) so that a minimum distance L is established between the coupling surface CS of the rotor R (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the interior surface <b>257</b> of the housing <b>255</b>, to have a distance that is greater, even if only slightly greater, than the distance denoted by reference letter L′ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Where L′ is measured between the housing coupling surface HS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and end or surface <b>258</b> of the modified slide shaft <b>140</b>′, which is tightened towards the coupling surface CS to extend into the interior of the housing <b>255</b>. With use of the hard and tempered steel materials contemplated for use with the instant invention, even the smallest of differences between L and L′ can establish significant compressive forces so as to ensure preferred or optional pre-loading of the housing <b>255</b> and the axle rod <b>280</b>, <b>280</b>′ during operation of the slide hammer <b>120</b>. In this way, compressive forces can be imparted in the direction of arrow <b>340</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) upon pin <b>290</b> and against axle recess AR and axle A.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">To further explicate the currently illustrated modification of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, in operation, the instant configuration <b>100</b>′ of the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> and the slide hammer (such as hammer <b>120</b> shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>) are operated as explained in connection with embodiments described elsewhere herein and in the directions generally denoted by reference arrow labeled <b>330</b>, but also so as to establish impact loads that are also imparted against the securing tool <b>250</b>, as well as the hammer stop <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>), as can be understood with reference to direction arrows labeled <b>340</b>, <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Such additional operational impact loads will operate to effectively separate the rotor plate R away from the wheel assembly WA. In this illustrated configuration, impact loads can be communicated to the rotor plate R in one direction denoted by arrow <b>350</b> and to the axle A generally in the opposite direction of force arrow <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Even more preferably, for further improved predictive load pathway capabilities, the axle rod <b>280</b>′ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) can be incorporated and adjusted to be in compression between the axle A of the wheel assembly WA and the housing <b>255</b> of the rotor securing tool <b>250</b> by rotation of the slide shaft <b>140</b>′. This adjustment capability of the slide shaft <b>140</b>′ and axle impact bar <b>280</b>′ combination can be preferably established by incorporating optional or preferred threads <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this threaded and adjustable variation, the housing <b>255</b> can be coupled to the rotor plate R whereby the rocker clamps <b>265</b> are initially positioned and loosely fastened to the slots <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, the slide shaft <b>140</b>′ (being received with the alternative axle impact rod or bar <b>280</b>′) is rotated to put the bar or rod <b>280</b>′ into compression as noted and depicted. Then, the rocker clamps <b>265</b> are further tightened to clamp the housing <b>255</b> of the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>250</b> to the rotor plate R. Next, the slide hammer <b>120</b> is actuated through one or more one cycles as desired and in the directions of arrow <b>330</b> outwardly in the direction of arrow <b>350</b> and then in the opposite direction of arrow <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As the rotor plate R begins to separate from the wheel assembly WA, the slide shaft <b>140</b>′ is further tightened to increase and or to reestablish the compressive force upon the axle impact bar or rod <b>280</b>′. In the circumstance where the wheel assembly WA components do not commence separation, a heating source such as an acetylene torch can be employed and can utilize one or more apertures <b>370</b>, <b>380</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that can be preferably or optionally formed in the housing <b>255</b> to receive a nozzle of such a torch.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Such a heating source can be then directed at the appropriate structures of the wheel assembly WA to impart additional temperature differential induced stresses across the interface between the wheel assembly WA components that are seized together. As the components of the wheel assembly WA are heated to dissimilar temperatures, the hammer cycle steps explicated here are repeated and separation of the previously seized components will then be accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">With continued reference to the various figures and now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, those skilled in the art may comprehend additional variations compatible for independent use or use in combination with any of the preceding embodiments. Specifically, a modification is contemplated wherein an automotive wheel assembly removal apparatus <b>100</b>″ is adapted as before to be connected to a wheel assembly and to include a slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> having a slide-tube <b>130</b> mounted hammer <b>120</b> received on a slide shaft <b>140</b> with a distal hammer stop <b>150</b> and a proximal end <b>144</b> with a coupler <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a modified interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>′ can be mounted to the coupler <b>160</b> and be adapted with at least one engagement hole pattern. A further modified configuration contemplates a tensioner coupling feature <b>185</b> that can be formed from any number of possible fastening features, including, for purposes of example without limitation, fastener threads.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A tensioner assembly <b>400</b> is also included and can incorporate a second interchangeable rotor securing tool such as modified tool <b>170</b>′, as well as another interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>″. The tensioner assembly <b>400</b> is further directed to a cross bar <b>410</b> having a generally centrally positioned central bore <b>415</b>. The central bore <b>415</b> is preferably sized to be received about the second interchangeable rotor securing tool. Even more preferably, the central bore <b>415</b> is sized and positioned for receipt about coupler <b>160</b> of the rotor securing tool <b>170</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In operation, the cross bar <b>410</b> imparts loads to the other components of the tensioner assembly <b>400</b> but does not typically come in contact with or otherwise impart any forces or loads to or against the second interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>′. In this way, the contemplated tension loads are established between the rotor securing tools <b>170</b>′ and <b>170</b>″</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">This arrangement sets up a preload there between to improve the removal capability of the removal assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ in the many contemplated configurations. Experience has proven that establishing a preloading tension between the rotor R that has become seized, and the vehicle chassis such as wheel assembly WA can drastically reduce the time needed to remove the rotor R and or other components of the wheel assembly WA.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As may be understood with reference also now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, additional modified optional or preferred embodiments may adopt the tensioner assembly <b>400</b> to be configured to receive a plunger-cylinder assembly <b>430</b>. The plunger-cylinder assembly can be seated between the cross bar and the slide hammer assembly <b>110</b> in a compression arrangement, but to impart tension forces between the rotor securing tools <b>170</b>′ and <b>170</b>″. Many possible plunger cylinders are compatible for use with the instant invention and can include, for illustration purposes without limitation, the RCS-101 and related series plunger cylinders available from ENERPAC, www.enerpac.com.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In various optional or preferred arrangements, the plunger cylinder assembly can be a manually or automatically actuated pneumatic, hydraulic, pneudraulic, and similarly capable device that can impart substantial forces, which will enhance the preload that can be developed during operation. An optional push cap <b>420</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) can be included between the cylinder plunger <b>430</b> and the cross bar <b>410</b> for configurations where an additional spacer may needed to accommodate the particular geometry of the removal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Optional or preferred counter bores may be formed in the interchangeable rotor securing tool <b>170</b>″ and the cross bar <b>410</b> for added convenience in seating the plunger cylinder. For example, counter bore seat <b>425</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>10</b>) can be formed in securing tool <b>170</b>″, and a counter bore seat <b>435</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>10</b>) can be similarly formed in the cross bar <b>410</b> to enable more straightforward centering of the plunger cylinder assembly <b>430</b> in the tensioner assembly <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">A tension link assembly <b>460</b> is fastened in the tensioner assembly <b>400</b> between the interchangeable rotor securing tools <b>170</b>′, <b>170</b>″. A plurality of push links <b>440</b> are adjustably and movably pinned to opposite ends of the cross bar <b>410</b>. A series of adjustment apertures <b>445</b> can be included whereby push link pins <b>450</b> can engage the push links <b>440</b> to the ends of the cross bar <b>410</b>. Further, the pins <b>450</b> can include handles <b>455</b> for lifting and positioning the tensioner assembly <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Preferably, each of the plurality of push links <b>440</b> is configured to be long enough to extend between the tensioner assembly <b>400</b> and to urge and seat against the vehicle chassis, such as the wheel assembly WA and components thereof. In optional embodiments, the push links <b>440</b> can further include straight or curved or specially shaped push rods <b>447</b>. Although push rods <b>447</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to be straight, which is especially useful when needed to urge against leaf-spring-type under carriage components, many other optional push rod <b>447</b> configurations are contemplated to accommodate use of the tensioner assembly <b>400</b> with rocker arms, control arms, chassis frame longerons, and other under carriage structures that may be available on a given vehicle for establishing a firm seat against which the removal apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ can be situated.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one possibly preferred or optional arrangement, the tension link assembly <b>460</b> can incorporate a plurality of tension rods <b>470</b> that can be secured with what are commonly referred to by those skilled in the automotive arts as lug nuts <b>465</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The tension rods <b>470</b> can be received in existing engagement holes of the contemplated hole patterns discussed elsewhere herein. Alternatively, additional hole patterns can be formed with through holes for use with the tension rods <b>470</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In other alternative adaptations, the lug nuts <b>465</b> are not needed when the tension rods <b>470</b> can be threaded into integral bores that can be formed in the rotor securing tools <b>170</b>, <b>170</b>′, <b>170</b>″. In each of these possible variations, the objective is to balance the tensile loads and it is recommended that at least two and more preferably three or more tension rods <b>470</b> be used as described.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further modifications to any of the preceding embodiments can optionally or preferably include a differently configured tension link assembly <b>460</b> wherein a tension cylinder <b>480</b> is used alone and or in combination with the tension rods <b>470</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, those knowledgeable in the relevant arts may come to know that the instant invention can incorporate the tension cylinder <b>480</b> to be a generally hollow tube with cross bar clearance slots <b>485</b> and lug bolts <b>490</b> that can be integrally formed about the cylinder <b>480</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In other variations, a modified tension cylinder <b>480</b>′ may be adapted with a tension stem <b>495</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), which is adapted with internal fastening means such as threads configured to threadably receive the tensioner coupling feature <b>185</b>. In this modification, the tensioner stem <b>495</b> is sized for receipt through the central bore <b>415</b> of the cross bar <b>410</b> and to be threadably received on the tensioner coupling feature <b>185</b> formed on the coupler <b>160</b> of the rotor securing tool <b>170</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Numerous alterations, modifications, and variations of the preferred embodiments, configurations, modifications, variations, and alternatives disclosed herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art and they are all contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the instant invention. For example, although specific embodiments have been described in detail, those with skill in the art can understand that the preceding embodiments and variations can be further modified to incorporate various types of substitute and/or additional materials, components, shapes, relative arrangement of elements, and dimensional and proportional configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Such optional or preferred variations can be particularly well-adapted for compatibility with the wide variety of industrial, commercial, and professional vehicle maintenance service environments known to those working in the field and available in the respective industries. Accordingly, even though only few variations of the present invention are described herein, it is to be understood that the practice of such additional modifications and variations and the equivalents thereof, are within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
