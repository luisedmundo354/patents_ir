<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to computer systems, in particular to virus detection systems for multi-processor systems, for example multi-processor server systems.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One application for the present invention relates to high density computer systems, for example, computer server systems for telecommunications applications. In telecommunications applications, it is important to provide high reliability and high capacity of operation. Various approaches have been taken to providing such high-performance, high reliability systems. Typically such systems are designed around providing redundant resources so that if one component of the system develops a fault, the system remains operational using the redundant resources. Fault tolerance can also be achieved, for example, with multiprocessor systems that provide protection against malicious code causing inconvenience or damage to the systems. High density systems are typically rack mountable, with one or more processor systems occupying a shelf in the rack. The trend in recent times is to make the computers with smaller form factors. This means that more computers can be located in a rack. This has the advantage of increasing the processing density within the racks, and also the advantage of reducing the distance between the computer systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the detection of viruses and malicious code in a higher density computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In situations where a group of individual computer systems (such as servers) are connected to work co-operably with one another, detecting and eliminating viruses and other malicious code may increase the operating reliability, security and availability of the group of computer systems many times over.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect of the invention may provide a server blade. The server blade may comprise a processor and a network interface. The network interface can be configured be connected to a network remote the server blade. The server blade may be configured to detect a malicious code occurrence in traffic on the network. The server blade may be further configured as a field replaceable unit. The server blade of this arrangement may therefore perform a virus detection function for a blade computer system from within the system, thereby providing an efficient and secure virus detection function. Thus the operational reliability, security and availability of the computer system may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Optionally, the server blade may further comprise an enclosure which encloses the processor. Thereby the server blade may be made resilient and handling thereof may be performed with reduced care and attention and may be performed by an unskilled worker.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further aspect of the invention may provide a modular computer system. The modular computer system may comprise a carrier operable removably to receive a plurality of computer system modules therein and a plurality of information processing modules removably received in the carrier, each module having a communications port operable to connect to a communications network internal to the carrier. The modular computer system may also comprise a switch operable to connect to the internal communications network to distribute information messages between the modules and to connect to an external communications network; and a traffic inspection module removably received in the carrier. The traffic inspection module may be operable to connect to the internal communications network to receive an information message, to perform processing on the message to determine a safety status, and to forward the message toward a final destination via the internal communications network dependent upon the determined safety status. This arrangement provides a modular computer system having a virus detection facility integral thereto to enable secure and efficient operation of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of particular embodiments.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments and examples are described hereafter by way of example only in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of an application of a high capacity multiserver system <b>1</b> for implementing a network-connected web site such as, for example, an airline reservation system on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an external network <b>3</b> (e.g., the Internet) for communicating with a user <b>5</b> can be connected to gateways <b>7</b> which can be connected to an entry edge server group <b>9</b> implemented by a web farm. The entry edge server group <b>9</b> forms an interface to the external network <b>3</b>. The entry edge server group <b>9</b> can then be connected by switches <b>11</b> and a firewall <b>13</b> to a web edge server group <b>15</b> that can also be implemented as a web farm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The web edge server group <b>15</b> can serve to cache web pages that are readily accessible to users <b>5</b> accessing the system <b>1</b> from the external network <b>3</b>, for example for checking flight times, etc. The web edge server group can comprise a number of blade server (BS) shelves and a number of network addressable storage (NAS) shelves for storing critical data. The web edge server group <b>15</b> can be further connected by a further firewall <b>17</b> to a plurality of application servers <b>19</b>, which can be responsible for, for example, processing flight reservations. The application servers <b>19</b> can then be connected via a further firewall <b>21</b> to computer systems <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, for example, e-commerce services including financial services for receiving and processing payment for airline reservations.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As will be appreciated, the server system described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is only an example of a possible application for a multiprocessor server system. Multiprocessor server systems have many different applications and the present system is not limited to being applicable for use in only one or a limited number of such applications, rather multiprocessor server systems as described herein are operable for use in many different applications. A non-exhaustive list of such alternative applications includes: e-commerce web server systems; telecommunications network server systems; LAN application and file server systems and remote vehicle control systems.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a schematic perspective representation of a rack system <b>31</b> as viewed from the front including left and right front uprights <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> and left and right rear uprights <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>. The uprights can be formed with apertures for receiving shelf fixings (e.g., screws, bolts, clips, etc., for mounting brackets, slides, rails, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example of a blade server shelf <b>41</b> mounted in the rack system <b>31</b>. The shelf <b>41</b> forms a carrier configured to carry a plurality of information processing cartridges <b>43</b> located side by side along the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term “shelf” is used herein in a conventional way to describe a structure that is mountable in rack system <b>31</b> and is configured to carry one or more components to form at least a part of a rack-mountable system. In the present example, the shelf <b>41</b> is three-dimensional, having a height (H), width (W) and depth (D). In the present example, one dimension (hereinafter described as the height, H) is smaller than the other dimensions (hereinafter described as the depth, D, and the width, W) to facilitate mounting of the shelf within the rack system <b>31</b>. It will be appreciated that although the width and depth are typically constrained by the dimensions of the racking system for which the shelf is designed, there is more freedom as regard the height, subject to taking account of any appropriate standards and packaging considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the information processing cartridges contains at least one processor. Each information processing cartridge in the present example is operable as a server. In the described examples, the information processing cartridges are configured as robust enclosed modules.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the example to be described in more detail presently, the information processing cartridges, when aligned in the carrier shelf, look like rectangular slabs, or blades. Accordingly, an information processing cartridge can be described as a blade. The information processing cartridges <b>43</b> comprise information processing modules enclosed in an enclosure, or housing, so that the information processing modules have the form of cartridges. Also, as the information processing cartridges are to operate as computer servers in the example described in more detail presently, an information processing cartridge <b>43</b> can also be described as a server blade. Accordingly, in the context of this example, the terms module, cartridge and blade are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The illustrated example of a shelf <b>41</b> is configured to carry sixteen information processing cartridges <b>43</b>, each of which is removably mountable in a respective opening <b>45</b> in the front of the shelf, whereby the information processing cartridges can be inserted into and removed from the front of the shelf <b>41</b> without removing the shelf <b>41</b> from the rack system <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present example, the shelf <b>41</b> comprises a three-dimensional, generally rectangular, enclosure, or housing, <b>47</b> that is suitable for mounting in generic racking systems including both 4-post and 2-post systems. It can be mounted on fixed rigid rack mounting cars and/or a simple slide/support system. The present example is designed for standard 19″-wide racking (1″=25.4 mm) as defined, for example, in the well-known IEC297 and EIA 310 specification standards with height corresponding to the so-called 3U (3 standard unit) height. For mounting such a 3U unit in such a 19″-wide racking system, with a depth of, say 25″ or 30″, the enclosure can be arranged with a height of up to about 130.5 mm, a width of up to about 445 mm and a depth, including all hardware and fascias, but excluding cable management, of up to about 635 mm, with the depth from the front-most point of a fascia to a rear I/O connector panel of a rear mounted Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) of about 610 mm. Of course, other examples designed for other racking systems could have different dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">This example of a shelf <b>41</b> has a single enclosure, or housing, <b>47</b> that houses a number of modular units or subsystems, the majority of which are replaceable in the field and are therefore known as Field Replaceable Units (FRUs). These modular units include the information processing cartridges <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The shelf enclosure <b>47</b> can be fabricated from sheet material (e.g., from steel sheet) to form a chassis portion <b>49</b> that includes a base <b>51</b>, two sides <b>53</b> and <b>55</b>, a front <b>57</b> and a rear <b>59</b>. The word “front” as used here is merely used as a label herein to refer to the face, or wall <b>57</b> of the enclosure that is located at the main access side of the rack system <b>31</b> in use when the shelf is mounted therein. Similarly, the words “rear” and “side” are merely used as labels herein to refer to the faces, or walls <b>59</b>, <b>53</b> and <b>55</b> that, in use, are located at those respective positions when the shelf is mounted in the rack system <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The openings <b>45</b> can be formed in the front face <b>57</b> for receiving the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> and, as will be explained later, apertures can also be formed in the rear face <b>59</b> for receiving further FRUs. The enclosure can further include a removable top cover <b>61</b> that can be secured to the chassis portion <b>49</b> by suitable fastening (e.g., screws). The apertures in the front and rear faces <b>57</b> and <b>59</b> allow at least some of the FRUs to be inserted into and/or removed from the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> via the front or the rear thereof, as appropriate, without removing the shelf from the racking. Access to components mounted in the shelf that are not accessible via one of the apertures in the front <b>47</b> and rear <b>59</b> faces can be achieved by removing the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> from the racking system <b>31</b> and then removing the top cover <b>61</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of an example of a shelf <b>41</b> for a first example. A plastic front bezel <b>63</b> can be provided that fits on the front face <b>57</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the chassis <b>49</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>. The front bezel <b>63</b> can be formed as a unitary removable part that spans the whole width and height of the front of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>. The front bezel <b>63</b> could alternatively include a number of separate components, or mouldings. The front bezel can include a peripheral portion <b>64</b> that can provide areas for corporate and product branding marks, for identification and numbering for the information processing cartridge and for a bar code label (all not shown). One or more apertures <b>65</b> can be formed in the peripheral portion <b>64</b> of the bezel <b>63</b>. The apertures <b>65</b> in the bezel can be arranged to align with one or more apertures (e.g. a slot (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the front face of the chassis. In use, air can pass through the apertures <b>65</b> to flow into the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> to reach FRUs that are mounted in the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> through the rear face <b>59</b> thereof. Air flowing through the aperture <b>65</b> flows into a plenum chamber <b>66</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to flow past the processing cartridges <b>43</b> to reach rear mounted FRUs. A central area <b>67</b> of the front bezel <b>63</b> can be open allowing access to the openings <b>45</b> in the front face <b>57</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> for insertion and removal of the information processing cartridges <b>43</b>. Where no active module is mounted in a location for an information processing module, a blanking panel, or filler panel, such as the blanking panel <b>44</b>, can be located in that location. LED indicators <b>69</b> can be mounted on a system indicator printed circuit board (not shown) behind a designated area of the bezel to provide an indication of system status via light guides incorporated into the bezel. A further system indicator board (also not shown) carrying LED indicators can be provided inside the shelf enclosure to be visible from the rear thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned above, in the present example of a shelf, up to sixteen information processing cartridges <b>43</b> can be installed in respective openings <b>45</b> in the front face <b>57</b> thereof. The number of information processing cartridges <b>43</b> actually installed in any installation is dependent upon the system configuration required. Various features relating to the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the rear of the shelf unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. This shows two different types of FRU <b>71</b> and <b>81</b> (4 units in total) that have been inserted into respective apertures <b>72</b> and <b>82</b> in the rear of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>. The FRUs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> include two Combined Switch and Service Processors (CSSPs) <b>71</b> and two Power Supply Units (PSUs) <b>81</b>. Various features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Before proceeding with a more detailed description of each of the FRUs <b>43</b>, <b>71</b> and <b>81</b> introduced so far and of the construction of the shelf <b>41</b>, there follows a brief description of an information processing cartridge <b>43</b>, a CSSP <b>71</b> and a PSU <b>81</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> provides a perspective view, partly from the rear, of an information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> provides a perspective view, partly from the front of the same information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> provides an exploded perspective view of the construction of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. Here is it to be noted that the term “rear” is applied in the context of the position, when installed, of the information processing cartridge, with respect to the shelf <b>41</b> (i.e. in this case the “rear” of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> is the innermost part of the information processing cartridge when it is inserted in the shelf <b>41</b>). Likewise, “front” refers in the present context to the outermost part of the information processing cartridge when it is inserted in the shelf <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B, it will be noted that information processing cartridges are three-dimensional, having a height (h), width (w) and depth (d). If, as in the present example, the information processing cartridges are to be arranged in a one-dimensional array (a row) across the shelf, then efficient packing for the information processing cartridges is achieved where one dimension (here the width, w) is smaller than the other dimensions (here the depth, d, and the height, h). In a particular example, the enclosure of a processing cartridge <b>43</b> has a height h, width w and depth d of 115 mm, 26 mm and 315 mm, respectively, although of course, other examples may have different dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be noted that an enclosure <b>101</b> of the present example of an information processing cartridge <b>43</b> has six, generally rectangular, faces. For convenience only, the face that is visible from the front of the racking when an information processing cartridge <b>43</b> is mounted in the shelf <b>41</b> is known as the front face <b>102</b>. The opposite face is known as the rear face <b>103</b>. In the present example these two faces, as well as top and bottom faces <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>, and the side faces <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> have the shape of elongate rectangles.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although in the present example the information processing cartridges have six generally rectangular faces, it will be appreciated that other examples could have other configurations. For example, rather than having a generally rectangular shape, the side faces of another example of an information processing cartridge could have the general shape of a triangle (whereby the information processing cartridge may then only have five faces), a pentagon (whereby the information processing cartridge may then have seven faces), and so on. Indeed, one or more or all of the edges could be curved. However, it will be appreciated that the present configuration provides advantages for example, in terms of manufacturing, engineering and packing density within a shelf <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this example, the information processing cartridge enclosure <b>101</b> is fabricated from two housing portions. The first housing portion <b>109</b> can be fabricated from, for example, a metal (e.g., pressed steel) and can include one side face <b>106</b>, the rear face <b>103</b> and part of the top face <b>104</b>. The part of the top face formed by the metal portion <b>109</b> is given the reference <b>1041</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The second housing portion <b>110</b> can be fabricated from, for example, a plastics material and can include the other side face <b>107</b> and the front faces <b>102</b> and bottom face <b>105</b> and the remaining part <b>1042</b> of the top face <b>104</b>. In the present example, a plastics material used is PolyCarbonate Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (PCABS), however many other plastics materials such as other ABSs and nylons may be used. The metal portion <b>109</b> also includes a part <b>1021</b> corresponding to the front face <b>102</b> and a part <b>1051</b> corresponding to a part of the bottom face <b>105</b>. The parts are covered by the plastics portion <b>110</b> when enclosure <b>101</b> is fully assembled. These parts are visible in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. The two housing portions <b>109</b> and <b>110</b> are secured to one another by fixings such as screws <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a groove <b>108</b> runs along the length of the plastic top face portion <b>1042</b>. This groove <b>108</b> is provided for interfacing with a guide member of the shelf chassis (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>). A similar groove <b>113</b> is formed in the bottom face <b>105</b> of the plastics portion <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref>. This groove <b>113</b> is provided for interfacing with a guide member of the shelf chassis (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The provision of the enclosure <b>101</b> means that the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> can safely be handled by an operator who is not a skilled technician. Also, through the use of the enclosure <b>101</b>, the information processing cartridge is a robust unit that protects its inner workings from the outside environment and vice versa. The use of a conductive enclosure, e.g., a metal enclosure, can result in the information processing cartridge including its own electromagnetic shielding. To this end, the enclosure <b>101</b> can also be provided with an internal electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding member <b>116</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. The EMI shielding member can be located between the internal components <b>112</b> of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> (not described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 18</figref> below) and the plastics portion <b>110</b>. The EMI shielding member can be secured to the plastics portion <b>110</b>, for example by heat bonding or an adhesive. In other examples, the plastics portion could have a conductive layer deposited thereon, or conductive plastics material could be used. In this example, the EMI shielding member <b>116</b> is provided with electromagnetic interference (EMI) fingers <b>114</b> to ensure good contact with the shelf chassis and the adjacent components. These fingers <b>114</b> extend through EMI finger apertures <b>1141</b> in the plastics portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C, the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> incorporates an injector/ejector handle <b>111</b> on the front face <b>102</b> for facilitating insertion and latching of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> within an aperture in the shelf <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in those Figures, the handle <b>111</b> of the injector/ejector lever extends substantially the whole height of the front face of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>, thereby increasing the mechanical advantage and facilitating injection and ejection of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. As is further shown in those Figures, the front face <b>102</b> of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> has perforations <b>115</b>, in the present example slits, to allow for airflow into the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. The front face part <b>1021</b> of the metal portion <b>109</b> has perforations corresponding to those in the front face <b>102</b> such that airflow into the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> is not impeded. It will be noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>B and SC that the handle <b>111</b> is narrower in its middle than at its ends. This reduces any masking effect of the handle <b>111</b> on the airflow to the perforations <b>115</b> in the front face of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> and facilitates grasping of handle <b>111</b>. The handle <b>111</b> can be bowed out from the front face of the information processing cartridge to further facilitate grasping thereof and to reduce any masking effect with regard to the perforations. In other examples, the handle <b>111</b> could have an open frame-like structure to further facilitate airflow.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the rear face <b>103</b> of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> also has perforations <b>117</b> to allow for air to be exhausted from the rear of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. A fan can be located within the enclosure <b>101</b> of an information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. In the present example the fan is a combined radial fan (blower) and heat sink to direct cooling air onto a processor of the information processing cartridge, which fan also encourages air movement within the enclosure <b>101</b>. LED indicators <b>119</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 and 5B</figref>) can be provided on the front face <b>102</b> of an information processing cartridge to indicate whether power is on, whether service intervention is required and whether the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> can be removed. A connector <b>120</b>, for example a 40 way single connector attachment (SCA-2) connector (a small computer systems interface (SCSI) connector), can be provided at the rear of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> for electrical connection of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> within the shelf <b>41</b>. The connector <b>120</b> is advantageously able to withstand repeated removals and insertions of the enclosure <b>101</b> from and into a shelf <b>41</b>. The connector arrangement can include a guide pin arrangement to prevent module misalignment during insertion of the information processing cartridge into the receiving location.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus an example of features and the construction of an information processing cartridge enclosure has been described. Although particular materials and constructions have been described, it will be appreciated that other examples could be employed. Indeed, it will be appreciated that this particular example relates to only a possible form for the processing cartridge <b>43</b>. An example of an alternative construction will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> provides a perspective view, partly from the rear, of an alternative information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. Here is it to be noted that the term “rear” is applied in the context of the position, when installed, of the information processing cartridge, with respect to the shelf <b>41</b> (i.e. in this case the “rear” of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> is the innermost part of the information processing cartridge when it is inserted in the shelf <b>41</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this example, the information processing cartridge enclosure <b>101</b> is fabricated from pressed steel to form two chassis portions. The first portion <b>234</b> includes one side face <b>107</b>, and part of each of the front and rear faces <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and the top and bottom faces <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>. The second portion <b>235</b> includes the other side face <b>108</b> and the remaining part of each of the front and rear faces <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and the top and bottom faces <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>. The two chassis portions <b>234</b> and <b>235</b> meet at a groove <b>236</b> and are secured to one another by fixings (e.g., one or more screws, not shown). Grooves <b>236</b> run along the top and bottom faces <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> of the enclosure <b>101</b> and are provided for interfacing with guide rails of the shelf chassis <b>49</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>). A cover portion that is secured to the chassis portion forms the other side face <b>106</b>. It will be appreciated however, that in another example, the chassis portions could be joined at a position other than the groove <b>108</b>, with the groove <b>108</b> being formed entirely in one of the chassis portions. Alternatively, the enclosure <b>101</b> may be constructed from a number of sheets of steel, with each sheet forming one of the faces.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> provides a perspective view, partly from the front, of a Combined Switch and Service Processor (CSSP) cartridge (or CSSP) <b>71</b>. Here is it to be noted that the term “front” is applied in the context of the position, when installed, of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b>, with respect to the shelf <b>41</b> (i.e. in this case the “front” of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> is the innermost part of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> when it is inserted in the shelf <b>41</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, it will be noted that a CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> is three-dimensional, having a height (h), width (w) and depth (d). In a particular example, the enclosure of a CSSP <b>71</b> has a height h, width w and depth d of 43 mm, 202 mm and 278 mm, respectively, although of course, other examples may have different dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">An enclosure <b>121</b> of present example of a CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> has six, generally rectangular, faces. For convenience only, the face that is visible from the rear of the racking when a CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> is mounted in the shelf <b>41</b> is known as the rear face <b>122</b>. The opposite face is known as the front face <b>123</b>. In the present example these two faces, as well as side faces <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> have the shape of elongate rectangles. The top and bottom faces <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> are also rectangular, but not elongate in the manner of the front, rear, top and bottom faces. Although in the present example the CSSP cartridges have six generally rectangular faces, as for the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> it will be appreciated that other examples could have other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this example, the CSSP enclosure <b>121</b> is fabricated from steel sheet to form a chassis portion that includes the bottom face <b>125</b>, the front and rear faces <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> and the side faces <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. A cover portion that is secured to the chassis portion forms the other top face <b>124</b>. The cover portion is secured to the chassis portion by suitable fixings, for example one or more screws <b>128</b>. It will be appreciated however, that in another example, other faces, or portions, of the enclosure could form the chassis and the cover portions. The provision of the enclosure <b>121</b> means that the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> can safely be handled by an operator who is not a skilled technician. Also, through the use of the enclosure <b>121</b>, the switch cartridge is a robust unit that protects its inner workings from the outside environment and vice versa. The use of a conductive enclosure, e.g., a metal enclosure, means that the CSSP cartridge includes its own electromagnetic shielding. To this end the CSSP enclosure <b>121</b> is provided with EMI fingers <b>129</b> to ensure good contact with the shelf chassis and the adjacent components.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> incorporates two D-shaped handles <b>132</b> to facilitate insertion and removal of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> with respect to an aperture <b>72</b> in the rear face of the shelf enclosure. A latch member <b>131</b> can be pivotably mounted on a plate that can be secured (e.g., using screws) to the rear face of the shelf enclosure. The latch member <b>131</b> is configured to engage one of the handles <b>132</b> and to secure the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> in place. In other examples, the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> could be provided with an injector/ejector handle in a manner similar to the information processing cartridge. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the front face <b>123</b> of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> has perforations <b>133</b> to allow for airflow into the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rear face <b>122</b> of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> has perforations <b>135</b> to allow for air to be exhausted from the rear of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At least one fan can be located, for example behind the perforated portion <b>135</b> of the rear face, in a CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> to channel cooling air through the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> from the front to the rear. In this particular example shown, two fans are provided, one behind each set of perforations <b>135</b>. LED indicators <b>137</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be provided on the rear face <b>122</b> of the CSSP enclosure <b>121</b> to indicate whether power is on, whether service intervention is required and whether the switch can be removed. Additional link status indicators can be provided integral to 2×4 stacked RJ-45 connectors <b>139</b>, also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, electrical connections <b>141</b> can be provided at the front face of the CSSP (i.e. on the face that in use is inside the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>). Suitable connections for use in the present example including a connector for power connections, a connector for serial management data connections and a connector for information connections. In the present example, information connections are implemented using an Ethernet information communication protocol, e.g. at 1 Gigabit (Gb). However other protocols could equally be used, for example the Infiniband information communication protocol. The connector arrangement can include a guide pin arrangement to prevent module misalignment during insertion of the CSSP module into the receiving location. For this purpose, guide pin holes <b>142</b> can be provided on the front face <b>123</b> into which guide pins may pass to aid module alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the present example, up to two CSSPs <b>71</b> can be mounted at any one time at the rear of the shelf unit in corresponding apertures <b>72</b> in the rear face of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>. The number of CSSPs <b>71</b> provided in any particular implementation depends upon system configuration and the need, or otherwise, for redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It will be appreciated that one possible construction of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> has been described and that as for the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>, other examples could employ other materials and/or constructions.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides a perspective view, partly from the front, of a power supply unit (PSU) cartridge <b>81</b>. Here is it to be noted that the term “front” is applied in the context of the position, when installed, of the PSU cartridge <b>81</b>, with respect to the shelf <b>41</b> (i.e. in this case the “front” of the PSU cartridge <b>81</b> is the innermost part of the PSU cartridge <b>81</b> when it is inserted in the shelf <b>41</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, it will be noted that PSU cartridge <b>81</b> is three-dimensional, having a height (h), width (w) and depth (d). In this particular example, the order to provide for a dense packing of the FRUs in the rear of the shelf <b>41</b>, the PSU cartridge <b>81</b> has two dimensions (hereinafter described as the width, w, and the depth, d) that are generally similar. In a particular example, the enclosure of a PSU cartridge <b>81</b> has a height h, width w and depth d of 83 mm, 202 mm and 276 mm, respectively, although of course, other examples may have different dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An enclosure <b>145</b> of present example of a PSU cartridge <b>81</b> is of generally oblong shape, but has the “top” “front” edge cut away to form an additional “top” “front” sloping face. The enclosure <b>145</b> therefore has five, generally rectangular, faces and two faces of generally rectangular shape with one comer cut away. For convenience only, the face that is visible from the rear of the racking when the PSU cartridge <b>81</b> is mounted in the shelf <b>41</b> is known as the rear face <b>146</b>. The opposite face is known as the front face <b>147</b>. In the present example these two faces and the two side faces <b>150</b>, <b>151</b> are of elongate, generally rectangular shape with one corner cut away, given that the width and depth of the PSU cartridge are similar, whereas the top and bottom faces <b>148</b>, <b>149</b>, although still rectangular, are not, in this example, notably elongate. A top front face <b>148</b><i>a </i>is present at the top front of the enclosure. Thus the front of the enclosure is sloped at the top edge. As for the information processing cartridges <b>43</b>, however, it will be appreciated that other examples could have other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this example, the PSU cartridge enclosure <b>145</b> is fabricated from steel sheet to form a housing portion that includes the bottom face <b>149</b>, the side faces <b>150</b> and <b>151</b> and the front and rear faces <b>146</b> and <b>147</b>. Cover portions that are secured to the housing portion form the top face <b>148</b> and top front face <b>148</b><i>a</i>. The cover portions are secured to the chassis portion by suitable fixings, for example one or more screws <b>152</b>. It will be appreciated however, that in another example, other faces, or portions, of the enclosure could form the chassis and the cover portions.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the PSU cartridge <b>81</b> incorporates two D-shaped handles <b>156</b> to facilitate insertion and removal of the PSU cartridge <b>81</b> with respect to an aperture <b>82</b> in the rear face of the shelf enclosure. A latch member <b>155</b> can be pivotably mounted on a plate that can be secured (e.g., using screws) to the rear face of the shelf enclosure. The latch member <b>155</b> is configured to engage one of the handles <b>156</b> and to secure the PSU <b>81</b> in place.

Electrical connectors <b>163</b> can be provided at the front face of the PSU (i.e. on the face that in use is inside the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>) for connection to the shelf. The PSU <b>81</b> of the present example may suitably employ an SSI-MPS (Server Systems Interface—Midrange Power Supply) compliant right angle connector at the front face <b>147</b> of the PSU <b>81</b> to connect to the shelf <b>41</b>. The power inlet <b>83</b> for each PSU <b>81</b> can incorporate a cable/connector retention mechanism (not shown) on the rear face <b>146</b> of the PSU to prevent accidental or malicious removal of the power input cord from the PSU <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the present example, the shelf unit enclosure provides slots at the rear of the shelf unit for two hot-swappable, AC input PSUs <b>81</b>. To provide redundant power supply, both PSU slots are populated. More generally, N+M power supplies can be provided, where N is the minimum number of power supply units needed to support the components mounted in the shelf, and M is a selectable number of 0, 1 or more power supplies to provide for redundancy. In the present example, N=M=1.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It will be appreciated that one possible construction of the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> has been described and that as for the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>, other examples could employ other materials and/or constructions.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the full complement of information processing cartridges or switches are not fitted to the enclosure, then blanking panels/modules (e.g., the blanking panels <b>44</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are fitted to all unpopulated positions to maintain the correct airflow and thermal characteristics of the shelf, a safe internal operating temperature for the shelf life expectancy of all shelf components, electromagnetic compliance (EMC) containment and electrostatic discharge (ESD) containment.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It will be noted that each of the FRUs, such as, the information processing cartridges <b>43</b>, is advantageously contained in its own robust enclosure to facilitate EMC containment, ESD containment, handling, storage and transportation. Each FRU can be configured as a ‘sealed’ unit in the sense that it can be configured not to have field or customer serviceable parts internally. The FRUs can be configured readily to plug into the shelf enclosure and to be hot swappable. The FRUs can be keyed to prevent incorrect positioning and insertion into the shelf enclosure and are arranged positively to be retained in the shelf by a latching/locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The examples of FRUs described above are not provided with removable media. In the present example, internal data storage is provided by 2.5″ IDE 9.5 mm or 12.7 mm profile hard disk drive (HDD) devices mounted internally in each information processing cartridge <b>43</b> and in the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b>. The drives are not considered as FRUs and are not hot-swappable disk drives in the present example, although they could be in other examples.

Although, for reasons of ease of illustration a slot shaped aperture <b>68</b> is shown, a plurality of apertures <b>68</b> aligned with the blade receiving locations may be provided. The aperture or apertures <b>68</b> can serve both as air vents for a flow of air to the plenum chamber <b>66</b>, and also as latching locations for latching portions at the top of the injector/ejector levers <b>111</b> for the blades shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref>. The top and sides of the plenum chamber are provided by the top cover <b>61</b> and side faces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A plurality of cartridge guides <b>97</b> can be provided at the underside of the plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b>. In the present example, these guides comprise sprung wire members, e.g., of a resilient metal such as spring steel, that are attached to the top surface of the plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b> and extend through a plurality of apertures therethrough to result in a row of guides <b>97</b> at the underside of the plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b>. This arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the sprung wire members <b>98</b> are shown attached to the top surface of the plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b>. In the present example, the sprung wire members <b>98</b> are arranged in pairs, such that two guides <b>97</b> are provided by each spring clip <b>98</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the guides <b>97</b> formed by the protruding portions of the sprung wire members <b>98</b> are shown at the underside of the plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b>. Each guide <b>97</b> is advantageously positioned so as to interface with the groove <b>108</b> in the plastics material in the upper face <b>104</b> of a processing cartridge <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> to aid correct alignment and to facilitate insertion of the processing cartridge during insertion of the cartridge into the shelf <b>41</b>. The use of the spring clip as a guide <b>97</b> also serves to urge the processing cartridge downwards to provide a secure mounting of the processing cartridge <b>43</b>, to take account of manufacturing and operational tolerances and to assist in insertion of the processing cartridge where an operator does not align this absolutely correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A further row of cartridge guides <b>99</b> can be provided at the upper surface of the base <b>51</b> of the shelf <b>41</b>. In the present example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, these guides <b>99</b> have a rail like form, which can be achieved by punching or stamping through the base <b>51</b> of the shelf <b>41</b>. In this example each guide, or rail, <b>99</b> includes a pair of upstands separated by an aperture <b>100</b> through the base <b>51</b>. The size of the aperture <b>100</b> can correspond to the width between the upstands. The separation of the upstands is selected so that the overall width of the resulting rails is slightly less than the width of a groove formed in the lower face of an information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. Thus, each guide <b>97</b> is advantageously arranged so as to interface with the groove <b>1113</b> in the plastics material in the lower face <b>104</b> of a processing cartridge <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> to aid correct alignment and to facilitate insertion of the processing cartridge during insertion of the cartridge into the shelf <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the present example, where the guides <b>97</b> and <b>99</b> are formed from metal, the provision of the grooves <b>108</b> and <b>113</b> in plastics material at the upper and lower faces, respectively, of each information processing cartridge <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>) results in a combination of metal and plastics materials that can provide a low friction interaction, facilitating insertion of the information processing cartridges.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">If, for example, the information processing cartridge enclosure is made of a metal, it may be undesirable to provide metal guides to avoid a metal to metal interaction. In such a case, for example, it may be desirable to form the guides from a plastics material having a low coefficient of friction, such as polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) or polythene. Plastics rails could be attached to the underside of the plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b> and/or on the upper surface of the base <b>51</b> of the shelf <b>41</b>. In such an example, grooves on the upper and lower faces of the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> could then be formed of metal or plastics and still result in a low friction arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A CSSP/PSU divider <b>96</b> can be provided to the rear of the midplane <b>171</b> and can extend horizontally to the rear face <b>59</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b>. The CSSPs <b>71</b>, when inserted, are supported by the divider <b>96</b>. To aid the correct insertion of the CSSPs <b>71</b>, CSSP guide pins <b>178</b> are provided on the midplane <b>171</b> at positions adjacent connectors <b>177</b> on the midplane <b>171</b> for connection to the CSSPs <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Respective positions <b>88</b> and <b>89</b> can be formed in the front face <b>57</b> and the rear face <b>59</b> at which first and second indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b> supporting the indicator LEDs <b>69</b> can be located. These positions <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> therefore include an aperture through the respective face of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> such that indicator LEDs <b>69</b> mounted onto a circuit board attached to the inside of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> may be viewed from outside the shelf enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">There now follows are more detailed description of the midplane <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As mentioned above, the midplane <b>171</b> connects all the elements of a shelf together, including, in the present example, up to sixteen information processing cartridges <b>43</b>, up to two CSSPs <b>71</b>, two PSUs <b>81</b> and the two indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b>. In the present example, due to its location within the shelf enclosure, the midplane <b>171</b> is not configured to be swappable. Accordingly, to maximize the system reliability, the midplane is configured to provide as a high level of reliability as possible. To this end, the midplane is advantageously configured without active devices and to include the minimum number of decoupling capacitors consistent with good design practice (ideally zero).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The midplane supports a number of paths for various power and signal lines to interconnect the FRUs.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the present example, each information processing cartridge <b>43</b> has a high speed information signal connection (e.g., a Gigabit (Gb) Ethernet SERializer/DESerializer (SERDES) connection) to each of the CSSPs <b>71</b>, each connection consisting of two pairs of differential signals. In a conventional manner therefore, the tracking of the paths for these signals is arranged to keep the pairs well balanced and on a single signal layer (i.e. without vias) to support such differential signals at high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, in the present example, each information processing cartridge <b>43</b> has a serial console connection to the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b>. Each connection consists of two TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) level signals that make a transmit and return (TX and RX) pair.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also, each PSU <b>81</b> has a management signal connection (e.g., a serial <b>12</b>C (Inter-IC Bus) connection) to the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> to control power and monitor environmental parameters. The I2C bus comprises of two signals SCL and SDL (serial clock line and serial data line). In addition, an I2C address programming pin is provided for the PSUs <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Each information processing cartridge <b>43</b> and PSU <b>81</b> can signal to the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> that it is inserted by pulling to ground (GND) a respective Inserted_L signal (i.e., an active low signal). These signals are fed to the CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> via the midplane <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Each PSU <b>81</b> has five 12 Volt output rails. The routing from each PSU <b>81</b> is arranged so that a fault in any single FRU cannot completely interrupt the power to any other.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As mentioned above, the midplane <b>171</b> is provided with appropriate connector arrangements for receiving the connectors on the FRUs.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the present example, the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> connects to the midplane <b>171</b> through a 40 pin Single Connector Attachment (SCA-2) connector as defined by the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) standard. Accordingly, the midplane carries corresponding connectors <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the present example, each CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> connects to the midplane <b>171</b> through a two right-angle 20 pair connector (e.g., 2 mm HM-Zd connectors available from Tyco Electronics). The corresponding connectors <b>177</b> on the midplane are straight male parts with a power connector. A guide pin arrangement is provided in addition to the connectors to prevent misaligned modules causing bent pins during insertion. The guide pin also provides a leading ground. The CSSP cartridge <b>71</b> also connects to the midplane <b>171</b> through a right-angled 125 way 5 row 2 mm connector. The connector <b>177</b> on the midplane <b>171</b> includes a straight male part. A guide pin arrangement is provided in addition to the connectors to prevent misaligned modules causing bent pins during insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the present example, as mentioned above, each PSU <b>81</b> connects to the midplane <b>171</b> through an SSI-MPS specification connector. The contacts are configured 5P/24S/6P with sequenced signal (S) and power (P) pins. Where the connector on the PSU is a 1450230-1 R/A male header, solder tails connector, the mating connector <b>179</b> on the midplane can be a 1450540-2 vertical receptacle, press-fit connector.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the present implementation, indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) are provided at the front and rear of the system and are configured as FRUs. In this example they hold three system-level indicator LEDs <b>69</b> and include a FRU identity (FRU-ID) programmable read-only memory (PROM) each. Three LEDs <b>69</b> are present on the indicator board. There can, for example, be a white locator LED that can be switched by the user for locating the system; a green power-on LED to indicate when the system is powered; and an amber service-required LED to indicate a fault or other condition requiring servicing. These LEDs can be driven by the CSSP <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the present example, identification information (FRU ID) for the midplane <b>171</b> is held on an I2C electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) in the front indicator board <b>183</b>. In addition to the I2C signals necessary to access the FRU ID EEPROM, the CSSPs <b>71</b> provide a current limited supply to the indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b> via the midplane. The indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b> are also provided with an I2C address programming pin. Depending on the implementation, FRU ID information can be stored instead, or in addition, on the rear indicator board <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As the FRU-ID for the midplane <b>171</b> is held on one or both of the indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b>, the midplane can be a totally passive unit. The FRU-ID PROMs communicate with the CSSPs <b>71</b> via an I2C bus. Each device on the bus has a separate I2C address. The lower three I2C address bits of the EEPROMs used are available as pins on the device, to allow programming with resistors. The least significant bit of this address (A<b>0</b>) is passed to the midplane via the corresponding connector. This allows the midplane <b>171</b> to program the address of the FRU-ID differently for the front and rear indicator boards <b>183</b> and <b>184</b>, by pulling the address low for the front board and high for the rear indicator board <b>183</b>. This ensures that both EEPROMS are available on the bus, at different addresses. The FRU-ID for the midplane can be stored on either front or rear EEPROM, but the present example the FRU-ID is stored in the EEPROM on the front indicator board <b>183</b>. The EEPROM can be 8 kByte or larger.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As mentioned above, the midplane <b>171</b> includes openings <b>185</b> to provide a ventilation path for cooling air passing through the shelf <b>41</b>. The cooling air passing through the shelf <b>41</b> via the midplane <b>171</b> can be driven by means of fans provided in each of the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> and the power supply modules <b>81</b>. The openings <b>185</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B</figref>, <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B and <b>9</b>C form schematic representations of openings in the midplane <b>171</b>. In practice, the openings could have any form (i.e., a series of large openings, or a number of small perforations), arranged on the midplane to align with corresponding openings or ventilation apertures in the various field replaceable units <b>43</b>, <b>71</b> and <b>81</b>. In this way, the path of the airflow from the front of the shelf to the back of the shelf can be configured to be as efficient as possible, depending on the detail configuration of the fan units and the ventilation openings or apertures in the information processing, switch, service processor and power supply unit modules <b>43</b>, <b>71</b> and <b>81</b>. Providing the fan units in the field replaceable units <b>43</b>, <b>71</b> and <b>81</b>, contributes to the aim of maintaining the chassis <b>49</b> and the midplane <b>171</b> of the shelf <b>41</b> free of active components, thereby minimising cost, and facilitating maintenance. Also, by providing the fan units in each of the field replaceable units, merely inserting and removing field replaceable units automatically adapts the flow of cooling air to the number and type of field replaceable units inserted in the shelf <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As described above, in the present example each of the FRUs is designed to be a non-user serviceable unit. Thus each FRU presents the user with a “sealed” unit which may be inserted into and removed from the shelf <b>41</b> as desired or required. If a FRU ceases to be operable, then the user has a choice only of returning the FRU to a supplier or service company for repair or of discarding the non-operable unit. As the FRUs are non-user serviceable, there is no requirement for a skilled technician to be employed in inserting or removing the FRUs into or from a shelf <b>41</b>. Thus each FRU is designed such that a non-skilled person should have difficulty in causing damage to the FRU during handling. Moreover, the configuration and construction of the FRUs (e.g., the injector/ejector levers, the grooves in the enclosures of the information processing units, etc.), of the shelf enclosure and the midplane (e.g., the guide rails to guide insertion of the FRUs, the locating pins, etc.) contribute to facilitating easy insertion and removal of the FRUs.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an example of the flow of cooling air through the shelf <b>41</b> and FRUs <b>43</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>81</b> mounted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In this example, the cooling air passing through the shelf <b>41</b> is drawn generally in a front to rear direction through the shelf <b>41</b> by cooling fans mounted within the CSSPs <b>71</b> and the PSUs <b>81</b>. Two separate flow paths for cooling air are provided in this example. The first, indicated as flow path αα by dotted lines <b>77</b> provides cooling air to the CSSPs <b>71</b>. The second path, indicated as flow path γγ by dotted lines <b>78</b> provides cooling air to the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> and PSUs <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The flow of cooling air along path αα enters the shelf <b>41</b> through the aperture(s) <b>65</b> in the front face <b>57</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> into the plenum chamber <b>66</b>. Further apertures (not shown) could also be provided in the side faces <b>53</b> and <b>55</b> of the shelf enclosure <b>47</b> to allow air to flow into the plenum chamber <b>66</b>. This air then flows through the plenum chamber <b>66</b>, and passes over the top edge of the midplane <b>171</b> to reach the perforations <b>133</b> of the front face of the CSSPs <b>71</b>. The cooling air then passes through the CSSPs <b>71</b>, providing cooling to the components thereof before passing out of the CSSPs <b>71</b> through the perforations <b>135</b> in the rear face of the CSSPs <b>71</b> thus being exhausted from the shelf <b>41</b>. This flow of cooling air along flow path αα is driven by fans <b>79</b> mounted within the CSSPs <b>71</b>. In the present example, a pair of fans <b>79</b> is provided within each CSSP <b>71</b> and is mounted against the rear face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Air flowing along path αα is impeded from flowing around the processing cartridges <b>43</b> by plenum chamber floor member <b>94</b> and is impeded from flowing to the PSUs <b>81</b> by CSSP/PSU divider <b>96</b>. This flow path αα therefore ensures that air flowing to the CSSPs <b>71</b> is not warmed by passage though the processing cartridges <b>43</b> and therefore provides maximum efficiency cooling to the CSSPs <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The flow of cooling air along path γγ enters the shelf <b>41</b> through the perforations <b>115</b> in the front face of the information processing cartridges <b>43</b>. The air thus enters the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> and provides cooling to the components thereof. Cooling fans (not shown) within the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> direct the cooling air to the processor (CPU) of the information processing cartridge and direct the flow of air in the cartridge thereby increasing cooling efficiency. The air then exits the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> through the perforations <b>117</b> in the rear face thereof. The air then passes through the apertures <b>185</b> through the midplane <b>171</b> to reach the PSUs <b>81</b>. This cooling air then passes though the perforations <b>157</b> on the front and upper front faces of the PSUs <b>81</b> to enter the PSUs and provide cooling to components thereof. It will be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> that the sloping rear of the upper face of the PSUs <b>81</b> increases the area over which air can be drawn into the PSUs, thereby reducing the back pressure on the air flowing through the shelf unit and aiding the cooling efficiency. The flow of cooling air along path γγ is driven by fans <b>85</b> mounted within the PSUs <b>81</b>. In the present example, a pair of fans <b>85</b> is provided within each PSUs <b>81</b> and are mounted against the rear face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Air reaching the PSUs <b>81</b> via path γγ will already have passed through the processing cartridges <b>43</b>. Such air will therefore be already warmed above the ambient temperature outside of the shelf <b>41</b> by its passage through the processing cartridges <b>43</b>. However, as the cooling requirement of the PSUs <b>81</b> is typically less than that for the CSSPs <b>71</b>, this does not cause any difficulty in the operation of the PSUs <b>81</b>, which are adequately cooled by this flow of pre-warmed air. The pre-warmed air passing through the apertures <b>185</b> through the midplane <b>171</b> is impeded from flowing into path αα and entering the CSSPs <b>71</b> by the SCCP/PSU divider <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As will be appreciated by the skilled addressee, the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is illustrative only and other arrangements whereby, for example, a mixture of cool air from the plenum chamber <b>66</b> and warmed air from the processing cartridges <b>43</b> is provided to each rear-mounted FRU can readily be constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there now follows a description of functional elements of an information processing cartridge <b>43</b> as contained within the information processing cartridge enclosure <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The information processing cartridge <b>43</b> includes a microprocessor <b>192</b> (a non-limiting example of a microprocessor that can be utilised in the present example is an UltraSPARC™ processor). The microprocessor is mounted on an information processing cartridge motherboard <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">A configurable clock generator <b>193</b>, configured as a programmable clock synthesizer employing a crystal, can be used to produce CPU clock signals, CLKA and CLKB. The clock frequency can be determined by jumper settings (not shown). A vectored interrupt controller (I-Chip) <b>195</b> and a configurable core voltage regulator module (VPM) <b>195</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the present example, memory means for use by the processor <b>192</b> when executing instructions can be provided in the form of buffered dynamic random access memory (DRAM), for example configured as dual in line memory modules (DIMMs) <b>196</b> with a 72-bit data path with error correction codes (ECC), seated in two sockets on a riser card from the information processing cartridge motherboard <b>191</b>. The memory capacity can be chosen to suit the processor addressable memory space. For example, in the present example, up to 4 Gigabytes (4GB) of addressable memory can be provided. Serial Presence Detect (SPD) auto-configuration is provided via a Service Management Bus (SMBus) over an I2C bus <b>197</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the present example, a PCI bus architecture can be employed with a so-called SouthBridge bus bridge <b>199</b> with SuperIO and two Gb Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) devices. As described above, however, other bus protocols (e.g., Infiniband) can be used. A 32 bit PCI bus <b>198</b> can be provided from the microprocessor <b>192</b>. The SouthBridge <b>199</b> is a standard form of bus bridge, in the present example packaged in a 352 pin PBGA (Plastic Ball Grid Array) package, that provides the following functions: an SM Bus interface over the I2C bus <b>197</b> for access to the SPD (Serial Presence Detect) feature of the DIMMs that allows initialization of the memory controller; an Xbus interface for access via an Xbus <b>200</b> (which is a packet switched multiprocessor bus) to a PROM <b>201</b>, a real time clock (RTC) <b>202</b> and an information processing cartridge service controller (hereinafter termed a Blade Service Controller (BSC)) <b>203</b>; an IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) interface that provides an ATA-100 (AT Attachment) IDE connection <b>204</b> to an IDE disk drive <b>205</b>; and a serial console interface on a service bus <b>206</b> to the BSC <b>203</b> that is used for operating system functions including a console function with this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For IO to the midplane <b>171</b>, two AC-coupled Ethernet interfaces <b>207</b> aid <b>208</b> are provided in the present example, which are packaged in a 316 pin PBGA. These Ethernet interfaces can provide a PCI attached Ethernet MAC capable of operation up to Gigabit Ethernet performance. The physical layer can be implemented using SERializer/DESerializers (SERDESs) <b>209</b> and <b>210</b>. An example of a SERDES device is the TLK2201 transceiver manufactured by Texas Instruments, Inc. The SERDES devices use differential PECL TX+/− and RX+/− (Positive Emitter Coupled Logic Transmit and Receive) pairs to communicate to the switch portions of the CSSPs <b>71</b> over the midplane <b>171</b>. The RX+/− pairs can be AC coupled at the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>, the TX+/− pairs can be AC coupled at each CSSP <b>71</b>. This facilitates hot-swap of the information processing cartridges <b>43</b> and the CSSPs <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Asynchronous serial connections <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> for communication between the BSC <b>203</b> and the Service Processor parts of the CSSPs <b>71</b> can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Internal data storage can be provided in the present example by a hard disk <b>205</b> with a capacity of 30GB or more rated for 24/7 continuous operation. The hard disk <b>205</b> is accessed using the primary IDE interface of the SouthBridge <b>199</b>. The hard disk <b>205</b> can hold an operating system, for example a Solaris operating system, and other software and data for performing information processing using the main, or host, processor (CPU) within the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the present implementation, the BSC <b>203</b> can be implemented as a microcontroller (e.g., a Hitachi H8 microcontroller). The BSC <b>203</b> can provide various functions, including for example: dual access (for the information processing cartridges and the CSSPs <b>71</b>) to PROM <b>201</b> and EEPROM <b>213</b> for boot information and a FRU-ID for the information processing cartridge; channelling communication between an information processing cartridge <b>43</b> and the service processor part of the CSSPs <b>71</b>; control of power on reset (POR), system reset and externally initiated reset (XIR) to the microprocessor <b>192</b>; control of the power, service-required and ready-to-remove LEDs <b>69</b>; upgrading of field-upgradable firmware, via the serial interface; a watchdog function for the operating system; monitoring the spaced of a CPU fan <b>214</b>; and communications with an EEPROM <b>215</b> and the operating system via the Xbus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the present example, the BSC <b>203</b> can be powered by a 5V service bus (SB) rail as soon as a CSSP <b>71</b> and a PSU <b>81</b> are fully inserted into the midplane <b>171</b>, it then turns on other DC/DC converters to provide power to the remainder of the information processing cartridge <b>43</b>. A BSC reset signal can be derived from a simple conventional power on reset (POR) generator that monitors a 5V supply rail.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the present example a 1MByte Flash PROM <b>201</b> can be provided for storing boot variables for OpenBoot™ PROM (OBP) and Power-On-Self-Test (POST). Further OBP variables can be stored in a second 16 kByte (16 kB) I2C PROM <b>215</b>, accessible via the SouthBridge SM Bus port over the IC Bus <b>197</b>. The PROM <b>215</b> can contain 8 kByte for OBP variables and 8 kByte of unused space. A 16 kByte I2C EEPROM <b>213</b> that is accessible via the BSC <b>203</b> can contain BSC variables and FRU-ID variables. The EEPROM is nominally divided into 8 kByte for FRU-ID and 8 kByte for the BSC variables. Write protection for the FRU-ID is implemented by BSC firmware.

Diode protection can be provided by diodes <b>406</b> and <b>414</b> respectively. The speed of the fan <b>403</b> can be controlled by a speed controller <b>409</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The two speed controllers <b>408</b>, <b>409</b> can in turn be controlled by a data input from each CSSP <b>71</b> received via an I2C bus connection (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Power supply lines carrying DC power for the other FRUs of the shelf <b>41</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as power line <b>416</b>. All power connections to and from the PSU <b>81</b> can connect to the midplane <b>171</b> when the PSU is inserted in the shelf <b>41</b> via the midplane connector <b>163</b>. In the present example the PSU <b>81</b> connects to the shelf through a 5P/24S/6P configuration SSI-MPS compliant right angle connector <b>163</b> at the front face <b>147</b> of the PSU <b>81</b>. Connectors for the I2C interface can also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The input power line <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> for each fan <b>402</b> and <b>403</b> can be provided with a softstart module <b>4131</b> and <b>4132</b> respectively, to allow for hot insertion of the PSU <b>81</b> into the shelf <b>41</b>. The softstart modules <b>4131</b> and <b>4132</b> can be controlled, for example, by pulling a signal to ground (e.g., a “mated” input line <b>4151</b> and <b>4152</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Where the two input power lines <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> are separate lines having separate softstart provision, there is no common failure mode for the backup method of powering the fans <b>402</b>, <b>403</b>. Thus even if the PSU <b>81</b> ceases to be operable to generate the DC supply, and a component (power line or softstart module for example) fails in the supply path from the second PSU <b>81</b> to the fans <b>402</b>, <b>403</b>, at least one of the fans <b>402</b>, <b>403</b> can remain operational as the shelf <b>41</b> still receives the cooling effect of three PSU fans.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the present example, the power supply has four rear panel LED indicators <b>137</b>. A blue “Ready to Remove” LED can be driven by the I2C interface and indicate that the power supply may be removed from the system. An amber “Service Required” LED can be driven by the I2C interface and indicate that the power supply is in a fault condition: any output out of range, over-temperature or shutdown. A green “DC Output-OK” indicator can be driven by internal power supply circuits and show that the main 12 volt supply is functioning. The LEDs can remain lighted when individual outputs are in the current limited mode of operation. A green “AC Input-OK” indicator can be driven by internal power supply circuits and show that AC input power is within normal operating range.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there will now be described an example of data connectivity between the FRUs and midplane of the shelf <b>41</b>. Power transmission paths are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. However, it will be appreciated that to facilitate the maximum component redundancy of the shelf <b>41</b>, each PSU <b>81</b> can independently provide power to each FRU.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In the present example each of the processing cartridges (blades) <b>43</b> connects to the midplane <b>171</b> via a pair of information signal connections (e.g. Gb Ethernet links) <b>224</b>, <b>225</b> and a pair of serial management signal connections <b>226</b>, <b>227</b>. Connections within the midplane <b>171</b> can ensure that each Ethernet link <b>224</b> is directed to a connection <b>265</b>-<b>268</b> from the midplane <b>171</b> to a first switch <b>73</b>, and that each Ethernet link <b>225</b> is directed to a connection <b>265</b>-<b>268</b> from the midplane <b>171</b> to a second switch <b>73</b>. Thus one Ethernet link can be established between each processing cartridge <b>43</b> and the switch <b>73</b> of each CSSP <b>71</b>. Further connections within the midplane <b>171</b> can ensure that each serial connection <b>226</b> is directed to a connection <b>310</b> from the midplane <b>171</b> to the first SSP <b>74</b> and that each serial connection <b>227</b> is directed to the second SSP <b>74</b>. Thus one serial link can be established between each processing cartridge <b>43</b> and the SSP <b>74</b> of each CSSP <b>71</b>. As mentioned earlier, information signal connections other than Gb Ethernet connections (e.g. Infinband connections) could be employed in other examples.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">A plurality of serial connections can connect each SSP <b>74</b> to the other. Serial lines <b>320</b>, <b>321</b> can connect each SSP <b>74</b> to the midplane <b>171</b> and connections within the midplane can connect the two sets of lines together. To provide a control interface from the SSPs <b>74</b> to the PSUs <b>81</b>, serial lines <b>322</b> can connect each SSP <b>74</b> to the midplane <b>171</b> and connections within the midplane <b>171</b> can connect to serial lines <b>324</b> from the midplane <b>171</b> to each PSU <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">An example of data and control connectivity of the shelf <b>41</b> to and from computer systems external to the shelf <b>41</b> when the shelf <b>41</b> is arranged for use within a multiprocessor server system such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">As summarised above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in the present example each processing cartridge, or blade, <b>43</b> is connected to the switch <b>73</b> of each CSSP <b>71</b> by an information signal connection (e.g. a 1Gb Ethernet link) formed by a combination of links <b>224</b>, <b>225</b> from the processing cartridge <b>43</b> to the midplane <b>171</b>, connections within the midplane <b>171</b> and links <b>265</b>-<b>268</b> from the midplane <b>171</b> to each switch <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Further, in this example a set of serial management signal connections comprising links <b>320</b>, <b>321</b> and connections within the midplane <b>171</b> connect the SSP <b>74</b> of each CSSP <b>71</b> to the SSP <b>74</b> of the other CSSP <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">To provide external data connectivity between the shelf <b>41</b> and an external core data network <b>330</b>, in association with which all information processing performed by the processing cartridges <b>43</b> of the shelf <b>41</b> is undertaken, connections <b>331</b> can be formed between the core data network <b>330</b> and the eight 1Gb Ethernet ports <b>139</b> provided on the rear panel <b>122</b> of the CSSP enclosure <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the present example, the connections by means of which control and configuration of the shelf <b>41</b> are performed are entirely separate to the connections to the core data network <b>330</b>. Therefore, a first external switch <b>335</b> can connect to a management (I2C) port <b>273</b> of the first CSSP <b>71</b> and a second external switch <b>336</b> can connect to a management (I2C) port <b>273</b> of the second CSSP <b>72</b>. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the management port <b>273</b> can provide a management network interface to both the switch <b>73</b> and SSP <b>74</b> of each CSSP <b>71</b>. The external switches <b>335</b>, <b>336</b> can each be connected to each of a pair of System Management Server (SMSs) <b>338</b>, <b>339</b>. The SMS is not essential to the operation of the shelf <b>41</b>, but use thereof aids optimal operation of the shelf <b>41</b>. In a typical multiprocessor server system a plurality of shelves <b>41</b> may be connected together via the core data network <b>330</b> under the control of a single management network utilising one set of SMSs <b>338</b>, <b>339</b>. A set of SMSs <b>338</b>, <b>339</b> may comprise a single SMS (as well as a plurality thereof). However use of at least two SMSs enables redundancy of components, therefore increasing overall system reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">A serial interface control <b>343</b> operable under telnet protocol control is also connected to the shelf <b>41</b> in the present example. This can provide a common operating system/boot console connection to the SSP <b>74</b> of both CSSPs <b>71</b> via the RJ45 connector <b>311</b> on the rear panel <b>122</b> of each CSSP enclosure <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">It will be appreciated from the above that a flexible and scalable modular computer architecture has been described. In the described example up to 16 information processing cartridges, or blades <b>43</b>, can be configured as sealed FRUs on a single shelf <b>41</b>, the number of blades being chosen according to customer requirements. Each blade has its own processor and random access memory. If, for example, there is a maximum of 2Gbytes of memory per information processing cartridge, and one processor per blade, 16 processors (16P) with 5.33 processors per unit height (1U) and a total of 32GB of memory per shelf can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In the present example, the shelf <b>41</b> incorporates redundant combined switch and shelf service processor modules (CSSPs) <b>71</b> and redundant power supply units (PSUs) <b>81</b> separate from the blades <b>43</b>. As the power supplies are carried by the shelf, the information processing cartridges can be kept compact and inexpensive. Also, as a result, they can be powered by DC power only, via the midplane <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Also, as mentioned earlier, the FRUs (e.g., the information processing cartridges, or blades, <b>43</b>, the CSSPs <b>71</b> and the PSUs <b>81</b>) can all be configured as sealed units that do not contain any internal FRUs themselves and do not contain user serviceable items. The enclosures of the FRUs can be arranged to enclose all of the functional components of the FRU with only electrical connectors being externally accessible and with indicator LEDs being externally visible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">These factors can all contribute to keeping the cost of the FRUs low, as well as that of the overall system. The modular approach with the use of sealed modular field replaceable units for providing system functionality and with non-field replaceable units designed with a minimum possible number of active components enhances reliability. Moreover, easy and rapid maintenance is facilitated in the event of a failure of a FRU by simple replacement of that FRU, further reducing the cost of ownership.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Thus, it will be appreciated from the above description that the provision of a rack mountable shelf, that includes power supplies, a shelf service processor and switches in modular units, for carrying a number of processing cartridges, wherein the number of processing cartridges can be chosen according to customer requirements, provides a flexible and scalable computer configuration. The balancing of the load between the processors of the processing cartridges can be effected by software using conventional principles.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">A configuration as described provides an easily scalable processor architecture, whereby the processing power provided by a complete system based on the information processing cartridge/information processing cartridge carrier architecture can be scalable from moderate to very high capacity through the simple addition of further information processing cartridges.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an example of the external connections from a shelf <b>41</b> can be in the form of two active information signal connections (e.g., Ethernet connections) <b>350</b> and <b>351</b>, two active power connections <b>353</b> and an active/standby pair of management connections <b>354</b>. With regard to the management connections, each connection comprises a serial connection and a network (e.g. Ethernet or Infiniband) connection. It is possible to connect to either the active or the standby connection, as the incoming signal will be internally routed to whichever management controller (CSSP) is the current master. It will be appreciated, therefore, that the connections to a shelf can be kept to a minimum. It will further be appreciated from the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that the system is scalable beyond a single shelf unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates how a plurality of shelves can be configured within one (or more) racks to provide even higher processing power. Such a constellation of shelves to provide a large grouping of servers is sometimes termed a “web farm” or “server farm” <b>360</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the web farm comprises a plurality of shelves <b>41</b> that each carry a plurality of blades <b>43</b>. Also provided are a plurality of Network Attached Storage devices (NAS) <b>373</b> for providing storage for critical data, e.g. email data storage, for the web farm. The NASs <b>373</b> are not required if there is no critical data to be stored, e.g. if the web farm is operating solely to provide web caching services.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Management control of the web farm <b>360</b> can be provided through a pair of System Management Servers (SMSs) <b>362</b>. Each SMS <b>362</b> can be connected to a management network via a link <b>366</b> and to a management console <b>365</b>. The SMSs <b>362</b> can communicate with the individual shelves <b>41</b> via a pair of management switches <b>364</b>. Each shelf <b>41</b> and NAS <b>373</b> can be connected to each management switch <b>364</b> via a connection <b>367</b>. Thus dual redundant management connections can be provided to each shelf <b>41</b> and NAS <b>373</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Flow of data to and from the web farm <b>360</b> can be provided through a pair of data switches <b>369</b>. Each data switch <b>369</b> can be connected to a consumer network via a link <b>370</b>. It is to be understood that the consumer network can be a larger data network to which the web farm <b>360</b> is connected. This network can be an office or corporation intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet or any other network. Connections between the data switches and the shelves <b>41</b> can be facilitated by connections <b>371</b>. It is to be noted that as each shelf has its own switching capability, there is no need for each shelf <b>41</b> to be directly connected to the data switches <b>369</b>. Connections can also be provided to connect the NAS units <b>373</b> to the shelves <b>41</b>. The topology used for interconnection of the data switches <b>369</b>, shelves <b>41</b> and NASs <b>373</b> can be any topology providing at least one connection of any length between every possible pair of units. Complex topologies arranged to minimise the maximum connection length between any two given units in the web farm can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The web farm <b>360</b> comprising a plurality of shelves <b>41</b> with or without a plurality of NASs <b>373</b> can suitably be used as any or all of the entry edge server group <b>9</b>, web edge server group <b>15</b> and application servers <b>19</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">As an alternative to providing critical data storage within a NAS <b>373</b>, such storage can be provided within one or more NAS cartridges fitted into one or more of the shelves <b>41</b> in place of processing cartridges <b>43</b>. Another alternative is to provide a server shelf with local storage (such as a RAID array (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) in place of the NAS <b>373</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Thus there has now been described an example of a fully configurable computing system based on a plurality of self contained field replaceable units (FRUs) and scalable from a single processing cartridge with power supply and switching capability to a multiply redundant multiprocessor server system with full system management capability extending over a number of co-operably connected server shelves. It will of course be readily apparent to the skilled reader that many of the specific features specified in the above description are in no way limiting and a variety of alternatives may be produced using only ordinary skill and common general knowledge. Non-limiting examples of example modifications which may be made to the above described system are discussed hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">There is no limit placed on the processing cartridges as to what software they should run. Each module within a shelf or farm may run under the same operating system, or a plurality of different operating systems may be used. Examples of possible operating systems include Sun Microsystems' Solaris® OS or another UNIX™-Type OS such as Linux™, MINIX™, or Irix™, or UNIX™ or a Microsoft OS such as Windows NT™, Windows 2000™, Windows ME/98/95™, Windows XP™.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">It is also not necessary that each processing cartridge within a shelf or farm be configured to run the same program software. For example, individual processing cartridges may be configured to execute, for example, fileserver software, mailserver software, webhosting software, database software, firewall software, or verification software.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Although it has been described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, that functionality of a switch and of a shelf service processor should be provided within a single combined switch and service processor unit, this is not essential and separate switch and shelf service processor field replaceable units may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Although it has been described above that a pair of PSUs and a pair of CSSPs may be provided so as to enable dual-redundancy, further PSUs and CSSPs may be provided so as to increase FRU redundancy further, thus providing statistically higher reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In the power supply circuitry in each of the blades and CSSPs, two voltage sense circuits may be provided after the fuses and before the diodes, to prevent a latent fault caused by a failed fuse going undetected until one of the PSUs is removed or taken offline. Such circuits may configured to withstand an overvoltage at their inputs whilst the input they are feeding is not powered, without any leakage to the unpowered circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Although it has been described above with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> that the processing module may be based on an UltraSPARC™ processor, this is not limiting and any other processor having sufficient processing capacity to undertake the tasks required of a particular processing cartridge may be used. Alternative processors include, but are not limited to, Intel x86 series and compatible processors, AMD x86 compatible processors, Alpha processors and PowerPC processors. The particular example of an x86 compatible processor is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the parts corresponding to those of the UltraSPARC™ based system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> have the same reference numerals and will not be described again here. In a system based on an x86 compatible processor, the processor <b>378</b> itself communicates with the other components, including the memory <b>196</b> and PCI bus <b>198</b> via a Northbridge <b>379</b>. The Northbridge <b>379</b> also includes an interrupt controller, so no separate interrupt concentrator is required. The other components of the processing cartridge could be substantially the same as for the UltraSPARC™ based system described above.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Although it has been described above that each information processing cartridge comprises a single microprocessor, this is not a limiting case as each or any of the information processing cartridges may have more than one microprocessor arranged to share common storage resources to operate synchronously (in lockstep) or asynchronously. Also, it is not necessary that all information processing cartridges inserted into a shelf at a given time are identical, rather a variety of different blade architectures may be used simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The provision of the functions of both Switch and Shelf Service Processor within a single FRU in the present example provides a facility within a single shelf <b>41</b> for dual redundancy in both functions in fewer different FRUs. As will be appreciated, there is no restriction that these two functions must be provided within a single FRU and division of the two functions into separate FRUs would present no difficulty to the skilled addressee.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The backup power provision for the cooling fans of the PSUs is described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Although it is described that the backup power supply to each fan should be independent of the other, if the risk of common mode failure of backup power supply is judged to be low, or is of low importance, then the backup supply to each fan may be provided in common with the backup supply to all other fans.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Also, an information processing module forming a field replaceable server blade can include a processor and memory can be configured by means of software, firmware or hardware to provide a special purpose function. By way of examples only, an information processing module can be configured to perform the function of one or more of a firewall, or a load balancer, encryption and/or decryption processing, an interface to a secure network, e.g. a virtual private network (VPN), a specialized switch with wide area network (WAN) connectability.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Also, a storage blade may be provided. The storage blade can be configured to be mountable in a server blade receiving location in a blade server carrier. The storage blade can comprise storage blade connectors configured for interconnecting with carrier connectors on the server blade carrier, whereby the storage blade is interchangeable with a server blade. A carrier, or shelf, for a server system can be arranged with a plurality of blade receiving locations for receiving blades, wherein the blades can be storage blades or information processing blades. The server system can be self configuring on receipt of the blades according to the type of blade received in each said location. To achieve the blade service controller in each blade can be operable to communicate with a shelf service processor to perform said configuring.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Although it has been described above that one or more standard processing cartridges <b>43</b> may be inserted into a shelf <b>41</b>, there may arise situations where a standard processing cartridge <b>43</b> may not always provide an optimum performance situation. Computer systems require management in many different ways, for example, load distribution, access control, secure transaction management and many other functions which may be performed with greatest reliability and/or speed by dedicated hardware. That is not to say that such functions may not be performed by a standard processing cartridge <b>43</b> programmed using appropriate application software, merely that specialist hardware (in the form of a non-standard processing cartridge) may provide reliability, performance and/or cost benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">One example of a specialist function is that of detecting and eliminating viruses and other malicious code such as Trojans. The incidence of malicious code is an ever increasing problem for computer systems administrators, whether directed against a specific computer system, company or group of companies or directed against the world in general. Methods of detecting malicious code are many and varied, although there are some features common to many different virus detection systems. In the following description, the terms malicious code and viruses may be used interchangeably to refer to all malicious programs, macros and other code including self-replicating code, such as viruses, worms, hacker agents and Trojans.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Virus detection may typically comprise two main operations, the first is identification and elimination of known viruses and the second is detection of “virus-like” behaviour or unknown viruses, that is operations or operation instructions which may be detected to have potential to cause undesired effects on a computer system. Such undesired effects may include a variety of effects ranging from the destructive, such as deletion of all data held by a computer system and deliberate corruption of file systems, to the inconvenient, such as causing a particular key press of a keyboard to have a non-standard effect or changing a colour of a display to a computer system user.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Detection of known viruses may generally be performed by comparing information newly received at a computer system with patterns of previously identified viruses and looking for a match. The information may comprise both program instructions and data. Upon detection of a match, the information file including the virus may be deleted or cleaned. Cleaning of a file refers to the removal of a virus from the file, leaving the rest of the file intact. This technique is particularly applicable to viruses that “piggy-back” onto other program files by inserting themselves into the file without causing any other damage to the file.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Detection of “virus-like behaviour” or unknown viruses may typically be performed by applying a set of rules to check for certain types of behaviour. For example, instructions causing large amounts of data to be wiped, instructions causing large scale automated sending of emails, instructions causing hard disk drives to be reformatted and instructions causing hard disk boot sectors to be overwritten.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In a networked server computer system, many different types of traffic may be present and each type of traffic which can potentially introduce malicious code to the system must be monitored for such malicious code. Examples of different traffic types which require monitoring include http (hypertext transfer protocol), ftp (file transfer protocol) and smtp (simple mail transfer protocol) traffic. Other traffic types may also be monitored if required or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Many different methods and channels exist for the propagation and transfer of viruses and malicious code. In addition to viruses which exist as a stand alone executable file, there may be viruses which infect other executable files such that the virus is executed when the file is executed, there may also be macro viruses within macro compatible documents, and there may be viruses within applets or other dynamic content.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Macro viruses are typically written in a macro scripting language for a word processor or spreadsheeting application. Many such applications have macro scripting language and documents created therein may have macros embedded within them. A virus detection facility may therefore be provided to check for macros within such documents and to clean any infected documents.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Applets are typically small application-like entities which may be used to create so-called “active content” within http web pages. Applets may generally be written in so-called “mobile code” such as Java, JavaScript, ActiveX and VBScript. These mobile code languages are not limited to the presentation and collection of information and so malicious code within such an applet could perform any command that a stand alone executable file may perform. A virus detection facility may therefore be provided to remove any known malicious mobile code, and a facility may be provided to monitor mobile code during execution so as to intervene in the event of any malicious behaviour taking place.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">An example of a software suite designed to provide some or all of the above described protection types and potentially further protection types not described above is the Gateway Protection suite of applications provided by Trend Micro Incorporated. Other virus detection software suites exist, examples of which are provided by companies including Symmantec and Network Associates.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">As will be appreciated, an information processing cartridge <b>43</b> as described above may be programmed with such virus detection software to perform a virus detection function. However, the information processing cartridge <b>43</b> may typically be overspecified for the performance of such a function and so a specific hardware solution may be used. Examples of dedicated hardware processing cartridges are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. Such dedicated processing cartridges, when programmed with an operating system and appropriate application software, may be referred to as appliance processing cartridges, appliance blades, or appliances.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a processing subsystem for a dedicated hardware processing cartridge based around an x86 compatible processor such as an Intel Pentium™ or Celeron™ series processor, or an AMD Athlon™ or Duron™ series processor. The processor <b>378</b> is connected to a North Bridge <b>379</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The north bridge <b>379</b> provides interrupt handling and memory management. Thus the processor <b>378</b> accesses the memory <b>196</b> via the north bridge <b>379</b>. In the present example, the north bridge <b>379</b> communicates with the south bridge <b>199</b> via a dedicated bridge link <b>605</b>. The dedicated bridge link <b>605</b> provides a dedicated high speed link between the south bridge (which handles most I/O tasks and the PCI bus) and the north bridge (which handles memory management and interrupt control). A number of dedicated bridge link technologies exist, many of which are proprietary to a particular chipset manufacturer. Examples of dedicated bridge link technologies include V-Link™ from VIA Technologies Inc. and MuTIOL™ from Silicon Integrated Systems Corporation (SIS). Alternatively, the bridge to bridge link could be performed by a PCI bus link.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The south bridge <b>199</b> handles the PCI bus <b>198</b>, which in the present example connects the south bridge <b>199</b> to a dual Ethernet with integrated SERDES (serialiser/deserialiser) <b>610</b> which provides the network connections to the switches <b>73</b> of the CSSPs <b>71</b> via the cartridge midplane connector <b>120</b>. The south bridge <b>199</b> also connects with a Super IO device <b>617</b> via an LPC (low pin count) bus <b>615</b>. The super <b>10</b> device <b>617</b> provides an interface to a flash memory <b>619</b>. The flash memory <b>619</b> stores the operating system and application software for the processing cartridge. The south bridge <b>199</b> also has an XBus interface to an XBus <b>200</b> which links the south bridge <b>199</b> to the blade service controller (BSC <b>203</b>). The BSC operates as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and therefore will not be described again here.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Other components differing from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> include the fact that the boot information formerly stored in a PROM attached to the XBus is in the present example stored in the Flash memory <b>619</b>, which may be accessed by the BSC <b>203</b> via a serial link <b>206</b> to the Super IO device <b>617</b>. Also, the clock generation is, in the present example performed by a clock generation module <b>193</b> attached to the I2C link <b>197</b> from the south bridge <b>199</b>. All other components may behave as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Thus <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the main functional components of a first example of a dedicated appliance blade. A further example of a dedicated appliance blade is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows an example of a processing subsystem for a dedicated hardware processing cartridge based around a PowerPC series processor. The processor <b>710</b> connects directly to the PCI bus <b>198</b> to connect to the dual Ethernet with integrated SERDES <b>610</b> which provides network connections to the switches <b>73</b> of the CSSPs <b>71</b>. Also connected to the processor <b>710</b> is the random access memory <b>196</b>. The processor <b>710</b> also has direct access to a flash memory <b>619</b> which is used to store the boot information, operating system and application software for the processing cartridge. The processor is directly linked to the BSC <b>203</b> via XBus <b>200</b> and serial link <b>206</b>. The BSC <b>203</b> and components attached thereto operate in may operate as the like components described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> above and therefore will not be described again.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Thus <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the main functional components of a second example of a dedicated appliance blade. As will be appreciated, other blade components groups and arrangements may be provided for processing cartridges based on the above or alternative central processors.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">A processing cartridge (whether of the type describe with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> or <b>20</b> or any other type) may be configured as a virus detection module and received within a computer system shelf <b>41</b> along with other processing modules. The virus detection module therefore is provided with all of the above described benefits of such a computer system arrangement. In particular, the virus detection module is served by the same management and control entities as other modules received in the same chassis <b>47</b>, thus failure of the virus detection module may be immediately reported to all other modules to enable those modules to take mitigating action, such as diverting to alternative virus detection service or to operate in an a defensive operation mode. An example of a defensive operation mode function might include the performance of virus detection at each processing module, as will be appreciated this will have a negative impact on the performance of the modules, however some virus detection protection may thereby be provided. The virus detection module may also use the management connections to report malicious code events to higher level management entities, such that information regarding malicious code events is instantly available to higher level management entities. Also, since the only entry points for traffic into and out of the shelf <b>41</b> are through the switches <b>73</b> of the CSSPs <b>71</b>, there is no possibility of data which has been virus checked being altered to contain malicious code by means of an unauthorised access to the network links between modules.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">As the computer system shelf is a closed computer system with all interconnections between modules integrated therein, the only traffic which needs to be checked for viruses is traffic entering the shelf. Once each module received in the shelf has been determined to be virus free, the only place from which viruses may originate is outside of the shelf. Thus the virus detection module may be configured to selectively scan only the traffic arriving at the shelf and to ignore any internally originating traffic. Thus the virus detection unit has less work to do, enabling it to operate faster or to be based on lower processing capacity components or both. Also, internally originating traffic is not being delayed by the virus scanning process, so operational efficiency of the computer system as whole may be increased. The virus detection module may be configured in various ways to achieve this functionality. In a first example, the virus detection module is configured to monitor all traffic flowing on the network, but to ignore all traffic identified as being internally originating. In a second example, the virus detection module may be configured as an ingress point for traffic into the computer system, such that all incoming traffic passes through the virus detection module and internal traffic does not.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Thus there has now been described various examples of a processor cartridge suitable to be configured to perform a virus detection function. The processing cartridge so configured may be fitted into a computer system shelf as described above with respect to processing cartridge <b>43</b>. As will be appreciated, many modifications and equivalents to the above described arrangement may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Although the embodiments above have been described in considerable detail, numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications.</p>
