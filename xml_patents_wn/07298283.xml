<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a device for detecting line or wire disconnection in a stepping motor driver which has a driver circuit preferably formed into a simplified integrated circuit and capable of detecting disconnection or break in a winding.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, Japanese Patent No. 2,639,144 discloses an apparatus for controlling an exhaust gas return valve which comprises a line-disconnection detecting circuit for use in a stepping motor. The control apparatus discerns a specific level of excitation current flowing through to windings of the stepping motor to detect disconnection in winding based on the discerned level of the excitation current.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an electric circuit diagram of a prior art disconnection detecting circuit <b>100</b> used in a control apparatus for an exhaust gas return valve. Disconnection detecting circuit <b>100</b> comprises excitation coils <b>121</b> to <b>124</b> provided in a stepping motor <b>120</b> and each having one end connected to a DC power source <b>130</b> through a resistor <b>137</b> or <b>138</b>; four transistors <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> each having a collector terminal connected to the other end of excitation coil <b>121</b> to <b>124</b>; current detecting resistors <b>105</b> to <b>108</b> each connected to an emitter terminal of transistor <b>101</b> to <b>104</b>; four comparators <b>109</b> to <b>112</b> each having a non-inverted input terminal (+) connected to a junction between each emitter terminal of transistor <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> and current detecting resistor <b>105</b> to <b>108</b>, and an inverted input terminal connected between two voltage-dividing resistors <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>; four D-type flip flops (DFF) <b>125</b> to <b>128</b> each having a D input terminal connected to an output terminal of corresponding comparator <b>109</b> to <b>112</b>; a motor drive circuit <b>140</b> for simultaneously supplying drive pulses for a base terminal of each transistor <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> and a trigger input terminal T of each DFF <b>125</b> to <b>128</b> through a retardant circuit <b>133</b> to <b>136</b>; an AND gate <b>141</b> for receiving outputs from all of DFFs <b>125</b> to <b>128</b>; and a control circuit <b>142</b> having an input terminal P<sub>i </sub>for receiving an output from AND gate <b>141</b> and an output terminal P<sub>o </sub>for forwarding drive signals to motor drive circuit <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In operation, control circuit <b>142</b> produces drive signals to motor drive circuit <b>140</b> which then provides drive signals of four different phases at 90 degree angular intervals for base terminal of transistors <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> to turn them on and off to drive stepping motor <b>120</b>. For example, upon turning transistor <b>100</b> on, electric current flows from DC power source <b>130</b> through resistor <b>137</b>, excitation coil <b>121</b>, collector-emitter terminals of transistor <b>101</b> and current detecting resistor <b>105</b> to ground to activate stepping motor <b>120</b>. At the same time, drive signals from motor drive circuit <b>140</b> are transmitted to trigger input terminal T of DFF <b>125</b> with a constant delay time through retardant circuit <b>133</b>. Dividing resistors <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> provide a reference voltage for each inverted input terminal of comparators <b>109</b> to <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In operating stepping motor <b>120</b>, output signals from output terminal P<sub>o </sub>of control circuit <b>142</b> cause motor drive circuit <b>140</b> to produce drive pulses to base terminal of transistor <b>101</b> to turn it on so that electric current flows from DC power source <b>130</b> through excitation coil <b>121</b>, transistor <b>101</b> and current detecting resistor <b>105</b>. Electric current through excitation coil <b>121</b> and transistor <b>101</b> is detected as a corresponding detection voltage applied on current detecting resistor <b>105</b>, and comparator <b>109</b> compares detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>105</b> with reference voltage divided by resistors <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>. When detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>105</b> reaches a predetermined level, comparator <b>109</b> produces the output to make DFF <b>125</b> produce the output of high voltage level to AND gate <b>141</b>. Similar operations are carried out in case motor drive circuit <b>140</b> produces drive pulses to each base terminal of remaining transistors <b>102</b> to <b>104</b>, and when detection voltage on current detecting resistors <b>106</b> to <b>108</b> comes up to the predetermined level, comparators <b>110</b> to <b>112</b> produce the outputs so as to transmit the outputs of high voltage level from DFF <b>126</b> to <b>128</b> to AND gate <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Upon occurrence of disconnection in excitation coil <b>123</b>, no electric current flows through excitation coil <b>123</b> although motor drive circuit <b>140</b> gives base terminal of transistor <b>103</b> drive pulse, and therefore, there is no detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>107</b>. This causes DFF <b>127</b> to produce the output of low voltage level to transmit a disconnection signal to input terminal P<sub>i </sub>of control circuit <b>142</b> through AND gate <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Disclosure Nos. 2000-175486 and 2-26297 demonstrate stepping motors capable of detecting disconnection in motor coil by detecting an elevated voltage applied on a driving element when any disconnection occurs in motor coil of the bifilar turn arrangement in the stepping motor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a disconnection detecting circuit of such a stepping motor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the disconnection detecting circuit comprises two pairs of motor coils or windings <b>221</b> to <b>224</b> each pair being wound in the bifilar turn arrangement, field effect transistors (FETs) <b>201</b> to <b>204</b> each connected in series to DC power source <b>230</b> and winding <b>221</b> to <b>224</b>, a common current detecting resistor <b>205</b> connected between FETs <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> and ground, a diode <b>206</b> connected in parallel to current detecting resistor <b>205</b>, a common current detecting resistor <b>207</b> connected between FETs <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> and ground, a diode <b>208</b> connected in parallel to current detecting resistor <b>207</b>, a disconnection detecting circuit <b>240</b> connected between each winding <b>221</b> to <b>224</b> and FET <b>201</b> to <b>204</b>, first and second control circuits <b>210</b> and <b>211</b> for forwarding drive signals to gate terminal of each FET <b>201</b> to <b>204</b>, an excitation signal generator <b>212</b> for applying excitation signals to first and second control circuits <b>210</b> and <b>211</b>, and a stop controller <b>250</b> for receiving a disconnection signal detected by disconnection detecting circuit <b>240</b> to provide stop control signals for first and second control circuits <b>210</b> and <b>211</b>. Disconnection detecting circuit <b>240</b> comprises diodes <b>241</b> to <b>244</b> connected between winding <b>221</b> to <b>224</b> and FET <b>201</b> to <b>204</b>, a common Zener diode <b>245</b> connected to all diodes <b>241</b> to <b>244</b>, resistors <b>246</b> and <b>247</b> for dividing output from Zener diode <b>245</b>, and a capacitor <b>248</b> connected in parallel to resistor <b>247</b>. Stop controller <b>250</b> has an input terminal connected between resistors <b>246</b> and <b>247</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When no break appears in each winding <b>221</b> to <b>224</b>, stop controller <b>250</b> does not produce the output. For example, when winding <b>221</b> has a break or cutoff, accumulated electric energy in winding <b>222</b> in the bifilar turn arrangement together with winding <b>221</b> cannot be released through winding <b>221</b>, and therefore, high voltage induced in winding <b>222</b> causes breakdown of FET <b>202</b>. Subsequently, electric energy in winding <b>222</b> is discharged while electric current flows through a closed circuit including winding <b>222</b>, FET <b>202</b>, resistor <b>205</b> and DC power source <b>230</b>. This electric current causes Zener diode <b>245</b> to be turned on to provide a trigger signal of high voltage level for stop controller <b>250</b>. Accordingly, stop controller <b>250</b> forwards stop signals to first and second control circuits <b>210</b> and <b>211</b> to cease operation of FETs <b>201</b> to <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As mentioned above, prior art disconnection detecting devices require complicated circuit construction and high voltage resistive electric elements to detect disconnection in winding of two phase stepping motor provided with plural windings in the bifilar turn arrangement. Such a circuit construction is expensive in manufacture and also unsuitable to produce an integrated circuit of the disconnection detector. In addition, when two phase stepping motor is operated with unipolar drive, switching elements are on-off switched by a chopper drive of regular current. In this case, if electric energy is accumulated in one winding, and besides, the other winding has a disconnection, counter electromotive force resulted from flyback energy cannot be regenerated through the other disconnected winding, and therefore, an excessive electric potential would be applied to a switching element for excitation of one winding. Thus, there is a large risk that the excessive electric potential may cause damage such as breakdown to the switching element. In this way, any of prior art techniques cannot detect disconnection in winding until the timing to excite the disconnected winding.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a device having a simplified circuit structure for detecting disconnection of a stepping motor. Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for detecting disconnection of stepping motor and capable of easily producing the device into an integrated circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The device for detecting disconnection according to the present invention, is used with a stepping motor driver which comprises at least a pair of windings (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>) wound in a bifilar turn arrangement and having each one end connected to a DC power source (<b>20</b>); a pair of switching elements (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) connected to the other end of each winding (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>); a common current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>) connected between each switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) and ground, a drive circuit (<b>10</b>) for forwarding drive signals to each control terminal of the switching elements (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>); a control circuit (<b>12</b>) for supplying the drive circuit (<b>10</b>) with operation signals; a PWM circuit (<b>14</b>) for providing the drive circuit (<b>10</b>) with pulse width modulated signals; a first reference voltage generator (<b>34</b>) for producing a first reference voltage (V<sub>t1</sub>); and a comparator (<b>8</b>) for comparing a detection voltage applied on the current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>) with the first reference voltage (V<sub>t1</sub>) to provide the PWM circuit (<b>14</b>) with a chopper signal (<b>17</b>) for turning off the switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) in the on condition when the detection voltage is higher than the first reference voltage (V<sub>t1</sub>). The device comprises a second reference voltage generator (<b>40</b>) for producing a second reference voltage (V<sub>t2</sub>) lower than the first reference voltage (V<sub>t1</sub>); a decision circuit (<b>8</b>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>) for comparing the detection voltage on the current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>) with the second reference voltage (V<sub>t2</sub>) to produce an alarm signal when the detection voltage is higher than the second reference voltage (V<sub>t2</sub>); and a disconnection detector (<b>11</b>) for receiving the alarm signal from the decision circuit (<b>8</b>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>) after the comparator (<b>8</b>) produces the chopper signal (<b>17</b>) to produce a disconnection signal when the decision circuit (<b>8</b>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>) continues to produce the alarm signal even after the switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) in the on condition is turned off, or when the decision circuit (<b>8</b>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>) produces the alarm signal over a predetermined period of time or when the accumulated value of the alarm signal exceeds a predetermined value after the switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) in the on condition is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During the normal operation of the stepping motor driver, when one of switching elements (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) is turned on to cause excitation current (I<sub>1</sub>) to flow through the corresponding one of windings (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>) and thereby accumulate electric energy in the winding (<b>21</b> or <b>22</b>). After that, when the switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>) in the on condition is turned off, regenerative current (I<sub>2</sub>) runs from ground through current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>), parasitic diode (<b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>2</b><i>a</i>) of mating switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>), mating winding (<b>21</b> or <b>22</b>) in bifilar turn arrangement to DC power source (<b>20</b>) to discharge electric energy accumulated in winding (<b>21</b> or <b>22</b>), while regenerative current (I<sub>2</sub>) produces negative detection voltage on current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">If disconnection arises in mating winding (<b>21</b> or <b>22</b>), no regenerative current (I<sub>2</sub>) passes through the mating winding (<b>21</b> or <b>22</b>), but instead, accumulated electric energy causes in windings (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>) high flyback voltage superimposed on power voltage from DC power source (<b>20</b>) together applied on switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>). When flyback voltage rises to an avalanche breakdown voltage level of the switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>), it is clamped with avalanche voltage, and despite the switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>) kept in the off condition, regenerative current (<b>13</b>) flows from winding (<b>21</b> or <b>22</b>) through the switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>), current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>) to ground, thereby inducing positive detection voltage on the current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>). The decision circuit (<b>8</b>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>) compares the detection voltage on current detecting resistor (<b>4</b>) with the second reference voltage (V<sub>t2</sub>) to produce an alarm signal when the detection voltage is higher than the second reference voltage (V<sub>t2</sub>). The disconnection detector (<b>11</b>) produces a disconnection detection signal when receives the alarm signal from the decision circuit (<b>8</b>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>) after the switching element (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>) in the on condition is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the stepping motor driver according to the present invention, comprises at least a pair of windings (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>) wound in a bifilar turn arrangement and having each one end connected to a DC power source (<b>20</b>); a pair of switching elements (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) connected to the other end of each winding (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>); a drive circuit (<b>10</b>) for providing control terminals of the switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>) with drive signals, and a control circuit (<b>12</b>) for supplying operation signals to the drive circuit (<b>10</b>). The disconnection detecting device in the stepping motor driver comprises a retaining circuit (<b>45</b>) for starting output of alarm signal at the time of forwarding a rising or trailing edge in drive signal to the switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>), and a disconnection detecting circuit (<b>46</b>) for producing a disconnection detection signal when the retaining circuit (<b>45</b>) produces the alarm signal over a predetermined amount or continuously over a given period of time. When disconnection arises in any of the windings (<b>21</b>, <b>22</b>) during the high speed rotation of the stepping motor, the disconnection detecting circuit (<b>46</b>) produces an alarm signal when the retaining circuit (<b>45</b>) produces an alarm signal over a predetermined amount or continuously over a given period of time after the retaining circuit (<b>45</b>) starts output of alarm signal at the time of forwarding a rising or trailing edge in drive signal to switching element (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention, when flyback energy produces high voltage upon occurrence of disconnection in winding of the regenerative side, the detecting device can detect the disconnection in the winding of the regenerative side to stop the stepping motor driver once the switching element comes into the avalanche region. As a single avalanche tolerance dose is usually larger than repetitive one, the stepping motor driver can be stopped with the only one application of high voltage to current detecting resistor to advantageously repress damage to the switching elements. This expands selectable ranges of switching elements. Also, the major circuit portion of the stepping motor driver except windings can be formed into an integrated circuit (IC) containable in a similar package as those produced by a prior art technique without need of altering peripheral equipments for enhanced protective function and improvement in reliability.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of the device for detecting disconnection according to the present invention applied to a two-phase stepping motor driver are described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 11</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a first embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device comprises two pairs of windings <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> wound in a bifilar turn arrangement, whose each one end is connected to a DC power source <b>20</b>; and a driving circuit <b>3</b> which may be formed in an integrated circuit connected to the other end of each winding <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. One and the other pairs of windings <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> form respectively unipolar A and B phase sides of a stepping motor (not shown) so that windings <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> of A and B phase sides are excited in the predetermined order to drive the stepping motor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Driving circuit <b>3</b> comprises metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as a pair of switching elements for each of A and B phase sides, which are connected to the other end of windings <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>; a common current detecting resistor <b>4</b> connected between MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and ground, a drive circuit <b>10</b> for forwarding drive signals to each gate terminal as a control terminal of MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>; a control circuit <b>12</b> having a pair of output terminals (distribution/disable terminals) for supplying drive circuit <b>10</b> with operation signals; a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) circuit <b>14</b> as a constant current chopper driver for providing drive circuit <b>10</b> with pulse-width modulated signals; a first reference voltage generator <b>34</b> for producing a first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>; and a comparator <b>8</b> for comparing a detection voltage applied on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> with first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>to provide PWM circuit <b>14</b> with a chopper signal <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(H)</figref> to stop operation of drive circuit <b>10</b> when detection voltage is higher than first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>. Parasitic diodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>a </i>are connected in parallel to MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. Drive circuit <b>10</b> may comprise at least any one of various known circuit, for example a drive circuit which includes a gate circuit disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3,525,436, an IC type control circuit disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 2003-111399 or a gated circuit. Also, PWM circuit <b>14</b> may comprise a known circuit exhibited in Japanese Patent No. 2,789,096.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The disconnection detecting device of the present invention further comprises inverters <b>32</b> each connected between output terminal of comparator <b>8</b> and PWM circuit <b>14</b>; a NOR gates <b>18</b> for A and B phase sides as disconnection detectors <b>11</b> each connected to output terminal of comparator <b>8</b> and output terminal of PWM circuit <b>14</b> through a retardant circuit <b>16</b>; and an RS flip flop (RSFF) <b>24</b> having a set terminal S for receiving an output from NOR gate <b>18</b> through an OR gate <b>23</b>. Reset terminal R of RSFF <b>24</b> is supplied with a reset signal through a port <b>38</b> from a peripheral device out of driving circuit <b>3</b>, and output terminal of RSFF <b>24</b> is connected to an input terminal I of control circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Comparator <b>8</b> comprises one inverted input terminal (−) connected to current detecting resistor <b>4</b>, and the other non-inverted terminal (+) connected to a first reference voltage generator <b>34</b> through a resistor <b>26</b> and port <b>36</b>. A series circuit of a resistor <b>28</b> and diode <b>30</b> provides a second reference voltage generator <b>40</b> for producing a second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>lower than first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>, and resistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> serve to provide a divided voltage of first reference voltage generator <b>34</b>. In addition, comparator <b>8</b> incorporates second reference voltage generator <b>40</b> to form a decision circuit which compares detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> with second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>and produces an alarm signal when detection voltage is higher than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>. NOR gate <b>18</b> forms a disconnection detector <b>11</b> which receives alarm signal from decision circuit <b>8</b> after comparator <b>8</b> produces chopper signal <b>17</b> to produce a disconnection signal. Comparator <b>8</b> normally produces the output of high voltage level, but changes the output to low voltage level when detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> exceeds first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>of first reference voltage generator <b>34</b>. Accordingly, comparator <b>8</b> gives PWM circuit <b>14</b> chopper signal <b>17</b> through inverter <b>32</b> to turn MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> through drive circuit <b>10</b>. In another aspect, when comparator <b>8</b> produces the output of low voltage level as mentioned above, electric current flows from first reference voltage generator <b>34</b> through resistors <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and diode <b>30</b> to output terminal of comparator <b>8</b> to apply a second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>divided from first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>by resistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> to the other input terminal (+) of comparator <b>8</b>. This function ensures that comparator <b>8</b> has the hysteretic property by applying changed or different first and second reference voltages V<sub>t1 </sub>and V<sub>t2 </sub>on the other input terminal (+) of comparator <b>8</b>. When detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> becomes lower than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>, comparator <b>8</b> changes the output from low to high voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In driving the stepping motor driver of two phases, control circuit <b>12</b> produces operation signals to drive circuit <b>10</b>, and simultaneously PWM circuit <b>14</b> forwards drive signals to MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> through drive circuit <b>10</b> to alternately turn MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> on and off. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> and (B) represent waveforms of output voltage from PWM circuit <b>14</b> and gate voltage on MOSFET <b>1</b>. When MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned on, MOSFET <b>2</b> is turned off, and adversely, when MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, MOSFET <b>2</b> is turned on. Specifically, when MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned on, excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>flows through corresponding winding <b>21</b> to accumulate electric energy in winding <b>21</b>. As understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(D)</figref>, excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>increases with elapsed time, and comparator <b>8</b> changes the output from high to low voltage level as chopper signal <b>17</b> when detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> exceeds first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>from first reference voltage generator <b>34</b>. Thus, chopper signal <b>17</b> is sent to NOR gate <b>18</b> and to PWM circuit <b>14</b> through inverter <b>32</b>, and concurrently PWM circuit <b>14</b> changes the output to drive circuit <b>10</b> to low voltage level to cease drive signal to MOSFET <b>1</b> to turn it off. When MOSFET <b>1</b> is switched off, regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows from ground through current detecting resistor <b>4</b>, parasitic diode <b>2</b><i>a </i>of mating MOSFET <b>2</b> in the bifilar turn arrangement to DC power source <b>20</b> to discharge electric energy in winding <b>21</b>. Regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>produces on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> negative detection voltage which is also applied on one input terminal (−) of comparator <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When comparator <b>8</b> produces chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level, electric current flows from first reference voltage generator <b>34</b> through resistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and diode <b>30</b> to output terminal of comparator <b>8</b> to change the input signal to the other input terminal (+) thereof from first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>to second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>divided from first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>by resistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Negative detection voltage on one input terminal (−) of comparator <b>8</b> is lower than second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>applied on the other input terminal (+) of comparator <b>8</b> which therefore immediately ceases chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level, and instead, produces the output of high voltage level. In this case, chopper signal <b>17</b> as an alarm signal has the very short span of pulse. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(G)</figref> indicates fluctuation in input V<sub>A </sub>voltage applied on the other input terminal (+) of comparator <b>8</b> as indicated by an instantaneous pulse V<sub>A1 </sub>of low level which initially changes from first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>to second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>, and then returns from second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>to first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>. Synchronously, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(H)</figref> shows that comparator <b>8</b> instantaneously produces chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level in response to instantaneous V<sub>A1 </sub>of input V<sub>A </sub>voltage to comparator <b>8</b>. PWM circuit <b>14</b> changes the output signal from high to low voltage level supplied to one input terminal of NOR gate <b>18</b> with delay time T shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(I)</figref> through retardant circuit <b>16</b>. Accordingly, although momentary chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level is conveyed to one input terminal of NOR gate <b>18</b>, retardant circuit <b>16</b> keeps the output of high voltage level so that NOR gate <b>18</b> produces no output as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(J)</figref>. In this way, RSFF <b>24</b> is not set through OR gate <b>23</b> and never produces the output. The stepping motor driver is operated as mentioned above in case there is no disconnection in mating winding <b>22</b>, and similar operation takes place without disconnection in the other winding <b>21</b>. Accordingly, during the off period of MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>, regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows through current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to apply negative voltage on resistor <b>4</b>, and thereby comparator <b>8</b> produces transient chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level after MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> is turned off, and then returns without delay to the output of high voltage level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(H)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, if any disconnection occurs in mating winding <b>22</b> in the bifilar turn arrangement, electric energy accumulated in winding <b>21</b> produces high flyback voltage in winding <b>21</b> when MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, and flyback voltage superimposed on supply voltage from DC power source <b>20</b> is applied on MOSFET <b>1</b>, but regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>does not flow through mating winding <b>22</b>. At the time flyback voltage reaches avalanche breakdown voltage of MOSFET <b>1</b>, regenerative current <b>13</b> flows from winding <b>21</b> through MOSFET <b>1</b> even in the off mode and current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to ground while flyback voltage is kept clamped at the avalanche breakdown voltage so that regenerative current <b>13</b> produces positive detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b>. Here, regenerative current <b>13</b> indicates the gradually reducing slope characteristics as shown by slanted lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(D)</figref>. Likewise, detection voltage <b>15</b> applied on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> indicates the gradually decreasing slope characteristics as shown by slanted lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(F)</figref>, and regenerative current <b>13</b> and detection voltage <b>15</b> do not indicate rapid drop characteristics unlike the normal condition. Under this situation, positive detection voltage <b>15</b> on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> is higher than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>, and applied on one input terminal (−) of comparator <b>8</b> which therefore produces chopper signal <b>17</b> of considerable time span T<sub>1 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(H)</figref> because positive detection voltage <b>15</b> lasts for a relatively long period of time while comparator <b>8</b> compares detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> and second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>. Comparator <b>8</b> still continues output of chopper signal <b>17</b> even after the output from PWM circuit <b>14</b> delayed by retardant circuit <b>16</b> is turned to low level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(I)</figref>. NOR gate <b>18</b> simultaneously receives chopper signal <b>17</b> from comparator <b>8</b> and delayed output from retardant circuit <b>16</b> to generate the output shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(J)</figref> to set terminal of RSFF <b>24</b> through OR gate <b>23</b> to set RSFF <b>24</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(K)</figref>, RSFF <b>24</b> produces the output to input terminal I of control circuit <b>12</b> which therefore ceases operation signals to drive circuit <b>10</b>. RSFF <b>24</b> is returned to the original condition when an extra reset signal is applied to a reset terminal R through a port <b>38</b> of driving circuit <b>3</b>. In this way, comparator <b>8</b> provides a voltage comparator which compares detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> with second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>to produce the output of chopper signal <b>17</b> when detection voltage is higher than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>, and the other hand, NOR gate <b>18</b> provides a disconnection detector which produces disconnection detecting signal when receives simultaneously chopper signal <b>17</b> and delayed output of low voltage level from comparator <b>8</b> as decision circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention having a comparator <b>8</b> which comprises a first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>for producing a chopper signal <b>17</b> to PWM circuit <b>14</b> when detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> is equal to or exceeds first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>, a second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>for producing the output when detection voltage on current detection resistor <b>4</b> is lower than second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>and a second reference voltage generator <b>40</b> for producing a second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>lower than first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>. Second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>provides a decision circuit for producing the output to NOR gate <b>18</b> when detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> is higher than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>. Basic components other than those mentioned above are similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In operating the stepping motor driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned on to cause excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>to flow through corresponding winding <b>21</b> for accumulation of electric energy in winding <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(D)</figref>, excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>through winding <b>21</b> increases as time passes, and first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>changes the output from low voltage level to chopper signal (not shown) of high voltage level to PWM circuit <b>14</b> which therefore switches the output to low voltage level to drive circuit <b>10</b> to cease drive signal to MOSFET <b>1</b>. As a result, MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, and regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows from ground through current detecting resistor <b>4</b>, parasitic diode <b>2</b><i>a </i>of mating MOSFET <b>2</b> and mating winding <b>22</b> to DC power source <b>20</b> to store electric energy in winding <b>21</b>. Regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>produces on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> negative detection voltage which also is applied to one input terminal (−) of second comparator <b>8</b><i>b</i>. Since detection voltage is lower than second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>of second reference generator <b>40</b> applied to the other input terminal (+), second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>produces the output of high voltage level shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(G)</figref> to one input terminal of NOR gate <b>18</b>. At the moment, as NOR gate <b>18</b> receives at one input terminal the output of high voltage level from second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>and at the other input terminal the output of high voltage level from PWM circuit <b>14</b> through retardant circuit <b>16</b>, NOR gate <b>18</b> never produces disconnection detection signal. The above-mentioned processes are repeated when mating winding <b>22</b> has no disconnection, and similar operation is carried out without disconnection in the other winding <b>21</b>. Accordingly, during the off period of MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>, regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows through current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to apply negative voltage on resistor <b>4</b>, and thereby second comparator <b>8</b> produces the output of high voltage level after MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For instance, if any disconnection happens in mating winding <b>22</b> in the bifilar turn arrangement, electric energy accumulated in winding <b>21</b> produces high flyback voltage in winding <b>21</b> when MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, and flyback voltage superimposed on supply voltage from DC power source <b>20</b> is applied on MOSFET <b>1</b>, but regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>does not flow through mating winding <b>22</b>.

Output terminal of second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>is connected to an input terminal of OR gate <b>44</b>, and output terminal of OR gate <b>44</b> is connected to reset terminal R of RSFF <b>45</b> for producing an alarm signal. Output terminal of RSFF <b>45</b> is connected to input terminal I of control circuit <b>12</b> through low-pass filter <b>46</b> as a disconnection detector <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operating the stepping motor driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned on to cause excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>to flow through corresponding winding <b>21</b> for accumulation of electric energy in winding <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(D)</figref>, excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>through winding <b>21</b> increases as time passes, and when detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> exceeds first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>from first reference voltage generator <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>produces a chopper signal <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref> to PWM circuit <b>14</b> and OR gate <b>43</b>. Accordingly, PWM circuit <b>14</b> switches the output to drive circuit <b>10</b> from high to low voltage level to cease drive signals to MOSFET <b>1</b>. At the same time, OR gate <b>43</b> forwards the output to set terminal S of RSFF <b>45</b> which therefore is turned to the set condition to provide low-pass filter <b>46</b> with alarm signal, however, low-pass filter <b>46</b> filtrates and prevents passage of alarm signal of short pulse width toward control circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows from ground through current detecting resistor <b>4</b>, parasitic diode <b>2</b><i>a </i>of mating MOSFET <b>2</b> and mating winding <b>22</b> to DC power source <b>20</b> to discharge electric energy in winding <b>21</b>. Regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>causes detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to rapidly decrease to a negative level lower than second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(F) and 7(B)</figref>, and first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>immediately drops chopper signal <b>17</b> to low voltage level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(G) and 7(C)</figref>. At the same time, second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>compares detection voltage with second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>from second reference voltage generator <b>40</b> negatively biased and produces the output of high voltage level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(H) and 7(D)</figref>. Output of high voltage level from second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>is applied to reset terminal R of RSFF <b>45</b> through OR gate <b>44</b> to reset RSFF <b>45</b> and thereby cease alarm signal to low-pass filter <b>46</b>. After RSFF <b>45</b> is set by chopper signal <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref> from first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>until RSFF <b>45</b> is reset by output from second comparator <b>8</b><i>b</i>, low-pass filter <b>46</b> filtrates alarm signal to RSFF <b>45</b>. Without disconnection in winding <b>22</b>, RSFF <b>45</b> is reset within a short period of time by output from second comparator <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and RSFF <b>45</b> produces alarm signal of extremely short pulse span as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(I)</figref>. Therefore, low-pass filter <b>46</b> removes alarm signal to stop passage of disconnection detection signal through low-pass filter <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(J)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When any cutoff occurs in mating winding <b>22</b> and MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, electric energy accumulated in winding <b>21</b> produces in winding <b>21</b> high flyback voltage which is applied on MOSFET <b>1</b> in the superimposed condition on supply voltage from DC power source <b>20</b>, however, no regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows through mating winding <b>22</b> in the bifilar winding relation. When flyback voltage comes up to avalanche breakdown voltage of MOSFET <b>1</b>, it is clamped on that voltage, and regenerative current <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(D)</figref> flows from winding <b>21</b> through MOSFET <b>1</b> even in the off mode and current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to ground to produce positive detection voltage <b>15</b> on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(F)</figref>. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, positive detection voltage <b>15</b> on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> indicates the gradually reducing slope characteristics after it exceeds first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>forwards chopper signal <b>17</b> to PWM circuit <b>14</b> and RSFF <b>45</b> through OR gate <b>43</b> to cease drive signal to MOSFET <b>1</b> and set RSFF <b>45</b>. Detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b>, however, does not exceed second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>does not produce the output as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(D)</figref>. Thus, RSFF <b>45</b> is not reset and continues to produce alarm signal of high voltage level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(I)</figref>. Therefore, low-pass filter <b>46</b> receives an input signal whose pulse span is longer than time width T<sub>2 </sub>to provide disconnection detection signal for input terminal I of control circuit <b>12</b> which stops operation of drive circuit <b>3</b>. In this way, second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>provides a decision circuit for comparing detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> with second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>to produce the output when detection voltage is higher than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>, and low-pass filter <b>46</b> provides a disconnection detector <b>11</b> for producing disconnection detecting signal when RSFF <b>45</b> is not reset by output from the decision circuit within a considerable period of time after first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>produces chopper signal <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a fourth embodiment according to the present invention utilizing a comparator <b>8</b> associated with a hysteretic property. Comparator <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is similar in construction to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except in that output terminal of each comparator <b>8</b> is connected to PWM circuit <b>14</b> through an inverter <b>32</b> and to set terminal of RSFF <b>24</b> through an inverter <b>48</b>, low-pass filter <b>46</b> as a disconnection detector <b>11</b> and OR gate <b>23</b>. When MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned on, excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>flows from DC power source <b>20</b> through winding <b>21</b>, MOSFET <b>1</b> and current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to ground. As excitation current I<sub>1 </sub>increases with passage of time as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(D)</figref>, detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> increases accordingly. When detection voltage exceeds first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(F)</figref>, comparator <b>8</b> produces a chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level to inverters <b>32</b> and <b>48</b> which, therefore, transmit signals of high voltage level to PWM circuit <b>14</b> and low-pass filter <b>46</b>. PWM circuit <b>14</b> switches the output to drive circuit <b>10</b> from high to low voltage level to cease drive signal to MOSFET <b>1</b>. During the normal operation, after MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, regenerative current I<sub>2 </sub>flows through current detecting resistor <b>4</b> to instantly convert detection voltage thereon into the negative level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(F)</figref>. When comparator <b>8</b> produces chopper signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level, input signal received by the other input terminal (+) of comparator <b>8</b> is automatically switched from first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>to second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>as above-described to compare detection voltage with second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>by comparator <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(G)</figref> indicates a momentary pulse V<sub>A1 </sub>of low voltage level formed by voltage V<sub>A </sub>which initially drops from first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>to second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>and then immediately returns from V<sub>t2 </sub>to V<sub>t1</sub>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(H)</figref> shows chopper signals <b>17</b> of low voltage level as alarm signals instantaneously produced by comparator <b>8</b> synchronously in response to momentary pulse V<sub>A1</sub>. When detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> is switched to a negative value lower than second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>after MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off, comparator <b>8</b> changes the output from low to high voltage level like a flash, and therefore, low-pass filter <b>46</b> which integrates the output from inverter <b>48</b>, does not produce the output, cutting input signals of short pulse width. Upon occurrence of disconnection in winding <b>22</b>, detection voltage <b>15</b> on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> represents the slope characteristics shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(F)</figref>. Accordingly, as detection voltage <b>15</b> is above second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>, comparator <b>8</b> continues to produce alarm signal <b>17</b> of low voltage level for a considerable period T<sub>1 </sub>of time. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(I)</figref>, low-pass filter <b>46</b> generates the output of pulse width T<sub>1 </sub>time T<sub>3 </sub>late to set RSFF <b>24</b> through OR gate <b>23</b>. This ensures that RSFF <b>24</b> provides input terminal I of control circuit <b>12</b> with disconnection detection signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(J)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When rotation rate of the stepping motor is increased by accelerating the switching rate, the device cannot detect the disconnection in response to chopper drive under PWM control because control circuit <b>12</b> furnishes drive circuit <b>10</b> with operation signals before detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> comes up to a predetermined level. Accordingly, it is necessary to certainly detect disconnection in winding <b>21</b> or <b>22</b> during the rotation of stepping motor at a high rate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a fifth embodiment of the present invention which may detect disconnection during the high speed rotation of stepping motor. The driver circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> comprises a trigger circuit <b>50</b> between each output terminal of first comparator <b>8</b><i>a </i>and input terminal of OR gate <b>43</b>. Each trigger circuit <b>50</b> comprises a one-shot multivibrator (OSMV) <b>52</b> connected in a line between control circuit <b>12</b> and drive circuit <b>10</b> for producing drive signals to MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and an OR gate <b>51</b> for supplying input terminal of OR gate <b>43</b> with logical sum signal of output signals from OSMV <b>52</b> and first comparator <b>8</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To detect disconnection in winding <b>21</b> or <b>22</b> of the stepping motor driven at a normal rotation rate, disconnection detection circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is operated similarly to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and each electric element in the circuit produces the signal waveform similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the stepping motor is driven at a high rotation rate, high frequency switching signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref> and (B) are applied to each gate of MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to repeatedly turn MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> on and off in response to operation signals forwarded from control circuit <b>12</b> to drive circuit <b>10</b>. As mating MOSFET <b>2</b> is turned on before regenerative current through parasitic diode <b>2</b><i>a </i>has completed to be exhausted after MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned off during the high speed rotation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(D)</figref>, electric current through MOSFET <b>2</b> moves from negative to positive values with the slope determined by inductance of windings <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. In a similar manner, as MOSFET <b>1</b> is turned on before regenerative current through parasitic diode <b>1</b><i>a </i>has completed to be exhausted after MOSFET <b>2</b> is turned off, electric current through MOSFET <b>1</b> similarly moves from negative to positive values with the slope determined by inductance of winding <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. Accordingly, detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> during the high speed rotation indicates a serrate waveform which includes a combined feature of upward ramp and rapid fall at the trailing edge of upward ramp as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(E)</figref>. At the moment, trigger circuit <b>50</b> is operated to produce a single pulse from OSMV <b>52</b> at the time of supplying the trailing edge in drive voltage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref> and (B) to gate terminal of MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>, and thereby, OR gate <b>51</b> produces pulse array signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(F)</figref> to OR gate <b>43</b>. Each time OR gate produces a pulse to set terminal of RSFF <b>45</b>, it is set to produce the output to low-pass filter <b>46</b> from Q output terminal. When there is no disconnection in winding <b>21</b> or <b>22</b>, detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> indicates serrate waveform as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(E)</figref>, however, when disconnection occurs in for example winding <b>22</b>, regenerative current <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(C)</figref> through MOSFET <b>1</b> results in ramp detection voltage <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(E)</figref> on current detecting resistor <b>4</b>. Simultaneously, second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>does not produce any reset pulse as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(G)</figref>, and RSFF <b>45</b> produce the output of long pulse width as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(H)</figref>. Thus, low-pass filter <b>46</b> as a disconnection detector produces a disconnection detection signal when low-pass filter <b>46</b> receives from RSFF <b>45</b> the output longer of time span longer than time T<sub>4 </sub>before second comparator <b>8</b><i>b </i>produces the output. Disconnection detection signal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(I)</figref> from low-pass filter <b>46</b> causes control circuit <b>12</b> to stop operation of drive circuit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the example of producing outputs from OSMV synchronously with supplying the trailing edge in drive voltage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(A)</figref> and (B) to gate of MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>, however, OSMV <b>52</b> may produce the outputs synchronously with supplying the leading or rising edge in drive voltage to gate of MOSFET <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>. Also, OSMV <b>52</b> may produce the outputs when receives drive signals from drive circuit <b>10</b> in lieu of outputs from control circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Driver circuit <b>3</b> used for the present invention may be formed into an integrated circuit. In this case, driver circuit <b>3</b> may be formed into a semiconductor device which has an insulation such as plastic encapsulant for integrally sealing a pair of MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, current detecting resistor <b>4</b> connected between each of MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and ground, drive circuit <b>10</b> which supplies drive signals to control terminals of MOSFETs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, control circuit <b>12</b> which provides operation signals for drive circuit <b>10</b>, PWM circuit <b>14</b> which produces pulse-width modulated signals to drive circuit <b>10</b>, and comparator <b>8</b> which forwards chopper signal <b>17</b> to PWM circuit <b>14</b> to stop operation of drive circuit <b>10</b> when detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> is higher than first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>. From outside connected to peripheral terminals of the integrated circuit are electric elements such a pair of windings <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and reference voltage generators <b>34</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this way, the disconnection detecting device according to the present invention effectively comprises second reference voltage generator <b>40</b> which may produce first reference voltage V<sub>t1 </sub>and second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>lower than first reference voltage V<sub>t1</sub>; decision circuit which compares detection voltage on current detecting resistor <b>4</b> with second reference voltage V<sub>t2 </sub>and produces the output when detection voltage is higher than second reference voltage V<sub>t2</sub>; and disconnection detector <b>11</b> which produces disconnection detection signal when receives the output from decision circuit after comparator <b>8</b> produces the output to easily detect disconnection in winding <b>21</b> or <b>22</b> with a simplified circuit structure. Also, the present invention enables to produce driver circuit into an integrated circuit without utilizing high-voltage resistive switching elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and to manufacture the disconnection detection device at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The foregoing embodiments according to the present invention may be changed in various ways. For example, instead of low-pass filter <b>46</b>, the driver may comprise an integrating circuit for integrating alarm signal output or counting circuit for accumulating output time of alarm signal, and a comparator for producing a disconnection detection signal when the integrated alarm signal output or accumulated output time is over a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention is preferably applicable to a disconnection detection device in stepping motor driver which has a plurality of windings in the bifilar turn arrangement.</p>
