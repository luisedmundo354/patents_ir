<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A viewfinder of a photographing apparatus to monitor a photographed image. The viewfinder of the photographing apparatus has a viewfinder body disposed to be drawn inside of the photographing apparatus body and outside of the photographing apparatus body, and a driving unit to drive the drawing-in and drawing-out of the viewfinder body. Moreover, when an outer LCD, which is disposed at an outer part of the photographing apparatus body, is rotated by a predetermined degree in a state that the viewfinder body is drawn outside of the photographing apparatus body, the viewfinder body is automatically drawn inside of the photographing apparatus body. On the other hand, when the outer LCD is rotated on a rotating axis on a plane of the outer LCD and faces an object, the viewfinder body is drawn out again to the outside of the photographing apparatus body. Therefore, the viewfinder of the photographing apparatus can be drawn in and drawn out of the photographing apparatus body in accordance with driving of the driving unit. Accordingly, the appearance of the camcorder becomes more appealing to the eye, and storing and handling of the product becomes easier.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 01-35650 filed on Jun. 22, 2001, in the Korean Industrial Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus, and more particularly to a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus that allows a user to monitor a photographing image (or object) or a reproducing image when photographing an image or reproducing the photographed image using a photographing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A photographing apparatus is a device to photograph an image (or object, etc.). As an example of the photographing apparatus, there is an apparatus that can only photograph an image, such as a manual or an automatic camera, and an apparatus that can photograph and reproduce the image, such as a camcorder or a digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A camcorder, (also referred to as a video camera, ) photographs an image and records it as image data on a videotape, and it is used generally to record and/or reproduce the image among many photographing apparatuses. Generally, the camcorder includes a viewfinder to monitor a photographing image or a reproducing image when a user photographs an image or reproduces the photographed image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view schematically illustrating the viewfinder of a conventional camcorder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional camcorder <b>10</b> includes a camcorder body <b>11</b> having a photographing unit to photograph the image and a recording unit to record the photographed image, and a view finder <b>12</b> formed on an outer part of the camcorder body <b>11</b> to allow the user to monitor the photographing or the reproducing image. The viewfinder <b>12</b> can be manually rotated 70° to 90° to an upper part of the camcorder body <b>11</b> as indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the viewfinder <b>12</b> protrudes from the camcorder body <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, since the viewfinder of a conventional camcorder with the above construction is mounted on the camcorder body in a protruding fashion, there is a problem in that handling and storing of the product is inconvenient. In addition, when the camcorder is designed, it is difficult to design the appearance of the camcorder as simple and appealing to the eye because the construction of the viewfinder must be considered. Moreover, operation of the camcorder is not simple since the user has to move the viewfinder manually.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been designed to overcome the above-mentioned and other problems of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus that is easy to handle and store, and a camcorder having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object of the present invention to provide a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus of simple and appealing design, and a camcorder having the same.</p>

The second switch SW<b>2</b> is connected with the reproducing unit <b>84</b> and the outer LCD <b>130</b> and/or the viewfinder LCD <b>22</b> under the control of the controlling unit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">General operation of the camcorder with the above construction will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the user wants to photograph an object while seeing an image of the object through the viewfinder <b>120</b> of the camcorder <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the controlling unit <b>70</b> drives the driving motor <b>62</b> in accordance with a controlling signal from the user. When the driving motor <b>62</b> is driven, the rack <b>68</b>, engaged with the pinion <b>66</b>, is moved in the drawing-out direction of the viewfinder <b>120</b> in accordance with the rotating of the worm gear <b>64</b>. Since the rack <b>68</b> is moved, the viewfinder body <b>30</b> is drawn out of the housing <b>52</b> until the guide protrusion <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the plate spring <b>56</b> is separated from the second guide hole <b>54</b><i>b </i>and connected with the first guide hole <b>54</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, if the viewfinder <b>120</b> is drawn out of the camcorder body <b>110</b>, the controlling unit <b>70</b> supplies the image, photographed at the photographing unit <b>82</b>, to the viewfinder LCD <b>22</b> by turning on the second switch SW<b>2</b>. At this time, the outer LCD <b>130</b> is closed, and the first switch SW<b>1</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the user wants to photograph the image while seeing the outer LCD <b>130</b> of the camcorder <b>100</b> instead of the viewfinder <b>120</b>, the user rotatably opens the outer LCD <b>130</b>. The rotating range detecting unit <b>72</b> detects the rotating degree of the outer LCD <b>130</b> and sends this information to the controlling unit <b>70</b>. The controlling unit <b>70</b> draws in the viewfinder <b>120</b> into the camcorder body <b>110</b> by driving the driving motor <b>62</b> when the rotating degree, detected at the rotating range detecting unit <b>72</b>, falls in a predetermined range that is more than 10° and less than 20°. Further, the controlling unit <b>70</b> does not supply the image, photographed at the photographing unit <b>82</b>, to the viewfinder LCD <b>22</b> by turning off the second switch SW<b>2</b>. Moreover, the controlling unit <b>70</b> displays the image signal photographed at the photographing unit <b>82</b> through the outer LCD <b>130</b> by turning on the first switch SW<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Similar to the above operation, if the user closes the outer LCD <b>130</b> of the camcorder <b>100</b> while photographing the image using the viewfinder <b>120</b>, the rotating range detecting unit <b>72</b> detects the rotating degree of the outer LCD <b>130</b> and sends this information to the controlling unit <b>70</b>. When the rotating degree detected at the rotating range detecting unit <b>72</b> is less than <b>100</b>, the controlling unit <b>70</b> turns off the first switch SW<b>1</b> and does not display the image photographed at the photographing unit <b>82</b> through the outer LCD <b>130</b>. Instead, the controlling unit <b>70</b> draws the viewfinder <b>120</b> outside of the camcorder body <b>110</b> by driving the driving motor <b>62</b>. When the driving motor <b>62</b> is driven in this case, the rack <b>68</b>, engaged with the pinion <b>66</b>, is moved in the drawing-out direction of the viewfinder <b>120</b> in accordance with the rotation of the worm gear <b>64</b>. As the rack <b>68</b> moves, the viewfinder body <b>30</b> is drawn out from the housing <b>52</b> until the guide protrusion <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the plate spring <b>56</b> is separated from the second guide hole <b>54</b><i>b </i>and connected with the first guide hole <b>54</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the viewfinder <b>120</b> is drawn out from the camcorder body <b>110</b>, the controlling unit <b>70</b> drives the second switch SW<b>2</b>. As the second switch SW<b>2</b> is driven, the image signal, photographed through the photographing unit <b>82</b>, is displayed on the viewfinder LCD <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another example provides a case wherein the image being photographed is a person, wherein both the user that photographs the image using the camcorder <b>100</b> and the person that is being photographed want to see the photographing image. The person who photographs the image manipulates a drawing-out signal of the viewfinder <b>120</b> to the controlling unit <b>70</b>. The controlling unit <b>70</b> drives the driving motor <b>62</b> in accordance with the drawing-out signal. When the driving motor <b>62</b> is driven, the rack <b>68</b>, engaged with the pinion <b>66</b>, is moved in the drawing-out direction of the viewfinder <b>120</b> in accordance with rotation of the worm gear <b>64</b>. As the rack <b>68</b> moves, the viewfinder body <b>30</b> is drawn out of the housing <b>52</b> until the guide protrusion <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the plate spring <b>56</b> is separated from the second guide hole <b>54</b><i>b </i>and connected with the first guide hole <b>54</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, if the viewfinder <b>120</b> is drawn out of the camcorder body <b>110</b>, the controlling unit <b>70</b> supplies the image signal photographed through the photographing unit <b>82</b> to the viewfinder LCD <b>22</b> by turning on the second switch SW<b>2</b>. Then, the person doing the photographing opens the outer LCD <b>130</b> and makes the outer LCD <b>130</b> face the image being photographed by rotating the outer LCD <b>130</b> on a rotating axis X on the plane of the outer LCD <b>130</b>. The rotating range detecting unit <b>72</b> detects the rotating degree of the outer LCD <b>130</b> and sends this information to the controlling unit <b>70</b>. The controlling unit <b>70</b> turns on the first switch SW<b>1</b> when the rotating degree detected at the rotating range detecting unit <b>72</b> is more than 170° and less than 270°, and controls the outer LCD <b>130</b> to display the image photographed at the photographing unit <b>82</b> thereon. The user who photographs the image can see the photographed image through the viewfinder <b>120</b>, and the person being photographed can see the photographed image through the outer LCD <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment of the present invention, the image being photographed through the photographing unit <b>82</b> has been illustrated and described, but the present invention is not limited to the embodiment. The present invention can be applied to a case wherein the image being recorded at a predetermined recording medium is reproduced through the reproducing unit <b>84</b>. In table <b>7</b>, the drawing-in and drawing-out of the viewfinder <b>120</b>, as described above, in accordance with the outer LCD <b>130</b> is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is illustrated whether the image signal is displayed or not at the outer LCD <b>130</b> and/or the viewfinder <b>120</b>, in accordance with the on/off status of the first switch SW<b>1</b> and the second switch SW<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the present invention, when the camcorder <b>100</b> is turned on or when the outer LCD <b>130</b> is closed, the viewfinder body <b>30</b> is automatically drawn out of the camcorder body <b>110</b>. In the meantime, when the camcorder <b>100</b> is turned off or the outer LCD <b>130</b> attached at the camcorder <b>100</b> is opened, the viewfinder body <b>30</b> is drawn into the camcorder <b>100</b>. Therefore, the operation of the viewfinder <b>120</b> is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, when the outer LCD <b>130</b> is rotated by, for example, 180° on the rotating axis on the plane of the outer LCD <b>130</b>, the viewfinder body <b>30</b> is drawn out of the camcorder body <b>110</b> with the above construction, and both the person who photographs and the image (or person) being photographed can view the photographed image. Note that the degree of rotation of the outer LCD <b>130</b> on the rotating axis on the plane of the outer LCD <b>130</b> may be set to any desired degree that provides the inventive feature as stated above.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, since the viewfinder <b>120</b> can be drawn into the camcorder body <b>110</b>, handling and storing of the camcorder <b>100</b> becomes easier, and the appearance of the camcorder can be designed easier and more appealing to the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
