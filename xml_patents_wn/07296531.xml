<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A breading machine has first and second combination battering/breading units positioned in close proximity to each other. Certain features of the invention have utility with machines having only a single battering/breading unit. Each of the combination units has a battering unit for applying a fluent batter to a food product. The battering unit includes a batter reservoir and a battering unit conveyor system for delivering food products from said batter reservoir to a battering unit conveyor discharge section that propels the food product from the battering unit. The combination units also include a breading unit for receiving food product from an associated battering unit. The breading unit includes a breading reservoir and breading unit conveyor system for applying particulate breading to the food product at a breading station by moving breading material from the breading material reservoir and food product coated with the batter to the breading station. A drive motor is coupled through respective first and second transmissions to provide motive power to the conveyors systems of each of the first and second combination battering/breading units for moving food products simultaneously through the combination battering/breading units.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to food product breading machines and more particularly to food product breading machines that are used to coat flaccid products with particulate breading materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flaccid food products, such as fish filets and chicken tenders, and delicate, frangible products, like croquettes, are typically breaded and fried for consumption by restaurant customers. These products, together with other foods that are fried, are frequently produced and consumed in volumes sufficient to justify in-restaurant use of machinery that batters and then coats the products with particulate breading material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prior art machinery used for breading food products functioned for both relatively rigid products, like bone-in chicken parts, onion rings, etc., and the noted flaccid products. The machines in question utilized open mesh wire conveyor belts that carried the products through the machinery. The machines often comprised a battering unit, where the products were coated with a fluent batter, and a breading unit where breading was applied to the product and adhered to the batter coating. The battering units had a conveyor belt that delivered battered products to a breading unit conveyor belt before the breading was applied.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Machines have been constructed with the battering unit supported vertically above the breading unit. The battering and breading units were oriented so that a single attendant, at one end of the machine, could load items into the battering unit and receive the items, breaded, from the breading unit. This was a particularly effective way to bread food products to order, as the attendant could load the number of items constituting an order into the machine, receive the breaded items and fry them at once. The superposed battering and breading units also provided a small “footprint” that minimized the space occupied by the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These machines were not without drawbacks. The unit conveyors were spaced vertically apart and configured so that battered items dropped from one conveyor to the other. Flaccid and frangible products, like fish filets, chicken tenders, and croquettes, presented problems. Flaccid products were often folded or heaped on the breading unit conveyor when breading was applied. Consequently, some flaccid products were only partially breaded while others were unevenly coated. Frangible products were sometimes broken up when dropped from one conveyor to the other. Relatively rigid products were more effectively handled although they sometimes landed roughly on the breading unit conveyor material and the impacts sometimes created clouds of breading and spillage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The battering and breading machine that is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,356 overcame the handling problems associated with flaccid and frangible food items, as well as rough handling of dimensionally stable items, by locating the battering unit laterally spaced from and in-line with the breading unit. The battering unit conveyor was positionable adjacent the breading unit conveyor so that flaccid and frangible items were handed-off to the breading conveyor without folding, heaping, or breaking up. The machine had a relatively large foot print and required the attendant to load items into the end of the machine that was opposite from the discharge end. This required sufficient floor space for the attendant to move around the machine from one end to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem with the prior art breading units was that after breading material was applied, the food products often carried breading material that was either loose, or only weakly adhered to the product. Food products carrying such breading were delivered from the breading units and placed in fryers where the breading was dislodged. This material was sometimes later be adhered to food products during frying, creating unappealing appearance and flavor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Unloading breading material from prior art breading machines has sometimes been difficult. Some prior art machines were constructed in such a way that the entire breading reservoir had to be physically removed from the machine in order to dump the breading material. Some reservoirs were equipped with trap doors that allowed breading material to fall from the reservoir while others utilized panels that were moved into position under conveyors so that the breading could be conveyed along and discharged from the machines at a discharge location. The prior art machines were constructed for discharging breading material from machines that had particular architectures. For example, where the machines had a distinct reservoir that was located at an elevated location trap doors enabled dumped breading to be collected under the reservoir. Where the under-conveyor panels were used, the machines had a discharge location for food products that also served as the discharge location for the breading material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,170 to Whited et al. concerns a new and improved food product breading machine that reliably conveys flaccid and frangible food products to a breading station without folding, heaping or breakage. The disclosure of the '170 patent to Whited et al is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention concerns improvements to the apparatus disclosed in the '170 patent to Whited et al.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As disclosed in the '170 patent, the breading machine had a reservoir that was mounted to pins or posts supported by a base plate. The reservoir included a drive roller for a breading conveyor that was activated by a motor positioned to the side of the reservoir and connected to the drive roller by a transmission. The entire reservoir could be removed by decoupling the drive roller and motor. Due to the angled base of the reservoir, its engagement produced a side force against the coupling between motor and the reservoir drive roller.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A latching system for coupling the reservoir to the drive motor consisted of a latch that was mounted on the breader reservoir, rotated downward over the coupling. This system works well in eliminating the breader reservoir from moving side-to-side axially but does nothing for supporting the breader load vertically. Also the latch had a tendency to ride up out of its groove causing the breader to become disengaged during operation, resulting in break in production.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An exemplary embodiment of the invention is an improved machine for coating food products with a particulate breading material. The exemplary machine has first and second combination battering/breading units positioned in close proximity to each other. Certain features of the invention have utility with machines having only a single battering/breading unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of the combination units has a battering unit for applying a fluent batter to a food product. The battering unit includes a batter reservoir and a battering unit conveyor system for delivering food products from said batter reservoir to a battering unit conveyor discharge section that propels the food product from the battering unit. The combination units also include a breading unit for receiving food product from an associated battering unit. The breading unit includes a breading reservoir and breading unit conveyor system for applying particulate breading to the food product at a breading station by moving breading material from the breading material reservoir and food product coated with the batter to the breading station.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A drive motor is coupled through respective first and second transmissions to provide motive power to the conveyors systems of each of the first and second combination battering/breading units for moving food products simultaneously through the combination battering/breading units. Use of this configuration food coating machine allows different types of foods to be prepared at the same time with a single machine.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODES CONTEMPLATED OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A food product breading machine <b>10</b> constructed according to the invention is illustrated in the drawings. The machine <b>10</b> is especially useful in restaurants where individual food products that are flaccid, such as chicken tenders, fish filets, etc., or frangible, such as croquettes, are fried to order. The machine <b>10</b> coats individual food items with a fluent batter and then overcoats them with a particulate breading material that clings to the batter. The breaded items are discharged from the machine in condition for frying.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The exemplary embodiment of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> is a breading machine <b>10</b> that has first and second combination battering/breading units <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> positioned in close proximity to each other. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention the units <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are positioned in side by side relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the combination units <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> has a battering unit <b>16</b> for applying a fluent batter to a food product. The battering unit includes a batter reservoir and a battering unit conveyor system for delivering food products from said batter reservoir to a battering unit conveyor discharge section that propels the food product from the battering unit. Each combination unit also include a breading unit <b>18</b> positioned beneath the battering unit <b>16</b> for receiving food product from an associated battering unit. The breading unit includes a breading reservoir and breading unit conveyor system for applying particulate breading to the food product at a breading station by moving breading material from the breading material reservoir and food product coated with the batter to the breading station.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A drive motor <b>20</b> is coupled through respective first and second transmissions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to provide motive power to the conveyor systems of each of the first and second combination battering/breading units for moving food products simultaneously through the combination battering/breading units. Use of this configuration food coating machine allows different types of foods to be simultaneously prepared in the two side by side units <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The combination unit <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is configured with the battering unit <b>16</b> stacked on top of the breading unit <b>18</b>. Food items are placed in the battering unit at one end <b>110</b> of the unit, conveyed in a generally horizontal direction through the battering unit, and delivered to the breading unit. The food items from the battering unit are conveyed through the breading unit in the opposite direction and discharged from the machine at the same end <b>110</b> where they are collected for frying. The machine attendant can thus feed food products constituting an order into the machine and receive the breaded products from the machine without having to change position. The breaded items can be accumulated in a frying basket and immediately placed in a fryer (or in the instance of two products that are prepared simultaneously in separate fryers). The relatively small area occupied by the machine <b>10</b> enables it to be positioned on a table top or counter adjacent a fryer if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the illustrated combination units has a base frame <b>112</b> that is constructed and arranged so that the battering and breading units <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are detachably supported and easily removable for cleaning without requiring the use of hand tools. In the illustrated embodiment, the base frame <b>112</b> comprises a base plate <b>120</b>, support legs <b>122</b>, and support structures <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> that extend upwardly from the base plate and bear the weight of both the breading and battering units. The illustrated support structures <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> are formed by respective pairs of sheet metal stanchions that have supporting cross bars extending between their respective upper ends and on which the breading unit <b>18</b> rests. The stanchions pairs frictionally grip the breading unit <b>18</b>. The unit <b>18</b> is removable for cleaning, etc. by lifting it from the cross bars. The legs <b>122</b> are sized so that the machine <b>10</b> may be placed on a table top or counter during use.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A drive system <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is constructed and arranged to drive food product conveyor systems associated with the two pairs of battering and breading units <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> so that food products are conveyed substantially continuously through the machine <b>10</b>. The illustrated drive system <b>118</b> comprises a drive motor <b>20</b>, a drive transmission <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) between the motor and the unit conveyor systems, and a tower arrangement <b>134</b> for supporting the transmission <b>132</b>. The tower arrangement comprises towers <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> that are anchored to and spaced apart along the base plate <b>120</b>. The towers <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are illustrated as relatively thick steel plates. The motor <b>20</b> is anchored to the tower <b>136</b> and drives the transmission through a gear reduction and an output shaft that is supported by bearings in the tower <b>136</b>. The drive transmission <b>132</b> is illustrated as a chain drive comprising two drive chains <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and shafts and sprockets that run in mesh with the drive chains and are rotatably supported by the towers <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>. The towers <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> rotatably support drive shafts <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>145</b> each carrying a driving sprocket at extending through bearings in the associated tower plates to transmit power to the breading and battering unit conveyor systems described below. A chain guard structure <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) encloses the tower arrangement and drive transmission <b>132</b>. The motor <b>20</b> is illustrated as an electric motor. Since two side by side units are utilized, each end of the shafts <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>145</b> are exposed on opposite sides of the tower for coupling to a respective conveyor as described more completely below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The illustrated battering unit <b>16</b> receives food items placed on a conveyor by an attendant, completely immerses the items in a batter pool, enables excess batter to be shed from the items and delivers the battered items to the breading unit <b>18</b>. A battering unit <b>16</b> similar to the unit depicted in the drawings is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is described and illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,356 and the illustrations and description there are incorporated herein in their entireties by this reference to that patent.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The battering unit <b>16</b> comprises a batter reservoir <b>150</b> and a battering unit conveyor system <b>152</b>. The battering unit conveyor system <b>152</b> is supported by the batter reservoir <b>150</b> and operated by the drive system <b>118</b> to move food products through the batter reservoir and deliver them to the breading unit <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The batter reservoir <b>150</b> is illustrated in the form of an open top tank with the battering conveyor system <b>152</b> occupying the tank. The conveyor system <b>152</b> moves food items placed in the unit <b>16</b> at the machine end <b>110</b> through a batter pool in the tank and delivers food items from the tank into the breading unit. The batter reservoir is seated atop the breading unit <b>18</b>. In the illustrated machine <b>10</b> the reservoir rests on a pair of support rods <b>160</b> that extend between supporting plates <b>162</b> that project upwardly from the breading unit <b>18</b>. The battering reservoir, with its contents, is lifted off the support rods for cleaning and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The illustrated conveyor system <b>152</b> comprises a food product battering section <b>180</b>, a product delivery conveyor section <b>182</b> projecting from the tank downwardly toward the breading unit, and a conveyor driving assembly <b>183</b> coupled to the drive transmission <b>132</b> by means of the power output shaft <b>143</b>. The conveyor sections <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> share a common conveyor “belt” <b>184</b>. The belt supports the food items over minimal contact areas to maximize contact between food products and the batter while minimizing the amount of batter remaining on the conveyor belt after passing through the batter pool.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The illustrated belt <b>184</b> is fabricated from linked metal wires forming a wide mesh, screen-like chain that extends substantially across the lateral width of the reservoir. The illustrated driving assembly <b>183</b> comprises a drive shaft <b>185</b> that extends laterally across the conveyor at the juncture of the sections <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>. The shaft carries belt driving sprocket wheels spaced apart between the sides of the battering conveyor and the input shaft <b>143</b> driven by the transmission <b>132</b>. The shaft <b>185</b> is detachably connected or coupled to the drive shaft <b>143</b> by telescoping the shaft ends together in driving relationship (not illustrated). The shafts can be disconnected manually by a machine attendant when the battering unit is removed for cleaning or replacement. The driving connection can be formed by a female shaft end forming a slot and a conforming tooth on the other male shaft end, by male and female splines, etc. While a wire mesh conveyor belt <b>184</b> is illustrated, any suitable form of conveyor could be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The battering conveyor section <b>180</b> extends between the reservoir entrance and discharge while the battering conveyor delivery section <b>182</b> projects from the battering section <b>180</b> for delivering battered food items to the breading unit <b>18</b>. The delivery section comprises a manual adjustment mechanism <b>190</b> and a delivery conveyor end section <b>192</b> projecting from the mechanism <b>190</b>. The end section <b>192</b> cooperates with the adjustment mechanism such that the projecting conveyor end is adjustably positionable vertically relative to the breading unit.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The adjustment mechanism <b>190</b> enables the machine attendant to manually reposition the conveyor end section <b>192</b> to accommodate food products having differing thicknesses.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The breading unit <b>18</b> comprises a breading material reservoir <b>200</b>, a breading unit conveyor system for moving food products. The conveyor system also moves breading material along a travel path P through the breading material reservoir <b>200</b>. The conveyor system also both breading and food product to a breading application station <b>206</b>. A breading material flow controlling system <b>208</b> operates so that food products conveyed through the station <b>206</b> pass through a standing wave of breading material. A breading discharge mechanism <b>210</b> directs breading material out of the reservoir when the breading unit is being emptied of breading material.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reservoir <b>200</b> is constructed and arranged so that breading material that is not applied to food items passing through the station <b>206</b> is recirculated through the reservoir by the conveyor system. The reservoir <b>200</b> is illustrated as an open top hopper-like construction defining parallel side walls <b>211</b>, a horizontal base section <b>212</b>, an end wall <b>214</b> beneath the battering conveyor end section, and an upwardly sloped bottom wall <b>216</b> extending between the horizontal base section <b>212</b> and the end wall <b>214</b>. The reservoir end <b>218</b> corresponding to the machine end <b>110</b> is open so that food products discharged from the machine pass through the open end <b>218</b> adjacent the base wall section <b>212</b>. A breading supporting panel <b>219</b> extends across the reservoir between the end wall <b>214</b> and the breading station <b>206</b>. The illustrated reservoir <b>200</b> is constructed from sheet stainless steel and is detachably secured to the base frame <b>112</b> so that the reservoir is manually removable from the base frame without using tools.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The reservoir <b>200</b> holds a quantity of breading material and delivers the breading material at a controlled rate due to operation of the breading unit conveyor described below. Breading material is added to the reservoir by means of a side chute <b>201</b> attached to the side wall <b>211</b> and illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-16</figref>. The chute <b>201</b> is constructed of sheet metal that is bent to define a sloped wall <b>202</b><i>a</i>, and two triangular shaped side walls <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>202</b><i>c</i>. During assembly of the reservoir <b>200</b>, the chute is attached to a side wall <b>211</b> by means of mounting tabs <b>203</b> that engage slots in the side wall <b>211</b>. The sloped wall <b>202</b><i>a </i>ends in a straight edge <b>204</b> that fits into a bottom of a rectangular hole in the side wall <b>211</b> sized to accommodate the chute <b>201</b>. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention the hole has dimensions of approximately 6.2 by 2.6 inches. The width dimension of the chute is slightly greater than the width (6.2 in) of this opening.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The breading unit conveyor system propels the food items and breading material along a travel path P and recirculates the breading material through the reservoir <b>200</b>. The illustrated breading unit conveyor system comprises first and second food product conveyor sections <b>220</b>, <b>222</b> for conveying food products received by the breading unit conveyor system downwardly and horizontally to the breading station <b>206</b> and thereafter out of the breading unit at the machine end <b>110</b>. The first, food product receiving conveyor section <b>220</b> is located adjacent and below the distal end of the battering unit conveyor and is positioned vertically above the level of the breading station <b>206</b> and horizontally spaced from the breading station. The second food product conveyor section <b>222</b> receives food product from the first conveyor section <b>220</b>, propels breading material and food products generally horizontally across the breading support panel <b>219</b>, through the breading station <b>206</b>, discharges breaded food products from the unit <b>18</b>, and recirculates unused breading through the reservoir <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The conveyor section <b>220</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) receives food products from the battering unit conveyor system, reverses the products' direction of travel and delivers the food products to the conveyor section <b>222</b>. The conveyor section <b>220</b> is angled downwardly so that the food products delivered to it from the battering conveyor are delivered gently onto the conveyor section <b>222</b> for movement through the breading station. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>, the conveyor section <b>220</b> comprises a framework <b>230</b>, a drive shaft assembly <b>232</b> detachably connected to the transmission <b>132</b>, and a conveyor belt <b>234</b> driven by the shaft assembly <b>232</b>. The illustrated belt <b>234</b> is constructed like the belt <b>184</b> but may be of any suitable construction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The framework <b>230</b> supports the drive shaft assembly <b>232</b> and the conveyor belt <b>234</b>. The framework <b>230</b> comprises a supporting hub <b>240</b>, laterally spaced side frame members <b>242</b>, transverse tie rods <b>244</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that extend between and support the side frames, and a drive shaft bearing assembly <b>246</b> that supports the tie rods <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>and the shaft assembly end on an opposite side of the framework spaced from the hub <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The supporting hub <b>240</b> is a tubular member into which the shaft assembly <b>232</b> extends and which cantilevers the framework <b>230</b> to the tower <b>136</b>. The hub <b>240</b> is formed by a tubular cylindrical body having outwardly extending flanges at its opposite ends. An outermost of the flanges <b>250</b> defines a plurality of circumferentially spaced keyhole slots <b>253</b> that receive respective headed studs <b>254</b> that are fixed to the tower <b>136</b>. In one embodiment, the studs <b>254</b> are carried by a flanged tube that is fixed to the tower <b>136</b> by suitable fasteners and encircles the drive shaft <b>144</b> that projects from the side of the tower to engage the drive shaft assembly <b>232</b>. A second hub flange (not shown) is fastened to the side frame <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The side frames <b>242</b> are illustrated as sheet metal members that extend along respective opposite sides of the conveyor belt <b>234</b>. The tie rods <b>244</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>extend between the side frames and are secured in place by thumb screws <b>256</b> that clamp each end of each tie rod to a respective side frame member. In the illustrated machine three tie rods <b>244</b><i>a</i>-<b>244</b><i>c </i>have threaded openings in each end, each of which receives a thumb screw that extends through a hole in the adjacent side frame. The head of each thumb screw bears on the side frame to clamp the side frame and tie rod together. The tie rods <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>are clamped between the side frames, the hub flange <b>252</b> and the bearing assembly <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The shaft assembly <b>232</b> is driven from the chain drive and supported for rotation between the hub <b>240</b> and the bearing assembly <b>246</b>. The illustrated shaft assembly comprises a shaft member <b>260</b> and belt driving sprockets <b>262</b> that are attached to the shaft member. The shaft member end that projects through the hub <b>240</b> is supported in a bearing mounted in the hub and telescopes into driving relationship with the drive shaft <b>144</b> when the conveyor section <b>220</b> is assembled to the tower <b>134</b></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The tie rod <b>244</b><i>d </i>extends between the side frame ends remote from the hub <b>240</b> and defines an external surface that is shaped to guide the belt <b>234</b> around the end of the conveyor section <b>220</b>. The tie rod has pins <b>270</b> that extend through an L-shaped slot <b>272</b> in the side walls of the conveyor <b>220</b> The L-shaped slot has a short downwardly extending portion into which the pins seat during operation of the conveyor <b>220</b>. During idle times of the machine the conveyor can be cleaned by lifting the tie rod <b>244</b><i>d </i>up and sliding the pins at either end of the tie rod back through an elongated extent of the slot toward the hub <b>240</b>. A fully retracted position of the tie rod <b>244</b><i>d </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. This position relaxes the belt tension for either cleaning or servicing of the conveyor <b>220</b>. Occasionally during the batter/breading cycle of food products, smaller products slip through the openings in the belt <b>234</b> and are trapped inside the belt loop shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Use of the slotted side walls allows the operator to relax tension in the belt so that he or she can retrieve and clean this conveyor section more quickly and easily. Also the ability to relax the tension in the belt allows the components of the conveyor <b>220</b> to be serviced more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The side walls of the conveyor bend outwardly at their top to achieve a funnel effect for products delivered from the battering unit. Each of the two side walls has a relatively vertical lower section <b>242</b><i>a </i>that bounds the belt and an angled upper section <b>242</b><i>b </i>that funnels the food product from the battering unit as the food is dropped by the discharge portion of the battering unit conveyor. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention the angle between the vertical and the sloped or angled upper portion of the wall is 30 degrees. It is believed that other angles are possible and angles between 45 and 15 degrees of slope are preferable. Angles of between zero and 90 degrees are possible. The greater the angle, the wider the food channeling region but too wide an angle could result in food product collecting along an inner portion of the conveyor wall.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The conveyor section <b>220</b> is manually assembled to and removed from the tower <b>134</b> by relatively rotating the hub flange <b>240</b> so that the studs <b>254</b> that extend from the tower are released from the keyhole slots <b>253</b> in the hub flange <b>250</b>. The conveyor section <b>220</b> is then pulled laterally away from the tower <b>134</b> so that the shaft assembly <b>232</b> is removed from its connection to the drive shaft <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The conveyor section <b>222</b> operates to direct food items and breading to the breading station <b>206</b>, discharge the breaded food items from the machine <b>10</b> and recirculate the unused breading material through the breading unit. As noted, the conveyor section <b>220</b> is angled downwardly with its discharge end located adjacent the conveyor section <b>222</b>. The conveyor section <b>222</b> is located immediately adjacent the discharge end of the section <b>220</b> and operates to create a flow of breading material out of the bottom of the breading reservoir <b>200</b>, past the discharge end of the conveyor <b>220</b> and into the breading station. The food products discharged from the conveyor <b>220</b> are gently deposited onto the flow of breading material that is passing by on the conveyor section <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The illustrated conveyor section <b>222</b> is multi-tiered, providing an upper run that conveys both breading and food products to the breading station <b>206</b>, a lower run onto which breaded food products are dropped from the upper run and which then conveys the breaded products to a discharge location at the machine end <b>110</b>. The conveyor system also has a recycling run that extends along the base wall section <b>212</b> and the sloping wall <b>216</b> for conveying unused breading back to the reservoir for redelivery to the upper run. The illustrated conveyor section comprises a single belt <b>310</b>, a belt drive shaft assembly <b>312</b> disposed in the reservoir <b>200</b> and detachably connected to the drive transmission <b>132</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, belt guides <b>314</b>, <b>315</b> and a belt tensioner <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The conveyor belt <b>310</b> is illustrated as constructed like the belt <b>184</b> in that it comprises a wire mesh structure that supports the food products but permits breading to drop from the belt into the reservoir <b>200</b> at locations where the belt is not located over the breading supporting panel <b>219</b>. While a wire mesh belt is illustrated, other forms of conveyor can be utilized so long as they perform the same function as the wire mesh belt, i.e. the conveyor moves the food products along the travel path beyond the breading station while enabling the unused breading to be returned to the breading reservoir without being discharged from the machine with the food products.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The belt drive shaft assembly <b>312</b> is located at the discharge end of the upper conveyor run so that the belt <b>310</b> is pulled across the panel <b>219</b> and through the breading station <b>206</b>. The illustrated drive shaft assembly <b>312</b> comprises a shaft <b>316</b> that extends from the transmission <b>132</b> through the reservoir <b>200</b>, bearings <b>318</b> supporting the shaft for rotation in the reservoir side walls, sprockets <b>320</b> fixed on the shaft for driving the belt, and a drive coupling <b>322</b> for detachably securing the shaft <b>316</b> to the drive transmission shaft <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The drive coupling is formed by telescoping end portions of the shaft <b>316</b> and the shaft <b>145</b>. In the illustrated machine the shaft <b>145</b> has a female end opening (not illustrated) that defines a central bore with diametrically opposed axial slots extending from it. The shaft <b>316</b> defines a projecting male end (not illustrated) that is conformed to the shape of the female end opening and slides axially into the shaft <b>145</b> to provide a driving connection that transmits adequate torque to operate the breading unit conveyor section <b>222</b>. The driving coupling also serves to maintain the breading unit <b>18</b> in proper alignment with the base frame <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A locking latch system <b>321</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>) is a way of locking the heavily loaded breader conveyors into their optimum operating positions. The breaders are designed with a tapered slope on the bottom surface or wall <b>216</b> which when combined with the weight of the loaded breader creates tremendous stress on the coupled shafts <b>145</b>, <b>316</b> and bearings for those shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The new latching system <b>321</b> redirects a reaction force equal to and normal to the downward force generated by the heavily loaded breader conveyors. A latch <b>324</b> in its locked position keeps the shafts in line concentrically, promoting smoother breader conveyor operation and reduces bearing and shaft wear. The Latch is mounted to a guide bearing housing <b>322</b> which is supported by the tower <b>138</b> without fasteners utilizing slots <b>326</b> and tabs <b>328</b>. The latch <b>324</b> and can only be installed or removed when the slots and tabs line up with corresponding slots and tabs on the guide bearing housing <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When installing a breader conveyor the latch is first rotated counterclockwise as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and the shafts <b>145</b>, <b>316</b> brought into driving engagement with each other. The latch <b>324</b> is then rotated clockwise to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The upward movement of the latch <b>324</b> brings a slot <b>330</b> into locking engagement with a shaft <b>332</b> supported by a side wall <b>211</b> of the breading reservoir <b>200</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, it is seen that the slot <b>330</b> terminates at one end by a rounded portion <b>334</b> sized to accommodate the shaft <b>332</b>. An entrance to the rounded portion <b>334</b> is defined by means of two small detents or knobs <b>336</b><i>a</i>, <b>336</b><i>b</i>. As the latch is locked in place the shaft <b>332</b> seats securely in the rounded portion <b>334</b> and due to restraining action of these detents <b>336</b><i>a</i>, <b>336</b><i>b </i>keeps the latch from releasing during operation. An outer surface of the shaft <b>332</b> is exposed within a slot <b>338</b> defined by collars <b>340</b><i>a</i>, <b>340</b><i>b </i>attached to the side wall <b>211</b>. If the latch were allowed to disengage during operation the breader conveyor could eventually pull from the drive shaft and the conveyor will stop running.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The belt guides <b>314</b>, <b>315</b> together with the shaft assembly <b>312</b> , train the belt <b>310</b> to define the conveyor runs and comprise an idler shaft <b>314</b><i>a </i>at the end of the run opposite to the shaft assembly , a pair of belt guiding elements <b>315</b> that direct the belt from the shaft assembly to the lower run, and a guide shaft, at the machine discharge end <b>110</b>, around which the belt <b>310</b> is trained as it leaves the lower run and moves onto the recycling run.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The belt <b>310</b> moves upwardly along the sloping reservoir bottom wall <b>216</b> and around the idler shaft <b>314</b><i>a </i>in alignment with the shaft assembly on the upper run. The idler shaft thus defines an end of both the recycling run and the upper run. The illustrated idler shaft is an undriven rotatable shaft that extends laterally across the reservoir <b>200</b> adjacent the end wall <b>214</b> and carries sprocket wheels that run in mesh with the belt <b>310</b>. The shaft is supported in bearings that are mounted in the sidewalls <b>211</b> of the reservoir <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The belt guiding elements <b>315</b> guide the belt <b>310</b> off of the drive shaft assembly <b>312</b> and train the belt along a smooth re-entrantly curved path—i.e. curved oppositely from the belt curvature as it passes around the shaft assembly <b>312</b>—from the shaft assembly <b>312</b> to the lower run. The reverse curvature of the belt proceeding from the shaft assembly <b>312</b> assures that food products passing the drive shaft assembly <b>312</b> on the upper run fall onto the lower belt run. Each of the two spaced elements <b>315</b> is formed by a curved plastic plate that is attached to a respective reservoir side wall <b>211</b> below the shaft assembly <b>312</b>. The elements <b>315</b> thus engage the opposite side edge portions of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The guide shaft <b>314</b><i>b </i>is a rod-like member that extends between the side walls <b>211</b> at the open reservoir end <b>110</b>. The illustrated shaft <b>314</b><i>b </i>is constructed from stainless steel and has an outer surface defined by a series of cylindrical lands that are smooth to allow the belt <b>310</b> to pass around the shaft <b>314</b><i>b </i>with minimal friction. The shaft <b>314</b><i>b </i>has an axially extending mounting pin <b>317</b> at each end by which the shaft is supported by the side walls. As illustrated, a base wall <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at the open reservoir end <b>110</b> terminates short of the ends of the side walls <b>211</b> so that food products passing the shaft <b>314</b><i>b </i>drop out of the machine end <b>110</b> beyond the base wall section.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The belt tensioner <b>313</b> maintains the belt tension relatively constant during operation of the machine <b>10</b>. The illustrated tensioner comprises a belt engaging tensioning member that is resiliently biased into engagement with the belt on the recycling run, tensioning member support arms mounting the member to the reservoir, and links that extend between the tensioning member and the shaft <b>314</b><i>b </i>for shifting the shaft position relative to the reservoir as the belt tensioning member <b>200</b> changes position. Additional details concerning operation of the belt tensioner are found in the Whited et al '170 patent which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The belt <b>310</b> sweeps unused breading material adjacent the wall section <b>212</b> and the sloping bottom wall <b>216</b> upwardly toward the end wall <b>214</b> where the breading material wells up and is conveyed by the belt in the upper run across the panel <b>219</b> toward the breading station <b>206</b>. In the illustrated machine <b>10</b>, the flow of the breading up and out of the reservoir is directed so that spillage does not occur and the material is distributed across the panel <b>219</b> in a pattern that facilitates complete coverage of the food items at the breading station. As illustrated, the uppermost side of the end wall <b>214</b> is provided with a flange <b>332</b> that extends the width of the end wall and projects into the reservoir <b>200</b> so that breading material that wells up from the bottom of the reservoir does not spill out of the reservoir over the end wall.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A breading flow control system controls and restricts the passage of breading material through the breading station <b>206</b> without impeding the movement of food products. Food products passing through the breading station are inundated by breading material. The breading flow control system comprises a breading diverter <b>350</b> for forming the breading material as the conveyor moves the material toward the loading location and a breading flow restrictor <b>352</b> for creating a standing wave of breading material at the station <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The illustrated diverter <b>350</b> is formed by a breading plow that projects from the conveyor section <b>220</b> toward the upper run of the conveyor <b>222</b> to produce a smooth flat bed of the breading material passing under the end of the conveyor section and continuous parallel breading mounds forming opposite lateral sides of the breading material bed. The illustrated plow comprises a plate-like rectangular member having a projecting side that extends into the breading material being moved by the conveyor <b>222</b>, so that some of the breading flow is diverted around the opposite plow plate sides to form the mounds. The plow is attached to the conveyor section by tabs <b>360</b> that project from opposite sides of the plate-like plow member through slots in the conveyor section side frames <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The breading flow restrictor creates the standing wave of breading material at the breading station through which the food products are conveyed. The flow restrictor <b>352</b> comprises wall sections <b>362</b><i>a</i>, <b>362</b><i>b </i>that extend over the upper conveyor run and the panel <b>219</b> to direct the breading material in a convergent flow pattern toward the breading station, and a plurality of breading flow restrictor members <b>244</b> respectively supported above the upper conveyor run <b>170</b> at the breading station for maintaining a fluidic mass of breading material at the breading station.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The illustrated side wall sections each have a convergent portion <b>362</b><i>a </i>that interacts with the breading material flowing along the upper run. The convergent sections interact with the breading material so that the mounds of breading are channeled inwardly toward the center of the upper run and break like waves over food products approaching the breading station. The side walls have parallel extending portions <b>362</b><i>b </i>that extend from the inner ends of the convergent portions through the breading station <b>106</b>. The side walls <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> are fixed in position with respect to the breading station with the parallel wall portions <b>362</b><i>b </i>forming a throat section through which most of the breading and the food products are directed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The illustrated machine employs two rows <b>372</b>, <b>374</b> of restrictor members <b>370</b> that are supported between the side walls <b>362</b> at a throat section. Each restrictor member defines a surface <b>370</b><i>a </i>biased toward the upper conveyor run. The surfaces of each row of restrictors are disposed adjacent each other proceeding laterally across the station. The surfaces are aligned normal to the travel path. When the surfaces <b>246</b> of each row are horizontally aligned and adjacent the belt, they collectively provide a virtually continuous obstruction to breading material that would otherwise pass unobstructed through the station <b>206</b> above the level of the belt. The surfaces are biased toward the conveyor by the weight of each member.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The surfaces <b>370</b><i>a </i>mound the breading material just upstream from the station <b>206</b> to create the standing wave of the material. When sufficient breading material has mounded upstream from a restrictor member <b>370</b>, the breading material pressure exerted on the member raises the member from the conveyor and breading material passes under the member from the breading station. The amount of breading material passing under any member depends on the conveyor speed, the breading material consistency, and the member weight and position. The conveyor speed is relatively constant so an equilibrium state typically is reached where a relatively constant amount of breading material flows under a given restrictor member.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When a food item moves into the station, those restrictor member surfaces that engage the item shift upwardly and move in conformity with the food item profile as it passes the raised restrictor member. The restrictors thus operate to tamp the passing food item without interfering with food item movement. At the same time the restrictor members that pass over a food item at the breading station obstruct nearly all but a surface coating of breading material from passing through the station <b>206</b> on the food item. Restrictor members that do not engage the food item remain in their initial, equilibrium positions adjacent the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition to their individual tamping and breading flow restricting functions, the restrictor members collectively act to compress the breading material against the food products at the application station. Because of the fluidic nature of the breading material moving along the conveyor, the restrictor members pressurize the breading material as it is moved into the throat section and, in effect, pack the breading against the food item even at locations along the lateral sides of the products where a restrictor member is not tamping the item.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the illustrated machine <b>10</b> the restrictor members of each row of restrictors are pivoted about a respective common axis extending between the side walls. In the illustrated machine, pivot shafts <b>376</b> are detachably carried in respective sidewall notches and each pivot shaft extends through a conforming hole in each restrictor member of the row. As the restrictor members engage the food products, the surfaces ride over the products as the restrictor members pivot about the axis of the pivot shafts at their remote ends. An additional notch is provided so that the angularity between the restrictor members and the conveyor can be adjusted by repositioning the pivot shafts between alternative notches. This changes the restrictor member biasing forces and alters the breading material pressure at the breading station.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The panel <b>219</b> extends under the upper conveyor run at the breading station <b>206</b>. When the food products emerge from the breading station, most of the breading material that moves along with the food products is no longer supported by the panel <b>219</b> and drops through the conveyor belt to the bottom of the reservoir <b>200</b>. Some breading emerging from the breading station may cling to the conveyor belt wires. Further, when the breading material is dampened from batter, clumps of the material tend to bridge the wire mesh forming the belt and may not automatically fall into the reservoir. In the illustrated breading unit, spring leaves <b>380</b> are resiliently biased against the belt and repeatedly strike the belt as it moves. The repetitive spring leaf impacts on the belt <b>310</b> vibrate the belt and dislodge breading material from the it. The spring leaves are supported and tensioned by pins <b>382</b> that project from the side walls. The spring leaves are removable from the unit by sliding them off of the pins.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, each of the two springs <b>380</b> has a loop <b>384</b> at one end which slips over the pin <b>382</b>. At an opposite end, the spring defines a sharp bend <b>386</b> which fits down between the links of the belt <b>310</b>. Between the loop <b>384</b> and the bend <b>386</b> the spring is stressed means of engagement with a post <b>385</b> which extends inwardly toward the top run of the conveyor belt <b>310</b> from a sidewall <b>211</b>. As the sharp bend rides up and over a link in the belt it is stressed even further. As the bend <b>386</b> passes over a link, it snaps back to a position between lines and strikes an upper surface of the wall <b>219</b>. This causes breading trapped between links to vibrate and separate from the belt <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The vibration and disloging of breading in prior art systems created noise. The disclosed system muffles the noise generated through use of an overmolded layer <b>388</b>, <b>390</b> of elastomeric material that covers an outer surface of the pin <b>382</b> and the post <b>385</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the layers <b>388</b>, <b>390</b> are a thermoplastic rubber material.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Experience with the prior art machine disclosed in the '170 patent indicates that the length L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the upper wall <b>219</b> plays a part in correct operation of the machine and more particularly can affect the manner breading is applied to the food product. To some extent proper operation is a trial and error process wherein different lengths are chosen. As illustrated in the Figures the wall <b>219</b> has a generally smooth flat surface over which the belt <b>310</b> extends during breading operations. The wall <b>219</b> has side flanges <b>219</b><i>a </i>that extend downwardly. Each of the flanges <b>219</b><i>a </i>has threaded studs <b>392</b> that project outwardly away from the wall <b>219</b> and can be passed through appropriately spaced openings in the side walls <b>211</b> of the reservoir <b>200</b>. Once the studs pass through the side walls, threaded connectors <b>394</b> are threaded onto the studs to hold the wall <b>219</b> in place. This construction allows for simple removal of the wall <b>219</b> and replacement with a shorter or longer upper wall depending on breading performance. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one exemplary wall <b>219</b> extends from a position beneath the plow <b>350</b> to a position just past (in the direction of breading movement) the post <b>385</b> which stresses the leaf spring vibrator <b>380</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in this arrangement, the top surface extends on either side of the connectors <b>394</b> to downwardly extending lips or flanges <b>396</b>, <b>398</b>. Substitution of other walls is achieved by removing the connectors, which allow the reservoir to be disassembled.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Experience with the breading function indicating that in the region of the gap between the flange <b>396</b> and the plow <b>350</b>, a shorter gap between the reservoir end wall and the flange <b>396</b> creates more pressure build up and may pump too much breading material onto the upper wall. By increasing the gap width of the opening O there is less restriction, less pressure build up and according less flow. At the other end of the wall or pan <b>219</b> by shorting the length the pan extends away from the breading station or zone <b>206</b> the dwell time of the contact between breading material and the food product is decreased. Thus, if the coating of breading is deemed too thick, one solution would be to shorten the length L and thereby decrease the time period the product is in contact with the breading material. This shortening could be made even more dramatic by removing a row <b>372</b> of the flow restrictor members <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Breaded food products sometimes tend to carry loose, excess breading on them after they have emerged from the breading station. The machine <b>10</b> is so constructed and arranged that the excess breading is removed from the products and recycled. After the breaded food products emerge from the breading station <b>206</b> they pass the drive shaft assembly and drop from the upper run to the lower run. Any remaining loose breading on the food products is shed as a result of the impact with the lower run belt. The loose breading falls through the belt and into the reservoir base section <b>212</b>. The recycling run belt sweeps the accumulated breading from the base section <b>212</b> upwardly along the sloping section <b>216</b> from which it is conveyed through the breading station again.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The food products remaining on the lower run are discharged from the machine over the open end of the reservoir base section <b>212</b> as the food products pass the guide shaft. The illustrated machine <b>10</b> is constructed so that a frying basket may be positioned below the machine discharge end <b>110</b> for accumulating food products for frying. The basket and its contents can be placed directly into the fryer when a sufficient number of products has been accumulated. The small foot print and the machine architecture that permits loading and discharging food from the machine end <b>110</b> makes it possible and desirable to station the machine <b>10</b> adjacent the fryers. This feature provides for enhanced convenience and efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When frangible food products are breaded, they are discharged from the upper conveyor run directly into a fryer basket or other suitable container (not illustrated), or into the hands of a machine attendant. Food products, such as croquettes or other products that could break up on impact with the lower run, are accessible at the end of the upper conveyor run through the open end of the reservoir. A receiving container may be supported between the reservoir sidewalls <b>211</b> just beyond and below the shaft assembly and above the lower run. The frangible products are deposited gently into the container without damage.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to the present invention emptying the reservoir of breading material is accomplished quickly and easily by use of the breading discharge mechanism without requiring lifting and manually dumping the reservoir and without the need for partially disassembling the breading machine conveyor drive system. The breading discharge mechanism that is constructed and arranged so that the breading material can be discharged from the machine into a receptacle without requiring the machine to be moved from its normal position. Additional details of discharge of breading materials from the reservoir are disclosed in the '170 patent to Whited et al.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">While a single embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described in considerable detail, the invention is not to be considered limited to the precise construction disclosed. Various adaptations, modifications, and uses of the invention may occur to those skilled in the business to which the invention relates. The intention is to cover all such adaptations, modifications, and uses coming within the spirit or scope of the appended claims.</p>
