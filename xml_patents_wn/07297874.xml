<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to fixtures for fitting long members such as grommets and wire harness to stationary portions such as hinges and panels.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a vehicle, for example, a number of wires such as cables and wire harness and a number of long members such as grommets for protecting the wires passed through the grommets are provided in a prescribed arrangement. In the case of some long member, a relatively soft plastic clip, or a band clip, for example, is fitted to a desired part of the long member in order to avoid its contacting and interfering with another member and by attaching the clip to a vehicle body, the arranged condition (routing) of the long member is decided.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More specifically, in case that a long member is a substantially circular wire harness, the band portion of a clamping band clip is wound on the desired part of the wire harness and the band clip is joined (attached) to the panel of the vehicle body, whereby the wire harness is latched so as to decide the route of the wire harness. When the route of the wire harness is thus decided, the wire harness is allowed to avoid contacting another member, for example, and when such another member is installed later, such another member as another long member or equipment can readily be installed and prevented from becoming entangled with still another member.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Incidentally, a clip, or a band clip, for example, is used as a fixture for holding the long member above and often formed of relatively soft plastics. However, there is a demand for fixtures capable of holding long members more firmly than hand clips, whereupon the present applicant for patent has proposed a fixture <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the fixture <b>60</b> includes two divided bodies <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> whose end portions on one side are coupled together by a coupling hinge <b>61</b> and end portions on the other are detachably joined, a fitting portion <b>64</b> installed so as to surround the outer periphery of a long member and a mounting portion <b>68</b> including a pair of clamping parts <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> for clamping the opposed sides (faces) of a panel or a hinge such as a flat plate like hinge <b>65</b> rectangular in cross section, the fixture <b>60</b>, being molded from comparatively high-quality synthetic resin. This fixture <b>60</b> is fit for use in holding a grommet for protecting wire harness provided in a prescribed arrangement between the panel of a vehicle body and a movable panel, for example, because the hinge <b>65</b> can firmly be fitted to the fixture <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, among electric wires such as wire harness, some wire is used for wiring a section between the panel of the vehicle body and the movable panel such as a door or a trunk panel and these electric wires like wire harness, for example, are protected with grommets that are long members made of elastic material such as rubber. Consequently, it has been proposed to form a grommet of the sort mentioned above into a bellows so that when the movable panel is closed, the grommet in a curved condition can be housed in a grommet housing portion and to attach the fixture <b>60</b> to a desired part of the grommet such that the grommet can be housed in the grommet housing portion without being sandwiched between the panel of the vehicle body and the movable panel when the movable panel is closed and that the fixture <b>60</b> is fitted to the flat platelike hinge <b>65</b> rectangular in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Though the fixture <b>60</b> proposed above can firmly be fitted to the hinge <b>65</b>, it is not necessarily easy to attach the fixture <b>60</b> to the hinge <b>65</b>, that is, the fitting workability is poor. The mounting portion <b>68</b> of the fixture <b>60</b> is, to put it concretely, formed so that its length is set substantially equal to the width of the hinge <b>65</b> and has a flat platelike contact portion <b>69</b> making face-to-face contact with one side of the hinge <b>65</b> and a pair of clamping parts <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> provided along the direction in which the clamping parts <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> cross the contact portion <b>69</b> at substantially right angles on the respective end portions of the contact portion <b>69</b>. The pair of clamping parts <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> are respectively folded back toward the contact portion <b>69</b> at substantially right angles from positions separated by a length substantially equal to the thickness of the hinge <b>65</b> so as to form U-shapes in cross section including both the front end portions of the contact portion <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to fit the mounting portion <b>68</b> to the hinge <b>65</b>, part of the one side of the hinge <b>65</b> is made to contact the inner side of one clamping part <b>66</b> and then the other clamping part <b>67</b> is pressed against the other side of the hinge <b>65</b> so that the other side of the hinge <b>65</b> is introduced into the other clamping part <b>67</b> because the other clamping part <b>67</b> is flexible. At the same time, the one clamping part <b>66</b> is moved such that the one side of the hinge <b>65</b> slides on the face of the one clamping part <b>66</b> and the inner face of the one clamping part <b>66</b> makes face-to-ace contact with the one edge face of the hinge <b>65</b>, whereby the fixture <b>60</b> can be fitted to the hinge <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, assuming that the one clamping part <b>66</b> is fixedly held when the other side of the hinge <b>65</b> is pressed (pushed) in the other clamping part <b>67</b> from a condition in which part of the one side of the hinge <b>65</b> is caused to contact the inner side of the one clamping part <b>66</b>, the one side edge of the hinge <b>65</b> in contact with the inner face of the one clamping part <b>66</b> slides along the inner face of the one clamping part <b>66</b>. In case that the hinge <b>65</b> is made of metal and a sharp edge is formed on the one side of the hinge <b>65</b>, the edge expected to slide on the inner face of the one clamping part <b>66</b> may cut into the inner face of the clamping part <b>66</b> and the hinge <b>65</b> may also be hardly pressed in between the clamping parts <b>66</b> and <b>67</b>, so that the fitting of the fixture <b>60</b> may not simply be carried out.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fixture that can readily be fitted to a long member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a fixture, comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">a fitting portion, fitting a long member; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">a mounting portion, mounting a stationary portion which is shaped into a rectangular in cross section, and the mounting portion including:
        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0013">a base portion; and</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0014">a first clamping portion and a second clamping portion, extending in a first direction substantially perpendicular to an extending direction of the base portion from both ends of the base portion, and clamping the stationary portion therebetween, and the clamping portions respectively having slip-out preventive portions,</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">wherein a projected portion is provided on an inner face of the first clamping portion; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">wherein the second clamping portion is flexibly formed.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">In the above configuration, the stationary portion has a first face, a second face and a third face which are adjacent to the first face, and a fourth face which is opposite to the first face, and when the inner face of the first clamping portion is brought into contact with one of the second and third faces of the stationary portion and when the second clamping portion is pressed against the other face out of the second and third faces by making the second clamping portion contact with the stationary portion (edge of the other face out of the second and third faces), the edge of the stationary portion never or hardly cuts into the inner face of the first clamping portion as the projected portion is provided on the inner face of the first clamping portion. Consequently, the second clamping portion can readily be forced onto the other face of the stationary portion, so that the fixture is readily installed likewise.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">Preferably, the length of the projected portion is so dimensioned that only the projected portion makes contact with the edge-to-edge face of the stationary portion when the mounting portion is fitted to the stationary portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019">In the above configuration, as edge of the stationary portion never cuts into the inner face of the first clamping part, it is ensured that the second clamping part can readily be forced onto the other face of the stationary portion, so that the fixture is readily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">Preferably, the slip-out preventive portion of the second clamping portion has a tilted portion which tilts toward the first clamping portion so as to decrease a thickness thereof in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">In the above configuration, when the inner face of the first clamping portion is brought into contact with one of the second and third faces of the stationary portion and when the second clamping portion is pressed against the other face out of the second and third faces by making the second clamping portion contact with the stationary portion (edge of the other face out of the second and third faces), the second clamping part is easy to bend as the second clamping portion is formed with the contact portion and the tilted portion tilted toward the opposite side to the first clamping portion with respect to the contact portion and consequently the second clamping part can readily be forced onto the other face of the stationary portion, so that the fixture is readily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">According to the present invention, there is also provided a fixture, comprising:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0023">a cylindrical fitting portion, fitting a long member; and</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0024">a mounting portion, mounting a stationary portion which is shaped into a rectangular in cross section, and the mounting portion including:
        <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0025">a base portion; and</li>
            <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0026">a first clamping portion and a second clamping portion, extending in a first direction substantially perpendicular to an extending direction of the base portion from both ends of the base portion, and clamping the stationary portion therebetween, and the clamping portions respectively having slip-out preventive portions,</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0027">wherein the fitting portion is formed by a first divided body and a second divided body, each has a retaining portion;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0028">wherein the retaining portions are protruded from an outer face of the cylindrical fitting portion when the first and second divided bodies are engaged by the retaining portions; and</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0029">wherein the engaged retaining portions are positioned on the fitting portion so as to serve a point of applying power when mounting the fixture to the stationary portion by using a principle of leverage.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0030">In the above configuration, when the inner face of the first clamping portion is brought into contact with one of the second and third faces of the stationary portion and when the second clamping portion is pressed against the other face out of the second and third faces by making the second clamping portion contact with the stationary portion (edge of the other face out of the second and third faces), the joint of the divided bodies functions as a swivel stopper as the position of gripping the divided bodies conforms to the mating position and consequently the second clamping portion can readily be forced onto the other face of the stationary portion, so that the fixture is readily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0031">Preferably, the retaining portions are extended in an axial direction of the cylindrical fitting portion from one edge to the other edge thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0032">Accordingly, it is ensured that the divided bodies can be joined together and that the second clamping portion can readily be forced onto the other face of the stationary portion since the retaining portions of the divided bodies serves as a swivel stopper, so that the fixture is readily installed.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0090">In order to fit the grommet <b>2</b> to the hinge <b>3</b> by using the fixture <b>1</b>, the first and second divided bodies <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are released from being joined and opened up first. Then the fixture mounting portion <b>15</b> of the grommet <b>6</b> is covered with the first and second divided bodies <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> so as to cover the peripheral face of the grommet <b>6</b> and by joining the mating recess portion <b>23</b> and the mating protruded portion <b>24</b> together, the fixture <b>1</b> is fitted to the grommet <b>2</b>. At this time, a swivel stopper may be provided for the fixture <b>1</b> and the fixture mounting portion <b>15</b> to stop them from swiveling in the peripheral direction. More specifically, the fixture mounting portion <b>15</b> may be provided with a mating projection and moreover one of the first and second divided bodies of the fixture <b>1</b> may be provided with a portion mating with the mating projection, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0091">The first clamping part <b>32</b> of the fixture <b>1</b> fitted to the grommet <b>2</b> is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>. In other words, the inner face of the first clamping part <b>32</b> is brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> such that the first clamping part <b>32</b> is hooked on the hinge <b>3</b>. At this time, the projected portion <b>41</b> of the inner face of the first clamping part <b>32</b> is brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> of the hinge <b>3</b> and at the same time the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>with respect to the first face <b>3</b><i>a </i>is brought into contact with or adjacent to the depressed portion <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0092">The second clamping part <b>33</b> is brought into contact with the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>. More specifically, the tilted face <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the slip-out preventive portion <b>45</b> of the second clamping part <b>33</b> is brought into contact with the edge of the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>with respect to the first face <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>from the condition above. Then the second clamping part <b>33</b> (tilted face <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the second slip-out preventive portion <b>45</b>) is pressed against the hinge <b>3</b> so as to bend in the direction of being alienated from the contact portion <b>31</b>. When the front end portion of the second clamping part <b>33</b> is caused to curve to an extent greater than the protruded length of the second slip-out preventive portion <b>45</b>, the second slip-out preventive portion <b>45</b> of the second clamping part <b>33</b> moves while sliding on the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>and then the contact portion <b>44</b> of the second clamping part <b>33</b> is brought into face-to-face contact with the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> and moreover the face of the second slip-out preventive portion <b>45</b> on the side of the contact portion <b>31</b> is brought into face-to-face contact with a fourth face <b>3</b><i>d</i>. Simultaneously with or substantially simultaneously with the contact action above comes the face-to-face contact of the first face <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> with the planar portion <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Further, the projected portion <b>42</b> of the first slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> is brought into contact with the fourth face <b>3</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0093">Thus the fixture <b>1</b> can be fitted to the hinge <b>3</b> and the grommet <b>2</b> can also be fitted to the hinge <b>3</b>. At this time, the fixture <b>1</b> is prevented by the planar portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the contact portion <b>31</b>, the projected portion <b>42</b> of the first slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> and the second slip-out preventive portion <b>45</b> from moving in the thickness direction of the hinge <b>3</b>. At the same time, the fixture <b>1</b> is also prevented by the projected portion <b>41</b> of the first clamping part <b>32</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> of the second clamping part <b>33</b> from moving in the thickness direction of the hinge <b>3</b>, whereby the grommet <b>2</b> can be fitted to the hinge <b>3</b> via the fixture <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0094">When the second clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>, the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> with respect to the fourth face <b>3</b><i>d </i>never or hardly cuts into the inner face of the first clamping part <b>32</b> since the projected portion <b>41</b> of the first clamping part <b>32</b> is kept in contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>. In other words, the hinge <b>3</b> disposed between the panel of the vehicle body and the movable panel is formed of metal, for example, iron and often made sharp. In this case, the first clamping part <b>32</b> moves in the direction of the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>with respect to the fourth face <b>3</b><i>d </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> when the second clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>. Consequently, in case that the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>with respect to the fourth face <b>3</b><i>d </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> is brought into direct contact with the inner face of the first clamping part <b>32</b> without the formation of the projected portion <b>41</b>, the first clamping part <b>32</b> may cut into that edge. However, as the projected portion <b>41</b> is brought into contact with the second face of the hinge <b>3</b>, the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>with respect to the fourth face <b>3</b><i>d </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> hardly or never cuts into the first clamping part <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0095">In particular, as the length A of the projected portion <b>41</b> allows the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>positioned on the side of the first slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> to be so dimensioned as not to contact the inner face of the first clamping part <b>32</b>, the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>with respect to the fourth face <b>3</b><i>d </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> never contacts the first clamping part <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0096">Thus the second clamping part <b>33</b> can easily be pressed (forced-in) toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>, so that the fixture <b>1</b> is readily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0097">Moreover, as the formation of the depressed portion <b>40</b> in the planar portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the contact portion <b>31</b> makes it difficult to bring the edge of the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>with respect to the first face <b>3</b><i>a </i>into contact with the planar portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>when the first clamping part <b>32</b> is brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>, whereby the first clamping part <b>32</b> can easily be brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0098">Since the second clamping part <b>33</b> is formed with the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> and connected integrally to the first coupling portion <b>36</b>, the second clamping part <b>33</b> is easy to bend when the second clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>, so that the fixture <b>1</b> is readily installed. In other words, when the second clamping part <b>33</b> is directly connected to the planar portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the contact portion <b>31</b>, in case that the second clamping part is formed with only the contact portion <b>44</b> without the tilted portion <b>43</b>, this second clamping part is less flexible than the second clamping part <b>33</b> having the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0099">Since the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> are tilted in the direction of bending the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> (the opposite side (outer face) to the contact portion <b>31</b> is bent at an obtuse angle), the second clamping part <b>33</b> is easy to bend in comparison with what has the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> that are linearly arranged. In the case that the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> are linearly arranged, the whole stress is applied to the connected part of the first coupling portion <b>36</b> when the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> that are bent. However, when the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> are bent at an obtuse angle on the opposite face (outer face) to the contact portion <b>31</b>, the stress applied to the connected part of the first coupling portion <b>35</b> is lowered when the second clamping part <b>33</b> is bent as part of the stress is absorbed by the bent part when the tilted portion <b>43</b> and the contact portion <b>44</b> are bent. Accordingly, nonconformity arising from damage, cracks and so on become hardly produced and durability is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0100">Since the mounting portion <b>17</b> is provided to the first divided body <b>18</b> so that when the second clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>, the mating recess portion <b>23</b> and the mating protruded portion <b>24</b> protruding from the respective divided bodies <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are positioned at the location (to which pressing force is applied) where these recess and protruded portions <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> can be touched by the fingers and the like, so that the fixture <b>1</b> is readily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0101">In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the projected portion <b>41</b> of the first clamping part <b>32</b> is brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the second clamping part <b>32</b> is brought into contact with the edge of the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> with respect to the first face <b>3</b><i>a</i>. When the second clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed toward the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>, the pressing direction is not the direction along the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>but the direction of pivoting the second-clamping part <b>33</b> with the location where the first clamping part <b>32</b> and the first slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> is brought into contact with the hinge <b>3</b> as an axis. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, since the mating recess portion <b>23</b> and the mating protruded portion <b>24</b> are provided in the place where the first divided body <b>18</b> or the second divided body <b>19</b> is pressed down by the fingers, for example, the mating recess portion <b>23</b> and the mating protruded portion <b>24</b> are used as a catching portion, so that the second clamping part <b>33</b> can readily be pressed down. When the clamping part <b>33</b> is pressed down by gripping the first clamping part <b>18</b> or the second clamping part <b>19</b>, moreover, the second clamping part <b>33</b> can readily be pressed down because the mating recess portion <b>23</b> and the mating protruded portion <b>24</b> provided at the gripping location function as skidding stoppers. Consequently, the fixture <b>1</b> is readily installed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0102">Further, the first and second divided bodies <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are joined together over the substantially whole area in their axial direction to ensure that the divided bodies are joined together and at the same time that the third face <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the hinge <b>3</b> can readily be forced (pressed) in the second clamping part <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, as the forms of joining the side end portions and the central portions of the first and second divided bodies <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are different from each other, the first and second divided bodies <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> never shift axially. Accordingly, it is ensured that the first and second divided bodies can be joined together.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0104">The contact portion <b>31</b> is provided with the recess portion <b>40</b> and the inner face of the first clamping part <b>32</b> is formed so that the projected portion <b>41</b> is brought into contact with the second face <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the hinge <b>3</b>. Consequently, the falling (falling of the first slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> toward the contact portion <b>31</b>) of the U-shaped portion formed with the side of the second end portion <b>31</b><i>c </i>of the contact portion <b>31</b>, the first clamping part <b>32</b> and the first slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> can be prevented. In other words, in case that the portion including the second end portion <b>31</b> of the contact portion <b>31</b>, the first clamping part <b>32</b> and the slip-out preventive portion <b>39</b> is formed into the U-shape without the recess portion <b>40</b> and projected portion <b>41</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, the first slip-out- preventive portion <b>39</b> may fall toward the contact portion <b>31</b>. However, since the provision of the recess portion <b>40</b> and the projected portion <b>41</b> results in reducing the thickness of the contact portion <b>31</b> having the recess portion <b>40</b> and that of the first clamping part <b>32</b> excluding the projected portion <b>41</b>, cooling after molding is facilitated and particularly the corner portions is cooled first as the corner portions are thinner, whereby the falling mentioned above hardly occurs. Thus the fixture <b>1</b> with the regular dimensions secured can be molded.</p>
