<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a semiconductor device having a dual stress liner for improving electron mobility, the dual stress liner includes a first liner portion formed on a PMOSFET and a second liner portion formed on an NMOSFET. The first liner portion has a first compressive stress, and the second liner portion has a second compressive stress smaller than the first compressive stress. The dual stress liner may be formed by forming a stress liner on a semiconductor substrate on which the PMOSFET and the NMOSFET are formed and selectively exposing a portion of the stress liner on the NMOSFET.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a dual stress liner, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device and a light exposure apparatus for forming the dual stress liner. More particularly, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a dual stress liner for increasing electron mobility, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device, and a light exposure apparatus for forming the dual stress liner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A semiconductor device including a PMOSFET (p-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) and an NMOSFET (n-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) may be manufactured by repeatedly performing unit manufacturing processes, such as a film formation, an etching, an ion implantation, or the like, on a semiconductor substrate such as a silicon wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electron mobility may be decreased by the compressive stress applied to the semiconductor substrate while repeatedly performing the unit manufacturing processes. In detail, the compressive stress occurs in channel regions of the MOSFETs due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients of materials constituting the semiconductor device and the actual or genuine stress existing in the materials. Thus, the electron mobility and saturation drain current (I<sub>dsat</sub>) are decreased in the NMOSFET, which uses electrons as its carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, according to U.S. patent application Publication Ser. No. 2003/0040158, in a semiconductor device including an n-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET, a first silicon nitride layer having tensile stress is formed on the n-channel MOSFET, and a second silicon nitride layer having compressive stress is formed on the p-channel MOSFET. Thus, electron mobility and saturation drain current of the n-channel MOSFET are increased, and bending or warping of a substrate is reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “on” another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first thin film could be termed a second thin film, and, similarly, a second thin film could be termed a first thin film without departing from the teachings of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising,” or “includes” and/or “including” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, relative terms, such as “lower” or “bottom” and “upper” or “top,” may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the “lower” side of other elements would then be oriented on “upper” sides of the other elements. The exemplary term “lower”, can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of “lower” and “upper,” depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements would then be oriented “above” the other elements. The exemplary terms “below” or “beneath” can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device having a dual stress liner in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a semiconductor device includes a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, such as a p-type single crystal silicon wafer, and a PMOSFET <b>200</b> and an NMOSFET <b>300</b> formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> has active regions defined by a device isolation layer <b>102</b>, and the PMOSFET <b>200</b> and the NMOSFET <b>300</b> are formed on the active regions. An n-type well is formed in the active region for the PMOSFET <b>200</b>, and a p-type well is formed in the active region for the NMOSFET <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The PMOSFET <b>200</b> may include a first gate insulating layer <b>202</b>, a first gate electrode <b>204</b>, p-type impurity regions <b>206</b> to be used as source/drain regions and a first channel region <b>208</b> underneath the first gate insulating layer <b>202</b>. The NMOSFET <b>300</b> may include a second gate insulating layer <b>302</b>, a second gate electrode <b>304</b>, n-type impurity regions <b>306</b> to be used as source/drain regions and a second channel region <b>308</b> underneath the second gate insulating layer <b>302</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Structures of the above-described MOSFETs <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> may be variably changed or modified, and thus the spirit and scope of the present invention are not limited by the structures of the MOSFETs <b>200</b> and <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A dual stress liner <b>400</b> having a first stress and a second stress is formed on the PMOSFET <b>200</b> and the NMOSFET <b>300</b>. The dual stress liner <b>400</b> is formed to increase electron mobility of the NMOSFET <b>300</b> and improve stability of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In detail, the dual stress liner <b>400</b> may include a first liner portion <b>410</b> having a first compressive stress and a second liner portion <b>420</b> having a second compressive stress smaller than the first compressive stress. The first liner portion <b>410</b> is formed on the PMOSFET <b>200</b>, and the second liner portion <b>420</b> is formed on the NMOSFET <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electron mobility of the NMOSFET <b>300</b> may be increased by the second liner portion <b>420</b>. Particularly, the second liner portion <b>420</b> has the second compressive stress small enough to relax compressive stress applied to the second channel region <b>308</b> of the NMOSFET <b>300</b>. Thus, the electron mobility, saturation drain current and current driving capability of the NMOSFET <b>300</b> may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Indeed, a plurality of PMOSFETs and a plurality of NMOSFETs are formed on the substrate <b>100</b>, and a plurality of first liner portions and a plurality of second liner portions are successively formed on the PMOSFETs and the NMOSFETs. Thus, bending and/or warping of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> may be reduced, and thus the stability of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The dual stress liner <b>400</b> may include silicon nitride, and may be formed by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process and a selective ultraviolet light exposure process. Particularly, the dual stress liner <b>400</b> may be formed by forming a silicon nitride layer on the PMOSFET <b>200</b> and the NMOSFET <b>300</b> using the PECVD process and selectively exposing a portion of the silicon nitride layer on the NMOSFET <b>300</b> to ultraviolet light. In the PECVD process, hydrogen (H) is introduced in the silicon nitride layer, and as a result, actual compressive stress is generated in the silicon nitride layer. The compressive stress of the silicon nitride layer may be relaxed through the selective ultraviolet light exposure process.</p>
