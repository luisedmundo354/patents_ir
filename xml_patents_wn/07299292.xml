<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention provides a process for encrypting a data stream to secure the data stream for single viewing and to protect copyrights of the data stream. Specifically, the invention provides a process for protecting streaming multimedia, entertainment, and communications in a network transmission. The invention further provides a virtual smart card within a client system that interacts with a streaming server component to effect the inventive process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Internet has provided another means for communication whereby data can be streamed from a server to a client. The client is responsible for displaying the streamed data, preferably streamed media, to a user. The server is responsible for delivering the data stream to the client. The Real Networks and Microsoft solutions send the data stream via a UDP (a connectionless Internet protocol) along with another connection between the client and the server that controls the transmission of the streamed data. The control connection element functions to stop buffer overruns and can adjust the transmission of the stream to compensate for bandwidth latencies. One problem with this arrangement, however, is that the data that are streamed to the client from the server are unprotected and available to anyone on the network. Therefore, there is a need in the art to better protect from interception across a wide area network, such as the Internet. Specifically, the need relates to providing an ability to protect the improper interception and ability to copy streaming data across the Internet. At present, there is no protection mechanism in place to protect copyrighted data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the data has been released by the server and either received by the user or intercepted before being received by the user, there is no way to restrict the re-transmission of such data once it has been released over a network. Even if the data stream has been copyrighted, there is no means to protect or enforce copyright protection of streamed data. The entity owning the copyright and streaming such content realize that there is no control over what is done with such content after it is released. Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide a means for protecting copyrights in content once streamed over a network. The present invention was designed to address both needs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, no streaming media solution actually encrypts the data that is being sent from the server to the client. One solution can accomplish this with existing technology, such as by merging SSL secure HTTP sockets with a streaming software package, such as Quicktime. Unfortunately, Quicktime does not have a full screen view option. Therefore, there is a need in the art to develop a better method for streaming video data.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention provides a process to encrypt a data stream, such as multimedia entertainment and communications, via a network, such as the Internet, and the like. The encrypted data stream will allow for copyrighted materials and multimedia communications (e.g., analyst meetings, interactive television, movies) on a secure, pay-per-view basis, and the like. The data stream cannot be stored on a client machine for future play-back, or retransmitted. A client, however, can view a data stream as many times as desired within a specified time frame.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An encryption protocol provides, for example, an encryption algorithm of a 192-bit key (e.g., Triple DES), a UDP packet protocol, a RTSP (rfc 2326) packet transmission protocol, an RTP (rfc 1889) packet transmission control protocol, and MPEGI video storage compression. However, the foregoing example of a preferred encryption protocol will change as such techniques improve with time. For example, one embodiment may employ the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), or similar encryption algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One advantage of the inventive process, using the inventive streaming server and transaction server, is that the client does not really need to possess fully optimized equipment. One client typically runs on any one machine at any one time. The client may be configured to playback, for example, 30 fps 320×240 video and audio back with no jitter. This enables a data stream of about 250-300 kpa, a large data buffer (of at least several megabytes), and a 350 MHz Pentium II processor or greater running Windows 98 or Windows NT. However, the client system is not so constrained, and virtually any client system configuration may be employed. For example, the client system may include a set top box, an interactive television capability, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The server, for example, can be a fully optimized, multi-threaded (thread pool) Windows NT service. Unlike an HTTP server, this allows sessions with clients to be cached and the server will need to maintain state in respects to all clients.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following terms are used with the meanings defined herein. Client or client system includes the computer that the data stream is being sent to. User includes the person executing instructions on the client.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Module includes a collection of compiled code designed to perform a specific function, or set of functions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">URI (universal resource identifier) represents an identifier associated with a location on the server of the stream.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Token includes a binary piece of information that includes the permissions the user has for a specific data stream.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Authentication includes providing a level of confidence that a component, device, person, or other entity is who/what it claims to be. In some situations, authentication may sometimes be treated as synonymous with identity.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Authorization includes providing a level of access control, and is directed towards answering the question of what actions an entity may be entitled to perform. For example, authorization may address the question of whether the entity has permission to access selected data, when, and for how long.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">CAS (Conditional Access System). CAS includes technologies directed towards controlling access to such as digital television services, and the like, by encrypting a transmitted programming. However, CAS is not directed solely to television. It may include digital radio broadcasts, digital data broadcasts, non-broadcast information, interactive services, and the like. Thus, CAS may include streaming data access, such as is described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Rapid Renewal includes providing key generation, new keys, and new security mechanisms to a client device, system, and the like. In one embodiment, dynamic rapid renewal provides the renewed security mechanism on a random basis to create an unpredictable environment and target for others, such as hackers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">DRM (Digital Rights Management) includes a file based alternative mechanism to protection of media. DRM includes, for example, protection of content itself, such as streaming data. In one embodiment, a license file, or the like, may be issued to enable a user to play the content, either together with the content or when a user tries to play the content. The content, such as the streaming data, may be encrypted and the encryption properties may persist as the content travels between networks, servers, and a client. DRM as described herein may employ a virtual smart card to enable management and protection of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">ECM (Entitlement Control Messages) includes encrypted data associated with entitlements, such as tokens, access constraints, content/encryption keys, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">EMM (Entitlement Management Messages) includes encrypted data such as entitlements, such as tokens, content/encryption keys, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Intrusion Detection includes those mechanisms for detecting situations, which may violate a security policy and other protections.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Non-Repudiation includes mechanisms directed towards ensuring that a user, consumer, client, and the like, are unable to deny a validity of their digital signature. One embodiment employs two distinct keys. One key may be escrowed, and may be used for non-signing actions. The second key, may be without a recovery mechanism, and may be utilized for signing. In this embodiment, where the user may be in sole control of the signing key, non-repudiation may be achieved by use of a solely owned, yet verifiable secret. Where signing validity may be critical, a separate key may be used, and that key may be the solely owned yet verifiable secret of the key holder. In another embodiment, the key holder may refuse the validity of the signature based on the ability of a sufficiently privileged entity to replicate the secret key.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a one embodiment of the inventive process and streaming server, the video may be stored unencrypted on the server machines; the files will only be retrievable through the server software. The inventive server will be responsible for (1) negotiating a set of encryption keys; and (2) encrypting the data stream “on the fly” thereby making the data packets that are actually going over the network useless to any computer other than the intended machine. One encryption standard is TRIPLE-DES with a 168-bit key. The server will use UDP for transmission of the data. This protocol uses considerably less network resources than other TCP protocols (http for example).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Client software will be responsible for decrypting the data stream and playback. The encryption keys used may be different every time the data stream is accessed. Every time the client is executed, a different encryption key is created so the client cannot play back earlier data streams if they were somehow saved to disk.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Illustrative Environment</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this shows a schematic of one embodiment of the client component of the inventive process and streaming server enabled to receive and view and/or otherwise access an encrypted data stream. The client keeps a list of all current data streams and the corresponding tokens. This information is stored on the token storage module <b>100</b>. This list will include the following three items: (1) the URI, (2) the token for that URI, and (3) the expiration date given by the server. In one embodiment, it may not be desirable for the client to have any way of determining if the token is valid or not. Because of this, and the need to remove out of date tokens, the server returns the expiration date. This information is used by the client to display information. The expiration date itself might never be sent back to the server, and the server verifies that the token passed is valid. Examples of module devices that can be used as token storage modules include, for example, Random Access Memory, secondary storage (hard disk), and embedded with software providing for token storage inventory and tracking of expiration dates.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The client communicates with a user interface <b>110</b>. The client may have a standard user interface that will give the appropriate user experience. The interface will have the ability to look through current valid streams or to connect to the server to search for other streams that could be viewed. The client user interface <b>110</b> communicates with a local display control module <b>130</b> and a stream control protocol module <b>120</b>. The client has to be able to setup a communications session with the server as well as control the flow of data from the server once the stream is being viewed. The stream control protocol module <b>120</b> creates the initial connection by connecting to the server, passing the requested URI, Token, and user information. The stream control protocol module <b>120</b> then negotiates a set of encryption keys and controls the flow of data from the server. Examples of stream control protocol module devices <b>120</b> within a client component that can be used to negotiate a set of encryption keys and control the flow of data from a server include, for example, Random Access Memory and the network interface card or modem. The software may monitor the rate of the data being received by sending network statistics, information associated with the buffer, including percent full, percent remaining, and the like, as well as other client characteristics to the streaming server. The display control module <b>130</b> controls the display of the data, and has the ability to pause, stop, or re-start the data stream. Examples of display control modules suitable for use within the client component include, Random Access Memory and the video card. The software running in this module will convert the data being sent form the server into a format that can be displayed to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The display module <b>140</b> displays video and audio data. The input buffer module <b>150</b> is a module that includes the stream buffer. The stream buffer may include a circular buffer of decrypted data that the display control module reads from and the decryption module writes to. Examples of stream buffer module devices that can be used to include a circular buffer of decrypted data include, for example, Random Access Memory. As packets are being received from the server, before the data is put into the input buffer, the data within the transport packet is decrypted by a decryption module <b>160</b> using the keys negotiated by the stream control protocol module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Decryption module <b>160</b> may be implemented using virtually any decryption mechanisms, including those that may be commercially. For example, SSL, DES, and RSA modules may be available and suitable for use as a decryption module. Lastly on the client component sides is a data stream receive module <b>170</b>. This module handles the reception of the data packets sent by the server.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Appropriate module devices that can be used as a data stream receive module within the client component includes, for example, Random Access Memory. The software included in this module may save the data being received by the client in a format that can be used by subsequent modules.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the client control connection module <b>200</b> will handle control communications between the client and the server. The client and server will negotiate a set of encryption keys. The client will send user information, the URI, and the token to the streaming server via the client control connection module <b>200</b>. From this module <b>200</b>, the data that is streamed to the client can be controlled (that is, paused, stopped, or restarted). Hardware devices suitable for use as a client control connection module within the streaming server include Random Access Memory. Such hardware components allow for the execution of hardware non-specific operations. Such software is either embedded in the client control connection module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein the client and server communicate current network conditions and modify the data stream accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The client data connection module <b>210</b> functions to send data packets to the client using a connectionless protocol to reduce server overhead.

The software functions to create a process wherein the encrypted data is sent via network packets to the client machine.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The encryption module <b>220</b> uses the keys negotiated by the client/server to encrypt the data stream as it is being sent to the client. This allows for “on the fly” encryption and the encryption keys will be unique for all client/server connections. This allows the source footage to be stored unencrypted on the server, where appropriate. Hardware devices suitable for use as an encryption module within the streaming server include Random Access Memory and proprietary hardware encryption devices. Such hardware components include software that functions to do the actual encryption of the data. Such software may either be embedded in the encryption module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein the data being sent to the device is encrypted with the keys originally negotiated with the client and the output data is of a format that can only be read after being decrypted by the client.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The flow control module <b>230</b> makes sure that the data stream is being sent by the server at the rate in which the client is using the data. The buffer at the client needs to be full at all times but streaming data must also not be overwritten. Thus, the flow control module communicates with both the encryption module <b>220</b> and uses feedback obtained from the client control connection module <b>200</b>. Hardware devices suitable for use as a flow control module within the streaming server include Random Access Memory. Such software may be either embedded in the flow control module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein the flow of data from the server to the client is regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The file system read buffer <b>240</b> is for server performance. Small amounts of data read in from the file may be stored in memory instead of having a constant open file on the file system. The file system module <b>250</b> is responsible for reading in data from the source footage on the storage medium or elsewhere. The file system module communicates with the client control connection module <b>200</b> to open URIs and the user interface module <b>260</b> to file path configurations. Hardware devices suitable for use as a file system module within the streaming server include Random Access Memory. Such hardware components include software that functions to allow the access to data streams. Such software may be either embedded in the file system module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein the data stored on the secondary storage device can be loaded into Random Access Memory to be delivered to the encryption module.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The streaming server further provides a simple user interface module <b>260</b> for setting server options such as which network port to bind to and the location of source footage. Hardware devices suitable for use as a file system module within the streaming server include Random Access Memory. Such software is either embedded in the file system module or uploaded therein.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transaction server comprises four module components. To access a video stream, the client must first obtain a transaction token. The transaction token may be based on a pay-per-view scheme in which the token will be valid for a certain time period. The time a token is valid for is dependent on what the user selects and what options are available for the selected stream. The user contacts the transaction server, via a client interaction module <b>300</b>, with the user information and the URI. The transaction server will determine what time options are available for the token and present that to the user. After the user selects the required time limit, the request is passed off to the user verification module <b>310</b>. Hardware devices suitable for use as a client interaction module within the transaction server include Random Access Memory. Such software may be either embedded in the client interaction module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein the user information is verified against the database and a valid token is created based, in part, upon the options requested by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The user verification module <b>310</b> checks for user information passed against a user database to see if the user is valid or not. The user database resides in memory of the user verification module. Hardware devices suitable for use as a user verification module within the transaction server include Random Access Memory. Such software is either embedded in the user verification module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein the token passed is verified. The URI creation module <b>320</b> and the token creation module <b>330</b> are tied together and the token is based, in part, upon the requested URI. This means that the token is unique to the request URI and cannot be used for any other stream. This information is then passed back to the client via module <b>300</b>. Hardware devices suitable for use as a URI creation module and token creation module, each located within the transaction server, include Random Access Memory. Such hardware components may include software that functions within the Random Access Memory. Such software may be either embedded in the URI creation module or token creation module or uploaded therein. The software functions to create a process wherein a valid URI to the media stream the user selected are created.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Illustrative Operations</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the client <b>400</b> executes and the client is loaded with a URI and a token <b>410</b>. The client either double clicks on the client's icon (no) or it launched by a media server (yes). If the media server launched the client, there will be a requested URI and token in the command-line parameters of the client. A display a window (<b>420</b>) lists all the purchased (and current) data streams available to view, or otherwise interact with. The user will be able to select a data stream to access by double clicking on the title of the stream. The screen waits for input from the user (<b>430</b>) and the user selects a data stream or another housekeeping option (<b>440</b>). If a housekeeping option was selected, execute user request (<b>450</b>) and go back to displaying video streams with module <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If the user launches a data stream (selects yes from <b>410</b>) a URI and token is saved in the purchased streams list so it can be viewed again at a later time <b>460</b>. A connection to the streaming server is opened and the URI, token and user information is sent to the streaming server <b>470</b>. The streaming server acknowledges a valid (or invalid) URI and token combination <b>480</b>. If the token is invalid or has expired, the server will close the connection and the client will go back and display all the data streams that are available to view. If the server acknowledges a valid URI and token combination, the client will start to receive data from the streaming server and display it <b>490</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the data stream finishes or the user selects any of the available stream options such as pause, stop, play, or restart <b>500</b>, the stream will stop and await further user input. If the stream has finished playing <b>510</b>, the process goes back to the list of available streams <b>420</b>, or continues displaying the data stream <b>490</b> by processing a user request <b>520</b> and then going back to displaying the stream <b>490</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the process run by the streaming server, there is first a connection with the client control module <b>200</b>, <b>600</b> to allow the client to establish a connection with the streaming server. The client will provide the URI, token and user information <b>610</b> from user <b>470</b>. The streaming server determines if the token and URI are valid <b>620</b>. If the token is invalid or has expired, the connection to the client will be closed with an appropriate error message <b>630</b>. If token is valid, a set of unique encryption keys will be negotiated with the client <b>640</b>. A URI will be opened and the streaming data will be read into a buffer <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The client flow control module <b>230</b> provides for the client and streaming server to have a flow control connection established to make sure that the data stream is leaving the streaming server at substantially the same rate it is being used at the client end <b>660</b>. This addresses bandwidth issues as well as making sure that the client play buffer is not overwritten. Therefore, the client flow control mechanism <b>660</b> uses the client flow control module <b>230</b> to obtain feedback from the data buffer in the client <b>710</b> and control the rate of the data stream to keep the client buffer as full as possible. If the client cannot accept any more data at this time, return to flow control module so indicates <b>670</b> to slow down or pause the streaming data. If the client can accept more data <b>680</b>, the client flow control will first determine if there are more data to stream <b>680</b>. If there are no more data to stream, the data stream could be completed, and the client connection will be closed <b>690</b>. If there is more data to be sent, the data waiting in the send buffer will be encrypted <b>700</b> and the encrypted data will be sent to the client <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> at the transaction server, the client first connects to the transaction server, for example through a web page <b>800</b>. In one embodiment, the transaction server will be implemented with ASP scripts. However, the invention is not so limited, and virtually any mechanism may be employed, without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. The client sends request URI and user information through ASP command-line arguments <b>810</b> and the transaction server user verification module <b>310</b> will determine the time limits of available tokens and display them to the user for selection. The transaction server will look up user information <b>820</b> in a database in the user verification module <b>310</b>. Examples of looking up user information are whether or not a user has an account (e.g., an account exists according to the transaction server) <b>830</b>. If the user does not have an account <b>840</b>, a transaction will be opened up to create new account page and get information from the user <b>840</b>. In addition, the transaction server user verification module <b>310</b> will determine if the URI that was requested is free of charge <b>850</b>. If the URI costs money <b>860</b>, the transaction server user verification module <b>310</b> will debit a credit card that is in the user database. This process will create a URI in the URI creation module <b>320</b> of the transaction server.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once a URI is provided and either paid for or provided free, a token will be created <b>870</b> in the token creation module <b>330</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Binding module <b>7020</b> is configured to uniquely identify client device <b>7002</b>, the server system, or the like. In one embodiment this is achieved by employing a fingerprint. A fingerprint may be made up of a number of elements specific to each fingerprint. Such elements are termed herein as ridges. Each ridge includes an element of a fingerprint that provides information to the fingerprint making it unique from other fingerprints. Some examples of ridges include a hardware serial number, operating system version number, Internet Protocol address, physical memory size, and the like. Each ridge included within the fingerprint refines the identity of the system so that it may be uniquely identified within a system. The combinations of all fingerprints may create a handprint or system fingerprint that uniquely identifies a personal computer, server, client device, set top box, or similar device within the system. An order of each of the fingerprint groups and individual ridges may affect the resulting system fingerprint or handprint.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">If the user launches a data stream at decision block <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the process moves to block <b>460</b>, where a URI and token is saved employing token manager <b>7016</b> and token storage module <b>7100</b>. Moving next to block <b>470</b>, communication &amp; flow control module <b>7010</b>, in conjunction with token manager <b>7016</b>, sends the URI, token, and user information to the streaming server.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If, at decision block <b>480</b>, the server acknowledges a valid URI and token combination, processing proceeds to block <b>490</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where data is streamed from the streaming server. Such streaming of data may be received by data stream receive module <b>7170</b> and sent to communication &amp; flow control module <b>7010</b>, where decryption of the received stream may occur through the use of cryptographic modules <b>7060</b>. The decrypted data stream may then be placed into client input buffer <b>7150</b>, at a rate that is directed at maintaining a substantially full client buffer. Communication &amp; flow control module <b>7010</b> provides flow control information during the streaming of the data to ensure the client buffer is substantially full.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The above specification, examples, and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.</p>
