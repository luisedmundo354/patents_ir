<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to instruments for forming an immobilized sample on a porous membrane, and to methods for quantification of a target substance in an immobilized sample using the instrument.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Clinical specimens and excised samples of diseased tissues may contain various types of proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a typical method for detecting specific proteins present in minute quantities in such samples.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The immunoconcentration method is known as a fast and simple ELISA method. This method titrates a specimen on a porous film (membrane) on the surface of which an immobilized antibody has been fixed beforehand to produce an antigen-antibody reaction on the membrane. A detection reagent is titrated onto the membrane to produce a color reaction, and then a wash solution is titrated to clarify the color (for example, see: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Nos. H1-223352 and 2000-329766).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a plurality of items are to be assayed, the preparation of the porous membrane on which an antibody has been previously fixed requires that a number of types of porous membranes or solid-phase plates corresponding to the number of items to be assayed are prepared, thereby reducing assay efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The scope of the present invention is defined solely by the appended claims, and is not affected to any degree by the statements within this summary.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first instrument for forming an immobilized sample on a porous membrane embodying features of the present invention includes: (a) a first plate containing a first connector and a first region provided with a plurality of through-holes; and (b) a second plate containing a second connector configured for engaging the first connector and a second region provided with a plurality of through-holes. A porous membrane is interposed between the first region and the second region by engagement of the first connector and the second connector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A second instrument for forming an immobilized sample on a porous membrane embodying features of the present invention includes: (a) a first plate containing a first region provided with a plurality of through-holes; and (b) a second plate containing a connector configured for engaging the first plate, which contains a second region provided with a plurality of through-holes. A porous membrane is interposed between the first region and the second region by engagement of the connector and the first plate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method for quantifying a target substance in an immobilized sample embodying features of the present invention includes: (a) providing an instrument comprising a first plate, the first plate comprising a first connector and a first region provided with a plurality of through-holes, and a second plate, the second plate comprising a second connector configured for engaging the first connector and comprising a second region provided with a plurality of through-holes; wherein a porous membrane is interposed between the first region and the second region by engagement of the first connector and the second connector; (b) adding a biological sample to each of the through-holes of the first plate to form an immobilized sample on the porous membrane; and (c) measuring the target substance with a substance that specifically bonds with the target substance in the immobilized sample.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with the present invention, instruments for forming an immobilized sample on a porous membrane have been discovered and are further described below. In addition, methods for the quantification of a target substance in an immobilized sample have been discovered, which are capable of quantifying a plurality of target substances and effectively quantifying the same target substance in a plurality of samples.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is desirable that the instrument for forming an immobilized sample on a porous membrane have a structure including a first plate having a first connector and a first region provided with a plurality of through-holes; and a second plate having a second connector capable of engaging the first connector and a second region provided with a plurality of through-holes. At least a porous membrane is interposed between the first region and the second region by the engagement of the first connector and the second connector. According to this structure, a porous membrane is uniformly pressed between a first region and a second region, and excellent wells are formed by a plurality of through-holes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is desirable that the each of the plurality of through-holes is more ovoid than circular. Ovoid through-holes may be arrayed so as to have a higher density of holes as compared to circular through-holes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The through-holes in the first plate have a top opening and a bottom opening. It is desirable that the top opening area is larger than the bottom opening area.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is desirable that the through-holes are arranged in a matrix pattern. In this configuration, automated injection of the sample into the well formed by the through-hole may be readily accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is desirable that the convexities and concavities have a close fitting tolerance of, for example, p6/H7, that allows disassembly. In this configuration, the convexities may be press-fitted to the concavities so as to be removable.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The hydrophobic porous membrane interposed between the first and second plates will be capable of hydrophobically binding with the protein, and specific examples of useful membranes include but are not limited to PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) hydrophobic membranes, nylon (subjected to an electrical charge process) membranes, nitrocellulose, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The average diameter of the pores of the hydrophobic membrane is between about 0.1 and about 10 μm, and preferably between about 0.1 and about 0.5 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When forming an immobilized protein on the hydrophobic porous membrane, the protein does not pass through the hydrophobic porous membrane, even if the pores of the hydrophobic porous membrane are larger than the protein, since the protein is held by hydrophobic bonds and the like between the protein and the membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is desirable that the hydrophobic porous membrane is subjected to an initialization process, such as immersion in methanol or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is desirable that the first and second plates are formed of a chemically resistant material including but not limited to vinyl chloride resin and polyethylene resin.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to the porous membrane, a filter may also be interposed between the first and second plates. The addition of a filter increases the water-tightness of the wells, and reduces fluid leakage from the wells. Furthermore, a filter may maintain moisture. Filter paper may be used as a filter. The thickness of the filter paper is desirably between about 0.2 and about 4 mm, and preferably between about 0.4 and about 2 mm. Furthermore, if the filter paper has a thickness within this range, one sheet may be used or a plurality of sheets may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention is further described below in reference to the examples shown in the drawings. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these examples.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Imin=35.4 (count/mm<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The calibration curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is prepared by subtracting Ib from the fluorescent intensity Is of the immobilized standard reagent in the standard series group Gs, and by calculating the net fluorescent intensity Iso. One ng/50 μL of the standard reagent of section (2) allows recognition of 1 U/50 μL of CDK1 in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In regard to the ten specimens and two control specimens, the average fluorescent intensity was calculated for each two wells, respectively.

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, specimens having a net fluorescent intensity less than Imin are designated by ND (not measurable). In the control specimens, HL60 is known to be 150 to 250 count/mm<sup>2</sup>, and Jurkat is known to be 380 to 550 count/mm<sup>2</sup>. Since the values of HL60 and Jurkat are within this range in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, these measurements are judged to be correct.</p>
