<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to photovoltaic cells, and more particularly but not exclusively to frames for mounting photovoltaic modules.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Photovoltaic cells, also known as “solar cells,” are well known devices for converting solar radiation to electrical energy. Photovoltaic cells are employed in both space and terrestrial applications. Photovoltaic cells in space applications include those used in spacecrafts and satellites. In terrestrial applications, photovoltaic cells are employed as power sources for a variety of things including electronic devices, vehicles, and buildings. Photovoltaic cells may be arranged into an array and packaged as a module.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photovoltaic modules are typically installed on the rooftop when employed as a power source for a building. In that application, regardless of whether the building is for residential or commercial use, it is important that the photovoltaic modules are installed such that they are structurally sound, operate at rated efficiencies, and aesthetically pleasing. It is also important for the photovoltaic modules to be relatively easy to ship and install.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a photovoltaic frame assembly comprises a photovoltaic module and a frame having a plurality of air vents. The air vents allow air to flow into the frame and thereby cool the photovoltaic module. The frame may be installed in-line with another such frame to allow air flow between frames.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present disclosure, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of apparatus, components, and method, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details. In other instances, well-known details are not shown or described to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a photovoltaic assembly <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Assembly <b>100</b> includes a photovoltaic module <b>102</b> and a frame, which may comprise a plurality of frame members. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the frame members are extrusions <b>110</b> (i.e., <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . ). Photovoltaic module <b>102</b> comprises an array of photovoltaic cells. A glass laminate may be placed over the photovoltaic cells for environmental protection. In one embodiment, the photovoltaic cells advantageously comprise backside-contact cells, such as those of the type available from Sunpower Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif. In a backside-contact cell, wirings leading to external electrical circuits are coupled on the backside (i.e., the side of the cell facing away from the sun) of the cell for increased area for solar collection. Backside-contact cells are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,053,083 and 4,927,770, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Other types of photovoltaic cells may also be used without detracting from the merits of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Extrusions <b>110</b>, which serve as frame members, form a frame surrounding photovoltaic module <b>102</b>. The resulting frame may support photovoltaic module <b>102</b> along its edges as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This not only increases the aesthetic aspects and structural integrity of the frame, but also helps protect components in the interior of the frame. Photovoltaic module <b>102</b> may already be framed with extrusions <b>110</b> when shipped from the factory. This helps protect photovoltaic module <b>102</b> during shipping and also allows for relatively easy installation of the photovoltaic module at the installation site. Depending on the application, extrusions <b>110</b> may also be assembled with photovoltaic module <b>102</b> at the installation site. In one embodiment, an extrusion <b>110</b> comprises extruded aluminum. Other materials or fabrication processes may also be employed to fabricate an extrusion <b>110</b>. For example, an extrusion <b>110</b> may alternatively be molded plastic (e.g., injection molded), pultruded plastic (glass reinforced), reaction injected molded plastic, or welded metal assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An extrusion <b>110</b> may include a plurality of air vents <b>112</b> for allowing air to flow into or out of the frame. Only a few of air vents <b>112</b> are labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and in other drawings for clarity of illustration. Arrows <b>103</b>, which represent air flow, are shown as going into the frame in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Of course, air flow may also go in a direction opposite to that shown by arrows <b>103</b>. Air vents <b>112</b> advantageously allow cooling of assembly <b>100</b>. This helps keep the photovoltaic module relatively cool, which helps the photovoltaic cells retain their rated efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, air vents <b>112</b> comprise cutouts within the perimeter (i.e. not touching the edges) of an extrusion <b>110</b>. Forming the air vents <b>112</b> within the perimeter of an extrusion <b>110</b> advantageously allows a plurality of air vents <b>112</b> to be formed without compromising the structural integrity of the extrusion. This helps extrusions <b>110</b> frame and support a photovoltaic module <b>102</b> without necessarily having to have another support within the frame. That is, extrusions <b>110</b> may be employed as the sole structure supporting a photovoltaic module <b>102</b> over a rooftop. Depending on the application, air vents <b>112</b> may also comprise cutouts touching an edge of an extrusion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another advantage of incorporating air vents <b>112</b> in an extrusion <b>110</b> is that the frame formed by extrusions <b>110</b> may be placed substantially close to a plane of a roof. For example, the frame may be installed flushed or relatively close to the roof and still allow air to flow under photovoltaic module <b>102</b>. This allows cooling of photovoltaic module <b>102</b>, while remaining aesthetically pleasing. In contrast, prior techniques for installing a photovoltaic module simply jack the photovoltaic module over the roof without using a frame. Such prior techniques leave an unsightly gap between the roof and the photovoltaic module and expose components under the photovoltaic module.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a closer view of extrusions <b>110</b> framing photovoltaic module <b>102</b> in accordance with embodiment of the present invention. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, extrusion <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> is joined to extrusion <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> by fasteners <b>204</b>. A fastener <b>204</b> may be a screw or a bolt, for example. An extrusion <b>110</b> may have an outer lip <b>202</b>. As will be more apparent below, an outer lip <b>202</b> may be employed to attach an extrusion <b>110</b> to the roof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows air vents <b>112</b> previously discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show a prospective view and a front view, respectively, of an extrusion <b>110</b> with air vents <b>112</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an arrangement of photovoltaic module assemblies in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, photovoltaic module assemblies <b>100</b> are arranged in line such that air flows from one photovoltaic module assembly to another through air vents <b>112</b> (not shown) as indicated by arrows <b>403</b>. This results in air flow under the photovoltaic modules, thereby cooling them. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, photovoltaic module assemblies <b>100</b> may be installed flushed or relatively close to a roofing plane <b>404</b>. Roofing plane <b>404</b> may be a rooftop surface of a dwelling, which may be commercial or residential.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Using a plurality of extrusions to form a photovoltaic module frame with air vents advantageously simplifies the manufacturing, shipping, and assembly of the frame. It is to be understood, however, that the frame may also comprise a single piece with a top or bottom opening, for example. The frame may also have any number of pieces and not necessarily four as in the provided examples. The frame may have frame members other than extrusions. Such frame members or framing may incorporate air vents, and mounting portions similar to the presently disclosed extrusions.</p>
