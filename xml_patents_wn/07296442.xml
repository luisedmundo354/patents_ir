<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to glassware forming machines, and more particularly to a system for cooling a neck ring assembly in a glassware forming machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Individual section glassware forming machines typically include an invert arm assembly that is oscillated or rotated approximately 180° to transfer a glass parison from a blank mold to a final blow mold in which the glassware is formed into its desired final shape. A glass gob is received in a mold cavity of a blank mold and formed into a parison that is carried by neck ring tooling on the invert arm assembly. The invert arm assembly is then inverted by rotation about a longitudinal axis to dispose the parison into the final mold. Thereafter, the invert arm is returned to its starting position adjacent to the blank mold for a subsequent cycle. Considerable heat is required to maintain the formability of the molten glass gobs as they are formed into articles of glassware, such as glass containers. Accordingly, the devices used to form the glass gobs into the glass containers must be capable of continued operation in this high heat environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A system for directing cooling air onto a neck ring in a glassware molding machine that includes at least one stationary blank mold station having at least one plunger cylinder with an axis and at least one neck ring arm selectively aligned with the blank mold station, and at least one neck ring carried by a neck ring arm and movable into a forming position at the blank mold station coaxially with the axis. The system includes at least one air plenum stationarily disposed at the blank mold station and having an internal cavity for receiving cooling air flowing laterally inwardly toward the axis and having at least one outlet opening adjacent to the axis, and a plunger wear plate stationarily disposed overlying at least a portion of the air plenum, and having an array of axially oriented openings for receiving air directed from the air plenum. The system further includes a plurality of openings in the neck ring arm for receiving air from the openings in the plunger wear plate across a gap between the neck ring arm and the plunger wear plate when the neck ring arm overlies the plunger wear plate, and a plurality of air passages in the neck ring for receiving air from the neck ring arm openings.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one presently preferred implementation, the blank mold station is mounted on a hollow section box that is internally pressured with cooling air, and the system further includes an air passage from within the section box to the plenum internal cavity to provide cooling air flow from the section box to the plenum. In this manner, cooling air is immediately provided from the section box to and through the invert arm assembly and onto the neck ring tooling.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for cooling a neck ring in a glassware forming machine that includes a section box providing a supply of cooling air, and a plunger cylinder having an axis. The method includes the steps of providing an air plenum having an internal cavity defining a flow path that extends radially toward the axis and axially to an outlet, providing an air passage adjacent to the said neck ring that is aligned with the outlet of the air plenum, and directing cooling air from the section box to the air passage so the cooling air flows radially in the air plenum toward the axis, and then axially from the outlet to the air passages to cool the neck ring.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring in more detail to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a portion of an individual section glassware forming machine <b>10</b> including a neck ring cooling assembly <b>12</b> according to one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention. The individual section glassware forming machine <b>10</b> includes a blank mold station wherein glass gobs are received in blank mold cavities and are formed into glass parisons carried by neck rings <b>16</b> on neck ring arms <b>14</b>. The neck ring arms <b>14</b> are carried by an invert arm assembly (not shown) and are driven 180° about a longitudinal axis to dispose the glass blanks carried by neck rings <b>16</b> in cavities of a final blow mold. In the final blow mold the glass blanks are blow molded into articles of glassware, such as glass containers. The articles of glassware are released from the neck rings <b>16</b> and the neck ring arms <b>14</b> are reciprocated back to their starting position adjacent to the blank mold for a subsequent cycle. An invert arm of the type suitable for use with an individual section machine is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/609,444, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Likewise, the section boxes, blank mold and finish molds may be of generally conventional construction, with exceptions as noted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The glassware forming machine includes a section box <b>20</b> of which a top plate <b>22</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The section box <b>20</b> is closed and is preferably pressurized with cooling air at a pressure of about 2-3 psi, by way of example without limitation. A valve <b>24</b> is disposed adjacent to an outlet <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the top plate <b>22</b> and is adapted to control the flow of cooling air therethrough. The valve <b>24</b> may be controlled by a remotely located solenoid, and may be pneumatically driven to its closed position and yieldably biased to its open position. When closed, the valve <b>24</b> prevents cooling air flow out of the section box <b>20</b> through the outlet <b>26</b>, and when open, the valve <b>24</b> permits flow of cooling air out of the outlet <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A cooling air flow valve assembly, or damper valve assembly <b>30</b> is disposed downstream of the outlet <b>26</b> and is constructed and arranged to control the rate at which cooling air flows therethrough. The damper valve assembly <b>30</b> is carried on a mounting plate <b>32</b> fixed to the top plate <b>22</b> and includes an annular generally cylindrical collar <b>34</b> fixed to the mounting plate <b>32</b>, a cylindrical housing <b>36</b> disposed within the collar <b>34</b>, and a valve body <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) disposed within the housing <b>36</b>. The housing <b>36</b> is preferably slidably received within the collar <b>34</b> for relative axial movement of the housing <b>36</b> relative to the collar <b>34</b> and the section box top plate <b>22</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the collar <b>34</b> preferably includes a circumferential groove <b>40</b> in its inner surface to receive an O-ring or other seal <b>42</b> between the collar <b>34</b> and housing <b>36</b> for a fluid tight seal between them. The housing <b>36</b> is connected to a laterally extending bracket or tube assembly <b>46</b> which in turn is connected to and moveable with an air plenum <b>48</b>, as will be set forth in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The valve body <b>38</b> is received for rotation within the housing <b>36</b> on an integral shaft and a bolt <b>44</b>, and is axially supported by a retaining ring <b>45</b> in the housing <b>36</b>. The valve body <b>38</b> is preferably a hollow cylinder having a circumferentially and axially extending opening <b>50</b> formed through its side wall <b>52</b> defining a portion of the flow path of the cooling air from the section box to the neck rings <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, cooling air flows from the pressurized section box <b>20</b>, upward or axially through the flow control valve <b>24</b>, axially into and radially out of the damper valve <b>30</b> toward the axis, radially into and axially out of the passage <b>64</b> in the tube assembly <b>46</b>, axially into, radially within toward the axis of the plunger cylinders, and axially out of the air plenum <b>48</b>, and axially into and through the plunger wear plate <b>92</b> and into the neck ring arms <b>14</b>. In the neck ring arms <b>14</b>, the cooling air is passed axially through the bores <b>110</b> in the neck ring arms <b>14</b> and the slots <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> in the neck rings <b>16</b> to cool them in use. Desirably, the cooling air flow path from the section box <b>20</b> to the neck ring arms <b>14</b> and neck rings <b>16</b> is separate from the cooling system used to cool the blank molds or other components of the individual section glassware forming machine <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the neck rings <b>16</b> and neck ring arms <b>14</b> can be cooled as desired without regard to the cooling of other components of the individual section glassware forming machine <b>10</b>.</p>
