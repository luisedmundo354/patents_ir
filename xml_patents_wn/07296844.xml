<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for the claims and/or as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an automotive vehicle is illustrated in accordance with the present invention and is referenced generally by numeral <b>20</b>. The automotive vehicle <b>20</b> is illustrated as a two-door coupe, however, the invention contemplates that the teachings of the present invention may be utilized with various automotive vehicles including passenger vehicles, utility vehicles, commercial vehicles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Two-door vehicles, particularly two-door vehicles having a door on each of a pair of opposed lateral sides of the vehicle, encounter the design constraints associated with passenger ingress to and egress from the vehicle. Particularly, two-door vehicles having multiple seating positions, such as the vehicle <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, involve design criteria requiring doors that are sufficiently sized to permit occupant ingress and egress to multiple seating rows of the passenger compartment. Additionally, various passenger vehicles, such as the coupe illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are generally lower to the ground for a lowered center of gravity for enhancing the handling and performance of the vehicle. These vehicles often include seating that is relatively low to a floor in the vehicle due to the compact height. Such compact height vehicles with lowered seats require the passenger to extend his or her legs forward within the passenger compartment of the vehicle <b>20</b>. All of these design characteristics, which are appreciated by the vehicle <b>20</b> of an embodiment of the present invention, are factors associated with designing doors of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the automotive vehicle <b>20</b> has a vehicle body <b>22</b> provided with a passenger compartment <b>24</b> for comfortably seating and transporting passengers. For the embodiment illustrated, multiple seating rows are provided within the passenger compartment <b>24</b>, including a front seating row <b>26</b> and a rear seating row <b>28</b>. In order to accommodate occupant ingress to an egress from the multiple seating rows <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the passenger compartment <b>24</b>, a door opening <b>30</b> is provided in the vehicle body <b>22</b>. The door opening <b>30</b> is sized to accommodate the entering and exiting of front and rear rows <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the passenger compartment <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The door opening <b>30</b> is illustrated formed through a lateral sidewall <b>32</b> and a roof <b>34</b> of the vehicle body <b>22</b>. Of course, the invention contemplates utilization of the present invention in various door openings in various regions of the vehicle body <b>22</b>. For example, the automotive vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment illustrated is symmetrical with mirror image lateral halves, as is typical with many passenger vehicles. Thus, the embodiment of the automotive vehicle <b>20</b> illustrated is provided with a door opening <b>30</b> on both lateral sidewalls <b>32</b> of the vehicle and the door openings <b>30</b> both extend at least partially through the roof <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Of course, the invention contemplates that both door openings <b>30</b> may overlap a central region of the roof <b>34</b> such that a larger region of the roof <b>34</b> is utilized for the door opening than that depicted by the present embodiment automotive vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the door opening <b>30</b> is illustrated formed through both the lateral sidewall <b>32</b> and the roof <b>34</b> of the vehicle body <b>22</b>, the invention contemplates utilization of various features in accordance with the present invention with or without the door opening <b>30</b> being formed through the roof <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the vehicle <b>20</b> includes a door <b>36</b> sized to enclose the passenger compartment <b>24</b> by mating with the perimeter of the door opening <b>30</b>. The door <b>36</b> is operably connected to the vehicle body <b>22</b> for translation from a closed orientation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to an open orientation as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. Since the door opening <b>30</b> of the depicted embodiment extends through the lateral sidewall <b>32</b> and the roof <b>34</b> of the vehicle body <b>22</b>, the door <b>36</b> includes a matching side panel <b>38</b> with a roof panel <b>40</b> extending laterally inboard from a top region <b>42</b> of the door side panel <b>38</b>. Thus, the door side panel <b>38</b> and door roof panel <b>40</b> collectively provide the door <b>36</b> for closing the door opening <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to displace the door <b>36</b> relative to the vehicle body <b>22</b> to an upper orientation that optimizes the door opening <b>30</b> for occupant ingress and egress, the door <b>36</b> is translated vertically upward relative to the vehicle body <b>22</b> and laterally outboard relative to the vehicle body. During the translation of the door <b>36</b> to the open orientation, the door <b>36</b> is also rotationally translated such that a forward region of the door <b>44</b> is translated upward and outboard from the vehicle body <b>22</b> at a greater rate than that of a rearward region <b>46</b> of the door <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to translate the door <b>36</b> between the closed and opened orientations, the door <b>36</b> may be pivotally connected to the vehicle body <b>22</b>. For example, the rearward region <b>46</b> of the door <b>36</b> may be pivotally connected to a rearward region <b>48</b> of the door opening <b>30</b> by a hinge <b>50</b>. Another hinge <b>52</b> is provided on an upward region of the door <b>36</b> for pivotally connecting the door roof panel <b>40</b> to the roof <b>34</b> of the vehicle body <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The hinges <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> provide a pivot axis <b>54</b> of the door <b>36</b> that extends laterally away from the vehicle body <b>22</b> from the roof panel hinge <b>52</b> to the rearward door hinge <b>50</b>. The lateral arrangement of the pivot axis <b>54</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Additionally, the pivot axis <b>54</b> is inclined downward from the roof panel hinge <b>52</b> to the rearward door hinge <b>50</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The door opening <b>30</b> diverges as it extends upward relative to the vehicle body <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The taper of the divergent door opening <b>30</b> maximizes a longitudinal length of the door opening <b>30</b> for accommodating entering and exiting both rows <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the passenger compartment <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The door opening <b>30</b> partially follows a perimeter of a windshield <b>56</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b>. The windshield <b>56</b> is a transparent panel mounted to the vehicle body <b>22</b> at a forward region <b>58</b> of a passenger compartment <b>24</b>. A structural pillar <b>60</b>, commonly referred to as an A-pillar, is displaced along a lateral side of the windshield <b>56</b>. The A-pillar <b>60</b> may form a portion of the door opening <b>30</b>. The door opening <b>30</b> may also partially extend along a top region of the windshield <b>56</b> thereby providing an enlarged door opening <b>30</b> through the roof <b>34</b>. Thus, the door side panel <b>38</b> engages the A-pillar <b>60</b> in the closed orientation and the door roof panel <b>40</b> extends to the top region of the windshield <b>56</b> and a distal end of the A-pillar <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a transparent backlight <b>62</b> is mounted to the vehicle body <b>22</b> at a rearward region <b>64</b> of the passenger compartment <b>24</b>. Another structural pillar <b>66</b> is provided on a lateral side of the backlight <b>62</b>. The door opening <b>30</b> may extend rearward to a top region of the backlight <b>62</b>. Accordingly, the door roof panel <b>40</b> may engage a top region above the backlight <b>62</b> and a distal end of the pillar <b>66</b> in the closed orientation of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Due to the large door opening <b>30</b> extending through the roof <b>34</b>, clearance is provided through the roof <b>34</b> of the vehicle body <b>22</b> such that passengers are not required to duck while entering and exiting the front row <b>26</b> of the passenger compartment. Passengers may enter the front row <b>26</b> of the passenger compartment <b>24</b>, and then sit down.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, a streamlined vehicle <b>20</b> is provided. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, the door <b>36</b> is illustrated in the open orientation. The door <b>36</b> opens facing forward such that passengers approach the door opening <b>30</b> from a forward region of the vehicle <b>20</b>. By translating the door <b>36</b> upward about the pivot axis <b>54</b>, the door <b>36</b> is not greatly extended laterally outboard of the vehicle <b>20</b>, which is typical with vertically hinged doors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a forward region of the passenger compartment <b>24</b> is generally unobstructed so that the passenger has wide clearance for his or her legs when entering or exiting the front row <b>26</b>. Such obstructions are generally typical in prior art doors that have a vertical hinge and open rearward facing. Such obstructions are also typical in doors that pivot about a generally horizontal axis provided at a forward region of the passenger compartment <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a striker <b>68</b> is provided on the forward region <b>44</b> of the door <b>36</b>. Likewise, a receiver <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is provided in the door opening <b>30</b> for receiving the striker <b>68</b> and latching the door <b>36</b> in the closed orientation. The striker <b>68</b> translates with the door <b>36</b> such that it is oriented generally horizontal in the closed orientation of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To maximize occupant external viewing from within the passenger compartment <b>24</b>, a side window <b>72</b> is provided in the side panel <b>38</b> of the door <b>36</b>. Additionally, a roof window <b>74</b> is provided in the roof panel <b>40</b> of the door <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the hinges <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are illustrated in greater detail. Both hinges <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are generally arcuate and are coupled to the vehicle body <b>22</b> for sliding translation relative to the vehicle body <b>22</b> so that as the arcuate hinges <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> slide, the door <b>36</b> is pivoted about the pivot axis <b>54</b>. Moreover, the arcuate hinges <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> share a common axis of rotation, the pivot axis <b>54</b>. The rearward door hinge <b>50</b> has a radius of curvature (r<b>1</b>) that is greater than the radius of curvature (r<b>2</b>) of the roof panel hinge <b>52</b> for increased translation of the door <b>36</b> relative to the door opening rearward region <b>48</b> with respect to the translation of the door roof panel <b>40</b> relative to the roof <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an actuator <b>76</b> may be provided within the vehicle body <b>22</b> interconnected with the rearward door hinge <b>50</b> for driving the door <b>36</b> between the open and closed orientations. Due to the vertical displacement of the door <b>36</b>, the actuator <b>76</b> may assist or translate the door <b>36</b>. The actuator <b>76</b> may be a hydraulic actuator, a pneumatic actuator, an electric actuator such as a stepper motor, or the like. Additionally, the actuator <b>76</b> may provide support to the door <b>36</b> to maintain the door <b>36</b> in the open orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In summary, various door, door opening and door hinging features are disclosed, which optimize vehicle compactness, and door positioning for ingress and egress of passengers to and from the passenger compartment <b>24</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
