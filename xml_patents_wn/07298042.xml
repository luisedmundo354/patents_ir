<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional ball grid array, solder balls, which become external terminals are disposed in a full grid arrangement or a staggered arrangement. Interconnects <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> are formed on each side of an interposer <b>500</b>. The interconnects <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> are connected through through-holes <b>506</b> formed in the interposer <b>500</b>. An IC chip <b>508</b> is mounted on the surface of the interposer <b>500</b>. The IC chip <b>508</b> is connected with the interconnects <b>502</b> through bumps <b>510</b> and is sealed with a mold resin <b>512</b>. Solder balls <b>514</b> are disposed on the back surface of the interposer <b>500</b> in a full grid arrangement. The solder ball <b>514</b> is connected with the interconnect <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional ball grid array, if the interposer <b>500</b> is mounted on a motherboard, force is applied to the solder balls <b>514</b> due to shrinkage of the interposer <b>500</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrative of a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> along the line II-II. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> along the line III-III. The semiconductor device includes a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a semiconductor chip. However, a semiconductor wafer may also be used. An integrated circuit <b>12</b> is formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. One integrated circuit <b>12</b> is formed in a semiconductor chip, and a plurality of integrated circuits <b>12</b> are formed in a semiconductor wafer. A region in which the integrated circuit <b>12</b> is formed may be referred to as an active region.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> includes a plurality of interconnects (or interconnect layer) <b>14</b> electrically connected with the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The interconnects <b>14</b> include an interconnect electrically connected with the integrated circuit <b>12</b> (or active region). The interconnects <b>14</b> may include an interconnect which is connected with the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> without being electrically connected with the integrated circuit <b>12</b>. An electrode (pad) <b>16</b> is formed on the interconnect <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> may include a passivation film <b>18</b>. The passivation film <b>18</b> may be a resin film, a silicon oxide film, or a silicon nitride film. The passivation film <b>18</b> may be transparent such as a silicon oxide film, or may be opaque. The passivation film <b>18</b> may be formed to avoid a part (center, for example) of the electrodes <b>16</b>. The passivation film <b>18</b> covers the interconnects <b>14</b>. The passivation film <b>18</b> may cover the entire integrated circuit <b>12</b> (or active region).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A resin layer <b>20</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The resin layer <b>20</b> is formed so that a part of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> (part of the passivation film <b>18</b>, for example) is exposed. The resin layer <b>20</b> is an electrical insulating layer. The resin layer <b>20</b> does not contain conductive particles. The resin layer <b>20</b> may have a stress relief function. The resin layer <b>20</b> may be formed of a polyimide resin, silicone-modified polyimide resin, epoxy resin, silicone-modified epoxy resin, benzocyclobutene (BCB), polybenzoxazole (PBO), or the like. The resin layer <b>20</b> may be formed of a material having a light shielding property. The resin layer <b>20</b> is formed to avoid the top of the electrodes <b>16</b>. At least a part of the resin layer <b>20</b> may be formed on the integrated circuit <b>12</b> (or active region).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The semiconductor device includes wiring pattern <b>22</b> electrically connected with the electrodes <b>16</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> is formed so that a part of the wiring pattern <b>22</b> overlaps the electrode <b>16</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> is formed to extend to the resin layer <b>20</b> (upper surface of the resin layer <b>20</b>, for example). The wiring pattern <b>22</b> may pass over the passivation film <b>18</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> may be formed of a three-layer structure consisting of a TiW sputter interconnect layer, a Cu sputter interconnect layer, and a Cu plating interconnect layer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A plurality of external terminals (solder balls, for example) <b>24</b> are formed on the wiring pattern <b>22</b>. The external terminals <b>24</b> may be formed of soft solder or hard solder. As the soft solder, solder containing no lead (hereinafter called lead-free solder) may be used. As the lead-free solder, a tin-silver (Sn—Ag) alloy, tin-bismuth (Sn—Bi) alloy, tin-zinc (Sn—Zn) alloy, or tin-copper (Sn—Cu) alloy may be used. At least one of silver, bismuth, zinc, and copper may be added to these alloys. The external terminal <b>24</b> is formed on the resin layer <b>20</b> and is supported by the resin layer <b>20</b>. Therefore, a part of the external force applied to the external terminal <b>24</b> is absorbed by the resin layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The semiconductor device includes a plurality of dummy terminals <b>26</b>. The dummy terminals <b>26</b> are not electrically connected with the electrodes <b>16</b>. The dummy terminals <b>26</b> are not electrically connected with the external terminals <b>24</b>. The dummy terminals <b>26</b> are supported by the resin layer <b>20</b>. For example, the dummy terminals <b>26</b> may be formed on pads <b>28</b> formed on the resin layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The dummy terminal <b>26</b> may be formed of the same material as the external terminal <b>24</b> (solder, for example). The dummy terminal <b>26</b> may be formed of a material different from the material for the external terminal <b>24</b> so that the dummy terminal <b>26</b> and the external terminal <b>24</b> differ in properties (elasticity, adhesion, and the like). If the dummy terminals <b>26</b> are formed of an adhesive, the dummy terminals <b>26</b> can be caused to adhere to a motherboard while being crushed. This enables the difference in size between the dummy terminals <b>26</b> to be absorbed. As a modification, a dummy terminal <b>27</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a center portion formed of a resin and a surface layer formed of solder. This allows the dummy terminals <b>26</b> to be easily elastically deformed, whereby the dummy terminals <b>26</b> can be prevented from being removed from the interconnect pattern of the motherboard, even if external force is applied. Moreover, the dummy terminals <b>26</b> and the external terminals <b>24</b> can be connected at the same time by forming the surface layer by using solder.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the case where the upper surface of the resin layer <b>20</b> is in a shape of a rectangle, the dummy terminals <b>26</b> may be formed at least at a pair of corners on the diagonal of the rectangle. The upper surface of the resin layer <b>20</b> may be divided into a first region which is located on the end and a second region which is closer to the center than the first region. In this case, the dummy terminals <b>26</b> may be formed in the first region and the external terminals <b>24</b> may be formed in the second region. According to the present embodiment, since bonding strength can be increased by the dummy terminals <b>26</b> when bonding the semiconductor device to a motherboard or the like, electrical connection failure of the external terminals <b>24</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The semiconductor device may include a second resin layer (protective layer such as a solder resist) <b>30</b>. The second resin layer <b>30</b> is formed on the resin layer <b>20</b>. The second resin layer <b>30</b> is formed to cover the wiring pattern <b>22</b> so as to avoid an area of the wiring pattern <b>22</b> in which the external terminal <b>24</b> is formed (land, for example). An opening which exposes the wiring pattern <b>22</b> on the resin layer <b>20</b> is formed in the second resin layer <b>30</b>. The external terminal <b>24</b> is connected with the wiring pattern <b>22</b> through the opening formed in the second resin layer <b>30</b>. The second resin layer <b>30</b> is in contact with at least the base of the external terminals <b>24</b>. The second resin layer <b>30</b> may cover the electrodes <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, a semiconductor wafer is used as the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The resin layer <b>20</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> (on the passivation film <b>18</b>, for example). The formation process of the resin layer <b>20</b> may include applying a resin precursor (thermosetting resin precursor, for example) to the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, or forming a resin precursor layer by spreading a resin precursor on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> by spin coating. A continuous or integral resin precursor layer may be formed by using a radiation sensitive resin precursor having a property sensitive to radiation (light (ultraviolet light or visible light), X-rays, or electron beams), and the resin precursor layer may be patterned. The resin precursor layer is patterned by applying lithography. The resin layer <b>20</b> may be formed by printing (screen printing, for example). The resin layer <b>20</b> may be formed of either a plurality of layers or a single layer. The resin layer <b>20</b> is formed to avoid the top of the electrodes <b>16</b>. The resin layer <b>20</b> may be formed to avoid a cutting region of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The wiring pattern <b>22</b> are formed to be electrically connected with the electrodes <b>16</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> is formed to extend to the resin layer <b>20</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> is formed to pass over the electrode <b>16</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> may pass on the side surface of the resin layer <b>20</b>. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> may be formed to include a land (area wider than the line). The external terminal <b>24</b> is formed on the land. The wiring pattern <b>22</b> may be formed of either a single layer or a plurality of layers. For example, a TiW sputter film and a Cu sputter film are stacked in that order by sputtering, and a plating resist film is then formed. An opening corresponding to the wiring pattern <b>22</b> is formed in the plating resist film by using photolithographic technology, and a Cu plating interconnect layer is formed by copper electroplating through the opening. The plating resist film is then removed and a Cu sputter interconnect layer and a TiW sputter interconnect layer are formed by etching the Cu sputter film and the TiW sputter film by using the Cu plating interconnect layer as a mask to form the wiring pattern <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The second resin layer <b>30</b> may be formed on the resin layer <b>20</b>. The description of the resin layer <b>20</b> may be applied to the second resin layer <b>30</b>. The second resin layer <b>30</b> may be a solder resist. The second resin layer <b>30</b> is formed to cover the wiring pattern <b>22</b> excluding a part (center of the land, for example) of the wiring pattern <b>22</b>. The second resin layer <b>30</b> may be formed so that the cutting region of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The external terminals <b>24</b> are formed on the wiring pattern <b>22</b> so as to be supported by the resin layer <b>20</b>. The external terminals <b>24</b> may be formed by applying a conventional method. The dummy terminals <b>26</b> are formed so as to be supported by the resin layer <b>20</b>. The pads <b>28</b> may be formed on the resin layer <b>20</b>, and the dummy terminals <b>26</b> may be formed on the pads <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A third resin layer (not shown) may be formed on the second resin layer <b>30</b>, if necessary. The description of the resin layer <b>20</b> may be applied to the third resin layer. The third resin layer is formed to cover an area other than the top of the external terminals <b>24</b>. This enables stress which occurs due to external force applied to the external terminals <b>24</b> to be dispersed. This also enables bonding between the external terminals <b>24</b> and the wiring pattern <b>22</b> to be reinforced. The third resin layer may be formed to cover the entire semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and then patterned. The third resin layer may be formed to cover the external terminals <b>24</b> and be removed from the top of the external terminals <b>24</b>. The third resin layer may be patterned by applying lithography. A part of the third resin layer may be removed by using a laser or ashing.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> may be cut (diced or scribed). If the resin layer <b>20</b> and the second resin layer <b>30</b> are not formed in the cutting region of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, clogging of a cutter (or blade) <b>32</b> can be prevented since the resin is not cut. The semiconductor device is thus obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is illustrative of a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, a conductive film <b>42</b> is formed below the external terminals (not shown) and dummy terminals <b>40</b>. The conductive film <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> (on the passivation film <b>18</b>, for example) under a resin layer <b>44</b>. However, the conductive film <b>42</b> may be formed inside the resin layer <b>44</b>. The conductive film <b>42</b> may be formed to cover the integrated circuit <b>12</b> (region in which the active element is formed, for example). This enables an electromagnetic wave shielding effect for the integrated circuit <b>12</b> to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As a modification, a conductive film <b>50</b> may be divided into a plurality of sections <b>52</b> provided at an interval from each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The influence of internal stress of the conductive film <b>50</b> on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> can be reduced by dividing the conductive film <b>50</b>. The conductive film <b>50</b> is formed so that the integrated circuit <b>12</b> (region in which the active element is formed, for example) is located in the region in which the sections <b>52</b> are formed (region including the sections <b>52</b> and the space between the sections <b>52</b>). This enables the electromagnetic wave shielding effect for the integrated circuit <b>12</b> to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the conductive film <b>42</b> (or <b>50</b>) is electrically connected with the dummy terminals <b>40</b> without being electrically connected with the electrodes <b>16</b>. In more detail, through-holes <b>46</b> are formed in the resin layer <b>44</b> so as to overlap a part of the conductive film <b>42</b> (or <b>50</b>). A wiring pattern <b>48</b> is formed from the conductive film <b>42</b> (or <b>50</b>) so as to pass on the inner surface of the through-hole <b>46</b> and extend to the upper surface of the resin layer <b>44</b>. The dummy terminals <b>40</b> are formed on the wiring pattern <b>48</b> so as to be supported by the resin layer <b>44</b>. The material for the dummy terminal <b>40</b> may be selected from the materials used for the external terminal <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The electromagnetic wave shielding effect can be increased by electrically connecting the conductive film <b>42</b> (or <b>50</b>) with GND through the dummy terminals <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The description in the first embodiment is applied to other configurations and the manufacturing method. In the present embodiment, the effects described in the first embodiment can also be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref> are illustrative of modifications of the dummy terminals. These modifications may be applied to the first and second embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, dummy terminals <b>100</b> may be formed to be larger than all the external terminals <b>22</b>. This enables adhesion of the dummy terminals <b>100</b> to be increased. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, at least two dummy terminals <b>110</b> may be disposed to be adjacent to each other. At least two dummy terminals <b>110</b> may be unified by melting the dummy terminals <b>110</b>. This enables adhesion of the dummy terminals <b>110</b> to be increased without changing the size of the dummy terminals <b>110</b>. In the case where a resin layer <b>120</b> has an oblong shape (rectangle or oval, for example) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, dummy terminals <b>122</b> may be formed on both ends of the oblong shape in the longitudinal direction.</p>
