<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus includes a metal base board <b>1</b> on which is mounted a support assembly <b>2</b> of generally rectangular shape and having a longitudinally-extending recess <b>3</b> in which is received a charge-measuring assembly <b>4</b> with cooling fins on its upper surface. The support assembly <b>2</b> has a box-like inlet structure <b>5</b> on one side providing a plenum chamber for air drawn to the inlet side of the charge-measuring assembly. A box-like outlet structure <b>6</b> extending along the opposite side of the charge measuring assembly <b>4</b> includes a plenum chamber and an outlet opening on the lower surface of the board through which air can be pumped away from the apparatus. A third structure <b>7</b> provides electrical connection to the assembly <b>4</b>. Further details of the charge-measuring assembly <b>4</b> are given below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The board <b>1</b> also supports particle size measuring means in the form of an optical laser arrangement indicated generally by the numeral <b>10</b>. The arrangement includes a laser tube <b>11</b> mounted horizontally on the board <b>1</b> to extend parallel to the support assembly <b>2</b>. Two inclined mirror assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are oriented to direct the beam of radiation emerging from one end of the tube <b>11</b> axially of the charge measuring assembly <b>4</b> and, in particular, the beam of radiation is incident on a window <b>14</b> in one end of the charge measuring assembly and passes along its length to emerge from its other end and be absorbed in an optical beam dump <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The charge measuring assembly <b>4</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. It comprises a rectangular metal block <b>20</b> with a forward surface <b>21</b> in which ten recesses <b>22</b> extend laterally of the block side-by-side towards its right-hand end. A photo multiplier tube (PMT) <b>23</b> is mounted on the forward surface towards the left-hand end of the block <b>20</b> for measuring the size of the particles. The rear surface <b>24</b> of the block, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, has a shallow recess <b>25</b> extending along most of its length and has ten circular apertures <b>26</b> opening into the recess aligned with respective ones of the recesses <b>22</b> in the forward surface <b>21</b>. A groove <b>27</b> providing a laser pathway extends diametrically across the apertures <b>26</b>. The lower end of the groove <b>27</b>, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, opens into the window <b>14</b>. At its other end, the groove <b>27</b> opens into a tubular guide <b>28</b> extending to the end of the block <b>20</b> and terminated by a coupling <b>29</b> to which the optical beam dump <b>15</b> is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of the recesses <b>22</b> in the block <b>20</b> contains a charge sensor <b>40</b> of the kind shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Each sensor <b>40</b> includes a rectangular upper plate <b>41</b> and a smaller lower plate <b>42</b> separated from one another by two support pillars <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>. An O-ring seal <b>45</b> extends around the upper plate <b>41</b> to form an hermetic seal with a respective recess <b>22</b>, the sensor <b>40</b> being held in place by screws extending into tapped holes (not shown) in the block <b>20</b> through two screw holes <b>46</b> at opposite ends of the plate. The upper plate <b>41</b> has an air pipe <b>47</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). On the underside of the plate <b>41</b> the pipe <b>47</b> supports and connects with the upper end of a charge sensor tube <b>50</b>, which is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The lower end of the charge sensor tube <b>50</b> is supported in a recess <b>70</b> in the lower plate <b>42</b>. The recess <b>70</b> is circular and tapers to a reduced diameter at its lower end to reduce stray capacitance between the metal structure and electrodes on the charge sensor tube <b>50</b>. The upper plate <b>41</b> also supports an electrical connector <b>49</b> connected to electrodes on the tube <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The tube <b>50</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and is of an electrically-insulative material such as glass or ceramic, it has a circular section with an outside diameter of about 1 mm, an inside diameter of about 0.5 mm and a length of about 30 mm. The tube <b>50</b> has five ring-shape electrodes on its outer surface spaced from one another along the length of the tube. The electrodes are on the outside of the tube because the air flowing through it may be humid and conductive. Two electrodes <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> at opposite ends of the tube <b>50</b> are each 8 mm long and are separated by insulating gaps <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>, each 0.5 mm long, from two intermediate electrodes <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, which are each 0.5 mm long. A central electrode <b>57</b>, which is 1 mm long, is separated from the intermediate electrodes by insulating gaps <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, each 0.5 mm long. The two outer electrodes <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are connected to ground. The two intermediate electrodes <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> are connected together and the signal on these is subtracted from the signal on the central electrode <b>57</b> using the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The lower end of the tube <b>50</b> extends through the recess <b>70</b> and through a circular boss <b>60</b> formed on the lower surface of the lower plate <b>42</b>. The electrodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> <b>57</b> are located towards the lower end of the tube <b>50</b> so that the distance between the charge measurement electrodes <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> and the particles' size measurement at the end of the tube is kept to a minimum</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The circuit for each sensor <b>40</b> comprises two identical amplifying circuits <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> connected to the central electrode <b>57</b> and the intermediate electrode pair <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> respectively. Each amplifying circuit <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> includes a low-noise charge amplifier <b>63</b>, a low pass filter <b>64</b>, a second amplifier <b>65</b> and an analogue-to-digital converter <b>66</b>. The digital output from each circuit <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> is supplied to a subtracting unit <b>67</b>, which provides an output signal to a digital processor <b>68</b> with suitable processing to reduce noise. The processor <b>68</b> receives nine other inputs from the other nine sensor units <b>40</b> The output signal from each sensor unit <b>40</b> takes the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, atmospheric air is drawn into and through the apparatus by a pump (not shown) located on the outlet side. The air is preconditioned with an elutriation filter of known kind to remove particles outside the range 1 μm to 10 μm. Particles that are too small would give rise to noise; particles that are too large would risk clogging the tubes <b>50</b>. It is important that the technique used to remove particles outside the desired size range has only a minimal effect on the charge of the remaining particles.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The preconditioned air containing suspect particles flows to the charge sensing tubes <b>50</b> in each of the ten sensors <b>40</b>. With a flow rate of about 10 L/min through the apparatus, the flow rate through each tube <b>50</b> is about 100 m/sec. When a particle is present in the air flowing through a sensor <b>40</b> an output response of the kind shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is produced. It can be seen that the width of the pulse P produced is highly constrained. The width of the pulse P depends on the diameter of the electrode rings <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> with larger diameters producing a more spread out signal. Short duration pulses are important if the apparatus is to be able to provide reliable identification when there is a high throughput of particles. The magnitude of the pulse P depends on the charge on the particle. The output from the sensors <b>40</b> is supplied to the processor <b>68</b>, which adds a timestamp to the data and is then stored to hard disc. The laser size measuring arrangement <b>10</b> continuously transmits a beam of laser radiation from the laser tube <b>11</b>, which is directed along the groove <b>27</b> in the block <b>20</b> where it intersects particles emerging from the lower end of the tubes <b>50</b>. The output of the PMT <b>23</b> is dependent on the size of the particle and this output is also supplied to the processor <b>68</b>. The processor <b>68</b>, therefore, receives information about the charge and size of each particle detected. This is compared with stored information to provide an output indicative of the nature of the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is believed that particles, in particular biological particles, carrying a relatively high electrical charge are more likely to have been generated artificially, and therefore present a possible hazard, because the usual mechanisms for producing small particles, such as aerosol nozzles and the like involve impact at high velocity. This causes disruption of the molecules, typically resulting in a charge on the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The dimensions of the tube can be varied but its diameter should be as small as possible compatible with producing flow through it sufficient to avoid clogging. It is believed that the minimum practical internal diameter is about 500 μm, with a wall thickness of about 250 μm. The number of charge sensors can be varied in order to achieve the desired throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One possible problem with the charge sensor tubes is that the particles may interact with the inside of the tubes to produce tribocharging. Glass and ceramic are known to have a fairly high propensity to tribocharging, although this is dependent on the nature of the particles. One possible alternative material is Mylar (a Registered Trade Mark of E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company), which is a polyester film material close to neutral in the triboelectric series, although this is only presently available in film form.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Instead of using an optical size measuring technique to identify a second characteristic of the particles it may be possible to identify the nature of particles from their charge and some other characteristic.</p>
