<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an orientating device for providing an indication of the orientation of a ground core sample cut by a core drill.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Core sampling is typically employed to allow geological surveying of the ground for purposes of exploration and/or mine development. Analysis of the material within the core sample provides information of the composition of the ground. However in order to map, for example a vein of ore, it is necessary to also have knowledge of the orientation of the core sample relative to the ground from which it was cut.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Several systems are already known for orientating core samples. One such system is the BALLMARK (Trademark) system which is described in International Application No. WO 00/75480. This system utilises a soft metal disk and a free running metal ball which are incorporated into a conventional inner tube back end or head assembly. The system utilises the force generated during breaking a core from the parent rock strata to indent the soft metal disk with the metal ball. As the ball is free running, gravity causes it to be positioned at the lowest point in its track, which corresponds with the bottom side of the hole and consequently the bottom of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The BALLMARK system has achieved high market acceptance and provides relatively high core orientation accuracy. Nevertheless, one drawback of the BALLMARK system is that it only operates by the actual breaking of the core. Core breaking involves lifting a drill string into which the core has advanced and applying sufficient tensile force to break the core from the bottom of the hole being drilled by the drill. However, in highly fractured or broken ground, the core breaks by itself during the drilling process. In this instance, the BALLMARK system will not operate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A more rudimentary system for core marking involves running a marking tool, which in essence is in the form of a red pencil on the end of a counter balanced spear, by a wireline down the drill string to physically mark the core. A substantial drawback with this system is that it requires separate tripping of the tool down the hole which takes substantial time thereby reducing actual drilling time and substantially increasing the cost of coring.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another marking system is the VAN RUTH wireline core orientator which utilises a plurality of slidable pins to provide a contour of the face of the core. Yet another system described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,311,201 relies on the use of a malleable material to provide an imprint of the face of the core. However, again both these systems require the separate tripping of a tool in order to provide orientation of the core.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide an orientation device for a core sample which does not require core breaking for operation and can be incorporated into a standard core drill so that it does not require separate tripping.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention there is provided an orientation device for providing an indication of the orientation of a core sample of material relative to a body of material from which the core is cut, said orientation device including at least:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a main body provided with a latching system for releasably latching the orientation device to a core lifter case assembly coupled to a core tube of a core drill used to cut said core sample; and,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a core orientation indicating means slidably coupled to said main body for providing an orientation reference for said core sample by action of contacting a facing surface of said material to be drilled by said core drill prior to commencement of drilling, said core orientation indicating means operatively associated with said latching system whereby upon sliding of said core orientation indicating means toward said main body beyond a trigger point facilitated by advancing of said core drill onto said facing surface said core orientation indicating means disengages said latching system from said core lifter case assembly so that said orientation device is retracted into said core tube by an advancing core when said drill is operated to cut said core.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Preferably said latching system includes first latching means for engaging said core lifter case assembly to prevent said main body from moving in an uphole direction prior to core orientation indicating means reaching said trigger point.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Preferably said latching system includes second latching means for engaging said core tube to prevent motion of said main body in a downhole direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">Preferably said second latching means includes a brake mechanism supported by said main body and having a plurality of brake elements which, when said main body is moved in a downhole direction relative to said core tube, wedge between said main body and an inner surface of said core tube with increasing force to brake said relative motion and effectively releasably lock said main body to said core tube, and when said main body is moved in an uphole direction relative to said core tube, self release from said inside surface of said core tube.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">Preferably said braking mechanism includes a braking surface formed about said main body, said braking surface provided with progressively increasing outer diameter in an uphole direction; and, bias means for biasing said brake elements in said uphole direction along said braking surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Preferably said braking mechanism further includes retaining means for retaining said braking elements about said main body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Preferably each of said braking elements is in the form of a ball.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">Preferably said core orientation indicating means includes a face orientator having one or more orientation elements for providing said orientation reference and, a shroud into which said one or more orientation elements retract as said core drill is advanced onto a said facing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">Preferably said orientation device includes a tubular extension coupled to said shroud and extending into and slidably retained by said main body, said extension provided with a latching surface wherein said first latching means is held in engagement with said core lifter case assembly by abutment of said first latching means with said latching surface, whereby in use, as said core drill is advanced onto said facing surface, said shroud contacts said bottom and slides toward said main body moving said latching surface out of abutment with said first latching means thereby disengaging said first latching means from said core lifter case assembly whereby said orientation device can retract into said core tube.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">Preferably said core orientation indicating means includes a shaft passing through said tubular extension and housing into said shroud and having a downhole end at which said one or more orientation elements are supported.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Preferably said orientation device further includes first bias means for biasing said tubular extension in a downhole direction and said latching surface into abutment with said first latching means.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Preferably said orientation device further includes: detent means for releasably axially locking said shaft to said tubular extension; and, second bias means acting between said shaft and said tubular extension for biasing said shaft to move axially in an uphole direction relative to said tubular extension when said detent means is released.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">Preferably said detent means acts between said main body and said tubular extension and is released as said core orientation indicating means slides toward said main body prior to reaching said trigger point.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">Preferably said shroud and said one or more orientation elements are relatively dimensioned so that when said detent means is released said shaft moves axially in an uphole direction by a distance sufficient so that said orientation elements are wholly located within said shroud.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">Preferably said core orientation indicating means includes a bottom orientator having a plurality of orientation balls and a plurality of races about which individual orientation balls can run, each race formed by two opposing race surfaces which are adapted to move relative to each other between a free run position where said race surfaces are spaced sufficiently apart to allow an orientation ball therebetween to run freely, and a clamp position wherein two adjacent race surfaces clamp an orientation ball therebetween to prevent said orientation ball from free running about said race.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Preferably said race surfaces are moved between said free run position and said clamp position by said second bias means upon release of said detent means.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">Preferably one or more of said race surfaces are formed of a material which is sufficiently soft so that when said race surfaces are in said clamp position an orientation ball therebetween indents said race surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">Preferably said races include at least one annular disc slidably mounted on said shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">Preferably said bottom orientation includes three orientation balls and said races include two annular discs slidably mounted on said shaft and respective uphole and downhole end race surfaces supported on said shaft between which said annular discs are located, wherein said downhole end race surface is fixed to a downhole side of said shaft and said uphole end race surface is slidably mounted on said shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">Preferably said orientation device further includes an inclinometer disposed within said main body for providing an indication of inclination of said orientation device when said core orientation indicating means is in contact with said facing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">Preferably said inclinometer is in the form of a rotatable wheel and, said shaft is moved toward said wheel to prevent rotation thereof when said detent means is released.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Preferably said wheel is mounted to rotate about first and second mutually perpendicular axes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Preferably said wheel is provided with a pair of ball bearings on opposite sides of an axis of said wheel and said inclinometer further includes a circular race within which said ball bearings can run, said circular race having an axis coincident with a longitudinal axis of said main body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">In an alternate embodiment said shaft is rotatably held within said tubular extension whereby said shaft can rotate about its longitudinal axis relative to said shroud.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">In this embodiment said orientation device includes a deadweight disposed in said main body and coupled to said shaft to rotate said shaft about its longitudinal axis by action of gravity to provide a bottom of hole reference. As bottom orientation is achieved by the combination of rotatably mounting the shaft and the provision of the deadweight, this embodiment provides an alternate to the use of the ball and race type bottom orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a brake system for a tool travelling within a tubular element having an inner circumferential surface, said brake system including:

    </ul>
    </li>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> of the accompanying drawings, an embodiment of the orientation device <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention includes a main body <b>12</b> provided with a latching system <b>14</b> which includes first latches <b>16</b> and second latches <b>18</b>. (As described in greater detail hereinafter, the second latches <b>18</b> are in the form of a braking system). The latching system <b>14</b> operates to releasably latch the device <b>10</b> to a core lifter case assembly <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which incorporates a core lifter coupled to a core tube <b>22</b> of a core drill <b>24</b> used for cutting a core sample of the ground. The core lifter case assembly <b>20</b>, core tube <b>22</b>, and core drill <b>24</b> are of conventional construction and do not of themselves form part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">A core orientation indicating means (hereinafter referred to as “core orientator”) <b>26</b> is slidably coupled to the main body <b>12</b>. The core orientator <b>26</b> provides an orientation reference for the core sample cut by the core drill <b>24</b> by action of the core orientator <b>26</b> contacting the toe (i.e. bottom facing surface) of the hole being drilled prior to the commencement of drilling, i.e. the rotation of the core drill <b>24</b>. The core orientator <b>26</b> is associated with the latching system <b>14</b> so that upon sliding of the core orientator relative to the main body <b>12</b> beyond a trigger point, the core orientation <b>26</b> disengages the latching system <b>14</b> from the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b> so that the orientation device <b>10</b> is retracted into the core tube <b>22</b> by an advancing core which is cut after commencement of drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The orientation device <b>26</b> includes two main components, a VAN RUTH style face orientator <b>28</b> which provides a plurality of reference points conforming with an end face of the core sample being cut and, a bottom orientator <b>30</b> which provides a reference line corresponding to the bottom of the hole cut by the core drill <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">The face orientator <b>28</b> includes a plurality of circumferentially arranged orientation elements in the form of pins <b>32</b> which are retained and can slide in respective holes <b>36</b> formed in a core block <b>34</b>. Each of the pins <b>32</b> is formed with an enlarged head <b>38</b> which is dimensioned so that it can not pass out from a lower end of a corresponding hole <b>36</b>. The core block <b>34</b> is further provided with a circumferential cut-out <b>40</b> inboard of a downhole end <b>42</b> of a core block <b>34</b>. A plurality of rubber O-rings <b>44</b> is seated in the cut-out <b>40</b> about the pins <b>32</b> and act as a brake holding the pins <b>32</b> in position in the absence of a force applied along the length of the pins <b>32</b>. The core block <b>34</b> is further provided with an axial hole <b>46</b> which opens on to the downhole end <b>42</b>. The hole <b>46</b> accommodates a screw <b>48</b> which couples the core block <b>34</b> to a shaft <b>50</b> of the device <b>10</b>. Retained between a head <b>50</b> of the screw <b>48</b> and the toe of the hole <b>46</b> is a core block spring <b>52</b> which acts to bias the core block <b>34</b> toward the shaft <b>50</b>. However, by virtue of this coupling, the core block <b>34</b> can be pulled against the bias of spring <b>52</b> to space it from the shaft <b>50</b>. A locating pin <b>54</b> extends partially into holes <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> formed in the core block <b>34</b> and shaft <b>50</b> respectively to fix the rotational position of the core block <b>34</b> to the shaft <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">The bottom orientator <b>30</b> includes a plurality (in this instance 3) balls <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>and <b>60</b><i>c </i>(hereinafter referred to in general as “balls <b>60</b>”) disposed within respective races <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>62</b><i>c </i>respectively (hereinafter referred to in general as “races <b>62</b>”). The races <b>62</b> comprise two annular discs <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b </i>which are slidably mounted on the shaft <b>50</b>, a cap <b>66</b> also slidably mounted on the shaft <b>50</b> on an uphole side of the discs <b>64</b>, and an end stop <b>68</b> fixed to the shaft <b>50</b> on a downhole side of the discs <b>64</b>. Race <b>62</b><i>a </i>is defined between a race surface <b>70</b><i>a </i>formed on the end stop <b>68</b> and adjacent face <b>70</b><i>b </i>of disc <b>64</b><i>a</i>. Race <b>62</b><i>b </i>is defined between a race surface <b>70</b><i>b </i>on an opposite side of the disc <b>62</b><i>a</i>, and facing race surface <b>70</b><i>c </i>on disc <b>62</b><i>b</i>; while the race <b>62</b><i>c </i>is defined between race surface <b>70</b><i>e </i>on an opposite side of the disc <b>64</b><i>b </i>and a facing race surface <b>70</b><i>f </i>on the cap <b>66</b>. Bias means such as annular spacing rubbers <b>73</b> are disposed between the mutually facing race surfaces <b>70</b>. (However, it is to be understood that the rubbers can be replaced with other bias means such as springs.)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">O-ring seals <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> are located in corresponding circumferential grooves formed on an outer circumferential surface of the end stop <b>68</b> and cap <b>66</b> respectively. The cap <b>66</b> is also provided with a groove <b>76</b> formed about its inner circumferential surface for seating an O-ring <b>78</b> which bears against the outer surface of the shaft <b>50</b>. A bush <b>80</b> is fixed to the shaft <b>50</b> on a side of the cap <b>66</b> opposite the end stop <b>68</b> by a bush pin <b>82</b>. The races <b>62</b> and in particular, annular discs <b>64</b> and spacing rubbers <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> are enclosed by a sleeve <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">Due to the construction of the bottom orientator <b>30</b>, it will be appreciated that the width of the races <b>62</b> and thus the distance between opposing race surfaces <b>70</b> can be changed. More particularly, the race surfaces can be moved between a free run position where the surfaces <b>70</b> are spaced sufficiently apart to allow the balls <b>60</b> disposed therebetween to freely run within the race <b>62</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>) and a clamp position where the ball <b>60</b> disposed between a pair of opposing race surfaces <b>70</b> is clamped by the surfaces thereby preventing it from rolling about the corresponding race <b>62</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">The orientation device <b>26</b> further includes a shroud <b>86</b> within which the face orientator <b>28</b> and bottom orientator <b>30</b> are disposed, and can retract into when the core drill <b>24</b> is lowered onto the bottom of a hole.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">The shroud <b>86</b> is slidably retained by the body <b>12</b> via a locking housing <b>88</b> to which the shroud <b>86</b> is threadingly coupled. The locking housing <b>88</b> includes a generally tubular extension <b>90</b> which extends into the main body <b>12</b>. The extension <b>90</b> is provided with an axial hole <b>92</b> through which the shaft <b>50</b> extends. A recess <b>94</b> is formed on a side of the locking housing <b>88</b> enclosed by the shroud <b>86</b> for seating the bush <b>80</b>. An outer surface of the extension <b>90</b> includes a first portion <b>96</b> at a downhole end of constant diameter followed by a contiguous and relatively short portion <b>98</b> of lineally increasing outer diameter leading to a further portion <b>100</b> of constant diameter which terminates in a radially outward step <b>102</b> followed by a short portion <b>104</b> of constant diameter then a radially inward step <b>106</b> leading to a final portion <b>108</b> of constant diameter. A plurality of holes <b>110</b> is formed in the portion <b>108</b> near, but inboard of a free end of the portion <b>108</b>. The holes <b>110</b> seat respective trigger balls <b>112</b>. The combination of the portion <b>100</b> and step <b>102</b> on the outer surface of the extension <b>90</b> form a latch seat <b>114</b> for the latches <b>16</b>. A circumferential groove <b>116</b> is formed in the locking housing <b>88</b> for seating an O-ring <b>118</b> that bears against the outer surface of the shaft <b>50</b> passing through the hole <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">An end of the shaft <b>50</b> which is disposed within the hole <b>92</b> is formed with a blind axial hole <b>120</b> in which is disposed an inclinometer lock spring <b>122</b>. The spring <b>122</b> is held within the hole <b>120</b> by a inclinometer lock pin <b>124</b> that partially extends into the hole <b>120</b> and partially extends from the free end of the shaft <b>50</b>. The inclinometer lock pin <b>124</b> is formed with an elongated hole or slot <b>126</b> through which a trigger seat pin <b>128</b> passes coupling the inclinometer lock pin <b>124</b> to the shaft <b>50</b>. The trigger lock pin <b>128</b> further extends on opposite sides into a trigger ball seat <b>130</b> which is disposed over the free end of the shaft <b>50</b> and through which the inclinometer lock pin <b>124</b> extends.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">A shaft spring <b>132</b> is disposed about the shaft <b>50</b> within the hole <b>92</b> and bears against the trigger ball seat <b>130</b>. The spring <b>132</b> acts to bias the shaft <b>50</b> to move it in an uphole direction relative to the locking housing <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">A locking spring <b>134</b> is located between the body <b>12</b> and portion <b>108</b> of the extension <b>90</b>. The spring <b>134</b> bears at one end against the step <b>106</b> and at an opposite end against a radial surface <b>136</b> formed internally of the body <b>12</b>. The spring <b>134</b> biases the locking housing <b>88</b> in a downhole direction relative to the body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">The latches <b>16</b> are pivotally mounted on pivot pins <b>138</b> to the main body <b>12</b> and extend through windows <b>140</b> formed in the body <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">The latch or brake system <b>18</b> includes a plurality of anchor balls <b>142</b> which are retained by a anchor ball sleeve <b>144</b> disposed about a tail section <b>146</b> of the main body <b>12</b>. In this regard, the sleeve <b>144</b> is provided with a plurality of holes <b>148</b> of a diameter less than the diameter of the balls <b>142</b> through which the balls <b>142</b> can protrude but not fall out. The braking system further includes a braking surface <b>150</b> formed about the tail section <b>146</b>. The braking surface <b>150</b> is formed with a gradually increasing outer diameter in a uphole direction, i.e. a direction away from the locking housing <b>88</b>. A further surface <b>152</b> is formed about the tail section <b>146</b> adjacent the braking surface <b>50</b> but of a smaller outer diameter. The two surfaces <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are joined by a short tapered surface <b>154</b>. An anchor ball spring <b>156</b> is disposed about the tail section of the body <b>12</b> and has one end seated against a shoulder <b>158</b> formed in the body <b>12</b> and an opposite end disposed within-he sleeve <b>144</b> and bearing against the anchor balls <b>142</b>. The spring <b>156</b> acts to bias the anchor balls <b>142</b> along the braking surface <b>150</b> in the uphole direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">The anchor balls <b>142</b> and braking surface <b>150</b> are dimensioned so that the balls <b>142</b> can ride along the braking surface <b>150</b> to wedge against an inner surface of the core tube <b>22</b> to produce a braking effect. More particularly, when the device <b>10</b> is travelling in a downhole direction within the core drill <b>24</b> the trigger balls <b>142</b> lock the device <b>10</b> to the core tube <b>22</b> preventing it from moving in the downhole direction and in particular falling out of the end of the core drill <b>24</b>. Further, by appropriate selection of the spring <b>156</b>, the braking system <b>18</b> also provides a braking effect against motion of the tool in an opposite direction. The degree of braking effect is dependent on the spring constant of the spring <b>156</b>. This braking effect is particularly useful when the device <b>10</b>, or another tool to which a similar braking system is applied is used in an uphole configuration to reduce the speed of the device <b>10</b> or other tool when travelling back under the influence of gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">An inclinometer <b>160</b> provided in the tail section <b>146</b> of the body <b>12</b>. The inclinometer <b>160</b> is in the form of a wheel <b>162</b> which is rotatably mounted about two mutually perpendicular axes <b>164</b> and <b>166</b>. The wheel <b>162</b> provided on its outer circumferential surface with a scale <b>168</b> providing an indication of the degree of inclination of the device <b>10</b> relative to a horizontal plane. The wheel <b>162</b> is weighted so that when it lies in a horizontal plane, a 0° marking lies in the horizontal plane. The wheel <b>162</b> is mounted within a circular bearing race <b>170</b> formed internally of the tail section <b>146</b>. Ball bearings <b>172</b> are coupled to the wheel <b>162</b> at opposite ends of the axis of the wheel <b>162</b> which coincides with the axis <b>164</b>. In view of this mounting arrangement, it will be appreciated that the wheel <b>162</b> can rotate about the axis <b>164</b> and also rotate about the axis <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">The inside surface of the body <b>12</b>, in the tail section <b>146</b> is formed with a surface <b>174</b> of constant diameter against which the trigger balls <b>112</b> can bear. The surface <b>174</b> leads in an uphole direction to an increased inner diameter portion <b>176</b>. The combination of the trigger balls <b>112</b>, surface <b>174</b> and trigger ball seat <b>130</b> form a detent <b>133</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">The operation of the device <b>10</b> will now be described in detail with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">The device <b>10</b> is initially manipulated so that the pins <b>32</b> are pulled to their maximum extent from the core block <b>34</b>, the shroud <b>86</b> and locking housing pulled to their maximum extent from the body <b>12</b> and the shaft <b>50</b> pulled to its maximum extent from the shroud <b>86</b>. In this configuration, the latches <b>16</b> are seated on the latch seats <b>114</b> and abut the step <b>102</b> and, the trigger balls <b>122</b> are held between the surface <b>174</b> and trigger ball seat <b>130</b>. Thus the spring <b>132</b> is held in relative compression and the races <b>62</b> are in their free run position allowing the balls <b>60</b> to move about the respective races <b>62</b> under the influence of gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">The device <b>10</b> is then inserted into the core tube <b>22</b> from the end provided with the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b> with the tail section <b>146</b> first. This insertion is halted when the latches <b>16</b> engage the end of the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. With the core drill <b>24</b> held in vertical or sub-vertical orientation, the device <b>10</b> is prevented from falling out of the core tube <b>22</b> (and thus core drill <b>24</b>) by action of the braking system <b>18</b>. In particular, the anchor balls <b>142</b> are effectively wedged between the inside surface of the core tube <b>22</b> and the braking surface <b>150</b> by the combined action of the spring <b>156</b> and the weight of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">The core tube <b>22</b> is then lowered into a core drill <b>24</b> in a conventional manner. Initially, the drill <b>24</b> is held above the toe of the hole a sufficient distance so that when the core tube <b>22</b> is properly located and seated within the core drill <b>24</b>, the pins <b>32</b> are spaced from the toe of the hole. A drill operator then lowers the drill <b>24</b> onto the toe of the hole. It will be appreciated that as the races <b>62</b> are in their free run position, the balls <b>60</b> will roll by action of gravity to a location where they lie lowermost within the races.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">As the drill is lowered on to the toe of the hole, the pins <b>32</b> contact the face or surface of the hole. This surface constitutes the upper surface of a core sample to be drilled with the core drill <b>24</b>. The pins <b>32</b> slide into the holes <b>36</b> of the core block <b>34</b> against resistance of the O-rings <b>44</b> providing profile reference points conforming to the configuration of the face of the core sample. The pins <b>32</b> maintain their relative position by virtue of the frictional forces applied by the O-rings <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">As the core drill <b>24</b> is progressively lowered into the hole, a front end of the shroud <b>86</b> eventually contacts the toe of the hole. Accordingly, the weight of the core drill <b>24</b> is now loaded onto the shroud <b>86</b>. This causes the shroud <b>86</b> to move axially toward the body <b>12</b> with the extension <b>90</b> sliding into the body <b>12</b>. This relative motion results in the latch seat <b>114</b> being progressively slid away from the latches <b>16</b>, and the trigger balls <b>112</b> being rolled along the surface <b>174</b> and eventually into the increased diameter section <b>176</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">When the trigger balls <b>112</b> reach the section <b>176</b> they are able to move radially outwardly moving out of the trigger ball seat <b>130</b>. In consequence, the spring <b>132</b> forces the shaft <b>50</b> to slide axially into the body <b>12</b>. This in turn forces the cap <b>66</b> against the locking housing <b>88</b> compressing the spacing rubbers <b>73</b> and squeezing the races <b>62</b> together to their clamp position where the orientation balls <b>60</b> are clamped against adjacent race surfaces <b>70</b>. (The screw <b>48</b> and spring <b>52</b> allows the shaft <b>50</b> to retract further into the extension <b>90</b> by action of the spring <b>132</b> to place the race surfaces <b>70</b> in the clamp position). Accordingly, the position of the balls <b>60</b> when clamped provides an indication of the location of the lowest part of the hole from which a core sample being drilled by the core drill <b>24</b> is derived. Assuming perfect operation each of the three balls <b>60</b> will lie along a common straight line. However by providing three balls <b>60</b> a hitherto unattainable degree of confidence in alignment accuracy assurance is provided. If one of the races <b>62</b>/balls <b>60</b> does not function correctly the remaining two balls will lie on a line indicative of the bottom of the hole. If all three balls are out of alignment then an operator can be very confident that the bottom of the hole orientation is unreliable and should be disregarded. In prior art one ball systems an operator is never completely sure that a bottom hole orientation indicated is accurate. Further, at this time, the inclinometer lock pin <b>124</b> advance toward and contact the wheel <b>162</b> preventing it from further rotation by outer axis <b>164</b> to provide an indication of the inclination of the device <b>10</b> at a point shortly prior to the commencement of cutting of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it will be seen that as the core drill <b>24</b> is further lowered towards the toe of the hole, the extension <b>90</b> is pushed further into the body <b>12</b> against the bias of spring <b>134</b> to a position where the latching seat <b>114</b> is moved from underneath the latches <b>16</b> allowing them to rotate radially inwardly about respective pins <b>138</b>. This radially inward movement is further facilitated by provision of complimentary tapered surfaces on the latches <b>16</b> and the lifter case <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">With the latches <b>16</b> now disengaged from the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b>, the further lowering of the core drill <b>24</b> into the bottom of the hole results in the entirety of the orientation device <b>10</b> sliding in an uphole direction within the core tube <b>22</b>. The brake <b>18</b> does not prevent such motion as the anchor balls <b>142</b> are able to be simply rolled along the braking surface <b>150</b>/or surfaces <b>154</b> and <b>152</b> to a position where they do not wedge against the inside surface of the core tube <b>22</b>. This is further facilitated by virtue of the spring <b>156</b> not being able to resist the weight of the core drill <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">Just prior to the core drill <b>24</b> touching the toe of the hole, a drill operator commences operation of the drill <b>24</b> causing it to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The core drill <b>24</b> can now cut a core sample of the ground. As the core sample is cut, it advances into the core drill <b>24</b> entering the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b> and core tube <b>22</b>. This pushes the orientation device <b>10</b> further in the uphole direction within the core tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">Once a length of core has been cut, the core drill <b>24</b> is stopped and lifted from the bottom of the hole. In this action, in the event that the core has not previously broken away from the ground from which it is cut, the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b> acts in a conventional manner gripping the core so that a tensile force can be applied to the core as the drill <b>24</b> is lifted from the ground thereby braking the core sample. The core tube <b>22</b> can then be retrieved in a conventional manner leaving the drill <b>24</b> in situ in the hole. The device <b>10</b> is retrieved with the core tube <b>22</b>. The device <b>10</b> can then be removed from the core tube <b>22</b> together with the core sample. Since the face orientator <b>28</b> is disposed within the shroud <b>86</b>, the configuration of the pins <b>32</b> is maintained and can then be matched against the face of the core sample. Further, the orientation balls <b>60</b> are clamped by action of the spring <b>132</b> providing indication of the position of the bottom of the hole. This then allows the orientation of the core sample to be uniquely defined. Further, the inclinometer <b>60</b> provides an indication of the inclination of the core sample cut from the ground. Particularly, the inclinometer reading may be taken by unscrewing a cap <b>165</b> inserting a sighting lens to the tail section <b>146</b> to view the scale <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">From the above description it will be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention are able to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies in the prior art because the orientation of the core is effectively “marked” prior to commencement of drilling and thus there is no need for a positive core break to retain the core orientation information, or to trip a separate tool to obtain the hole inclination. The device <b>10</b> is simply tripped with the core tube <b>22</b> rather than requiring separate tripping.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">The core block <b>34</b> can be removed by unscrewing the screw <b>48</b> so as to be held as a permanent record of core orientation with the core sample. To this end the outside of the core block or the core sample itself should be marked with a line in alignment with the balls <b>60</b>. Further, in such an instance it is preferable if the core block <b>34</b> is made of a relatively cheap material such as plastics material.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">A further embodiment of the core orientation device is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> in which features the same, similar or perform equivalent functions as in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> are denoted by the same reference numbers but with the inclusion of a superscripted prime (′) symbol. The core orientator <b>10</b>′ and core tube <b>22</b>′ are depicted within a core drill <b>24</b>′ includes at a downhole end a reamer <b>113</b> and core drill bit <b>115</b>. A stabilising ring <b>117</b> is also depicted coupled between the drive within the core drill <b>24</b>′. The core drill <b>24</b>′, reamer <b>113</b>, drill bit <b>115</b> and stabilising ring <b>117</b> are of conventional construction and do not form part of the embodiment of the orientator <b>10</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">The main differences between the orientators <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ are summarised as follows. The body <b>12</b>′ has a forward section <b>143</b> housing the locking spring <b>134</b>′ and provided with windows <b>140</b>′ all of which are of substantially similar configuration to the corresponding portion of the body <b>12</b> of the first embodiment. The body portion <b>12</b>′ also includes a tail section <b>146</b>′ provided with the surfaces <b>174</b>′ and <b>176</b>′ which, together with the trigger balls <b>112</b>′ and trigger ball seat <b>130</b>′ form detent <b>133</b>′. However, the forward section <b>143</b>′ and tail section <b>146</b>′ of the body <b>12</b>′ are spaced by an integral tubular section <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">The tail section <b>146</b>′ houses a deadweight <b>147</b> which is attached to the shaft <b>50</b>′ by a coupling <b>149</b> and pin <b>151</b>. The deadweight <b>147</b> and coupling <b>149</b> are able to rotate about the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>50</b>′. To this end, the coupling <b>149</b> is mounted in a bearing <b>153</b> having an outer race which is seated against an inner circumferential surface of the tail section <b>146</b>′. The deadweight <b>147</b> is provided with a longitudinal slot <b>155</b> along which the shaft <b>50</b>′ can axially slide.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0083">Inclinometer wheel <b>162</b>′ is attached via an axle <b>157</b> to the deadweight <b>147</b> at an end distant the face orientator <b>28</b>′. Since the deadweight <b>147</b> can rotate about the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>50</b>′ within the tail section <b>146</b>′, the inclinometer wheel <b>162</b>′ is in effect able to rotate about two perpendicular axes in a like manner as the wheel <b>162</b>, these axes being the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>50</b>′ and the axis of axle <b>157</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">The second latches <b>18</b>′ in the orientator <b>10</b>′ are mounted about the intermediate section <b>145</b> of the body <b>12</b>′. The latches <b>18</b> are in the form of pawls <b>159</b> which are pivotally coupled by pins <b>161</b> to the body <b>12</b>′. Each pawl <b>159</b> is provided with a groove <b>163</b> on a radially outer surface for seating a spring <b>165</b>. The spring <b>165</b> biases the pawls <b>159</b> radially outward about pins <b>161</b> to enable abutment against a stop ring <b>167</b> coupled between the core lifter case <b>20</b>′ and core tube <b>22</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">As mentioned above, the shaft <b>50</b>′ is able to rotate about its longitudinal axis in the orientator <b>10</b>′. To assist in facilitating this rotational motion, the shaft <b>50</b>′ is supported by a linear bearing <b>169</b> housed within the tubular extension <b>90</b>′ of the locking housing <b>88</b>′, and a bearing <b>171</b> also housed within the extension <b>90</b>′ but spaced from the linear bearing <b>169</b> and adjacent the trigger ball seat <b>130</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">One end of the shaft spring <b>132</b>′ abuts the linear bearing <b>169</b>. An opposite end of the spring <b>132</b>′ is seated within a cup-shaped member <b>173</b> which is attached to the shaft <b>50</b>′ adjacent the bearing <b>171</b>. It will be further noted that the shaft <b>50</b>′ at an end opposite the face orientator <b>28</b>′ is formed with a bifurcation <b>175</b> through which the pin <b>151</b> extends.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">When the device <b>10</b>′ and corresponding end of the core drill <b>24</b>′ lie in a non-vertical plane, the deadweight <b>147</b> will rotate about the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>50</b>′ to a position where it possesses the least potential energy. That is, the deadweight <b>147</b> will position itself that it lies lower most within the body <b>12</b>′. Since the shaft <b>50</b>′ is attached via the coupling <b>149</b> to the deadweight <b>147</b>, shaft <b>50</b>′ and face orientator <b>28</b>′ are rotated with the deadweight <b>147</b>′. It will be recognised that this functionality is equivalent to that provided by the bottom orientator <b>30</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">The operation of the rotator <b>10</b>′ will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The device <b>10</b>′ is manipulated so that the shaft <b>50</b>′ is pulled to its maximum extent out of the shroud <b>86</b>′ with the pins <b>32</b>′ also pulled out to the maximum extent. In this configuration the trigger balls <b>112</b>′ are held between the trigger ball seat <b>130</b>′ and the surface <b>174</b>′ axially locking the shaft <b>50</b>′ to the shroud <b>86</b>′ and tubular extension <b>90</b>′. The device <b>10</b> is then inserted rearwardly into the core of the case assembly <b>20</b>. The pawls <b>159</b> are able to pivot inwardly about pins <b>161</b> against the bias of spring <b>165</b> past the stop ring <b>167</b>. When in this position, the latches <b>16</b>′ engage the end of the core lifter case as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">With the core drill <b>24</b>′ already in the hole, the core lifter tube <b>22</b> is then lowered through the core drill <b>24</b>′ in a conventional manner. The drill <b>24</b>′ is held above the toe of the hole at sufficient distance so that when the core tube <b>20</b> is properly located within the drill <b>24</b>′, the elements <b>28</b>′ are spaced from the toe of the hole. An operator then lowers the drill <b>24</b>′ to the toe of the hole. During the travel of the device <b>10</b>′ and core tube <b>22</b>′ through the drill <b>24</b>′, the counterweight <b>147</b> will have rotated within the tail section <b>146</b>′ to the lowest point within the housing <b>12</b>′ by action of gravity. This in turn will have rotated the shaft <b>50</b>′ and face orientator <b>28</b>′ to provide a bottom reference for the face orientator <b>28</b>′ and subsequent core cut by the drill <b>24</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">As the drill <b>24</b>′ is lowered onto the facing surface of the toe of the hole, the pins <b>28</b>′ contact the facing surface and are pushed inwardly into the bush <b>34</b>′ to provide profile reference points conforming to the configuration of the face of a core sample to be cut. The pins <b>28</b>′ are maintained in their position by virtue of frictional force existing between the pins <b>28</b>′ and the core block <b>34</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">As the drill <b>24</b>′ advances towards the toe of the hole, eventually the forward axial face of the shroud <b>86</b>′ contacts the facing surface of the hole. Now the weight of the drill <b>24</b>′ is loaded onto the shroud <b>86</b>′. This causes the shroud <b>86</b>′ to move axially toward the body <b>12</b>′ with the extension <b>90</b>′ projecting further into the body <b>12</b>′. As a result the trigger balls <b>112</b>′ eventually roll onto the increased diameter portion <b>176</b>′ of the tail section <b>146</b>′ axially releasing the shaft <b>50</b>′ from the extension <b>90</b>′. This releases the spring <b>132</b>′ which drives the shaft <b>50</b>′ further in an uphole direction into the body <b>12</b>′ so as to eventually contact the inclinometer wheel <b>162</b>′ preventing it from further rotation about the axle <b>157</b> to thus provide an indication of the inclination of the device <b>10</b>′ at a time commensurate with the commencement of cutting of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Eventually, the shroud <b>86</b>′ is pushed to a position where the latching surfaces <b>114</b>′ are slid away from beneath the latches <b>16</b>′ allowing the latches to collapse or pivot inwardly thereby becoming disengaged from the core lifter case assembly <b>20</b>′. Further lowering of the drill <b>24</b>′ onto the bottom of the hole results in the entirety of the device <b>10</b>′ sliding in an uphole direction within the core tube <b>22</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">The drill <b>24</b>′ is then operated in a conventional manner to cut a core. As the core is being cut, it enters the core tube <b>22</b>′ pushing the device <b>10</b>′ further in the uphole direction.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">Once a length of core has been cut, the drill <b>24</b>′ is stopped and lifted from the bottom of the hole. In this action, in the event that the core is not previously broken away from the ground, the lifter case assembly <b>20</b>′ grips the core and a tensile force applied by the lifting of the drill <b>24</b>′ breaks the core from the ground. The core tube <b>22</b>′ is then retrieved in a conventional manner leaving the drill <b>111</b> in situ. The device <b>10</b>′ is retrieved with the core tube <b>22</b>′. The device <b>10</b>′ is then removed from the core tube <b>22</b>′ together with the core sample. As the deadweight <b>147</b> always self-locates to the lowest position within the body <b>12</b>′, by aligning the face of the core with the pins <b>28</b>′, the orientation of the core within the ground can be determined. Further, the inclination of the core sample can be determined by viewing the inclinometer wheel <b>162</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">Prior to cutting the next length, the device <b>10</b>′ is simply reloaded into the core tube <b>22</b>′ and the resulting ensemble then lowered through the drill <b>24</b>′ in a conventional manner and the sequence recommenced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">The braking system <b>18</b> used in the device <b>10</b> can be used in other applications and in particular to prevent loss of running tools and other downhole equipment in the event of failure or accidental release from an overshot and/or wireline. In addition, as previously mentioned, the braking system also assists in reducing the speed of a running tool when returning under the action of gravity within drill string or drill pipe in an uphole orientation. Moreover, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the braking system <b>18</b> can be incorporated into a head assembly <b>200</b> of any form of running tool or downhole device to hold the tool or device within a drill pipe <b>202</b>. The head assembly <b>200</b> includes a conventional spearpoint <b>204</b> which is adapted for coupling to a conventional overshot <b>206</b> provided with overshot latch dogs <b>208</b>. The interaction and operation of the spearpoint <b>204</b> and overshot <b>206</b> is well known to those skilled in the art and not described in any detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">The head assembly <b>200</b> includes a shaft <b>210</b> which is fixed to the spearpoint <b>204</b>. The shaft <b>210</b> is provided along a portion of the length of its outer circumferential surface with a braking surface <b>212</b> which is tapered so as to gradually increase in outer diameter in a direction toward a mouth of a hole into which the drill pipe <b>202</b> is disposed. Braking surface <b>212</b> terminates in a downhole side in a radially outward step <b>214</b> leading to a constant diameter portion <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">A further tapered surface <b>218</b> is provided on the shaft <b>210</b> and tapers in the same direction to the locking surface <b>212</b> so as to increase in outer diameter in an uphole direction. The tapered surface <b>218</b> leads to a constant diameter portion <b>220</b> which engages with the spearpoint <b>204</b>. The shaft <b>210</b> is provided with an enlarged portion <b>222</b> between the surfaces <b>212</b> and <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">An anchor ball sleeve <b>224</b> is slidably retained about the shaft <b>210</b> over the braking surface <b>212</b>. The sleeve <b>224</b> is provided with a plurality of slots <b>226</b> through which anchor balls <b>228</b> can extend. The anchor balls <b>228</b> are located to ride along the braking surface <b>212</b>, the slots <b>226</b> formed of a width less than the diameter of the anchor balls <b>228</b>. A bush <b>230</b> is located about the surface portion <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> that acts as a seat for a spring <b>232</b>. The spring <b>232</b> is further retained by a detente washer <b>234</b> which sits on a spearhead base <b>236</b> which is coupled via a pivot pin <b>238</b> to the downhole end of the shaft <b>210</b>. The spring <b>232</b> biases the anchor balls <b>228</b> to ride along the braking surface <b>212</b> to extend from the slots <b>226</b> to wedge against inner circumferential surface <b>240</b> of the drill pipe <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">The braking system <b>18</b> also includes an automatically releasable brake lock <b>242</b> which acts to ordinarily hold the anchor balls <b>228</b> out of contact with the inner surface <b>240</b> to allow free running of an associated tool within the drill pipe <b>202</b> when attached to a overshot <b>206</b>, but automatically deploys of the anchor bolts <b>228</b> to lock or brake the tool within the drill pipe <b>202</b> when the overshot <b>208</b> is released from the spearpoint <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">The automatically releasable brake lock <b>242</b> includes an overshot extension sleeve <b>244</b>, a cap <b>246</b>, spring <b>248</b>, locking sleeve <b>250</b>, balls <b>252</b> and floating sleeve <b>256</b>. The overshot extension sleeve <b>244</b> is threadingly coupled at one end to the overshot <b>206</b>. The cap <b>246</b> is threadingly coupled to an opposite end of the extension sleeve <b>244</b>. The cap <b>246</b> further slidably engages the locking sleeve <b>250</b>, with the spring <b>248</b> being disposed about the spearpoint <b>204</b> between the end of the extension sleeve <b>244</b> coupled to the overshot <b>206</b> and the locking sleeve <b>250</b>. The locking sleeve <b>250</b> is dimensioned so that it can extend over the balls <b>252</b>. The balls <b>252</b> are retained about the surface <b>218</b> by the floating sleeve <b>256</b> which is provided with apertures <b>258</b> through which the balls <b>252</b> can extend. A further spring <b>260</b> is located within the floating sleeve <b>256</b> and acts between the spearpoint <b>204</b> and the balls <b>252</b> urging the balls <b>252</b> to roll to an end of the surface <b>228</b> with the smallest outer diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">The spearhead base <b>236</b> is provided with a planar end surface <b>262</b> from which extends an outwardly tapered surface <b>264</b> extending at an angle of 45° relative to the surface <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">When the overshot latch dogs <b>208</b> are engaged with the spearpoint <b>204</b>, the spring <b>248</b> urges the locking sleeve <b>250</b> over the balls <b>252</b> preventing them extending radially outwardly from the apertures <b>258</b>. In addition, the floating sleeve <b>256</b> is forced in a downhole direction bearing against the anchor ball sleeve <b>224</b> forcing the anchor balls <b>228</b> against the step <b>214</b> and thus disposed about a portion of the surface <b>212</b> with the smallest outer diameter allowing the balls <b>228</b> to be spaced from the surface <b>240</b>. In this configuration, the tool to which the braking system <b>18</b>′ is attached is able to run freely in any direction within the drive pipe <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">However, if the latch dogs <b>208</b> become detached from the spearpoint <b>204</b> while within the drill pipe <b>202</b>, the brake lock <b>242</b> is automatically released deploying of the anchor balls <b>228</b>. This arises as follows. With the disengagement of the latch dogs <b>208</b>, the extension sleeve <b>244</b> which is attached to the overshot <b>206</b> holds the locking sleeve <b>250</b> as the spearpoint <b>204</b> and remainder of the assembly <b>200</b> starts to fall dragging the locking sleeve <b>250</b> with it. Thus in effect the locking sleeve <b>250</b> is pulled away from the balls <b>252</b>. The balls <b>252</b> are now free to move radially outwardly as they roll along the surface <b>218</b> toward the spearpoint <b>204</b> by action of the spring <b>232</b>. In this regard, the spring <b>232</b> urges the anchor ball sleeve <b>242</b> and thus the floating sleeve <b>256</b> toward the spearpoint <b>204</b>. With the locking sleeve <b>250</b> retracted, the floating sleeve <b>256</b> can then roll the balls along the surface <b>218</b> against the bias of the spring <b>260</b>. Simultaneously, the spring <b>232</b> urges the anchor balls <b>228</b> to roll along the braking surface <b>212</b> which, due to its increasing outer diameter results in the balls <b>228</b> extending from the holes <b>226</b> and into contact with the surface <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">Assuming for the time being that the drill pipe <b>202</b> is disposed in a downhole (as distinct from an uphole) the weight of the tool to which the braking system <b>18</b>′ is attached together with the action of the spring <b>232</b> will effectively wedge the anchor balls <b>228</b> between the surfaces <b>212</b> and <b>240</b> to lock the tool to the drill pipe <b>202</b>. Now, a fresh overshot <b>208</b> can be lowered into the hole to engage the spearpoint <b>204</b>. As the overshot is now retrieved by a wireline, it pulls the spearpoint <b>204</b> and shaft <b>210</b> in an uphole direction causing it to slide relative to the anchor ball sleeve <b>224</b>. As this occurs, the balls <b>228</b> are able to roll along the braking surface <b>212</b> toward the step <b>214</b> thereby releasing the balls <b>228</b> from engagement with the surface <b>240</b>. Simultaneously, the floating sleeve <b>256</b> and locking sleeve <b>250</b> are caused to slide relative to the shaft <b>210</b> back to the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> so that the balls <b>252</b> effectively lock the anchor balls <b>228</b> from engagement with the surface <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">In the event of an uphole application, the spring <b>232</b> can be provided with an appropriate spring constant so as to urge the balls <b>228</b> into engagement with the surface <b>240</b> to provide a braking effect as distinct from wedging against the surface <b>240</b> to lock an associated tool into the drill pipe <b>202</b>. This difference in operation is due to the fact that gravity now acts in a direction which tends to roll the balls <b>228</b> along the braking surface <b>212</b> toward the step <b>214</b> where the balls are out of engagement with the surface <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">This then provides a manner for controlling the rate of descent of a tool in an uphole disposed drill pipe, which would otherwise free fall and smash against the head of the drill pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">Now that embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts that numerous modifications and variations may be made without departing from the basic inventive concepts. For example, the face orientator <b>28</b>,<b>28</b>′ is depicted as a VAN RUTH style orientator. However this may be replaced by other marking systems including, for example, a pad of malleable material which can take an impression of the facing surface of the toe of the hole, or even simply a marker which can mark the core such as a China graph pencil. Further, a combination of pins <b>32</b> and markers may be used extending from the same core block <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">In addition, if desired, a core tube extension can be coupled between the core tube <b>22</b>,<b>22</b>′ and a conventional back end for the purposes of receiving the device <b>10</b>,<b>10</b>′ during a core run. The extension is in the form of a tube of the same length as the device <b>10</b>,<b>10</b>′ and may be provided with an internal shoulder or stop to provide an abutment surface for a portion of the shroud <b>86</b> or housing <b>88</b> located at a position so that when the abutment engages the shroud <b>86</b> or housing <b>88</b> the entirety of the device <b>10</b>′ is located within the core tube extension. This ensures that the core tube <b>22</b> is left entirely for receipt of the core being cut and also provides protection of the device <b>10</b>,<b>10</b>′ in the event of over drilling of the core. In this instance, the core would abut against the face of the shroud <b>86</b> which is made of thickened material. Further, due to the abutment of the shroud <b>86</b> and/or housing <b>88</b> with the core extension tube, any load applied by over drilling of the core would essentially be borne on the shroud <b>86</b>/housing <b>88</b> and core extension tube, rather than being transmitted to the remainder of the device <b>10</b>,<b>10</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">All such variations and modifications are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention the nature of which is to be determined from the above description and the appended claims.</p>
