<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention pertains to methods and systems for electronic component test time improvement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Production testing involves the individual testing of large numbers of parts to determine if they function acceptably. Each test that is performed on a part exacts a cost in terms of time expenditure. The time expenditure for each part, or component of a part is multiplied over large numbers of parts and thus can be very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Production testing of integrated circuits includes the evaluation of several different integrated circuit parts. One such part that must be evaluated is the control circuit timer. Timers are used in the control circuitry of most integrated circuits, e.g., power amplifiers. A conventional timer <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, timer <b>100</b> divides a clock of frequency f<sub>0 </sub>into a clock of frequency f<sub>0</sub>/2<sup>N </sup>that is produced at an output of timer <b>100</b> in order to generate a delay. Such timers can be used to delay the power-up or the power-down of the power amplifier to allow noise associated with power-up and power-down to settle so as to facilitate “click-less” and “pop-less” performance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Controlled delays provided by control circuit timers can range from milliseconds to seconds or greater. Although these wait times are beneficial as a means of facilitating click-less and pop-less performance during normal operation they add a substantial measure of time to the time that is needed to evaluate each part that is tested during the final production test. These wait times, that are expended on each part, constitute production time expenditures that are very costly in terms of time and expense. Such time consuming operation is highly undesirable in the production test environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, a need exists for a method and system that can help to speed electronic component test time in the production test environment. The present invention provides a method and system that accomplishes this need.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a timer circuit that has a normal mode and a test mode is disclosed. The test mode includes a power-up phase and a power-down phase. The timer circuit includes an oscillator and a first timer circuit portion coupled to the oscillator. The first timer circuit portion includes an input and an output. An output signal that confirms either the satisfactory or unsatisfactory operation of the first timer circuit portion is taken from the output associated with the first timer circuit portion in the power-up phase. The timer circuit further includes a second timer circuit portion coupled to the first timer circuit portion and the oscillator. In the test mode, the output of the oscillator is forwarded to the input of the second timer circuit portion; and in normal mode, the output of the first timer circuit portion is forwarded to the input of the second timer circuit portion. The second timer circuit portion also includes an input and an output. An output signal that confirms either the satisfactory or unsatisfactory operation of the second timer circuit portion is taken from the output associated with the second timer circuit portion in the power-down phase.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, respective portions of a timer circuit are tested during respective phases of a production test such that a testing of the entire timer circuit is effected in a single power-up/power-down cycle of the production test, and time expenditures related to a testing of the entire timer completely in each single phase of the production test is avoided. In one embodiment, only a first portion of the timer circuit is tested in a power-up phase of a testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both a first and a second portion of the timer circuit in the power-up phase of the testing cycle. Likewise, only a second portion of the timer circuit is tested in a power-down phase of the testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both the first and the second portion of the timer circuit in the power-down phase of the testing cycle. By testing only a first portion of timer circuit in the power-up phase and only a second portion of timer circuit in the power-down phase, a testing of the entire timer circuit can be effected while significant time expenditures can be avoided in each phase of the testing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other advantages of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after having read the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments which are illustrated in the drawing figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with these embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">System for Electronic Component Test Time Improvement in Accordance with Embodiments of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a block diagram <b>200</b> of a system for testing the operation of a timer circuit of an electronic component (e.g., power amplifier <b>203</b>) according to one embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, respective portions of a timer circuit <b>203</b>B are tested during respective phases of a production test such that a testing of the entire timer circuit is effected in a single power-up/power-down cycle of the production test, and time expenditures related to a testing of the entire timer completely in each single phase of the production test is avoided. In one embodiment, testing system <b>201</b> tests only a first portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in a power-up phase of a testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both a first and a second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in the power-up phase of the testing cycle. Likewise, testing system tests only a second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in a power-down phase of the testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both the first and the second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in the power-down phase of the testing cycle. By testing only a first portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in the startup phase and only a second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in the power-down phase, a testing of the entire timer circuit can be effected while significant time expenditures can be avoided in each phase of the testing cycle. It should be appreciated that since the value of the supply current in the power-down phase is an extremely important specification of battery powered electronic systems and need to be tested, allocating the testing of parts of timer circuit <b>203</b>B between power-up and power-down phases is convenient as it is accommodated by test phases that are already a part of existing production test processes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> embodiment, power amplifier <b>203</b> includes amplifier circuit <b>203</b>A and timer circuit <b>203</b>B. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, power-up/power-down test control system <b>201</b>A is employed to trigger the powering up and powering down of power amplifier <b>203</b>. And, performance analysis system <b>201</b>B receives outputs from timer circuit <b>203</b>B that can be used to confirm the acceptable function of timer circuit <b>203</b>B. In one embodiment, in a power-up phase of testing the timer circuit <b>203</b>B output is taken from a first output that corresponds to a first portion of the timer circuit, and, in a power-down phase of testing, the timer circuit <b>203</b>B output is taken from a second output that corresponds to another portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B as is discussed in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, power amplifier <b>203</b> is tested by testing system <b>201</b> to determine if power amplifier <b>203</b> meets acceptable performance standards. In one embodiment, the performance of power amplifier <b>203</b> is assessed during both power-up and power-down phases of a test cycle. As a part of such testing, the performance of various components of power amplifier <b>203</b>, such as timer circuit <b>203</b>B are tested, as is discussed in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, power amplifier <b>203</b> can be packaged in a commercial integrated circuit package arrangement and does not require the use of additional pins (to trigger testing of timer circuit <b>203</b>B). It should be appreciated that during production testing, existing power amplifier input and output pins can be used to initiate the power-up and power-down phases of the test and to obtain desired output signals. In one embodiment, power amplifier <b>203</b> can be operated in both test and normal modes. In test mode, the power-up and power-down delays are provided by either a first or a second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B (but not both) and thus are abridged. By contrast, in normal mode, the power-up and power-down delays are provided by both portions of timer circuit <b>203</b>B and thus the full delay of timer circuit <b>203</b>B is generated. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> embodiment, power amplifier <b>203</b> includes amplifier circuit <b>203</b>A and timer circuit <b>203</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be a part of the control circuit of power amplifier <b>203</b>. Moreover, timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be employed to generate a delay that can minimize or eliminate audible noise (e.g., pop) by delaying power-up or power-down cycles. In one embodiment, the timer has two modes of operation: (1) test mode and (2) normal mode. In test mode a generated delay is provided by only a portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B and thus the delay is abridged. In normal mode delay is provided by the entire timer circuit <b>203</b>B and thus is longer. In production test it is advantageous to avoid the longer delay that is generated by timer circuit <b>203</b>B in normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, timer circuit <b>203</b>B has two distinct portions, and outputs that correspond to each portion (see discussion made with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In test mode, upon power-up an output that provides an indication of the proper function of the first portion of timing circuit <b>203</b>B is taken from a first output that is associated with the first portion of timing circuit <b>203</b>B. And, upon powering down, an output that provides an indication of the proper function of the second portion of timing circuit <b>203</b>B is taken from the second output that is associated with the second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> are diagrams that illustrate the operation of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in normal and test mode respectively according to one embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates the operation of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in normal mode. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, starting from a power-up state <b>251</b>, when the power amplifier is prompted to shutdown in normal mode, a timer circuit, e.g., <b>203</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, causes the actual shutdown of the power amplifier to be delayed, for instance, by 1 second, shown at state <b>253</b>, which is the full delay provided by the timer circuit, e.g., <b>203</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Thereafter, power amplifier is powered-down at state <b>255</b>. Subsequently, when the power amplifier is prompted to power-up, a timer circuit, e.g., <b>203</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> causes delay to the full functionality of the power amplifier, for instance, by 1 second, as shown at state <b>257</b>. Thereafter, power amplifier, e.g., <b>203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is powered-up at state <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates the operation of timer circuit <b>203</b>B in test mode. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, starting from a power-up state <b>251</b>, when the power amplifier is prompted to shutdown, timer circuit <b>203</b>B is prompted to forego the normal mode full delay (e.g., 1 second in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> example above), at <b>253</b>, and to cause a shorter delay as is shown at <b>259</b>, for instance 20 ms. Thereafter, power amplifier <b>203</b> is powered down at state <b>255</b>. Subsequently, when the power amplifier <b>203</b> is prompted to power-up, the timer circuit <b>203</b>B is prompted to again forego the normal mode full delay, at <b>257</b>, and to cause a shorter delay, for instance 40 ms, as is shown at <b>261</b>. Thereafter, the power amplifier <b>203</b> is powered up at state <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the timer circuit can be implemented as a part of a programmable circuit. In such embodiments, the length of the delays that are discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> can be programmed and changed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows components of an exemplary timer circuit <b>203</b>B according to one embodiment of the present invention. In exemplary embodiments, timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be included as a part of the control circuit of power amplifier <b>203</b> as is discussed above. In one embodiment, timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be employed to generate a delay that can minimize or eliminate audible noise (e.g., pop) associated with power-up and power-down of a device such as a power amplifier by delaying power-up or power-down. During a production test both power-up and power-down operations of timer circuit <b>203</b>B are tested, and thus the power-up and power-down delays can add significant time to testing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, test mode delay is provided in the power-up and power-down phases of the production test by respective portions of timer circuit <b>203</b>B. Thus, in test mode, the generated delay is shortened or abridged for both the power-up phase and the power-down phase of the testing of timer circuit <b>203</b>B as is discussed herein. In a production test that involves tens of thousands of power amplifiers that need to be powered up and down, the time, and cost savings realized due to the shortened delay effected in the power-up and power-down phases can be very significant.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is important to note that, using the methodology described herein a complete testing of timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be effected since the acceptable operation of the first portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be confirmed during the power-up phase of the production test and the acceptable operation of the second portion of timer circuit <b>203</b>B can be confirmed during the power-down phase of the production test.

In one embodiment, as with the first circuit portion discussed above, the second circuit portion can be implemented with clock or frequency dividing components. The input of second circuit portion <b>305</b> is coupled to the output <b>307</b> of first circuit portion <b>303</b> and the output of oscillator <b>301</b>. In normal mode, a timer output with full delay can be produced at the output <b>309</b> of second circuit portion <b>305</b> with the clock input to second circuit portion <b>305</b> taken from output <b>307</b>. It should be appreciated that in test mode, upon power-down, the timing circuit output can be taken from second output <b>309</b> that is associated with the second portion of timing circuit <b>203</b>B.</p>

In operation, in one embodiment, during a power-up phase, the output is taken from an output <b>307</b> associated with the first circuit portion <b>303</b> as is shown in FIG. <b>3</b>B. It should be appreciated that in one embodiment, in a power-up phase, the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to the output associated with first circuit portion <b>303</b> can be less than the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to the output <b>309</b> associated with second circuit portion <b>305</b>.
