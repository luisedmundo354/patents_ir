<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention relates to an apparatus and a method for low-contamination melting of high-purity, aggressive and/or high-melting glass or glass-ceramic. According to the invention, for this purpose a melt is heated in a crucible or melting skull crucible by means of high-frequency radiation and is mixed or homogenized in the melting crucible. It is preferable for a gas nozzle, from which gas bubbles, e.g. oxygen bubbles (known as O<sub>2 </sub>bubbling), escape into the melt, to be provided at the base of the crucible. This alone makes it possible to achieve surprising multiple benefits in the melting skull crucible. Firstly, unmelted batch which drops into the melt in solid form, for example from above, is melted down more quickly as a result of more intensive mixing with the liquid fraction of the melt, secondly the temperature distribution in the melt is made more even, thirdly a uniform distribution or mixing of different glass constituents is achieved, and fourthly the redox state of the glass can be adjusted.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an apparatus and a method for the low-contamination melting of a substance in general and in particular for the melting of high-purity, aggressive and/or high-melting glass or glass-ceramic, specifically.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In traditional melting methods, glass is melted continuously in a platinum crucible or in refractory tank furnaces. A drawback of such methods is that some of the platinum is released to the melt, and the refractory tank furnaces have only short service lives. The desired high-purity glass quality cannot be achieved in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are also known methods in which glass is melted continuously in melting tank furnaces and removed. To obtain high-quality glass, a refining channel and a homogenization device or tank furnace may follow the melting tank furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In both the above mentioned methods, discontinuous or continuous, the melting crucible or the melting tank furnace are externally heated, e.g. by a burner, and the heat is conductively transmitted to the melt in the interior. There is direct contact between the melt and the crucible or tank furnace. This has a number of drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Firstly, the maximum melt temperature is limited by the crucible or tank furnace material. Therefore, the melting crucible or melting tank furnace and if appropriate the refining channel and the homogenization tank furnace usually consist of platinum, which has a relatively high melting point and is relatively resistant to corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the platinum melting crucible or the platinum melting tank furnace, and also the refining channel and the homogenization tank furnace, is attacked and corroded by the glass melt.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In any case, platinum disadvantageously leads to contaminations or impurities in the glass, which have an adverse effect on the optical properties, in particular the transmission, and consequently these conductive-heating methods can only be used to a very restricted extent for high-purity glasses. Impurities of this nature lead to transmission losses in optical fiber transmission systems of up to 200 to 500 dB/km.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This has proven extremely problematical in particular for the melting of aggressive glasses, e.g. zinc silicate or lanthanum borate glasses, since these glasses cause extensive corrosion to the crucibles or tank furnaces.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to the conductive-heating methods mentioned above, it is also known to use methods in which glass is melted and heated inductively in a skull crucible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A skull crucible typically comprises meandering water-cooled metal tubes which are spaced apart from one another. The melt inside the interior of the skull crucible is heated by a coil arrangement arranged around the skull crucible by high-frequency power being introduced into the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Cooling of the skull crucible results in the formation of a substantially solid layer or crust of material of the same composition, i.e. in particular of glass, between the skull crucible and the melt. To this extent, impurities in the melt caused by the crucible material are significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A skull crucible is known, for example, from PETROV YU. B. et al., “Continuous Casting Glass Melting in a Cold Crucible Induction Furnace”, XV. International Congress on Glass 1989, Proceedings, Vol. 3a, 1989, pages 72 to 77.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, the complex structure, in particular the high-frequency technology requirements of an inductively heated skull melting device, results in completely new requirements and problems compared to the abovementioned conductive-heating melting apparatuses. Firstly, the high melting temperature and very high throughtput rates per crucible volume means that many solution approaches for conductive-heating apparatuses cannot readily be transferred to skull melting apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In principle, high melting rates and therefore high throughputs can be achieved with a skull melting apparatus. Although this is desirable, on the other hand this may under certain circumstances cause the quality of the melt and therefore of the end product to suffer, for example as a result of thermal reduction. This also leads to a deterioration in the transmission properties of the glass.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the rate at which the high-frequency radiation is introduced depends on various parameters of the melt. Therefore, the melting performance is restricted not only by the high-frequency power emitted by the coil arrangement but also by the melting parameters and crucible geometries.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Consequently, the known skull melting apparatuses are in need of improvement in particular with regard to the quality and homogeneity of the melt and also with regard to the melting capacity or throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Document DE 199 39 780 A1 has disclosed an induction-heated skull crucible in which the metal tubes of the crucible wall are short-circuited with one another above the base, in order to displace the HF field upward or downward.</p>

As a result, however, the redox state of the melt is only locally changed and the melt as a whole is not homogenized.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method, in particular a skull melting apparatus or a skull melting method, for melting a substance, in particular glass or glass-ceramic, which allow an improved homogeneity, an increased melting capacity, an increased throughput and/or a high substance or glass quality to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A further object of the present invention is to further develop known skull melting apparatuses or skull melting methods and to avoid or at least alleviate the drawbacks of known apparatuses and methods.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The object of the invention is achieved in a surprisingly simple way by the subject matter of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The apparatus according to the invention, in particular a skull melting apparatus for melting or fusing a substance or compound, in particular for melting high-purity, aggressive and/or high-melting glass or glass-ceramic, comprises a, preferably coolable, e.g. water-cooled crucible or skull crucible and an emitting device for emitting electromagnetic radiation, in particular a coil arrangement arranged around the crucible. The emitting device or coil arrangement emits in particular high-frequency electromagnetic radiation which is introduced into a melt inside the crucible, so that the melt is heated by means of the absorbed high-frequency power. Furthermore, there is a mixing or homogenization device for mixing or homogenizing the melt, the mixing or homogenization device being assigned to the crucible, for example being arranged on and/or in the crucible, so that the mixing or homogenization can take place in the crucible or melting crucible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is preferable for batch which is to be melted to be laid onto the melt continuously, approximately in the center and from above, and for liquid melt to be removed from the crucible continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The inventors have established that simply the fact of mixing and/or homogenizing the melt in the melting crucible or skull crucible makes it possible to achieve surprising multiple benefits. Firstly, unmelted batch which drops into the melt in solid form, for example from above, is melted more quickly as a result of more intimate mixing with the liquid fraction of the melt. Surprisingly, the inventors have discovered that the effective contact area between the melt and the supplied material is greatly increased and therefore the melting capacity rises. Secondly, the temperature distribution of the melt is made more even. Thirdly, a uniform distribution of mixing of different glass constituents which, for example, may have different melting points and/or high-frequency coupling coefficients, is achieved. Fourthly, the redox state of the glass can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The action mechanisms which have been discovered are of relevance in particular in conjunction with the inductive high-frequency heating which is preferably used, since the coupling or introduction of the electromagnetic radiation is also dependent on the state of aggregation, the temperature and the particular glass constituent in the melt. In particular, the coupling to unmelted batch constituents is very low.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The apparatus according to the invention and the method are also particularly suitable for high-melting glasses which require melting temperatures of at least 1500° C. or 1600° C. Furthermore, aggressive glasses, e.g. zinc silicate glasses or lanthanum borate glasses, can be melted successfully.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The mixing or homogenization is preferably carried out without any contamination or at least with little contamination, which is highly advantageous in particular for high-purity glasses.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To be mixed or homogenized, it is preferable for the melt to be set in internal motion deliberately or in a predetermined way, or for internal motion to be induced, boosted and/or maintained. In particular, a predefined flow, e.g. with a predefined flow velocity and/or flow direction, is induced in the melt. By way of example, by targeted generation of a temperature difference it is possible to cause a convective flow in the melt, or to induce, assist or boost an existing convective flow.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The mixing or homogenization can be induced or generated with or without material being introduced into the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A preferred form of the material-introducing mixing comprises the introduction of batch which is formed in such a manner that, for example, a flow is induced in the melt simply as a result of the batch being introduced. For this purpose, by way of example, a pelletized and/or coated batch in which in particular gas bubbles are enclosed and/or which releases gas bubbles when it melts is used. It is also possible for the batch to be supplied in pelletized, coated and/or other compacted form without these gas bubbles. In the context of the present invention, the term pelletizing is to be understood as meaning combination to form a stable, solid body, for example by means of pressing. The term coating is to be understood as meaning a structure similar to a solid provided, for example, with a vitreous covering. This, in a particularly advantageous way, both avoids dusting resulting from granular and fine-granular material being supplied and, furthermore, significantly improves the filling rate, since a significantly increased amount of material can be introduced into the melt for the same volumetric flow. Furthermore, batch constituents can be substituted by more fine-grained material without increased dusting occurring, the fine-grained material leading to an optimized melting rate as a result of shortened diffusion paths.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an alternative or in addition, it is preferable for a batch which has been formed, for example into rods and effects mixing or homogenization in particular by being rotated as it is lowered into the melt, is added. The rods, which are, for example, in the shape of propellers, in particular define an agitator which dissolves of its own accord.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As an alternative or in addition, it is also possible to provide an external agitation device, in particular made from coated metal, for mechanical agitation, or an agitator which is immersed into the melt and dissolves of its own accord, for example by melting, and is made from the same material as the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a device for introducing gas or gas bubbles, for example by means of one or more gas nozzles, into the melt. The gas nozzle is preferably cooled, in particular liquid-cooled, e.g. water-cooled, and is preferably arranged at the base of the crucible. The cooling of the gas nozzle may be connected to the cooling of the crucible or may be formed separately.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the gas nozzle projects through the base of the crucible, at least in sections, and extends into the interior of the crucible. In particular, a tip of the gas nozzle extends as far as or into the melt, so that gas which emerges from the gas nozzle or tip rises into the melt in the form of gas bubbles. This bubbling effect intimately mixes and homogenizes the melt in the melting crucible in a particularly simple way.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is preferable to use O<sub>2</sub>-containing gas, which has proven highly advantageous in particular for lead silicate glasses. This is because in these glasses the lead is thermally reduced at high melt temperatures, which are used for a high melting capacity. This in turn has an adverse effect on the transmission of the glass, in a similar way to platinum contamination, and may even lead to expensive discoloration, making the melted glass completely unusable. Introduction of oxygen into the melt to prevent the lead from being reduced, so that effective control of the redox state of the glass is achieved by the introduction of gas. This even makes it possible, for example, for lead silicate glass to achieve a melting capacity of approximately 500 kg/day, 800 kg/day, 1000 kg/day or more and, at the same time, to avoid or at least alleviate a significant deterioration in the transmission qualities.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is preferable for the section of the nozzle which projects into the melt, i.e. for example the tip, to be made from low-contamination material, e.g. a light metal, in particular aluminum, magnesium or beryllium, or at least to be coated with a material of this type. Coating with polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon®) also appears possible.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order, after the gas nozzle has “frozen up”, i.e. after a solid layer of substance or glass has formed over the gas nozzle, for the gas nozzle to be opened up or cleared again, it is preferable for the gas nozzle to comprise a device for punching through a solid substance or skull layer. This punching device is in particular produced as a needle, e.g. from a material which is able to withstand high temperatures, such as tungsten or similar metal. It is preferable for the needle to be arranged in the center of the gas nozzle, preferably in a longitudinally displaceable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the text which follows, the invention is explained in more detail on the basis of preferred exemplary embodiments and with reference to the figures, in which identical reference symbols denote identical or similar components.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first embodiment of the apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention for melting glass, having a cooled, e.g. water-cooled, crucible or melting crucible <b>10</b>. An emitting device for emitting electromagnetic radiation, in the form of a coil arrangement <b>30</b>, is arranged around the crucible <b>10</b>. High-frequency power is introduced into a melt <b>40</b>, for example comprising lead silicate glass, by means of the coil arrangement, so that the melt <b>40</b> is heated. A high frequency of approximately 250 kHz to approximately 400 kHz at an emission power of approximately 200 kW to approximately 300 kW or higher is used. The temperature of the melt is in the range from 1200° C. to 2000° C.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The crucible <b>10</b> comprises a water-cooled annular wall section <b>12</b> and a water-cooled base <b>14</b>. The wall section <b>12</b> and the base <b>14</b> together form the cooled wall of the crucible <b>10</b> and each comprise metal tubes <b>16</b> which are arranged in meandering form and are spaced apart from one another, as can be seen most clearly from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The metal tubes <b>16</b> have a cross section of approximately 2 cm and gaps of 5 mm between the tubes <b>16</b>, so that the crucible wall is initially permeable to liquid when the crucible <b>10</b> is unfilled.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On account of the cooling of the wall section <b>12</b> and of the base <b>14</b>, i.e. the crucible wall, a solid, continuous skull layer <b>42</b> of material of the same composition as the melt, i.e. in this exemplary embodiment of glass, is formed in the contact region between the melt <b>40</b> and the crucible wall, so that the arrangement formed from the crucible <b>10</b> and the solid skull layer <b>42</b> becomes liquid-tight. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which represents a diagrammatic illustration of the crucible, does not show the individual tubes <b>16</b> and the skull layer <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be noted that the melting apparatus is operated continuously, so that batch is regularly laid onto the melt through a substantially central opening <b>20</b> in a cover <b>18</b> of the crucible <b>10</b>. Furthermore, melt is continuously removed via an outlet opening <b>22</b> of the crucible <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A cooled bridge <b>24</b> penetrates into the melt <b>40</b> to a depth of at least approximately 3 cm to 5 cm in the vicinity of the outlet opening <b>22</b>, in order to keep unmelted or undissolved constituents of the batch away from the outlet opening <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore the apparatus <b>1</b> comprises two burners <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> which direct flames <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> onto the contents of the crucible or a surface <b>41</b> of the melt <b>40</b> through openings in the cover <b>18</b>. In this arrangement, the burner <b>26</b> is used for initial melting of the contents of the crucible when the apparatus <b>1</b> is starting up, for example after a change of crucible, and the burner <b>28</b> is used to continuously reheat the melt <b>40</b> in the outlet opening <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A mixing or homogenization device in the form of a gas nozzle <b>50</b> is arranged at the base <b>14</b> of the crucible <b>10</b>. The gas nozzle <b>50</b> projects into the crucible in sections and introduces the gas into the melt <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the gas nozzle <b>50</b> is arranged eccentrically, in this exemplary embodiment approximately halfway between the center and the edge of the round crucible <b>10</b> and on the opposite side from the outlet opening <b>22</b>. This position has proven highly advantageous since a convective flow <b>54</b>, which is in any case present as a result of a temperature difference in the melt and rises centrally from a hot core <b>43</b> and then descends at the edge, is boosted and, at the same time, batch which is laid centrally through the opening <b>20</b> is kept away from the cold crucible wall <b>12</b> by means of the gas bubbles <b>52</b>. The substantially annular flow <b>54</b> advantageously results in effective mixing and homogenization of the melt and is responsible for a temperature compensation and a uniform distribution of the material in the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this example, the gas bubbles contain O<sub>2 </sub>in order at the same time to oxidize lead in the lead silicate glass melt <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a diagrammatic plan view from above of the crucible base <b>14</b> with the gas nozzle <b>50</b>, which is arranged in an opening <b>15</b> or cutout in the crucible base <b>14</b> between the meandering metal tubes <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the skull layer <b>42</b> is formed not only on the cooled base <b>14</b> of the crucible, but also on the cooled gas nozzle <b>50</b>. However, the escaping gas bubbles <b>52</b> ensure that an opening of the gas nozzle is kept clear for prolonged periods.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Nevertheless, the solid skull layer <b>42</b> may close up over an outlet opening <b>56</b> of the gas nozzle <b>50</b>, so that it is no longer possible for gas to escape from the nozzle <b>50</b>, for example as a result of an interruption in the gas feed. This situation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. To allow the opening <b>56</b> to be opened up again, the gas nozzle comprises a needle <b>58</b> which is arranged longitudinally displaceably, in the direction indicated by the arrow <b>59</b>, inside a passage <b>60</b> in the center of the gas nozzle. Therefore, a tip <b>62</b> of the needle <b>58</b> can punch through a section <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the skull layer <b>42</b> which is above the gas outlet opening <b>56</b>, so that the gas outlet opening <b>56</b> can be opened up again.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The inventors have discovered that an upper section <b>51</b> of the gas nozzle <b>50</b>, which projects into the crucible <b>10</b> and at least in part is in direct contact with the skull layer <b>42</b>, is preferably made from non-contaminating or at least low-contamination material. In the context of the present invention, the term low-contamination is to be considered to encompass materials which substantially have little or no effect on the glass quality. These are in particular light metals, such as for example aluminum. Although aluminum does pass into the melt, aluminum ions or aluminum compounds substantially have little or no adverse effect on the optical properties, in particular the transmission of the glass. On the other hand, cooling of the gas nozzle <b>50</b> ensures that the gas nozzle <b>50</b> is able to withstand the high temperatures in the crucible <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, the use of a metal with a high melting point, e.g. higher than 2000° C., in particular molybdenum, iridium, tungsten or a tungsten compound, has proven advantageous to the needle <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the gas nozzle <b>50</b> in longitudinal section. The gas nozzle <b>50</b> comprises the gas outlet opening <b>56</b> and the gas passage <b>60</b> in which the needle <b>58</b> runs and is guided. The needle <b>58</b> can be displaced inside the gas nozzle <b>50</b>, parallel to the passage <b>60</b>, by means of a displacement device <b>64</b>. Furthermore, the gas nozzle <b>50</b> comprises a gas inlet <b>66</b> and a seal <b>68</b> for the needle <b>58</b>. The upper section <b>51</b> of the gas nozzle <b>50</b> comprises aluminum or an aluminum-containing alloy, with a lower section <b>53</b> of the gas nozzle <b>50</b> made from brass. The upper and lower sections <b>51</b>, <b>53</b> are sealed in a fluid-tight manner with respect to one another by seals <b>70</b>. In the lower section <b>53</b> there is a cooling water inlet <b>72</b> and a cooling water outlet <b>74</b>, so that the gas nozzle can be effectively cooled by water flowing through it.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which illustrates a cross section through the nozzle, it can be seen that the lower section <b>53</b> is divided, parallel to a longitudinal axis L of the gas nozzle <b>50</b>, into two halves <b>53</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>b</i>, which are electrically insulated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a second embodiment of the apparatus <b>101</b> according to the invention, with an alternative device <b>150</b> for mixing and homogenizing the melt <b>40</b>. Glass batch which has been formed into pellets, coated pills and/or beads <b>156</b> is introduced, via a conveyor belt <b>154</b>, into the melt <b>40</b> through the opening <b>20</b>. The glass beads <b>156</b> comprise an outer boundary region <b>158</b> and an inner core region <b>160</b>. The boundary region <b>158</b> substantially comprises glass of the same composition as the melt <b>40</b>. The core region <b>160</b> comprises a substance which releases a gas or gas bubbles <b>152</b> in the melt when the boundary region <b>158</b> has melted. The substance in the core region <b>160</b> may comprise a gas, a liquid, e.g. water, or a solid material, e.g. a salt, which by interacting with the hot melt <b>40</b> release the gas bubbles <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The fact that the glass beads <b>156</b> sink in a left-hand section <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the melt and the fact that the gas bubbles <b>152</b> rise up in a right-hand section <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the melt <b>40</b> result in a substantially annular flow being generated or induced within the melt <b>40</b>. However, it is also possible, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for an existing convective flow to be boosted.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a third embodiment of the apparatus <b>201</b> according to the invention, in which batch bodies <b>256</b> which have been pressed into the form of rods are introduced into the melt <b>40</b> by means of a mixing and homogenization device <b>250</b>. The bodies <b>256</b> in rod form are, for example, shaped in the style of propellers and rotate as they sink within the melt <b>40</b>, with the bodies <b>256</b> being melted at the same time, so as to generate flow phenomena in the melt <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a fourth embodiment of the apparatus <b>301</b> according to the invention with an agitator <b>350</b> which mechanically makes the melt <b>40</b> in the melting crucible <b>10</b> flow by means of a rotational movement.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a preferred embodiment of an elongate agitator <b>350</b>′. The agitator <b>350</b>′ is substantially produced, e.g. by pressing, from the glass which also forms the melt <b>40</b>. The agitator <b>350</b>′ is introduced into the melt <b>40</b> from above along its longitudinal axis <b>352</b>, for example in a similar manner to the agitator <b>350</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and is rotated about its axis <b>352</b>. The agitator <b>350</b>′ comprises three agitating arms which extend away from the center and is dissolved of its own accord by melting in the melt <b>40</b>. To ensure continuous addition of glass and agitation, the agitator <b>350</b>′ is correspondingly continuously moved in further from above.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the first embodiment of the apparatus <b>1</b> according to the invention with a connected refining channel <b>80</b> and an additional external homogenization device <b>90</b>. Liquid glass is continuously passed out of the crucible <b>10</b>, in the direction indicated by arrow <b>82</b>, into the refining channel <b>80</b> and, from there, in the direction indicated by arrow <b>84</b>, onwards into the external homogenization device <b>90</b>. The external homogenization device <b>90</b> comprises a glass outlet <b>92</b> for pouring, e.g. into a mold and/or for further or final processing of the glass to form a glass product or glass-ceramic product.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Refining of the glass in the refining channel <b>80</b> and subsequent homogenization in the external homogenization device <b>90</b> further improves the quality of the glass. The glass quality achieved with the apparatus according to the invention may, however, already be sufficiently high, so that there is no need for the refining channel <b>80</b> and/or the homogenization device, with the result that the glass melt <b>40</b> is ready for further or final processing at the outlet opening <b>22</b>.</p>
