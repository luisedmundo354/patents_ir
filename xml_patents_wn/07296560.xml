<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an engine of spark-ignition type and more particularly to an engine of spark-ignition type which can accelerate the gasification of the injected fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An example of the conventional engines of spark-ignition type injects fuel from an injector into an intake port provided in a cylinder head, as well as the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The engine of this type has an advantage that it can obtain a mixture air of air-fuel ratio more precise than a carburetor, an excellent exhaust gas property and an output property.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the conventional engine directs a fuel injection hole of an injector to an intake valve port and starts the fuel injection during an intake stroke of a cylinder. The injected fuel passes through the intake valve port together with intake air and is flowed into a combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-mentioned conventional technique has the following problem.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">&lt;Problem&gt; The injected fuel is apt to insufficiently gasify.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is no room for the injected fuel to absorb heat within the intake port. Therefore, it gasifies insufficiently. This makes it difficult to attempt to improve each of the exhaust gas property, output property, fuel consumption property, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has an object to provide an engine of spark-ignition type able to solve the above-mentioned problem. More particularly, it aims at providing an engine of spark-ignition type which can accelerate the gasification of the injected fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The characterizing matter of the invention as set forth in claim <b>1</b> is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an engine of spark-ignition type has a cylinder head <b>1</b> provided with an intake port <b>2</b>, into which fuel is injected from an injector <b>3</b>. This engine of spark-ignition type, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, is characterized in that the injector <b>3</b> has fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> directed to an inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> and a start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made during an exhaust stroke of each of cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, and that the injected fuel collides against the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>1</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the injected fuel collides against the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>. Therefore, the fuel contacts the collision portion and spreads over the surroundings of the collision portion to receive the heat of the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> with the result of accelerating its gasification. The present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, makes the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection during the exhaust stroke. Accordingly, when compared with the case where the start of the fuel injection is made during an intake stroke, it can increase the time for gasification to result in being advantageous to the gasification. Further, during the exhaust stroke, the compression heat, combustion heat and exhaust heat are stored in the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> via a compression stroke, an explosion stroke and the exhaust stroke, so that the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> has a high temperature. This point is also advantageous to the gasification.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>2</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It offers the following effect in addition to the effect presented by the invention of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is advantageous to the gasification of the injected fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made at a later half portion of the exhaust stroke. This is advantageous because the exhaust heat is stored at the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> at the later half portion of the exhaust stroke for a longer period of time than at an earlier half portion of the exhaust stroke.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>3</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It offers the following function and effect in addition to the effect presented by claim <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is advantageous to the gasification of the injected fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made during a term of 31 degrees to 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the exhaust stroke. This is advantageous to the gasification of the injected fuel. When the start of the fuel injection is made prior to 31 degrees of crank angle before the end of the exhaust stroke, the exhaust heat is stored in the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> for a relatively short period of time to result in failing to sufficiently increase the temperature of the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>. This entails a likelihood that the fuel gasifies insufficiently. Further, if the start of the fuel injection is made after 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the exhaust stroke, the time for fuel gasification becomes so short that the fuel is likely to gasify insufficiently. On the other hand, when the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made during the term of 31 degrees to 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the exhaust stroke, the above-mentioned likelihoods are not caused, so that it is advantageous to the gasification of the injected fuel.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>4</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It offers the following function and effect in addition to those presented by the invention as set forth in any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is possible to reduce the number of parts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, one throttle body <b>7</b> is used for a pair of left and right adjacent cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Therefore, the number of throttle bodies <b>7</b> is sufficient even if it is half the number of cylinders. This can reduce the number of parts.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>5</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It offers the following function and effect in addition to those presented by the invention of claim <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is possible to prevent the gasification of the fuel within the injector.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>(A), <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, the injector <b>3</b> is attached to the throttle body <b>7</b>. Consequently, when compared with the case where the injector is attached to the cylinder head, it is possible to inhibit the entrance of heat from the cylinder head <b>1</b> to the injector <b>3</b>, which leads to the possibility of preventing the gasification of the fuel within the injector <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>6</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It offers the following effect in addition to the effect presented by claim <b>4</b> or claim <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is possible to reduce the number of parts.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, one injector <b>3</b> is employed for one throttle body <b>7</b>. Therefore, the number of injectors <b>3</b> is sufficient even if it is half the number of cylinders. Thus it is possible to reduce the number of parts.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>7</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It offers the following effect in addition to the effect presented by the invention of claim <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is possible to distribute fuel of equal amount to the left and right cylinders accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, the fuel injected separately in the left and right directions from the left and right fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> is made to respectively collide against the inner wall surfaces of the intake port <b>2</b> on the left and right sides of a central intake port wall <b>34</b>. Accordingly, when compared with the case where the fuel injected from a single fuel injection hole is made to collide against the central intake port wall, thereby dividing it in the left and right directions, it is possible to precisely distribute the fuel of equal amount to the left and right cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">(Invention of Claim <b>8</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It offers the following effect in addition to the effect presented by the invention of claim <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">&lt;Effect&gt; It is advantageous to the gasification of the injected fuel.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An embodiment of the present invention is explained based on the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> show an engine of spark-ignition type according to the embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, an explanation is given for a water-cooled vertical two-cylinder gasoline engine of spark-ignition type.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The embodiment of the present invention is outlined as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a cylinder head <b>1</b> is assembled to an upper portion of a cylinder block <b>15</b>. A head cover <b>16</b> is assembled to an upper portion of the cylinder head <b>1</b>. An oil pan <b>17</b> is assembled to a lower portion of the cylinder block <b>15</b>. A gear case <b>18</b> is assembled to a left portion of the cylinder block <b>15</b>. A belt case <b>19</b> is assembled to a left portion of the gear case <b>18</b>. A cooling fan <b>20</b> is arranged at a left portion of the belt case <b>19</b>. A flywheel <b>26</b> is disposed at a right portion of the cylinder block <b>15</b>. A throttle body <b>7</b> is assembled to a rear portion of the cylinder head <b>1</b>. A governor lever <b>21</b> and a governor spring <b>22</b> of a mechanical governor are arranged along a wall surface of the cylinder block <b>15</b>. This engine is provided with an electronic fuel injection device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The electronic fuel injection device of this engine is outlined as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fuel is injected from an injector <b>3</b> into an intake port <b>2</b> provided in the cylinder head <b>1</b>. Attached to the throttle body <b>7</b> are a throttle valve <b>8</b> and the injector <b>3</b>. The throttle valve <b>8</b> is interlockingly connected to the governor lever <b>21</b> of the mechanical governor. There are provided an intake air pressure sensor <b>9</b> which detects the intake air pressure intake-downstream of the throttle valve <b>8</b>, a sensor <b>10</b> which detects the number of engine rotations and a control means <b>11</b>. The sensor <b>9</b> and the sensor <b>10</b> are associated with the injector <b>3</b> through the control means <b>11</b>. Depending on the intake air amount calculated based on the intake air pressure detected by the sensor <b>9</b> and the number of engine rotations detected by the sensor <b>10</b>, the control means <b>11</b> adjusts the fuel injection amount from the injector <b>3</b>. As for the fuel, gasoline is used. But other liquid fuel and liquefied gas fuel can be employed. The liquid fuel is the fuel that is liquid at an ordinary temperature under the normal pressure (15 degrees C. to 20 degrees C., and 760 mmHg). The liquefied fuel is the fuel that is gaseous at the ordinary temperature under the normal pressure but is liquid when pressurized. This invention aims at accelerating the gasification of the fuel. Therefore, its effect remarkably appears when using the liquefied fuel which hardly gasifies after the fuel injection, rather than the gaseous fuel which easily gasifies after the fuel injection.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The details of the electronic injection device are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, the injector <b>3</b> is attached to an upper portion of the throttle body <b>7</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the injector <b>3</b> is connected to a pump <b>24</b> for delivering fuel under pressure, provided in a fuel container <b>23</b>. Thus the fuel is sent under pressure through the pump <b>24</b> from the fuel container <b>23</b> to the injector <b>3</b>. And the control means <b>11</b> controls the fuel injection term from the injector <b>3</b> so as to adjust the fuel injection amount. The control means <b>11</b> is a microcomputer. The control means <b>11</b> makes a control at the ignition time as well.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The electronic injection device is devised as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>(A), <b>2</b>(B), and <b>5</b>, the injector <b>3</b> has fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> oriented toward an inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>. A start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made during exhaust strokes of the cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The injected fuel collides against the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when seen in a direction parallel to cylinder center axes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, on the assumption that a direction where the two cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are arranged is taken as a left and right direction, and a widthwise direction of the cylinder head <b>1</b> rectangular to this left and right direction is deemed as a front and rear direction optional one of which is regarded as a rear direction, one throttle body <b>7</b> is utilized for a pair of adjacent left and right cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. This throttle body <b>7</b> is arranged rearwardly of the cylinder head <b>1</b> and is provided with one throttle intake passage <b>7</b><i>a </i>and one throttle valve <b>8</b>. A central intake port wall <b>34</b> is conducted from between the respective valve ports <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the left and right cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> toward the throttle intake passage <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The respective valve ports <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>a </i>are communicated with the throttle intake passage <b>7</b><i>a </i>through the intake port <b>2</b> formed on the left and right sides of the central intake port wall <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2(A)</figref>, the injector <b>3</b> is attached to the throttle body <b>7</b>. One injector <b>3</b> is used for one throttle body <b>7</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the injector <b>3</b> has its front end portion directed toward the central intake port wall <b>34</b> ahead thereof. The left and right fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are arranged at this front end portion of the injector <b>3</b>. The fuel injected from these left and right fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> separately in the left and right directions are adapted to respectively collide against the inner wall surfaces of the intake port <b>2</b> on the left and right sides of the central intake port wall <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the left and right fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are paired and two pairs of these left and right fuel injection holes are arranged at the front end portion of the injector <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2(A)</figref>, the fuel injected simultaneously and separately in the front and rear directions from these two pairs is adapted to respectively collide against the inner wall surfaces of the intake port <b>2</b> as staggered in the front and rear direction on the left and right sides of the central intake port wall <b>34</b>. Further, the fuel is injected simultaneously from the left and right fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, a direction of cylinder center axes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> is taken as an upper and lower direction. Assuming that the side where the head cover <b>16</b> is present is regarded as an upper side and the side where the cylinder block <b>15</b> exists is a lower side, when seen in a direction parallel to a direction where a crank shaft <b>37</b> spans, the fuel to be injected is injected obliquely downwards through an intake port inlet <b>4</b> to the intake port <b>2</b> and collides against a lower portion of the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> from an obliquely upper side. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>(A) and <b>5</b>, the directions of the fuel injection are indicated by arrows. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2(A)</figref>, the fuel collides against the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b> at leading end positions of the arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the central intake port wall <b>34</b> has its width in the left and right direction progressively decreased as it approaches the throttle intake passage <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The intake port <b>2</b> is formed into a branched structure that it is directed from the single intake port inlet <b>4</b> toward the respective intake valve ports <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the mutually adjoining left and right cylinders <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. And the fuel injected simultaneously and separately in the left and right directions from the left and right fuel injection holes <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> respectively collides against the inner wall surfaces of the left and right branched port portions <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> on the left and right sides of the central intake port wall <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This engine has two cylinders and the intake port <b>2</b> is branched, so that it is not necessary to use the intake manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The details of the injection start time are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, this engine is of four-cycle and has two cylinders arranged in series. With an angle of a crank pin taken as 360 degrees, in one cycle, during two times of synchronizing period in which a compression stroke of one cylinder synchronizes with an exhaust stroke of the other cylinder, the respective starts <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection are made. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, during a period of time in which the first cylinder <b>5</b> is at the compression stroke and the second cylinder <b>6</b> is at the exhaust stroke, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made from the injector <b>3</b> toward the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>. Further, on the contrary, during a period of time where the second cylinder <b>6</b> is at the compression stroke and the first cylinder <b>5</b> is at the exhaust stroke, the start (<b>3</b><i>a</i>) of the fuel injection is also made from the injector <b>3</b> toward the inner wall surface of the intake port <b>2</b>. The control means <b>11</b> controls the stating time of the fuel injection. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> numerals <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> designate the crank pins.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Concretely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, during the term in which the first cylinder <b>5</b> is at a later half portion of the compression stroke and the second cylinder <b>6</b> is at a later half portion of the exhaust stroke, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made from the injector <b>3</b>. Besides, during the term in which the second cylinder <b>6</b> is at a later half portion of the compression stroke and the first cylinder <b>5</b> is at a later half portion of the exhaust stroke, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made from the injector <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferably, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made during the term in which the first cylinder <b>5</b> is at 31 degrees to 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the compression strok and the second cylinder <b>6</b> is at 31 degrees to 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the exhaust stroke. In addition, the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection is made from the injector <b>3</b> during the term in which the second cylinder <b>6</b> is at 31 degrees to 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the compression stroke and the first cylinder <b>5</b> is at 31 degrees to 25 degrees of crank angle before the end of the exhaust stroke. At the time earlier than this term, there is a likelihood that the amount of the heat stored at the cylinder head <b>1</b> becomes insufficient. At the time later than this term, there is a fear that the time for gasifying the fuel becomes short.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection made twice in one cycle is substantially effected by the phase difference of 360 degrees of crank angle. The control means <b>11</b> adjust the time for making the start <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the fuel injection based on the intake air pressure detected by the sensor <b>9</b> and the number of engine rotations detected by the sensor <b>10</b>, as well as the fuel injection amount.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The other devises are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are provided an engine temperature detecting means <b>12</b>, an intake bypass passage <b>13</b> which communicates an intake-upstream side of the throttle valve <b>8</b> with an intake-downstream side thereof, and a bypass valve <b>14</b> for opening and closing this intake bypass passage <b>13</b>. The engine temperature detecting means <b>12</b> is associated with the bypass valve <b>14</b> through the control means <b>11</b>. If the engine temperature is lower than a predetermined value, the control means <b>11</b> opens the bypass valve <b>14</b>. A cooling-water temperature sensor is utilized for the engine temperature detecting means <b>12</b>. But instead of this cooling-water temperature sensor, an engine temperature sensor may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, in the event that the reduction speed of the intake air pressure detected by the sensor <b>9</b> is higher than a predetermined value, the control means <b>11</b> controls the bypass valve <b>14</b> so that it opens for a predetermined period of time. In the case where the reduction speed of the intake air pressure detected by the sensor <b>9</b> is higher than the predetermined value, the control means <b>11</b> controls the bypass valve <b>14</b> so that it opens for a longer period of time as the reduction speed of the intake air pressure becomes higher. If the reduction speed of the intake air pressure detected by the intake air pressure sensor <b>9</b> is lower than the predetermined value, the bypass valve <b>14</b> is kept closed except the case where the engine temperature is lower than a predetermined value.
