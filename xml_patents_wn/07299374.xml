<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates in general to the operation of memory arrays, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for controlling generation of an array clock for use in clocking internal operations of a memory array.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typical clock distribution schemes include a clock generation circuit integrated with a memory array to provide a clock signal which controls the internal operations of the memory array. This array clock is conventionally generated from a system clock, and typically has a pulse width which is dependent upon the frequency of the system clock.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are two portions to an array clock, i.e., an active portion and an inactive (or reset) portion. During the active portion of the array clock cycle, the memory array is accessed and read or write operations are performed. During the inactive portion of the array clock cycle, the internal timings of the memory array are reset to a predetermined state. For the array to function properly, there should be an adequate amount of active clock time and an adequate amount of inactive clock time. An excess amount of either will result in wasted cycle time, or frequency, while an insufficient amount of either will result in failure of the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ideally, there is a small amount of margin in both the active and inactive portions of the clock cycle to balance a maximum operational frequency with a robust design point. The robust design point is required to account for process and environmental variations and tolerances across circuits within the given memory array to allow for a reasonable yield. Thus, provided herein is a novel clock control method and apparatus for a memory array which addresses these concerns.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided through the provision of a clock control method which includes: generating an array clock for an array from a system clock and a reset control signal, the reset control signal comprising an array tracking reset signal; and switching the reset control signal to a mid-cycle reset signal whenever the system clock exceeds a predefined frequency threshold, wherein when the array tracking reset signal is employed, an active pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency independent, and when the mid-cycle reset signal is employed, the active pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency dependent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a clock control apparatus is provided which includes a clock control circuit. The clock control circuit generates an array clock for an array from a system clock and a reset control signal. The reset control signal is one of a plurality of input control signals. The clock control circuit automatically employs a first input control signal as the reset control signal when the system clock is below a predefined frequency threshold, and a second input control signal when the system clock exceeds the predefined frequency threshold. When the reset control signal comprises the first input control signal, a pulse width of the generated array clock is system clock frequency independent, and when the reset control signal comprises the second input control signal, the pulse width of the generated array clock is system clock frequency dependent.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further aspect, a clock control circuit is provided. This clock control circuit includes means for generating an array clock for an array from a system clock and a reset control signal. The reset control signal comprises an array tracking reset signal. The circuit further includes means for switching the reset control signal to a mid-cycle reset signal when the system clock exceeds a predefined frequency threshold. When the reset control signal comprises the array tracking reset signal, a pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency independent, and when the reset control signal comprises the mid-cycle reset signal, the pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency dependent.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An noted above, internal clocks for memory arrays, such as static random access memories (SRAMs) require minimum active pulse widths. The active pulse width should be wide enough to allow sufficient time to perform the addressing, decoding, reading, writing, etc., functions of the memory array, while the inactive portion of the array clock should be sufficient to allow resetting of the array for today's high frequency operation. The array clock pulse width (i.e., the active portion of the array clock cycle) should also track the performance of the remainder of the memory array for robust operation. In accordance with the present invention, during normal operation the active portion of the array clock cycle is controlled to a greater extent than the inactive portion of the cycle. This is because an inadequate active pulse width will result in array failure more quickly than an inadequate inactive cycle time.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, multiple array clocking options are employed. These different clocking options derive from multiple reset control signals provided as inputs to a clock control circuit. When the reset control signal comprises an array tracking reset signal, the pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency independent, and when the reset control signal comprises a mid-cycle reset signal, the pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency dependent. Further, there is an automatic switching of the reset control signal from the array tracking reset signal (normal operation) to the mid-cycle reset signal when the system clock exceeds a predefined upper frequency threshold. This predefined frequency threshold is such that the inactive portion of the array cycle time is insufficient for proper operation of the memory array to continue with the active pulse width of the array clock being defined using the array tracking reset signal. Additionally, a bypass signal is provided as one of the reset control signals. When the bypass signal is active a “DC mode” is entered by the clock control circuit where the array clock tracks the system clock. This particular option would be desirable in, for example, a test situation. Each of the reset control signals, and the clock control technique outlined above, are described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is simplified block diagram of one embodiment of a memory array <b>100</b>, such as an SRAM, for which an array clock (ARYCLK) is to be generated in accordance with aspects of the present invention. A system clock is input to a clock control circuit <b>110</b> of memory array <b>100</b> from which the array clock is generated employing one of the multiple reset control signals, labeled reset <b>115</b>, C1_reset <b>125</b>, and bypass <b>135</b>. Reset signal <b>115</b> is an array tracking reset signal which is generated by propagating the array clock through, for example, a portion of the memory array (such as addressing and decoding circuitry <b>120</b>), as well as a dummy global bitline <b>130</b> for further tracking of memory array operations, and a programmable delay element <b>140</b>. Output from the addressing and decoding circuitry can be obtained by tapping off an appropriate address and decoding bitline. Preferably, the tap is made as far down the array circuitry as possible. By way of example, a local column decode line of addressing and decoding circuitry <b>120</b> may be tapped, meaning that the array clock has already propagated through at least some of the global and local row and column decode circuitry, as well as subarray addressing. The dummy global bitline <b>130</b> facilitates further mimicking of the actual memory array's performance. This dummy bitline may comprise similar circuits and topologies employed by actual bitlines of the memory array. The programmable delay element <b>140</b> provides programmability of the resulting pulse width. The intent of this technique is to mimic as much of the delay path through the memory array as possible so that as the memory array speeds up and slows down, reset signal <b>115</b> will automatically adjust accordingly. In this way, the reset signal can be characterized as being self-timed by the memory array. Thus, different manufacturing process variations and environmental variations between memory arrays will results in slight adjustments to the reset signal <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As explained further below, when the reset signal <b>115</b> goes high, the pulse width of the array clock signal is defined under normal operations. Thus, the pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency independent using the array tracking reset signal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The C1_reset signal <b>125</b> is provided as a high frequency reset signal which is automatically employed when the system clock exceeds a frequency threshold. Where the switching threshold occurs will vary with size and architecture of the memory array. For example, certain memory arrays may be small, and can run at 8 GHz under normal operation, while very large memory arrays may only run at 1 GHz normally, but still be on the same chip with the same processor. The C1_reset signal <b>125</b> is generated by a mid-cycle clock circuit <b>150</b> from the system clock. By way of example, clock circuit <b>150</b> could comprise an inverter and delay logic such that the C1_reset signal is principally a delayed inversion of the system clock. Thus, when the array clock is generated from the C1_reset signal <b>125</b>, the pulse width of the array clock is system clock frequency dependent.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The third reset control signal depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is bypass signal <b>135</b>. When this signal is active, the array clock mirrors the system clock, with some slight delay. This signal allows the memory array to operate in a “DC mode”, where the internal array clock is the system clock, and the system clock could be slowed down to, for example, the megahertz range for testing purposes. This bypass signal is an external control signal from, for example, the system controller (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts one embodiment of clock control circuit <b>110</b>. As shown, the system clock is input to a chopper <b>200</b> which outputs a chopped clock signal. One skilled in the art will recognize that chopper <b>200</b> could comprise any available circuit to truncate a wide pulse width signal to a narrow pulse width signal. An appropriate delay is provided within the chopper circuit to define the pulse width of the narrower chopped clock signal. The chopped clock signal is then input to a stretcher circuit <b>210</b> which outputs the array clock (ARYCLK). Reset control signals reset <b>115</b>, C1_reset <b>125</b>, and bypass <b>135</b> are input to stretcher circuit <b>210</b> to facilitate stretching of the narrow chopped clock pulse signal to the array clock signal having the desired active pulse width.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, during normal operation, when the chopped clock signal goes high, the active pulse width for the array clock is initiated and when the reset signal <b>115</b> goes high, the active pulse width is terminated, thereby initiating the inactive portion of the array clock cycle. Thus, the width of the array clock is determined by the leading edge of the chopped clock pulse and the leading edge of one of the reset control signals.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts one embodiment of a stretcher circuit <b>210</b>, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. During normal operation, the chopped clock signal sets a latch <b>300</b>, meaning that the output of latch <b>300</b> goes high. Since in normal operation, the bypass signal is assumed inactive, the inversion <b>325</b> of this signal is high which results in a high output from AND gate <b>320</b>. Since AND gate output <b>320</b> is high, the output of OR gate <b>330</b> is also high, i.e., the array clock signal is high. Latch <b>300</b> remains set until one of the reset control signals (i.e., reset or C1_reset) goes high. These reset control signals are passed through an OR gate <b>310</b>, the output of which is provided to the reset input of latch <b>300</b>. Thus, when the earliest of reset <b>115</b> or C1_reset <b>125</b> goes high, the output of latch <b>300</b> goes low, meaning that the array clock cycles to the inactive portion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As noted above, when the bypass signal is high, (for example, representative of a system test mode) the system clock is passed through chopper <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) as the chopped clock. This signal is combined with the high bypass signal in AND gate <b>340</b> before being passed to OR gate <b>330</b> and output as the array clock. Note that when the bypass signal is high, the inversion of the signal by inverter <b>325</b> results in a low input to AND gate <b>320</b>, and thus a low output from the AND gate, thereby bypassing operation of latch <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> depict timing diagrams showing generation of the array clock signal (ARYCLK) for different system clock frequencies. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, normal operation is assumed wherein the pulse width of the array clock is determined by the array tracking reset signal (reset signal <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As shown, the system clock going active intitates the chopped clock pulse, which in turn initiates the active portion of the array clock cycle. This array clock signal, after propagating through the addressing and decoding circuitry, the dummy global bitline and the programmable delay element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, results in a reset pulse going active. This reset pulse going active in turn drives the array clock inactive as explained above in connection with the stretcher circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, during normal operation, the C1_reset signal does not control the pulse width of the array clock, meaning that the array clock pulse width is system clock frequency independent. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the C1_reset signal goes active when the system clock goes inactive. This is because, as explained above, the C1_reset signal is principally an inversion of the system clock signal. The timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> holds for the designed normal operation of the memory array, as well as for lower frequency system clock operation. At lower frequency operation than designed, the inactive portion of the array clock cycle is simply extended.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the system clock frequency is assumed to increase over that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and be above an intended operational range for the memory array. In this case, the chopped clock signal is again initiated from the system clock going high, which results in initiation of the active cycle of the array clock. Assuming in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> that the C1_reset signal is unused or unavailable, then the active cycle portion of the array clock is terminated with the array tracking reset signal going high as explained above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, in this case, since the system clock frequency is higher than the intended normal operation for the memory array, the inactive portion of the clock cycle is small, and assumed to be insufficient for resetting of the memory array in preparation for the next cycle. The result is a failure of the memory array operation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, normal operation of the memory array can be extended to a higher system clock frequency by automatically switching the reset control signal from the array tracking reset signal to the mid-cycle reset signal (C1_reset). This is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the chopped clock signal is again initiated by the system clock going high, which in turn initiates the array clock signal (ARYCLK). Due to the higher frequency system clock, the C1_reset signal, which is principally an inversion of the system clock signal, will go high sooner than the array tracking reset signal. As explained above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, this results in earlier termination of the active portion of the array clock cycle, i.e., before the array tracking reset signal goes high. The result in an increase in the inactive portion of the array clock cycle and a decrease in the active portion. The goal is to extend the operational frequency of the memory array clock when the system clock slightly exceeds its normal operating range. Should the system clock frequency go too high, then the array clock signal will break down due to insufficient active cycle time. However, at such a high frequency, other components of the system would also be breaking down due to the system clock frequency being too far above the designed operational range.</p>
