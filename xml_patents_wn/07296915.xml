<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of the invention relates to an alternative lighting device and system for use in a vehicle, building or aircraft and, more specifically, a lighting device and system for illuminating the interior space of a vehicle, building or aircraft using white light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For many years the lighting of the interiors of automobiles, aircraft, trains and other vehicles has been accomplished with the use of flourescent lighting systems. Flourescent lights, otherwise known as cold cathode lights, were widely used in direct or indirect lighting systems. However, flourescent lights possess many characteristics which are disadvantageous to the customer. The disadvantages include the short lifetime of the flourescent lighting tube, high power requirements, low durability, high cost for specialty designs, and high electromagnetic interference which can be detrimental to other electrical systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A recent advancement in lighting systems has been made which eliminates many of these disadvantages. The use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in lighting systems has allowed the customer to avoid many of the disadvantages of using a flourescent lighting system. LED lighting systems are typically low power, have a greatly enhanced lifetime, lower replacement cost and have lower electromagnetic interference. U.S. Pat. No. 6,158,882 entitled “LED Semiconductor Lighting System” discloses one such system. This system uses LEDs in serial for illuminating vehicle interiors. The lighting system includes a plurality of LEDs contained within a sealed lighting tube. However, this system is not directed toward a high power LED lighting system. Namely, this system, which encloses the LEDs in a sealed plastic tube, does not disclose the need for heat dissipation when high power and high heat LEDs are used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,180 entitled “Airplane Cabin Lighting Arrangement,” the disclosed lighting system is mounted in the ceiling of an airplane cabin and includes multiple LEDs connected in parallel or series to a power supply. In this system, the light sources are separated by between 25 and 50 cm. By distributing the LEDs throughout a large space, the high heat caused by high power LEDs is reduced. However, this system does not address dissipating the high heat generated when a lighting system uses LEDs in close proximity with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,767 entitled “Thermal Management System for LED Arrays,” the inventor discloses a method of manufacturing an electrically-driven LED lamp including the step of screen printing an electrically insulating coating over an electrically and thermally conductive heat sink. A printing circuit with traces of a resin with a metal disbursed therein is made to establish discreet and electrically conductive paths for electrical interconnecting LEDs. This disclosed system is intended for use in tail lights of a vehicle. However, this system does not address the needs of a replaceable, movable, and durable lighting system for use to light the interior cabin of vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, any advancement in the field of an LED lighting device and system which would improve the heat dissipation, replaceability, movability and durability of the LED lighting device and system would be advantageous.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A lighting device and system for illuminating the interior of a vehicle, aircraft or building is provided. The lighting device and system includes a channel case made from a thermally conductive material, including aluminum. The channel case has a bottom edge and two opposed side edges forming an interior space. A circuit board is disposed within the interior space of the channel case and the circuit board includes circuit traces on the top, bottom or both sides of the circuit board. A heat transfer device is attached to the bottom of the circuit board and is further attached to the bottom of the channel case. The heat transfer device allows for the heat generated by the LEDs to be transferred to the channel case which acts as a heat sink. A plurality of light-emitting diodes and resistors are mounted on the circuit board in series and generate light through a lens which is attached to the two opposed side edges of the channel case.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the description that follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures are not necessarily drawn to scale and certain figures may be shown in an exaggerated or generalized form in interest of clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate a cross-sectional view of the cabin of an airplane including the LED lighting system according to the present invention. The aircraft fuselage <b>100</b> is shown. The aircraft fuselage <b>100</b> includes an aircraft cabin <b>101</b>. The aircraft cabin <b>101</b> is defined by an artificial ceiling <b>103</b> and an artificial floor <b>102</b>. Seats <b>104</b> are attached to the artificial floor <b>102</b>. A lighting and duct panel <b>106</b> is provided above seats <b>104</b>. A duct <b>108</b> is shown attached to the aircraft fuselage <b>100</b> and is positioned behind the lighting and duct panel <b>106</b>. The lighting and duct panel <b>106</b>, the duct <b>108</b> and the aircraft fuselage <b>100</b> form a cavity <b>107</b>. Within cavity <b>107</b>, the LED lighting system <b>111</b> is shown. The LED lighting system <b>111</b> is oriented such that the light produced from the LEDs is directed through the opening provided between duct <b>108</b>, lighting and duct panel <b>106</b> and the fuselage <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the LED lighting system <b>111</b> provides indirect light to the cabin <b>101</b> of the aircraft. However, in another embodiment, the LED lighting system <b>111</b> can provide direct light to the cabin <b>101</b>. The LED lighting system <b>111</b> is not limited to use in an aircraft, but can be implemented in a wide variety of settings, including but not limited to, building, vehicles, trains and buses. The LED lighting system <b>111</b> can be mounted to the light and duct panel <b>106</b>, to the duct <b>108</b>, or to the fuselage <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate the LED lighting device according to the present invention. The LED lighting device <b>110</b> is shown. An end cap <b>300</b> is shown attached to each end of the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. The end cap <b>300</b> in one embodiment snaps on to the channel case <b>306</b> and the lens <b>308</b>, however, a wide array of attachment configurations may be implemented without detracting from the spirit of the invention. The end cap <b>300</b> is preferably made of a durable plastic or metallic material and can be manufactured to fasten to other LED lighting system end caps <b>300</b>. The end cap <b>300</b> allows power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> to enter and exit the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. In another embodiment, electrical connectors protruding from one end cap <b>300</b> can attach to another end cap <b>300</b> electrically connecting the two LED lighting systems <b>111</b>. Further, the end caps <b>300</b> can provide integral strain to the electrical connectors of the LED lighting systems <b>111</b>. In another embodiment, the electrical connectors can be rigid or hard mounted and attach to other electrical connectors to form a solid connection.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The channel case <b>306</b> is preferably made of aluminum, however, a wide variety of materials may be used without detracting from the spirit of the invention, including but not limited to, metals and any heat conductive material. The channel case <b>306</b> is formed with a bottom and two opposing sides. The channel case <b>306</b> is an elongated box forming an interior space. The channel case <b>306</b> can also include integral mounting grooves for the lens <b>308</b> and for a circuit board <b>400</b>. The lens <b>308</b> is shown engaged with the channel case <b>306</b>. The lens <b>308</b> engages the opposed sides of the channel case <b>306</b> or the lens <b>308</b> can engage the channel case lip <b>504</b> of the opposed sides of the channel case <b>306</b>, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The lens <b>308</b> is a transparent plastic such as Lexan, or other plastics, or the lens <b>308</b> may be an optical filter permitting only certain colors of light to pass through the lens <b>308</b>. The lens <b>308</b> can be bent to form an arc or the lens <b>308</b> can be manufactured with an arc. The edges of the lens <b>308</b> engage the sides of the channel case <b>306</b>, enclosing the channel case <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are configured for ground and 28 volt. The LED lighting device <b>110</b> runs on a 28 volt system which can be powered from the aircraft, vehicle or building in which the LED lighting device <b>110</b> is installed. In another embodiment, the LED lighting device <b>110</b> is attached to a separate power supply or is attached to a regulator which is attached to the aircraft, vehicle or building. In one embodiment, the power regulator is capable of pulse width modulation and is capable of using a low electromagnetic interference wave form. In another embodiment, a feedback circuit may be coupled to the power regulator. The feedback circuit would modify that amount of power distributed by the power regulator to the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. The feedback circuit could include a temperature gauge and circuitry to assist in the modification of the amount of power distributed. Thus, as temperatures increase, the regulator would reduce the amount of power distributed to the LED lighting device <b>110</b>, thereby maintaining a desirable temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A circuit board <b>400</b> is shown disposed within the interior space formed by the channel case <b>306</b> and the lens <b>308</b>. The circuit board <b>400</b> can be manufactured using a standard printed wiring board (PWB) or using a standard printed circuit board (PCB). Either board provides for the mounting of electrical components including the LEDs <b>402</b>, diodes <b>404</b> and resistors <b>650</b> and <b>652</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The circuit board <b>400</b> typically consists of a non-conductive substrate upon which a conductive pattern or circuitry is formed. This conductive pattern of circuitry can be placed on either the top, bottom, on both sides or upon multiple internal layers of the circuit board <b>400</b>. The circuit board <b>400</b> can either be a rigid circuit board or a flexible circuit board. The LEDs <b>402</b>, diodes <b>404</b> and resistors <b>650</b> and <b>652</b> are electrically connected to the circuit traces on the circuit board <b>400</b>. The circuit traces of the circuit board <b>400</b> are further connected to the power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The diodes <b>404</b> are mounted to the circuit board <b>400</b> and provide voltage reversal protection to the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. Voltage reversal occurs when the power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are reversed resulting, in the ground line being attached to the 28 volt power supply and the 28 volt power line attached to the ground. Voltage reversal damages the LEDs <b>402</b> and can render the LED lighting device <b>110</b> unworkable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The LEDs <b>402</b> are mounted to the circuit board <b>400</b> and include white LEDs <b>402</b> manufactured by OSRAM, a division of Siemens. However, a wide variety of LEDs, colors and manufacturers can be implemented without detracting from the spirit of the invention. The LEDs <b>402</b> can be surface mounted to the circuit board <b>400</b> or the LEDs <b>402</b> can be hole mounted through the circuit board <b>400</b>. The LEDs <b>402</b> as shown in one embodiment are two LEDs, spaced apart, distributed down the center of the channel case <b>306</b>. The LEDs <b>402</b> of the LED lighting device <b>110</b> can be coupled into groupings within one single LED lighting system <b>111</b>. The LEDs <b>402</b> of a single grouping can be interspersed within other groupings of LEDs <b>402</b> of the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. If one group of LEDs <b>402</b> ceases to function, the overall output of light from the LED lighting device <b>110</b> is only slightly diminished and does not cause a block of darkness in the LED lighting device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a mounting bracket for an LED lighting system is shown. A mounting bracket <b>500</b> is shown attached to the channel case <b>306</b> of the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. The mounting bracket <b>500</b>, in one embodiment, snaps onto the outer edge of the channel case <b>306</b> and then is screwed or bolted into the interior of the cabin in which the LED lighting device <b>110</b> is installed. Heat sink fins <b>502</b> are shown on the channel case <b>306</b>. The heat sink fins <b>502</b> provide additional heat dissipation capability for the channel case <b>306</b>. The channel case <b>306</b> functions as a heat dissipation device with or without the heat sink fins <b>502</b>. A channel case lip <b>504</b> is shown as part of channel case <b>306</b>. The channel case lip <b>504</b> extends perpendicular to the opposed sides of the channel case <b>306</b>. The lens <b>308</b>, when attached to LED lighting device <b>110</b> contacts with the lip <b>504</b> of the channel case <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an end view of the LED lighting device <b>110</b>. LED lighting device <b>110</b> is shown including the lens <b>308</b>, the channel case <b>306</b> and two LEDs <b>402</b> mounted on the circuit board <b>400</b>. The circuit board <b>400</b> is attached to a thermally conductive layer <b>600</b>. The thermally conductive layer <b>600</b> is either fixedly or adhesively attached to the circuit board and is in contact with the channel case <b>306</b>. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the thermally adhesive layer <b>600</b> can be removably attached to the circuit board <b>400</b> or the thermally adhesive layer <b>600</b> can be an element of the circuit board <b>400</b>. Further, the thermally adhesive layer <b>600</b> can be fixedly or removably attached to the channel case <b>306</b>. The lens <b>308</b>, in one embodiment, applies a downward force on the circuit board <b>400</b> which compresses the thermally conductive layer <b>600</b> against the channel case <b>306</b>. The downward forces is from the lens <b>308</b> attempting to straighten the arc and from the force applied to the channel case lip <b>504</b> by the lens <b>308</b>. The thermally conductive layer <b>600</b> when in contact with the channel case <b>306</b> transmits the heat generated from LEDs <b>402</b> and the circuit board <b>400</b> to the channel case <b>306</b> which acts as a heat sink. In one embodiment, the thermally conductive layer <b>600</b> is manufactured from Chotherm; however, a wide variety of materials may be used as a thermally conductive layer without detracting from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">By transmitting the heat from the LEDs <b>402</b> to the channel case <b>306</b>, the overall temperature of the LED lighting device <b>110</b> is reduced. The internal heat produced by the LED lighting system of the prior art system identified in U.S. Pat. No. 6,158,882, issued to Bischoff, exceeds 80 degrees Celsius. LEDs <b>402</b> are manufactured to last in excess of 100,000 hours of use. However, when the surrounding air temperature of the LEDs <b>402</b> exceeds 40 degrees Celsius, the LEDs <b>402</b> begin to degrade and their usable lifetime is reduced. Temperatures in excess of 70 to 80 degrees Celsius greatly reduce the usefulness of the LEDs <b>402</b> and cause the LEDs <b>402</b> to cease functioning in a very short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the internal temperature of an enclosed LED lighting system, like the system disclosed by Bischoff, is capable of reaching temperatures in excess of 80 degrees Celsius over the ambient temperature within 10 to 12 minutes. Comparatively, the LED lighting system <b>111</b>, according to the present invention, only reaches temperatures of approximately 31 degrees Celsius over the ambient temperature after use for several hours as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> further shows that the LED lighting system <b>111</b> reaches a temperature of approximately 25 degrees Celsius over the ambient temperature within the first 20 minutes of use, leveling off to approximately 31 degrees Celsius over the ambient temperature over an extended period of time. This reduction of internal temperature greatly enhances the reliability and durability of the LEDs <b>402</b>, thus decreasing the replacement cost of the LED lighting system <b>111</b> while increasing the reliability of their use. The channel case <b>306</b>, with or without the heat sink fins <b>502</b>, provides for heat dissipation of the LEDs <b>402</b> without damaging the LED <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The channel case <b>306</b> of the LED lighting system <b>111</b> only reaches an external temperature of approximately 30-31 degrees Celsius over the ambient temperature. At this temperature, the channel case <b>306</b> of the LED lighting system <b>111</b> can be mounted against any surface, whether metallic or plastic, without causing damage due to excessive heat.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of the electronic system of the circuit board <b>400</b> of the present invention. The schematic diagram of circuit board <b>400</b> is shown. The circuit board <b>400</b> includes power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> providing ground and 28 volt power to the circuit traces of board <b>400</b>. The 28 volt power line <b>302</b> is connected to a reverse voltage diode or rectifier <b>404</b>. The reverse voltage diode or rectifier <b>404</b> protects the circuit board <b>400</b> if the power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are incorrectly installed and are connected to reverse poles.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Resistors <b>650</b> and <b>652</b> are connected to the circuit traces along with the LEDs <b>402</b>. Resistors <b>650</b> and <b>652</b> are current limiting resistors. As can be seen, the LEDs <b>402</b> are connected in serial on certain circuit trace lines and are connected in parallel with other groupings of circuit trace lines. LED grouping <b>654</b> is connected in parallel with LED grouping <b>656</b>. As has been discussed previously, the LEDs <b>402</b> of any particular grouping, such as LED grouping <b>654</b>, can be interspersed throughout the LED lighting system <b>111</b>. Therefore, if any particular LED grouping, such as grouping <b>654</b> becomes unworkable, then the non-functioning LEDs <b>402</b> of the LED lighting device <b>110</b> will be interspersed throughout the entire LED lighting device <b>110</b> and not contained within a block of LEDs <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an LED lighting system including multiple LED lighting devices connected in series. Multiple LED lighting devices <b>110</b> are daisy-chained together to form an LED lighting system <b>111</b>. A first LED lighting device <b>110</b> can be connected to another LED lighting device <b>110</b> through an electrical connection <b>900</b>. The electrical connection <b>900</b> connects the circuit board traces of one LED lighting device <b>110</b> with another LED lighting device <b>110</b>. Therefore, when the first LED lighting device <b>110</b> is connected to a power supply <b>902</b> through power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, all LED lighting devices <b>110</b> which are connected in series through the daisy-chain connections <b>900</b> are powered from a single power supply <b>902</b>. The single power supply <b>902</b> is also connected to a dimmer control <b>906</b>. The dimmer control allows for the increase or decrease of power to be sent from the power supply <b>902</b> to the LED lighting devices <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an LED lighting system including multiple LED lighting devices connected in parallel. In this embodiment, the LED lighting devices <b>110</b> can be connected in parallel to form a parallel LED lighting system <b>950</b>. Each LED lighting device <b>110</b> is connected the other LED lighting devices <b>110</b> and to the power supply <b>902</b> through a common electrical connection <b>952</b>. The common electrical connection <b>952</b> connects the circuit board traces of one LED lighting device <b>110</b> with each of the other LED lighting devices <b>110</b>. Therefore, each LED lighting device <b>110</b> is connected to the power supply <b>902</b> through power lines <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> and is connected to each other LED lighting devices <b>110</b> in parallel. The single power supply <b>902</b> is also connected to a dimmer control <b>906</b>. The dimmer control allows for the increase or decrease of power to be sent from the power supply <b>902</b> to the LED lighting devices <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The LED lighting device <b>110</b>, the LED lighting system <b>111</b> or the parallel LED lighting system <b>950</b> can be attached to the aircraft, vehicle or building. Each LED lighting device <b>110</b> can be screw mounted, bolted or adhesively attached to the interior surface of the cabin of the aircraft, building or vehicle. Further, each LED lighting device <b>110</b> can snap-on to the mounting bracket <b>500</b> which can be screw mounted, bolted or adhesively attached to the interior surface of the cabin of the aircraft, building or vehicle. Through the use of the daisy-chain electrical connections <b>900</b> or through the common electrical connection <b>952</b>, individual LED lighting devices <b>110</b> can be replaced in the LED lighting system <b>111</b> and the parallel LED lighting system <b>950</b> without replacement of the entire system. Further, by using the pigtailed electrical connections <b>900</b> and the pigtailed common electrical connections <b>952</b>, movement of the building, vehicle or aircraft will not cause damage to the LED lighting devices <b>110</b> as the LED lighting device <b>110</b> can move independent of the other LED lighting devices <b>110</b> in either LED lighting system <b>111</b> and <b>950</b>. Thus, the expansion and contraction of the vehicle, building or aircraft will not damage the LED lighting system <b>111</b> or the parallel LED lighting system <b>950</b>. Through the use of a single power supply <b>902</b>, the LED lighting device <b>110</b>, the LED lighting system <b>111</b> and the LED lighting system <b>950</b> produce a minimal amount of electromagnetic interference. Further, the rugged construction and design of the LED lighting system <b>111</b> and the LED lighting system <b>950</b> provide for enhanced durability.</p>
