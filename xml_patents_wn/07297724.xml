<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Photoinitiators for free radical polymerization reactions are provided that include triarylsulfonium ions and arylsulfinate ions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Free radical polymerization reactions can be photoinitiated. The photoinitiator system can be based on various chemical approaches. For example, free radical polymerization reactions can be photoinitiated using a three-component photoinitiator system that includes an electron acceptor, an electron donor, and a sensitizing compound. The sensitizing compound usually absorbs actinic radiation resulting in the formation of an excited sensitizing compound. The electron donor can donate an electron to the excited sensitizing compound. That is, the sensitizing compound is reduced and the electron donor is oxidized. The reduced sensitizing compound is a radical anion that can donate an electron to an electron acceptor to yield an initiating free radical for the polymerization reaction. The initiating free radical is the reduced electron acceptor. In some instances of a three-component photoinitiator system, the oxidized electron donor is a radical species that also can function as an initiating free radical.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other photoinitiator systems include a sensitizing compound and an electron donor but no electron acceptor. The sensitizing compound is usually an organic dye, an organic pigment, or an inorganic pigment. The sensitizing compound can absorb actinic radiation to form an exited sensitizing compound. The electron donor typically donates an electron to the excited sensitizing compound resulting in the oxidation of the electron donor. The oxidized electron donor is a radical species that functions as an initiating free radical for polymerization reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other free radical photopolymerization reactions, a salt such as a triarylsulfonium salt can generate an initiating free radical. Triarylsulfonium salts typically absorb ultraviolet radiation to form an excited triarylsulfonium ion. The excited triarylsulfonium ion can then photodegrade, abstract a hydrogen atom from another species present in the composition, and ultimately form a radical that can function as an initiating free radical for a polymerization reaction.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Compositions are provided that include a photoinitiator system for free radical polymerization reactions. More specifically, the photoinitiator includes an arylsulfinate ion and a triarylsulfonium ion.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Triarylsulfonium salts, in the absence of a sensitizing compound, typically cannot generate an initiating free radical for polymerization reactions when exposed to visible radiation. A photoinitiator system that can be activated using visible radiation is desirable for some applications. Visible light sources are typically less expensive and less hazardous than ultraviolet light sources. Additionally, compared to ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation can typically transmit more readily through various substrates such as polymeric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">One aspect of the invention provides compositions that include an arylsulfinate salt and a triarylsulfonium salt. The compositions can function as a photoinitiator system for free radical polymerization reactions. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the arylsulfinate salt can absorb actinic radiation to form an excited arylsulfinate salt. The excited arylsulfinate salt can transfer an electron to the triarylsulfonium salt resulting in the formation of an arylsulfinate radical. The arylsulfinate radical can initiate free radical polymerization reactions. In some instances, the reduced triarylsulfonium salt can photodegrade to produce other initiating free radicals.</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Suitable monomers are those that are capable of free radical polymerization reactions and typically include ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as monoacrylates, monomethacrylates, diacrylates, dimethacrylates, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The triarylsulfonium salts typically do not directly react with the arylsulfinate electron donors in the absence of actinic radiation, at least not at room temperature. The photoinitiator system can be activated by exposure of the photopolymerizable composition to actinic radiation. The actinic radiation typically has a wavelength of at least 250, at least 300, at least 325, at least 350, at least 400, at least 425, or at least 450 nanometers. The actinic radiation typically has a wavelength less than 1000, less than 900, less than 850, or less than 800 nanometers. For example, the actinic radiation can be in the range of about 250 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 300 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 350 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 300 to 850 nanometers, in the range of 350 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 250 to 850 nanometers, in the range of 250 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 400 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 425 to 800 nanometers, or in the range of 450 to 800 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Absorption of actinic radiation results in the formation of an initiating radical. The initiating radical reacts with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer to form a higher molecular weight radical that can react with other monomers resulting in the formation of yet higher molecular weight radicals leading to the formation of a polymeric material. In some instances, the polymeric material is cross-linked.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, visible light can be used to excite the arylsulfinate salt and activate the photoinitiator system. This can be advantageous because relatively inexpensive light sources can be used. Light sources emitting in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum tend to be less expensive than those emitting, for example, in the ultraviolet region. Other light sources that include ultraviolet radiation or a combination of ultraviolet and visible radiation can be used. Typical light sources include, but are not limited to, mercury vapor discharge lamps, carbon arcs, tungsten lamps, xenon lamps, sunlight, lasers, light emitting diodes, and the like.</p>

Thus, the triarylsulfonium arylsulfinate salts are often not limited to applications that include aqueous formulations or aqueous systems with a large amount (e.g., 30 to 70 weight percent) of a cosolvent such as an alcohol.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The triarylsulfonium arylsulfinate salt can be activated by exposure to actinic radiation having a wavelength in the range of 250 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 300 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 350 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 250 to 850 nanometers, in the range of 250 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 400 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 425 to 800 nanometers, or in the range of 450 to 800 nanometers. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the arylsulfinate ion typically absorbs actinic radiation to form an excited arylsulfinate ion. The excited arylsulfinate ion can transfer an electron to the triarylsulfonium ion resulting in the formation of an arylsulfinate radical.

The signal was digitized using a Model DI-151R5 Waveform Recording System (available from DATAQ Instruments, Inc., Akron, Ohio) and then stored and analyzed on a Dell OptiPlex XM 590 pc. Scans were run at 100 mV/sec scan rate.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The electrochemical measurements were made using a three-electrode configuration: a reference electrode, a working electrode, and a counter electrode. The reference electrode was a fritted electrode (obtained from Sargent Welch, Buffalo Grove, Ill.) that was filled with 0.01M AgNO<sub>3 </sub>in acetonitrile and fitted with a silver wire 1 mm in diameter by approximately 19 cm in length. The counter electrode was a platinum wire 1.0 mm in diameter and approximately 16 cm long (overall length) formed into a coil having a coil diameter of approximately 10 mm and a coil length of about 7.5 cm. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode, approximately 3.5 mm in diameter (obtained from BAS, Inc., West Lafayette, Ind.).

After the reference and counter electrodes were connected to the instrumentation, the working electrode was polished as described above and was then inserted into the cell. A background scan was conducted before the exemplary compounds were added to the cell. Then, approximately 10 mg of the compound was added to the cell and, after it had dissolved, the measurement was made to record the oxidation potential. The potential was determined as the voltage at peak current on the first scan. In this configuration, the oxidation potential of ferrocene in an identical electrolyte solution appeared at +0.1 volts versus the reference electrode.</p>

This solution was passed through a column of a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin (available under the trade designation AMBERLITE IR-120(PLUS) from Rohm and Haas Co., Philadelphia, Pa.) that had been acidified by washing sequentially with deionized water, concentrated HCl and deionized water until the pH of the eluate was approximately 5.5. The column was then washed with deionized water until a total of 2L of eluate was collected. The deionized water was removed with a rotary evaporator and the resultant intermediate was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 50° C.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The intermediate was then dissolved in 1L of anhydrous ethanol in a round bottom flask fitted with a magnetic stir bar, a condenser and a hose adapter that was attached to a source of nitrogen gas. This solution was stirred and heated overnight in an oil bath at 100° C. An additional 500 mL of ethanol was added to the flask and heating and stirring was continued for an additional 4 hours. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and was neutralized with alcoholic KOH to the bromothymol blue endpoint. The product precipitated from the solution and was isolated by vacuum filtration and was washed with anhydrous ethanol. The solid was dried overnight at room temperature to afford 75.1 g of product.</p>

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Each precipitated solid was extracted into ethyl acetate and then the organic phase was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator to afford the substituted benzenesulfinic acid as a colorless solid. Each of the solid substituted benzenesulfinic acids was dissolved in methanol to give approximately 10 weight percent solutions. Deionized water was then added dropwise to each solution until a precipitate just formed. Sufficient methanol was then added to the solution until all of the solid dissolved. Each aqueous methanol solution was neutralized with a 1M aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide, as indicated in Table 1, to afford the alkali metal salt of the substituted benzenesulfinate, which was isolated by removal of the solvent with a rotary evaporator. The data are given in Table 1.</p>

Cure time was considered to be the time that it took for the solution viscosity to increase so that the liquid no longer flowed in the vial as the vial was agitated. The mixture did not cure. After 40 seconds the mixture still flowed in the vial.</p>

<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The commercially available aqueous solution of triarylsulfonium chloride was dried using a rotary evaporator and then a vacuum oven. A mixture of dry triarylsulfonium chloride (1.0 g) and anhydrous ethanol (10 mL) was magnetically stirred at 40° C. for one hour. The mixture was then filtered through a pad of a filter aid (available under the trade designation CELITE from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee Wis.) in a fritted glass filter funnel. To the filtrate was added a solution of sodium 4-cyanobenzenesulfinate (0.52 g) in anhydrous ethanol (10 mL) and this mixture was magnetically stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was filtered and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in methylene chloride and this solution was filtered. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator to afford 1.54 g of product as a hygroscopic solid.</p>
