<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In semiconductor manufacturing, it is difficult to design and build a semiconductor chip having the same process for a positive channel field effect transistor (pFET) or negative channel field effect transistor (nFET) and the same characteristics in every batch of chips. Varying processes and characteristics of semiconductor chips from chip to chip can affect the performance of the semiconductor chip including the electrical behavior, set-up and hold times, off chip driver slew rate, etc. Sometimes these varying processes and characteristics can be so extreme that the semiconductor chip fails to meet specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A representative pFET or nFET of a semiconductor chip can be tested to determine whether the process for the pFETs and nFETs in the chip are fast (strong) or slow (weak). Based on the test results, action can be taken to offset any undesirable characteristics of the semiconductor chip due to the process. In addition, if an external voltage supplied to the semiconductor chip varies, by determining the variation, action can be taken to adjust for any effects the variation may cause. For example, by evaluating the characteristics of a pFET, nFET, and/or external voltage supplied to the semiconductor chip, an off-chip driver (OCD) on the chip can be adjusted as needed to compensate for any effects due to variations in the characteristics from nominal values.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One embodiment of the invention provides an evaluation circuit. The evaluation circuit comprises a test circuit configured to provide a test voltage indicative of a characteristic of a semiconductor device, a reference circuit configured to provide a first reference voltage, a first delay circuit configured to convert the test voltage into a first delay, a second delay circuit configured to convert the first reference voltage into a second delay, and a first latching circuit configured to determine a relationship between the first delay and the second delay.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a memory system <b>100</b> having a voltage/process evaluation circuit. Memory system <b>100</b> includes a semiconductor chip <b>102</b> and a memory device <b>106</b>. Semiconductor chip <b>102</b> is electrically coupled to memory device <b>106</b> through path <b>104</b>. Semiconductor chip <b>102</b> includes voltage/process evaluation circuit <b>108</b> and off chip driver (OCD) circuit <b>112</b>. Voltage/process evaluation circuit <b>108</b> is electrically coupled to OCD <b>112</b> through path <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, semiconductor chip <b>102</b> includes a receiver circuit, generator circuit, a set up and hold time adjustment circuit, or any other suitable circuit. In one embodiment, memory device <b>106</b> and semiconductor chip <b>102</b> are a single semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Voltage/process evaluation circuit <b>108</b> evaluates the incoming voltage supplied to chip <b>102</b> and the process of a negative channel field effect transistor (nFET) and a positive channel field effect transistor (pFET) in chip <b>102</b>. The nFET and pFET that are evaluated are representative of all the nFETs and pFETs in chip <b>102</b>. The evaluation results are passed to portions of OCD <b>112</b> through path <b>110</b>. Based on the evaluation results, portions of OCD <b>112</b> are adjusted such that chip <b>102</b> meets specified specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Voltage/process evaluation circuit <b>108</b> utilizes a number of circuits to perform the evaluations. A test circuit is used to evaluate the external voltage supplied to chip <b>102</b>. The supplied voltage is converted into a delayed clock signal, where the delay is proportional to the value of the supplied voltage. A reference voltage representing a nominal value for the supplied voltage is also converted into a delayed clock signal, where the delay is proportional to the value of the reference voltage. The delay proportional to the supplied voltage is compared to the delay proportional to the reference voltage to compare the supplied voltage to the reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Voltage/process evaluation circuit <b>108</b> also includes test circuits to evaluate the processes for the nFETs and pFETs in chip <b>102</b>. The test circuits provide test voltages indicative of the processes for the FETs. The test voltages are converted into delayed clock signals, where the delays are proportional to the values of the test voltages. Reference voltages representing nominal values for the test voltages are also converted into delayed clock signals, where the delays are proportional to the reference voltages. The delays proportional to the FET processes are compared to the delays proportional to the reference voltages to compare the processes for the FETS to the reference values.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">By converting the test voltages and reference voltages to delays rather than comparing them directly using comparators, power is conserved and process detection and evaluation is completed more quickly than if comparators were used. This voltage and process evaluation can occur each time chip <b>102</b> is reset or whenever desired.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Memory device <b>106</b> includes a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), double data rate (DDR) SDRAM, or other suitable memory. Memory device <b>106</b> communicates with chip <b>102</b> through path <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of voltage/process evaluation circuit <b>108</b>.
