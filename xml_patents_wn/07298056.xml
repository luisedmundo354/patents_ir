<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A turbine integrated within a hydrofoil extracts energy from a free-flowing motive fluid. In the preferred embodiment, the turbine is of the crossflow variety with runner blades coaxial to the width of the hydrofoil. The foremost edge of the hydrofoil comprises a slot covered by a continuously adjustable gate for controlling the overall drag imposed by the turbine. The hydrofoil mounts to a sailing vessel by means of a gimbal on a structure affixed to the hull, enabling the turbine to optimally respond to changes in direction of the free-flowing motive fluid and facilitating guidance and stability of the vessel. Both axes of the gimbal have a combination of auxiliary generator and motor with a locking mechanism. Engaging the motor and locking mechanism controls the guidance and stability of the overall vessel, and the pitch of the hydrofoil. Disengaging the locking mechanism and motor permits any change in direction of the motive fluid to affect the gimbal thereby extracting energy via the auxiliary generators. To further control drag and output power over a range of flow velocities, the preferred turbine comprises a DC generator with voltage feedback controlling field excitation, coupled to a voltage and current regulating circuit that performs electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen fuel. The hydrogen fuel tank also functions as the vessel's ballast having adjustable draft depending upon its fullness. Integrated remote control simultaneously optimizes vessel guidance, velocity, drag, stability, ballast depth, and electrolysis processes.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally in the field of power plants. More specifically, the present invention is in the field of hydrokinetic generators with means to adapt to changes in streamline direction and magnitude of a free-flowing motive fluid. Most importantly, the present invention maximizes net energy by utilizing a hydrokinetic generator mounted on a marine sailing vessel that also limits drag on the vessel in a controlled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Considering present humankind's primary source of energy, fossil fuel can diminish to the point of negligible net energy within this century; there exists a fundamental need for developing renewable and sustainable sources of energy including further exploitation of readily available known resources. More specifically, there exists a need for a novel approach to ensure least impact to environment and low civic infrastructure costs such that the energy investment return is most quickly realized. Utmost, to optimally exploit oceanic energy, which may be attained anywhere over approximately three quarters of the surface of the planet thus availing vast industrial growth potential, the main obstacle existing is the delivery from such an expansive source of energy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While many patents exist for harnessing energy from pneumatic and hydraulic sources, relatively few have considered a mobile structure to facilitate delivery of energy and maintenance and servicing of the structure. For instance, wind turbines mounted on abandoned off shore oil rigs, as well as both wind turbines and hydrokinetic turbines mounted on structures essentially resembling deep-sea buoys have begun to proliferate. These types of structures obviously do not adequately address delivery of energy considering their distance from the shore, the actual distribution center. These structures also impede maritime traffic and present maintenance difficulties especially in severe weather conditions. Another limitation of this prior art overcome by the present invention is that the density of water is approximately seven hundred seventy five times greater than air and thus a wind turbine must occupy an area seven hundred seventy five times greater than a hydrokinetic turbine in order to yield equivalent power given equal velocity of the motive fluids. The prior art structures utilizing hydrokinetic turbines yield power limited by the velocity of the motive fluid converted from wave motion alone. In contrast, a sailing vessel of limited drag may achieve velocities greater than the wind velocity thus illustrating one way in which the present invention optimally uses the advantages of combining hydraulic and pneumatic mediums. Even fewer patents so far have addressed the need to reduce drag caused by the mobile structure while engaged in the motive fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The reduction of drag, the combined exploitation of hydraulic and pneumatic energy mediums, and the integration into a singular mobile combined generation and delivery system with means to optimally respond in a controlled manner to changes in velocities of the media exemplify the patentable novelty the present invention holds over prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention achieves the goals of overcoming existing limitations of prior art oceanic hydrokinetic and pneumatic power generation systems foremost through integration into a singular generation and delivery system to extract power from free-flowing seawater while simultaneously exploiting wind energy. While prior art exists which functions in free-flowing bodies of water or wind, the novelty of this invention lies in its ability to respond and adapt to any change in the magnitude and direction of the streamlines of plural free-flowing motive fluids while controlling drag caused by moving in any direction within the mediums of wind and water. Through implementing a system to control vessel velocity given input parameters such as wind velocity, seawater current velocity, vessel mass and drag affecting actual velocity of the vessel, and feedback of generator output voltages; this enables the present invention to extract optimal energy from both pneumatic and hydrokinetic sources. Controlling the drag also facilitates maintaining overall stability and guidance of the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Secondly, because developing an integrated generation and delivery system which optimally adapts to changes in both magnitude and direction of the streamlines of plural free-flowing motive fluids formed the basis of the guiding concepts of the present invention; this readily avails the present invention the applicability to any body of water anywhere. Thus, the present invention does not require a large scale of infrastructure and therefore greatly diminishes the environmental impact while attaining a positive net energy earlier upon implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optimizing energy efficiency in the control of all processes including drag, ballast depth, vessel stability and velocity, and electrolysis of water in an integrated control loop positions the present invention as desirable for implementation in gathering energy for emerging power conveyance systems, especially hydrogen fuel and fuel cell technology.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is directed to a turbine-integrated hydrofoil for adaptively extracting energy from plural free-flowing motive fluids that continuously change direction and magnitude of flow. The following description contains specific information pertaining to various embodiments and implementations of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically depicted in the present specification. Furthermore, some of the specific details of the invention are not described in order to maintain brevity and to not obscure the invention. The specific details not described in the present specification are within the knowledge of a person of ordinary skills in the art. Obviously, some features of the present invention may be omitted or only partially implemented and remain well within the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following drawings and their accompanying detailed description are directed as merely exemplary embodiments of the invention. To maintain brevity, some other embodiments of the invention that use the principles of the present invention are specifically described but are not specifically illustrated by the present drawings, and are not meant to exhaustively depict all possible embodiments within the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a general perspective view of a vessel <b>100</b> implementing an exemplary apparatus in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts three turbine-integrated hydrofoils <b>101</b> engaged in the direction of the vessel <b>100</b>. The present invention may implement any number of a plurality of turbine-integrated hydrofoils <b>101</b>. The turbine-integrated hydrofoils <b>101</b> couple to the vessel <b>100</b> through corresponding beams <b>105</b> affixed to the hull <b>102</b> of the vessel <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> portrays a single hull <b>102</b> although implementation of a multi-hull structure does not constitute a substantial departure beyond the scope of the present invention. A design of adequate buoyancy of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> may supersede the implementation of any hull whatsoever. Further description of means of buoyancy within the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> and of an alternate shape of the hull <b>102</b> follows in subsequent paragraphs, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The length of beam <b>105</b> may extend to varying distances from the vessel's center of gravity through variable extension means <b>104</b> depending upon the velocity and stability of the vessel <b>100</b>. The variable extension means <b>104</b> may vary in length through a controlled stabilizing locking motor mechanism not shown, or through a hydraulic piston-driven turbine system not shown. The hydraulic piston driven turbine system extracts supplemental energy from the tension and compression forces on the variable extension means <b>104</b> when drag varies from one hydrofoil <b>101</b> to the next during a vessel <b>100</b> stabilizing process engaging plural turbine-integrated hydrofoils <b>101</b>. The beam <b>105</b> terminates at the gimbal mounting means <b>103</b> further described in a subsequent paragraph and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Below the waterline, the output fuel tank <b>106</b> affixes to the hull <b>102</b> through variable extension means <b>107</b> which varies the draft of the output fuel tank <b>106</b> by varying extension length depending upon vessel velocity and stability, and mass of the output fuel tank <b>106</b> affected by fullness thereby providing ballast. Sails <b>108</b> provide the ordinary means of extracting energy from pneumatic sources. Because the hydrofoils <b>101</b> mount upon a beam extension means <b>104</b> of variable length, the sails <b>108</b>, while not necessarily drawn to scale in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may significantly exceed the typical area of a sail for a vessel of a given hull size as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Furthermore, implementation of any area and material type for the sail <b>108</b> not explicitly addressed herein does not constitute a departure beyond the scope of the present invention. The mainmast <b>109</b> affixes the sail <b>108</b> employing means typically practiced in the art, though once again, due to the additional stabilizing effect provided by the hydrofoil mount beam variable extension means <b>104</b>, the mainmast <b>109</b> may significantly exceed the typical height of a mainmast <b>109</b> for a vessel of a given hull size as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A lightening rod <b>110</b> mounts atop the mainmast <b>109</b> in order to extract additional energy from electrical storm activity. Given a mainmast <b>109</b> extending to greater heights than typical mainmasts for a vessel of the depicted hull size, and also in order to extract optimal pneumatic and hydraulic energy the vessel <b>100</b> will plot a trajectory towards maximal weather conditions likely including electrical activity, the present invention thus extracts further energy through lightening strikes to the lightening rod <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a detailed perspective view of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>, which provides a fundamental and significant departure from prior art and considerable novelty in the present invention. The dashed line <b>200</b>-<b>201</b> represents the axis of rotation <b>216</b> of the entire assembly of the hydrofoil <b>101</b>. To minimize undesired mechanical oscillatory motion <b>216</b> that reduces efficiency and induces stress, the dashed line traverses through the center of gravity of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil. The rotation means <b>215</b> likely comprises circular bearings and serves two purposes. First, directly coupled through motor and locking means not shown, the rotation means <b>215</b> can adjust the angle of pitch of the hydrofoil <b>101</b> to optimize dynamic lift for variable vessel <b>100</b> velocities. Secondly, once the locking means not shown coupled to the rotation means <b>215</b> disengages, the motor not shown coupled to the rotation means <b>215</b> may operate as a generator extracting supplemental energy from rotational motion <b>216</b> caused by changes in direction of the free-flowing motive fluid. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize the rotation means <b>215</b> forms one axis of a gimbal, a second axis formed by the gimbal mounting means <b>103</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and described in a subsequent paragraph. The present invention thus adapts to any change in direction of the streamlines <b>202</b> of a free-flowing motive fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further shows the streamline <b>202</b> of the free-flowing motive fluid entering the gate <b>204</b> of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>, proceeding through the outline of the fluid coupler means <b>205</b>, and changing in pressure and velocity as indicated by the streamline <b>203</b> in the draft section of the turbine of different size and shape than the entering streamline <b>202</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the fluid coupler means <b>205</b> entails a cross-flow impeller design as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and described in a subsequent paragraph. As the flow passes through the fluid coupler means <b>205</b>, it impinges upon the lower surface <b>206</b> of the draft section of the turbine whereupon the gate to the electrolyzer may be found. Both the turbine gate <b>204</b> and the electrolyzer gate on lower surface <b>206</b> are illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The electrolyzer preferably sits in the area <b>209</b> between the lower surface <b>206</b> of the draft section of the turbine and the outer lower surface <b>208</b> of the hydrofoil <b>101</b> itself. One electrode <b>211</b> of plural electrodes and the electrolyzer membrane <b>210</b> are shown and further comprise temperature sensors not shown which in part determine the openness of the electrolyzer gate. By flowing from the input gate in area <b>209</b> through the exit gate in area <b>212</b>, the motive fluid of the turbine also serves as electrolyte as well as forced convection cooling fluid for the electrolyzer membrane <b>210</b> and electrodes <b>211</b>. The openness of the electrolyzer gate and the turbine gate <b>204</b> affects the overall drag of the hydrofoil <b>101</b>, and thus besides electrolyzer membrane <b>210</b> and electrode <b>211</b> temperature, the drag, stability, and velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> represent input variables into the control algorithm for opening the electrolyzer gate and turbine gate <b>204</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the anode electrode <b>211</b> is composed of, or plated with manganese dioxide to minimize the amount of sodium hypochloride, NaOCl, also known as sodium chloroxide or chlorine bleach that collects at the anode <b>211</b> while operating in salt water. Hydrogen gas output from the electrolyzer becomes sequestered in a storage tank <b>207</b> or in the area <b>213</b>. The hydrogen gas further enhances buoyancy of the overall hydrofoil <b>101</b>. Obviously, any change in position of gates or area that the electrolyzer occupies within the hydrofoil <b>101</b> in the preferred embodiment does not constitute a substantial departure beyond the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The remaining features depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> include the external fins <b>214</b>, and the support brace <b>217</b> directly coupled to the main strut <b>218</b>. The main strut <b>218</b> directly couples to a rotating member <b>300</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the rotational direction <b>301</b> allowed by the rotating member <b>300</b> affixed to the gimbal mounting means <b>103</b>.

The rotating member <b>300</b> likely comprises circular bearings and serves two purposes. First, directly coupled through motor and locking means not shown, the rotating member <b>300</b> can adjust the angle of attack of the hydrofoil <b>101</b> and thus with the external fins <b>214</b> behaving as the keel board of the vessel <b>100</b>, control guidance and stability of the vessel <b>100</b>. Secondly, once the locking means not shown coupled to the rotating member <b>300</b> disengages, the motor not shown coupled to the rotating member <b>300</b> may operate as a generator extracting supplemental energy from rotational motion <b>301</b> caused by changes in direction of the free-flowing motive fluid impinging on the external fins <b>214</b>. The present invention thus further adapts to any change in direction of the streamlines <b>202</b> of a free-flowing motive fluid. Let it further be known that given means to extract supplemental energy from the tension and compression forces on the variable extension means <b>104</b> and use of the external fins <b>214</b> and rotating member <b>300</b>, the utilization of the vessel <b>100</b> in a body of free-flowing motive fluid of constant direction may entirely obviate a sail <b>108</b> and mainmast <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates two positions of a suitable embodiment of a mechanism for the gate to the electrolyzer or the turbine itself. The left hand side of dashed line <b>400</b>-<b>401</b> portrays the view of the gate in a closed position while the right hand side of dashed line <b>400</b>-<b>401</b> portrays the view of the gate in the open position. The arrows <b>402</b>, <b>403</b> indicate the streamline of either the free flowing motive fluid <b>202</b> impinging on the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> itself, or the motive fluid <b>203</b> passing the gate of the electrolyzer on the lower surface <b>206</b> in the draft section of the turbine.

While the gate mechanism presented in this specification likely provides adequate if not optimal functionality, the use of any other gating means not explicitly described herein does not constitute a substantial departure beyond the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a fluid coupler, a cross-flow impeller looking along the axis of the rotor within the turbine. Dashed line <b>200</b>-<b>201</b> indicates the axis of rotation as stated before and viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where the outline area of the fluid coupler <b>205</b> first became manifest. Here <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the rotor <b>500</b> as motive fluid <b>202</b> passes over the plurality of runner blades <b>501</b> to finally exit as draft flow <b>203</b> after depositing most energy in the form of both impulse force impinging upon the blade <b>501</b> and reactive force when leaving the blade <b>501</b>. As this curved form of cross-flow impeller is well known within the public domain as derived from the Pelton water wheel concept for optimal energy extraction, the specification herein thus requires no further description. In light of the aforementioned, the modification of Pelton runner blades in the preferred embodiment is purely exemplary, illustrative and not restrictive. As previously stated, the fundamental goal of the present invention is to attain the highest possible net energy, in other words, highest return on investment in terms of energy, through implementing the simplest design. While the impeller herein presented likely provides optimal functionality, let it hereafter be known that any impeller, whether or not responsive to impulse and reaction forces, within a turbine-integrated hydrofoil responding to changes in direction and magnitude of the streamlines of a free-flowing motive fluid does not constitute a substantial departure beyond the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">This specification now refers to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a top-downward view of the outline of an alternate embodiment of the hull and mounting system. As previously stated, the vessel <b>100</b> may possess a single hull or a multiple hull structure, or no hull whatsoever given adequate buoyancy of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>. The outline of the hull <b>102</b>, indicated by lines <b>600</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents a most agile structure for maneuverability, guidance and adaptation to changes in direction of pneumatic and hydraulic motive fluids given the gimbal mounting means <b>103</b> previously described for the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>. The line <b>601</b> represents the keel board of the hull, mainly shown to clarify the view of the structure of the hull <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which otherwise serves no practical purpose given the external fins <b>214</b> of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Lines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> represent alternate embodiments of the beams <b>105</b> and variable extension means <b>104</b> previously described. Line <b>603</b> thus represents a pinion member acting upon a rack gear in the middle of line <b>602</b> to increase or decrease the length of lines <b>602</b>. Increasing the length of any singular line <b>602</b> increases the area of the triangle <b>602</b> formed by plural lines <b>602</b>, thus moving the gimbal mounting means <b>103</b> of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> located at the vertices of the triangle <b>602</b> away from the center of gravity of the vessel <b>100</b>. The pinion member represented by line <b>603</b> possesses the same features and characteristics of the variable extension means <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> such as a locking motor mechanism or a generator when unlocked to extract supplemental energy when tension and compression forces act upon the variable extension means. One may note that multiple sides of the triangle formed by lines <b>602</b> must act synchronously, with one advantage being less stress to any one member due to distribution of forces among multiple members.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a coupling configuration and energy extraction means from the impeller through to the output conditioning circuitry of the electric generator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the generator rotor shaft <b>500</b> directly coupling to a DC generator <b>700</b>. The DC generator <b>700</b> may also function as a motor by means of reversing armature current and with the use of the external fins <b>214</b> and rotating member <b>300</b>, may enable guidance and stability of the vessel <b>100</b>. The impeller, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in order to maintain simplicity, physically occupies the outline area <b>205</b> within the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>, while the shaft <b>500</b> extends along the axis of rotation, line <b>200</b>-<b>201</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The DC generator <b>700</b> may be any of available forms of DC generator, including but not limited to a commutated or semiconductor-rectified generator, and as shown with a separately-excited or else preferably with a self-excited shunt field winding <b>721</b> configuration chosen for its combined simplicity and relatively constant voltage independent of load current. The DC generator <b>700</b> thus produces a speed-dependent DC voltage across its armature leads, positive <b>701</b> and negative <b>702</b>, that feeds the power filtering elements, the inductor <b>703</b> and the capacitor <b>705</b>. Though two armature leads <b>701</b>, <b>702</b> imply a single-phase machine, this is purely exemplary, and no predetermination is placed on the number of phases of the machine in the preferred embodiment. The filtering performed by the inductor <b>703</b> and the capacitor <b>705</b> minimizes spurs in the electrical waveform caused by commutation. The preferred embodiment of this invention samples the filtered DC waveform at node <b>704</b> filtered by inductor <b>703</b> and capacitor <b>705</b> referencing the negative armature lead <b>702</b> to local ground <b>707</b> to form feedback that controls the average current through the field winding <b>721</b>. The feedback that controls the average field winding <b>721</b> current thus controls the torque opposing the impeller rotation thus controlling drag of the vessel <b>100</b> and ultimately the armature voltage depending on impeller rotational velocity and load current.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As previously mentioned, this form of feedback regulation allows relative scaling of mechanical parameters such as openness of the turbine gate <b>204</b> affecting vessel <b>100</b> drag in a coarse manner, ultimately affecting the power extractable for given pneumatic and hydraulic motive fluid energy levels. For power output means that draw a constant load current, this feedback control of field winding current can compensate for fine, instantaneous variation in the velocity and pressure of the free-flowing motive fluid <b>202</b> to produce a relatively constant armature voltage. This feedback control can also most quickly respond accordingly to changes in the free-flowing motive fluid <b>202</b> that impart varying levels of torque on the impeller affecting vessel <b>100</b> drag in a fine manner and thus avert potentially fatigue-inducing torque on the impeller during extreme conditions characterized by bow breaching and plunging motion imparting varying force on the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>. For instance, when the average voltage of the sampled, filtered DC waveform at node <b>704</b> exceeds a given threshold, the feedback control will reduce the average current passing through the field coil <b>721</b> which in turn, reduces the torque on the impeller while reducing the average armature voltage. Likewise, when the average voltage of the sampled, filtered DC waveform at node <b>704</b> recedes below a given threshold, the feedback control increases the average current passing through the field coil <b>721</b>, which in turn, increases the torque on the impeller for the benefit of increasing the average armature voltage. While load or armature current, i.e. the electrical current leaving the filtered node <b>704</b> and entering the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> may vary, responding to load current change may take a subordinate priority compared to responding to changes in motive fluid <b>202</b> pressure in order to avert fatigue on the impeller. In one case, an increase in extractable energy from the free-flowing motive fluid <b>202</b> or relative velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> coincides with an increase in demand for load current, therefore necessitating little change in average current passing through the field coil <b>721</b>. Similarly, a decrease in extractable energy or relative velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> from the free-flowing motive fluid <b>202</b> coincides satisfactorily with a decrease in demand for load current again necessitating little change in average current drawn through the field coil <b>721</b>. However, given the extractable energy from the free-flowing motive fluid <b>202</b> increases or decreases contrary to a decrease or increase in demand for load current, these situations can elicit limitations in the control loop response. These limitations may manifest in terms of delayed response time, that is, control loop parameters such as loop bandwidth and damping factor that primarily concern stability may slow a response time, producing inadequate transient output voltage or else excessive transient output voltage given a lesser bandwidth or incorrect damping factor. In addition, the design must take into careful consideration the overall headroom for meeting system demands during such instances, and thus varying loads require more design complexity. Therefore the preferred embodiment of this invention powers output means drawing constant current for optimal power conditioning for application to loads such as an electrolyzer, with the relative velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> also an input parameter in the overall control loop for the complete system as described in subsequent paragraphs and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Proceeding further along the path of the local feedback loop, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts two points on the filtered node <b>704</b> where sampling occurs. The path including the resistors <b>710</b>, <b>712</b> and the capacitor <b>711</b> constitute the voltage sampling node of a typical feedback loop with frequency compensation. The network of these resistors <b>710</b>, <b>712</b> and the capacitor <b>711</b> along with the error amplifier <b>709</b> and its own feedback loop represented by the capacitors <b>714</b>, <b>715</b> and the resistor <b>716</b> form the feedback section of a prior art switch mode power supply. Given the fixed internal reference voltage <b>713</b> into the non-inverting input of the error amplifier <b>709</b>, resistor <b>710</b> along with resistor <b>708</b> compose a voltage divider that sets the optimal voltage on the filtered node <b>704</b> that feeds the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> while this control loop responds to variations in the velocity of the motive fluid <b>202</b>. The reference voltage <b>713</b> multiplied by the quantity of one plus the ratio of resistor <b>710</b> over resistor <b>708</b> determines the optimal value of the output voltage of the filtered node <b>704</b> that the control loop maintains despite changes in input energy. The other sampling node includes the Zener diode <b>706</b> that quickens the response to over-voltage conditions at the sampling node <b>704</b>. Resistor <b>708</b> must be of correct value in order to allow the Zener current to flow through the diode <b>708</b> given this over-voltage condition. The design of the frequency compensation of this error amplifier must also take into account the junction capacitance, though often negligibly small, seen across the Zener diode <b>706</b> and parallel to resistor <b>710</b>. Resistors <b>712</b> and <b>716</b> and capacitors <b>711</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>715</b> form the frequency compensation of the error amplifier <b>709</b> within the feedback loop of a prior art switch mode power supply. While tuning these frequency compensation components is not germane to the specification of the present invention and is elsewhere covered in detail, this specification will now disclose some general observations regarding it. Uncompensated, the filter components, the inductor <b>703</b> and the capacitor <b>705</b> produce a complex pole pair at their resonant frequency given by one over the quantity of two times pi times the square root of inductance times the capacitance. The filter capacitor <b>705</b> also places a zero above the pair of poles at a frequency given by one over the quantity of two times pi times the capacitance and the value of the capacitor's <b>705</b> equivalent series resistance, “ESR”. Generally as a goal in compensation, two zeroes are added near the filter resonant frequency to correct the sharp change in phase near that frequency and an open-loop unity gain frequency is chosen to exist at a frequency about ten times greater than the resonant frequency but less than about 10% of the switching frequency. The overall gain of the error amplifier <b>709</b>, the filter components comprising the inductor <b>703</b> and capacitor <b>705</b>, the two zeroes added plus the gain of the integrator created by the compensation network that sets open-loop unity gain frequency preferably sums to zero at the unity gain frequency. The integrator gain is given by 1/(2(pi)(Fo)(R<b>710</b>(C<b>714</b>+C<b>715</b>))) where Fo is the open-loop unity gain frequency. The frequency of the output filter compensating zeroes equals 1/(2(pi)(R<b>716</b>)(C<b>715</b>)) and 1/(2(pi)(R<b>710</b>+R<b>712</b>)(C<b>711</b>)) and these zeroes are understood to add to 40 dB per decade of gain. A pole also exists in the compensation network and its frequency is chosen to coincide with the zero formed by the output capacitor <b>705</b> and its equivalent series resistance “ESR”. This compensating pole frequency equals 1/(2(pi)(R<b>712</b>)(C<b>711</b>)). A final pole in the compensation network exists at the frequency 1/(2(pi)(R<b>716</b>)(C<b>714</b>||C<b>715</b>)) and is selected to be about ¾ Fs, three-quarters of the switching frequency to reduce switching noise into the error amplifier <b>709</b>. While it is understood the precise placement of the pole frequencies, integrator frequency and zeroes frequencies is not of utmost criticality, care must still be taken to follow the aforementioned feedback loop frequency compensation practices to yield best power supply response and stability, and particularly a relatively constant output voltage <b>704</b> over the widely varying angular velocity of the rotor <b>500</b> resulting from the wide variation of energy within the free-flowing motive fluid. In the past, stability problems have risen due to a negative resistance oscillator formed by cascading switch mode power supplies. For example, the second switch mode power supply in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the output power conditioning means <b>724</b>, presents a negative resistance because its input current actually decreases with increased input voltage, which in turn may cause instability by adding right-hand s-plane poles in the characteristic equation of the control loop. To prevent this form of instability, the design must ensure the magnitude of the complex impedance of the source, i.e. the DC generator <b>700</b> along with the power filtering elements, the inductor <b>703</b> and the capacitor <b>705</b>, is much less than the magnitude of the input impedance of the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> over the entire frequency band of interest, from DC to the unity gain frequency of the feedback loop of the output conditioning means <b>724</b>. Careful consideration to all the aforementioned stability criteria ensures long-term reliability and optimal energy extraction over the widest possible range of velocity of the motive fluid <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Proceeding further along the feedback path depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after the error amplifier <b>709</b>, a pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> exists primarily to convert the analog error signal output of the error amplifier <b>709</b> into pulses which, after getting conditioned to source and sink large impulses of current by the gate driver buffer <b>718</b>, drive the gate of the field coil current switching field effect transistor <b>719</b>, ultimately determining the average current drawn through the field winding <b>721</b> of the DC generator <b>700</b>. The design of the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> preferably implements an analog comparator, not shown, that sets and resets logic according to the value of the sampled voltage <b>704</b> compared to a fixed reference. In this case, the analog comparator, not shown within block <b>717</b>, receives at its inverting input, the voltage signal output from the error amplifier <b>709</b>. The non-inverting input of the analog comparator, not shown, receives a DC voltage signal equal to that of the voltage reference <b>713</b>, in the same manner as the error amplifier <b>709</b>. The analog comparator within the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> thus compares the inverted output of the error amplifier <b>709</b> to a voltage equal to DC reference <b>713</b>. Since the comparator within the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> is an inverting amplifier referenced to the voltage reference <b>713</b>, the filtered output voltage <b>704</b> once divided by resistors <b>710</b>, <b>708</b> gets inverted through the error amplifier <b>709</b>, and this output gets inverted by this comparator. Therefore, the comparator output within the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> is a logic high signal when the filtered output voltage <b>704</b> is above the set voltage and a logic low signal when the filtered output voltage <b>704</b> is below the set voltage. This comparator output logic signal is routed out through logic means that finally inverts the signal into the gate driver <b>718</b>. Thus when the filtered output voltage <b>704</b> exceeds the set voltage, the logic means resets and along with the output of the modulation controller <b>717</b> and inputs to the gate driver <b>718</b>, goes low, disabling current flow through the field coil current switching transistor <b>719</b>. The logic means within the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> preferably permits the controller <b>717</b> to operate in an energy saving “pulse skip” mode. When the output voltage <b>704</b> exceeds the set voltage, skipping pulses saves the energy needed to charge and discharge the gate of the field coil current switching transistor <b>719</b>. As previously stated, the relative velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> presents an input parameter in the overall control of the vessel <b>100</b>. Here in the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b>, the input parameter of vessel <b>100</b> relative velocity may induce pulse skip operation. When the relative velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> recedes below a given threshold, the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> may thereby minimize energy lost in field coil <b>721</b> current as well as reduce drag on the vessel <b>100</b>. Let it hereafter be known that this means of controlling the average field coil current using switch mode techniques is strictly exemplary and not restrictive, and therefore any changes in configuration, such as but not limited to, choice of pulse width versus pulse frequency modulation, or the polarity of the output logic and according choice of N-type or P-type channel material of the field coil current switching transistor <b>719</b>, does not constitute a substantial departure beyond the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a separately excited field coil as the means of field coil excitation, a self-excited shunt field winding likely proves equally effective, if not more readily realizable due to the amount of current passing through the coil and convenience of not needing the physical space a separate supply <b>722</b> occupies. Note that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also depicts the catch rectifier <b>720</b> as a Schottky diode, that a synchronized switching transistor may be implemented in its place at the expense of greater complexity in the logic of the controller <b>717</b> and an additional gate driving buffer similar to gate driver buffer <b>718</b> but for the benefit of increased power efficiency. As well known by those skilled in the art, because the field coil <b>721</b> is inductive, when the current is switched, the field coil voltage is reversed proportional to the inductance multiplied by the change in current with respect to time. Using a simple catch rectifier <b>720</b> can protect the switching transistor <b>719</b> from over voltage while feeding that stored energy back to recharge the separately excited field winding source <b>722</b> or back into the armature terminal <b>701</b> in the case of a self-excited shunt field winding, thereby returning the stored energy in the field coil <b>721</b> back to the system, increasing the system power efficiency. A synchronous switching rectifier that has a lower voltage drop across it depending upon drain to source on-resistance and rectifying current compared to the catch rectifier <b>720</b> gains further efficiency. The complexity of the synchronous rectifier lies in the precision required to prevent the field coil current switching transistor <b>719</b> including its gate capacitance from having an on-time that coincides with the on-time of the transistor including its gate capacitance that replaces the catch diode <b>720</b>. Having on-times that coincide effectively short-circuits the field winding leads and thus short-circuits the field winding excitation source. Conversely, the longer delay in turning-on the synchronous rectifying transistor reduces the gain in efficiency. Digital timing circuitry within the controller <b>717</b> may achieve the goal of precise timing necessary, given a known tolerance for the gate capacitances of the switching transistors. Whether the system of controlling average field coil current implements a simple catch diode or a synchronous rectification circuit, both circuits remain within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While this specification previously presented a chopped field coil current controlled DC generator as the preferred embodiment, equivalent generator configurations exist within the scope of the present invention. In one embodiment, the generator <b>700</b> alternatively exists as an AC induction generator of adequate number of poles such that its synchronous speed, which determines whether the AC machine is operating in its generator or motor region according to its torque-slip curve and is inversely proportional to the number of poles, is well below the average rotational velocity of the rotor <b>500</b> and therefore the AC machine operates with positive slip as a generator. What makes the AC induction generator desirable is its economical, reliable construction and widespread use, rendering this type of generator easily attainable and cost effective. In the case of unavailability of an AC induction generator of sufficient number of poles for an adequately low synchronous speed to operate with positive slip given the average rotational velocity of the rotor <b>500</b>, the AC induction generator indirectly couples to the impeller through a gear system. This gear system increases the rotational velocity of the rotor shaft <b>500</b> with respect to the impeller. The gear system likely occupies the outline area of the fluid coupler <b>205</b> in proximity to the generator <b>700</b>. In order to directly apply the voltage from the AC induction generator to the load through wires <b>725</b>, <b>726</b>, the electrical circuit represented by output conditioning means <b>724</b> contains a speed dependent switch that receives an input signal from a velocity transducer sensing the rotation of the rotor <b>500</b> in the outline area of the fluid coupler <b>205</b>. The velocity transducer output signal therefore also needs to physically traverse the same path as the leads <b>701</b>, <b>702</b> either on its own conductor or modulated upon the armature coil power current. This speed dependent switch affords highest efficiency and protection such as when the coupler shaft has inadequate velocity for positive slip, or there exists a fault condition on either side of the output conditioning means <b>724</b>, the AC generator becomes disconnected from the load. This gear system including automatic transmission to change the impeller to rotor gear ratio to achieve constant output voltage amplitude over varying fluid velocities, rotational velocity transducer, and speed dependent switch effectively replaces the filtering components <b>703</b>, <b>705</b>, and the entire field current controlling feedback loop of the previously described DC generator system. The output conditioning means <b>724</b> could thus be physically located in the hull <b>102</b> away from the generator unit, with the leads <b>701</b>, <b>702</b>, routed from the generator <b>700</b>, through the support structure <b>217</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>103</b>, out along the beam <b>105</b> through the extension means <b>104</b> to the hull <b>102</b> location of the output conditioning means <b>724</b>. As with the leads before, the output conditioning means <b>724</b>, though only a pair of wires <b>725</b>, <b>726</b> is shown implying a single-phase system, this is purely exemplary with no predetermination of the number of phases that may be applied to the utility power grid.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Returning to the DC generator implementation, a variety of loads may be applied by connection to the leads <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> depending upon end user needs. Examples of loads include charging any variety of available chemistries of battery, or the leads <b>725</b> and <b>726</b> themselves terminating as the electrodes in the process of electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen fuel. In both cases here, the output means <b>724</b> will likely require the protection of the transient voltage suppressor <b>723</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as a Zener diode, from inductive spikes caused by commutation. Here in these examples of output loads as in all foregoing descriptions, the local ground <b>707</b> attached to lead <b>702</b> purely references the negative differential voltage output of the generator <b>700</b> and all other associated references in the field coil current controlling feedback system, not ordinarily referenced to true earth ground and thus not the chassis ground potential of the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> and for that matter, quite likely completely isolated from the negative differential voltage lead <b>726</b> from the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> which may or may not be referenced to a true earth ground potential.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case of the load being the charging batteries, the output conditioning means <b>724</b> could occupy a physical location within the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b> in the instance of the battery being the excitation source <b>722</b> for another DC generator <b>700</b>. But in other applications, because the process of battery charging generally requires low-error voltage sensing at the battery terminals and low-error temperature sensing from a thermistor within the cell packaging powered by an accurate reference, the design more feasibly and economically locates the charger section of the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> in proximity of the battery unit charging in the hull <b>102</b>. Therefore the leads <b>725</b>, <b>726</b> likely route high voltage from the output power conditioning means <b>724</b>, through the support structure <b>217</b>, <b>218</b>,<b>103</b>, out along the beam <b>105</b> through the extension means <b>104</b> to the hull <b>102</b> location of the battery and associated charger.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the preferred embodiment, the load is the current required to perform electrolysis on water to produce hydrogen fuel. This process achieves a high efficiency due to inherent advantages in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Seawater is naturally electrolytic thereby reducing chemical processing costs; and advanced electrolysis methods allow for a voltage as little as one and a half to two volts applied across the electrodes, which the generator <b>700</b> in the self-excited shunt field winding configuration can easily provide over a wide range of rotational velocities of the rotor <b>500</b>. Given the requirements for such a system for electrolysis, the output conditioning means <b>724</b> in one case consists of simply a very high efficiency synchronous switch mode buck or in other words, step-down DC-to-DC converter, with some form of current regulation, to provide the appropriate voltage to the electrodes <b>725</b>, <b>726</b> to perform electrolysis. In this case, synchronous switch-mode DC-DC conversion cannot provide isolation of the local ground <b>707</b> from true earth ground, which may or may not be tolerable for the configuration of DC generator <b>700</b> implemented, though desirable due to its simplicity and optimal efficiency. If the DC generator <b>700</b> absolutely requires ground isolation, then a flyback or forward DC-DC converter with synchronous rectification within the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> achieves the next highest efficiency. Because this output power conditioning means <b>724</b> is relatively simple and compact, it can occupy an area adjacent to the generator <b>700</b> within the turbine-integrated hydrofoil <b>101</b>, with the leads <b>725</b>, <b>726</b> routing conditioned DC power to the electrodes contained within the appropriate sections of the electrolyzer. For simplicity, the system preferably reduces wire losses by minimum distance routing a low voltage and high current through copper bars <b>725</b>, <b>726</b> to the electrolyzer where the power is then directly applied to the electrodes <b>211</b>. The leads <b>725</b>, <b>726</b> terminate as the electrodes, particularly the anode and cathode, respectively, for the electrolyzer, and thus the anode <b>725</b> references to true earth ground as the hydrogen collects at the cathode <b>726</b> while the system isolates both the gas and electrical potential at the cathode <b>726</b> from the surrounding environment. One means of using seawater for hydrogen electrolysis consists of admitting seawater through a filter membrane in a reverse osmosis process for desalination then adding potassium hydroxide as an electrolyte for increased electrolyzer efficiency. In the preferred means, the filter membrane is coarse enough to allow seawater with salt less the silica particulate, and the anode <b>725</b> is plated with manganese dioxide to minimize the amount of sodium hypochloride, NaOCl, also known as sodium chloroxide or bleach that collects at the anode <b>725</b>. This preferred electrolysis method saves the cost in energy to perform reverse osmosis desalination and processing the sodium chloroxide by-product otherwise an environmental contaminant.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternately, the output power conditioning means <b>724</b> may take the AC voltage produced by an AC induction generator in place of the DC generator <b>700</b> from leads <b>701</b>, <b>702</b> and full-wave rectify the AC voltage into a DC voltage, then filter and further regulate the voltage and current for optimal power conditioning for application to loads as described in the foregoing paragraphs regarding DC power generation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the overall control of all the components described thus far of the complete turbine-integrated hydrofoil for adaptively extracting energy from a free-flowing motive fluid that continuously changes direction and magnitude of flow. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> displays a flowchart, which is ordinarily associated with a computer program running in software, the algorithm delineated may be implemented with any combination of hardware or software such as linear or analog circuits or discrete digital circuits or an integrated central processing unit, or a microprocessor. A central processing unit or microprocessor affords the advantage of convenient means to gauge, test, and remotely communicate using well-defined existing wireless standards to a central service logging and energy distribution location, the state of any part or process of the system, including but not limited to functionality, guidance, stability, drag, velocity, or fullness of batteries or hydrogen fuel tanks. Furthermore, a local central processing unit or microprocessor may receive control signals guiding the vessel <b>100</b> towards maximal weather conditions from a remote control and service facility with means to track weather conditions. Such remote control means could permit unmanned operation of the vessel <b>100</b>. From the start <b>800</b>, the controller is continuously sampling and storing <b>801</b> such variables as position, velocity, acceleration, weight, and level of vessel; velocity of motive fluids; armature voltages; fuel tank fullness; electrolyzer temperature; and energy efficiency. From the sampling and storing <b>801</b> processes, the system control algorithm proceeds in two concurrent paths through the remainder of the flowchart. While not specifically stated in block <b>801</b>, it may be assumed all sampled variables including the signals representing various input parameters including the armature voltage are sampled and stored in a likewise continuous, concurrent manner as implied by the looping arrow exiting only to return to the upper right corner of block <b>801</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the period for sampling the motive fluids velocities has a time resolution necessary to react to and control mechanical processes, ordinarily sampling at an approximate frequency of about a hundred times a second, or a period of about ten milliseconds, with a small deviation allowable possibly due to the convenience of a local non-integer multiple frequency digital clock from which to derive this sampling clock frequency. This algorithm then averages the samples over a space of five to ten samples, this average representing a single sample in order to reduce the effects of noise. It is reasonable that the processes controlling motive fluid related adjustments such as turbine gate openness in block <b>802</b> need to occur, or most efficiently occur for that matter, no more often than ten to twenty times a second. The vector sum of plural motive fluid velocities is then computed to determine the vessel <b>100</b> trajectory to plot for optimal energy extraction by directing towards the highest relative vessel <b>100</b> velocity vector. This highest relative vessel <b>100</b> velocity vector then gets communicated back to a central remote control facility if implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In practically all conceivable embodiments, there always exists the path that serves to adjust the field coil <b>721</b> current to optimize generator <b>700</b> armature voltage, while minimizing the necessary torque exerted on the impeller and drag on the vessel <b>100</b> over a range of relative velocities of the free-flowing motive fluid <b>202</b>. Thus in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the path proceeds from the sampling block <b>801</b> to the process block <b>802</b>, where the instantaneous magnitude of the sampled generator armature voltage is compared to an upper threshold. This upper threshold likely equals in excess of one hundred percent of, but less than two times, the rated voltage of the generator <b>700</b>. Various types of circuits may perform this comparison through either digital sampling followed by numeric comparison or through analog means to control the average field coil <b>721</b> current such as the control feedback loop previously described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Hence, the outcome of this comparison in block <b>802</b> determines whether to increase or decrease the average field current accordingly. Using means described previously and depicted algorithmically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, this block <b>802</b> exists to process the sampled instantaneous magnitude of the output voltage to determine the average field coil <b>721</b> excitation current by means of feedback control processes applied in order to optimally extract energy from a free-flowing motive fluid. If implemented digitally, the number of samples per second corresponding appropriately to slightly greater than two times the unity gain loop bandwidth previously described, defines the sampling period per the Nyquist criterion. This digital algorithm, like the preceding analog circuitry, allows the generator to produce a maximum voltage while mitigating the risk of fatigue upon the impeller <b>205</b> throughout the extremes of usable flow, while also minimizing drag on the vessel <b>100</b> throughout the range of vessel <b>100</b> relative velocities.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The previously described paths through the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> perform mathematical manipulations on sampled output voltages of sensors in order to determine the appropriate course of action. It shall be known that any of the paths could share the outputs of these mathematical functions in order to improve the overall control algorithm. The previously cited example of this refers to when the relative velocity of the vessel <b>100</b> recedes below a given threshold, the pulse width modulation or pulse frequency modulation controller <b>717</b> may skip pulses that determine the generator average field coil <b>721</b> excitation current to minimize energy lost in field coil <b>721</b> current as well as reduce drag on the vessel <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> further shows by decision block <b>803</b> how the magnitude of vessel <b>100</b> relative velocity may feed into the control of most other processes. Block <b>804</b> deals with insufficient magnitude in vessel <b>100</b> velocity, whereby reduction in vessel <b>100</b> drag is in order to increase velocity, or minimize vessel <b>100</b> extreme instantaneous instability, hence reduce the average field coil <b>721</b> to reduce torque on the impeller <b>205</b> as well as close the turbine gate <b>204</b> and the gate to the electrolyzer depending upon temperature. Block <b>804</b> suggest two other means of reducing vessel <b>100</b> drag depending upon vessel <b>100</b> stability thereby increasing velocity including reducing the distance of the hydrofoil from the center of gravity of the vessel <b>100</b>, along with lifting the ballast <b>106</b>. Block <b>804</b> also suggests adjusting the pitch of the hydrofoil <b>101</b> to improve dynamic lift at the lower vessel <b>100</b> velocity. Block <b>805</b> deals with optimizing extractable energy once the vessel <b>100</b> attains sufficient velocity for the hydrofoils <b>101</b> to provide maximum dynamic lift. This action includes opening the turbine gates <b>204</b> and increasing the average field coil <b>721</b> excitation current resulting in increased armature voltage from the generators <b>700</b>. Another input parameter into this block <b>805</b> comprises vessel <b>100</b> stability, consisting of a computed standard deviation of level over many samples as sensed by accelerometers, gyroscopes, camera-based pattern recognition means, or any other presently available inertial displacement sensing means. In block <b>805</b>, vessel <b>100</b> stability and velocity form input parameters into control of distance of hydrofoils <b>101</b> from the center of gravity of the vessel <b>100</b> and control of ballast draft itself having a third input variable of fuel tank <b>106</b> fullness. Decision block <b>806</b> makes a high level decision affecting vessel <b>100</b> trajectory based on tank <b>106</b> fullness. If the tank fullness is below a given threshold as shown in block <b>807</b>, the vessel <b>100</b> stays its present course towards maximal weather conditions or maximal relative velocity vector as computed in block <b>801</b>. If the tank fullness appears above a given threshold, the vessel <b>100</b> should plot a trajectory back towards the central distribution destination to dock its payload, all the while adjusting ballast <b>106</b> draft according to aforementioned stability computations. While not explicitly depicted for sake of clarity in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it may be inferred that any deviation of the algorithm to include the additional use of these function output variables in decision blocks, or for that matter, use of a singular central processor to also concurrently perform these and other control tasks not explicitly depicted, such as, but not limited to: charging batteries; or performing electrolysis; maximizing energy efficiency; or electronic means of vessel <b>100</b> velocity, drag, stability, or guidance control; or logging communications; does not constitute a substantial departure beyond the scope of the present invention.</p>
