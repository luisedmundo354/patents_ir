<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of patterning a thick-film-paste-material layer, a method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission device and a method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission display.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the fields of displays for use in television receivers and information terminals, studies have been made for replacing conventionally mainstream cathode ray tubes (CRT) with flat-panel displays which are to comply with demands for a decrease in thickness, a decrease in weight, a larger screen and a high fineness. Such flat panel displays include a liquid crystal display (LCD), an electroluminescence display (ELD), a plasma display panel (PDP) and a cold cathode field emission display (FED). Of these, a liquid crystal display is widely used as a display for an information terminal. For applying the liquid crystal display to a floor-type television receiver, however, it still has problems to be solved concerning a higher brightness and an increase in size. In contrast, a cold cathode field emission display uses cold cathode field emission devices (to be sometimes referred to as “field emission device” hereinafter) capable of emitting electrons from a solid into a vacuum on the basis of a quantum tunnel effect without relying on thermal excitation, and it is of great interest from the viewpoints of a high brightness and a low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> shows a cold cathode field emission display to which the field emission devices are applied (to be sometimes referred to as “display” hereinafter). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a schematic partial end view of the conventional display, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a schematic partial perspective view of the display when a cathode panel CP and an anode panel AP are disassembled.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The field emission device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a so-called Spindt-type field emission device having a conical electron emitting portion. Such a field emission device comprises a cathode electrode <b>111</b> formed on a supporting member <b>110</b>, an insulating layer <b>112</b> formed on the supporting member <b>110</b> and the cathode electrode <b>111</b>, a gate electrode <b>113</b> formed on the insulating layer <b>112</b>, an opening portion <b>114</b> formed in the gate electrode <b>113</b> and the insulating layer <b>112</b> (a first opening portion <b>114</b>A formed in the gate electrode <b>113</b> and a second opening portion <b>114</b>B formed in the insulating layer <b>112</b>), and a conical electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A formed on the cathode electrode <b>111</b> positioned in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B. Generally, the cathode electrode <b>111</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b> are formed in the form of a stripe each in directions in which the projection images of these two electrodes cross each other at right angles. Generally, a plurality of field emission devices are arranged in a region (corresponding to one pixel, and the region will be called an “overlapped region” or an “electron emitting region” hereinafter) where the projection images of the above two electrodes overlap. Further, generally, such electron emitting regions are arranged in the form of a two-dimensional matrix within an effective field (which works as an actual display portion) of a cathode panel CP.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An anode panel AP comprises a substrate <b>30</b>, a phosphor layer <b>31</b> (<b>31</b>R, <b>31</b>B and <b>31</b>G) which is formed on the substrate <b>30</b> and has a predetermined pattern, and an anode electrode <b>33</b> formed thereon. One pixel is constituted of a group of the field emission devices formed in the overlapped region of the cathode electrode <b>111</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b> on the cathode panel side and the phosphor layer <b>31</b> which is opposed to the above group of the field emission devices and is on the anode panel side. In the effective field, such pixels are arranged on the order of hundreds of thousands to several millions. On the substrate <b>30</b> between one phosphor layer <b>31</b> and another phosphor layer <b>31</b>, a black matrix <b>32</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The anode panel AP and the cathode panel CP are arranged such that the electron emitting regions and the phosphor layers <b>31</b> are opposed to each other, and the anode panel AP and the cathode panel CP are bonded to each other in their circumferential portions through a frame <b>34</b>, whereby the display is produced. In an ineffective field (ineffective field of the cathode panel CP in the example shown in the drawings) which surrounds the effective field and where a peripheral circuit for selecting pixels is formed, a through-hole <b>36</b> for vacuuming is provided, and a tip tube <b>37</b> is connected to the through-hole <b>36</b> and sealed after vacuuming. That is, a space surrounded by the anode panel AP, the cathode panel CP and the frame <b>34</b> is in a vacuum state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A relatively negative voltage is applied to the cathode electrode <b>111</b> from an cathode-electrode control circuit <b>40</b>, a relatively positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>113</b> from a gate-electrode control circuit <b>41</b>, and a positive voltage having a higher level than the voltage applied to the gate electrode <b>113</b> is applied to the anode electrode <b>33</b> from the anode-electrode control circuit <b>42</b>. When such a display is used for displaying on its screen, a scanning signal is inputted to the cathode electrode <b>111</b> from the cathode-electrode control circuit <b>40</b>, and a video signal is inputted to the gate electrode <b>113</b> from the gate-electrode control circuit <b>41</b>. Due to an electric field generated when a voltage is applied between the cathode electrode <b>111</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b>, electrons are emitted from the electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A on the basis of a quantum tunnel effect, and the electrons are attracted toward the anode electrode <b>33</b> and collide with the phosphor layer <b>31</b>. As a result, the phosphor layer <b>31</b> is excited to emit light, and a desired image can be obtained. That is, the working of the display is controlled, in principle, by a voltage applied to the gate electrode <b>113</b> and a voltage applied to the electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A through the cathode electrode <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method of producing a Spindt-type field emission device will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A</figref>, <b>35</b>B, <b>36</b>A and <b>36</b>B which are schematic end views of the supporting member <b>110</b> and the like constituting the cathode panel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This method is in principle a method of forming the circular-cone-shaped electron emitting electrode <b>115</b>A composed of a metal material by vertical vapor deposition. That is, vaporized particles perpendicularly enter the first opening portion <b>114</b>A formed in the gate electrode <b>113</b>. The amount of the vaporized particles which reach the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B is gradually decreased by utilizing the shielding effect of an overhanging deposit formed around an opening edge portion of the first opening portion <b>114</b>A, so that the electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A as a circular-cone-shaped deposit is formed in a self-aligned manner. The method will be explained in which a peeling-off layer <b>116</b> is formed in advance on the insulating layer <b>112</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b> for easing removal of an unnecessary overhanging deposit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A</figref>, <b>35</b>B, <b>36</b>A and <b>36</b>B, only one electron emitting portion is illustrated.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">[Step-10]</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A conductive material layer composed, for example, of polysilicon for a cathode electrode is formed on a supporting member <b>110</b> composed, for example, of a glass substrate by a plasma-enhanced CVD method. Then, the conductive material layer for a cathode electrode is patterned by a lithographic method and a dry etching method, to form the cathode electrode <b>111</b> having a stripe form. Thereafter, an insulating layer <b>112</b> composed of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed on the entire surface by a CVD method.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">[Step-20]</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Then, the conductive material layer (for example, TiN layer) for a gate electrode is formed on the insulating layer <b>112</b> by a sputtering method. Then, the conductive material layer for a gate electrode is patterned by a lithographic method and a dry etching method, to form the stripe-shaped gate electrode <b>113</b>. The cathode electrode <b>111</b> in the form of a stripe extends in a direction rightward and leftward to the paper surface of the drawing and the gate electrode <b>113</b> in the form of a stripe extends in a direction perpendicular to the paper surface of the drawing.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[Step-30]</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Then, a resist layer is formed again, a first opening portion <b>114</b>A is formed in the gate electrode <b>113</b> by etching and the second opening portion <b>114</b>B is formed in the insulating layer <b>112</b> by etching, so as to expose the cathode electrode <b>111</b> in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B, and then, the resist layer is removed, whereby a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref> can be obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">[Step-40]</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>, a peeling-off layer <b>116</b> is then formed on the gate electrode <b>113</b> and the insulating layer <b>11</b> by oblique vapor deposition of nickel (Ni) while the supporting member <b>110</b> is turned. In this case, the incidence angle of vaporized particles relative to a normal of the supporting member <b>110</b> is set at a sufficiently large angle (for example, an incidence angle of 65° to 85°), whereby the peeling-off layer <b>116</b> can be formed on the insulating layer <b>112</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b> almost without depositing any nickel in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B. The peeling-off layer <b>116</b> extends from the opening edge portion of the first opening portion <b>114</b>A like eaves, whereby the diameter of the first opening portion <b>114</b>A is substantially decreased.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">[Step-50]</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Then, an electrically conductive material such as molybdenum (Mo) is deposited on the entire surface by vertical vapor deposition (incidence angle 3° to 10°). During the above vapor deposition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, as the conductive material layer <b>117</b> having an overhanging form grows on the peeling-off layer <b>116</b>, the substantial diameter of the first opening portion <b>114</b>A is gradually decreased, the vaporized particles which contributes to the deposition in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B gradually comes to be limited to particles which pass the central region of the first opening portion <b>114</b>A. As a result, a circular-cone-shaped deposit is formed on the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B, and the circular-cone-shaped deposit constitutes the electron emitting electrode <b>115</b>A.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">[Step-60]</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, the peeling-off layer <b>116</b> is peeled off from the insulating layer <b>112</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b> by a lift-off method, and the conductive material layer <b>117</b> above the insulating layer <b>112</b> and the gate electrode <b>113</b> is selectively removed. In this manner, a cathode panel CP having a plurality of the Spindt-type field emission devices can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the above display constitution, it is effective to sharpen the top end portion of the electron emitting portion for attaining a large current of emitted electrons at a low driving voltage, and from this viewpoint, the electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A of the above Spindt-type field emission device can be said to have excellent performances. And, the above manufacturing method of a Spindt-type field emission device has an advantage that a circular-cone-shaped deposit can be formed as an electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A in a self-aligned manner with regard to the opening portions <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B. However, the formation of the conical electron emitting portion <b>115</b>A requires advanced processing techniques, and with an increase in the size of the display and with an increase in the area of the effective field, it is beginning to be difficult to form the electron emitting portions <b>115</b>A uniformly all over the effective field since the number of the electron emitting portions <b>115</b>A totals up to tens of millions in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">There has been therefore proposed a so-called flat-type field emission device which uses a flat electron emitting portion exposed in a bottom portion of an opening portion without using the conical electron emitting portion. The electron emitting portion of the flat-type field emission device is formed on a cathode electrode positioned in the bottom portion of the opening portion, and it is composed of a material having a lower work function than a material constituting the cathode electrode for achieving a high current of emitted electrons even if the electron emitting portion is flat. In recent years, it has been proposed to use various types of carbon materials such as a carbon-nanotube as the above material.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the manufacture of the above flat-type field emission device, a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref> is obtained, and then a thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> made, for example, of negative-type photosensitive paste containing carbon-nanotubes is formed on the entire surface including the inside of the opening portion <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref>). Then, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> is exposed to exposure light (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>), further, followed by development, removal of an unnecessary portion of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> and then firing of the remaining thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b>, whereby an electron emitting portion <b>115</b> can be obtained (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37C</figref>). Reference numeral <b>119</b> indicates an exposure mask.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Meanwhile, before the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> is exposed, the exposure mask <b>119</b> is aligned in relation to a reference marker (not shown) that is provided beforehand, so that the exposure mask <b>119</b> and the opening portion <b>114</b> are not out of position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, the supporting member <b>110</b> undergoes deformation, for example, due to a thermal history of the supporting member <b>110</b> or stresses of various layers (cathode electrode <b>111</b>, insulating layer <b>112</b>, gate electrode <b>113</b>, etc.) formed on the supporting member <b>110</b>. As a result, when the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> is exposed, an alignment failure actually takes place between the exposure mask <b>119</b> and the opening portion <b>114</b> in many places. When such a phenomenon occurs, the distance from the opening end portion of the first opening portion <b>114</b>A formed in the gate electrode <b>113</b> to the electron emitting portion <b>115</b> positioned in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>114</b>B varies, and as a result, the electron emissions from the electron emitting portions <b>115</b> vary, which causes display non-uniformity. In the worst case, part of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> is left on the side wall of the opening portion <b>114</b>, so that a short circuit is formed between the gate electrode <b>113</b> and the cathode electrode <b>111</b> by such a thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One means that is thinkable to overcome the above problem is a method in which a resist-material layer <b>120</b> for covering the side wall of the opening portion <b>114</b>, the gate electrode <b>113</b> and the insulating layer <b>112</b> is formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref>) after the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref> is obtained, a negative-type thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> containing carbon-nanotubes is formed on the entire surface including the inside of the opening portion <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>). In the above method, however, the resist-material layer <b>120</b> is dissolved by the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b>, which actually results in a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref> instead of bringing about a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>, so that it is no longer significant to provide the resist-material layer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another method may be thinkable, in which a mask layer made of a material insusceptible to the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> is formed in place of the resist-material layer <b>120</b>. That is, a mask layer made of a material insusceptible to the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>122</b> is formed on the entire surface including the inside of the opening portion <b>114</b>, a resist layer is formed on the mask layer, an opening portion is formed through the resist layer positioned above the bottom portion of the opening portion, the mask layer is etched with using the resist layer as an etching mask, and then resist layer is removed, thereby to remove the mask layer from the bottom portion of the opening portion. However, this method is complicated and requires an additional cost.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of patterning a thick-film-paste-material layer with a resist material without any problem, a method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission device in which an electron emitting portion made of a thick-film-paste-material can be formed with a resist material without any problem, and a method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission display, to which the above method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission device is applied.</p>

When bonding of the three members or bonding at the second stage is carried out in a high-vacuum atmosphere, a space surrounded by the substrate, the supporting member, the frame and the adhesive layer comes to be a vacuum space upon bonding. Otherwise, after the three members are bonded, the space surrounded by the substrate, the supporting member, the frame and the adhesive layer may be vacuumed to obtain a vacuum space. When the vacuuming is carried out after the bonding, the pressure in an atmosphere during the bonding may be any one of atmospheric pressure and reduced pressure, and the gas constituting the atmosphere may be ambient atmosphere or an inert gas containing nitrogen gas or a gas (for example, Ar gas) coming under the group O of the periodic table.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">When the vacuuming is carried out after the bonding, the vacuuming can be carried out through a tip tube pre-connected to the substrate and/or the supporting member.

After the space reaches a predetermined vacuum degree, the tip tube is sealed by thermal fusion. It is preferred to heat and then temperature-decrease the cold cathode field emission display as a whole before the sealing, since residual gas can be released into the space, and the residual gas can be removed out of the space by vacuuming.</p>

As a result, the phosphor layer <b>31</b> is excited to emit light, and a desired image can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The method of manufacturing a field emission device and the method of manufacturing a display in Example 3 will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B and <b>6</b>A to <b>6</b>C hereinafter. In drawings for explaining the method of manufacturing a field emission device, there is shown only one electron emitting portion or a component thereof in an overlap region of the cathode electrode <b>11</b> and the gate electrode <b>13</b> or on the cathode electrode, for simplification of the drawings. Actually, however, one or a plurality of electron emitting portions is/are formed in the overlap region of the cathode electrode <b>11</b> and the gate electrode <b>13</b> or on the cathode electrode.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">[Step-300]</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">First, a stripe-shaped cathode electrode <b>11</b> made of an approximately 0.2 μm thick chromium (Cr) layer is formed on a supporting member <b>10</b> made, for example, of a glass substrate, for example, by a sputtering method and an etching technique. The cathode electrode <b>11</b> extends in a first direction (direction perpendicular to the paper surface of the drawing). The cathode electrode <b>11</b> may be formed by the method explained in Example 1 or Example 2.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">[Step-310]</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Then, an insulating layer <b>12</b> is formed on the entire surface, specifically, on the supporting member <b>10</b> and the cathode electrode <b>11</b>. Specifically, the insulating layer <b>12</b> having a thickness of approximately 1 μm is formed on the entire surface, for example, by a CVD method using TEOS (tetraethoxysilane) as a source gas.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">[Step-320]</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Then, the stripe-shaped gate electrode <b>13</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>12</b>. The gate electrode <b>13</b> extends in a second direction (leftward and rightward on the paper surface of the drawings) different from the first direction. Then, a resist layer is formed on the insulating layer <b>12</b> and the stripe-shaped gate electrode <b>13</b>, and then the first opening portion <b>14</b>A is formed through the gate electrode <b>13</b>. Further, the second opening portion <b>14</b>B communicating with the first opening portion <b>14</b>A formed through the gate electrode <b>13</b> is formed through the insulating layer <b>12</b>, and then the resist layer is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). The cathode electrode <b>11</b> is exposed in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>14</b>B. In the following explanations, the first opening portion <b>14</b>A and the second opening portion <b>14</b>B will be sometimes expressed as “opening portion <b>14</b>”.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">[Step-330]</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">A resist-material layer <b>20</b> covering the side wall of the opening portion <b>14</b>, the gate electrode <b>13</b> and the insulating layer <b>12</b> is then formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Specifically, in the same manner as in Example 1, the resist-material layer <b>20</b> made of a positive-type resist material (THMR-iP5720HP, supplied by Tokyo Ouka Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha) produced from a novolak resin and 2-heptanone is formed on the entire surface including the inside of the opening portion <b>14</b> by a spin coating method, and then, the resist-material layer <b>20</b> is patterned by a lithography technique, to expose the central portion of the cathode electrode <b>11</b> positioned in the bottom portion of the second opening portion <b>14</b>B.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">[Step-340]</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Then, the surface of the resist-material layer <b>20</b> is modified in the same manner as in [Step-110] of Example 1, to form a modified layer <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">[Step-350]</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Then, a photosensitive thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is formed at least in the opening portion <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). That is, the “step of forming a photosensitive thick-film-paste-material layer” is carried out. Specifically, the photosensitive thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is printed on the entire surface including the inside of the opening portion <b>14</b> by a screen printing method. The photosensitive thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> that is used in this case is composed of a so-called negative-type resin (a resin having a property that it undergoes polymerization or crosslinking under irradiation with exposure light to become insoluble or sparingly soluble in a developer solution and remains after development, and, for example, consisting of an acryl monomer), an acrylic resin and a material having an electron emission function. The material having an electron emission function is a carbon-nanotube structure, and more specifically, the carbon-nanotube is produced by an arc discharge method and has an average diameter of 30 nm and an average length of 1 μm. The above thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> will be used in Examples to be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000">[Step-360]</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Then, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is irradiated with exposure light from the front-surface side of the supporting member <b>10</b> to expose that portion of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> which portion is positioned in the bottom portion of the opening portion <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). The thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is then developed, to remove an unexposed thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b>, and then the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is dried at 80° C. for 20 minutes to remove the solvent in the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b>. In the above manner, there can be obtained an electron emitting portion <b>15</b> composed of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> on the cathode electrode <b>11</b> positioned in the bottom portion of the opening portion <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). Reference numeral <b>19</b> indicates an exposure light shielding material (mask).</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">[Step-370]</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Then, the ashing treatment is carried out in the same manner as in [Step-240] of Example 2, and the modified layer <b>21</b> in the surface of the resist-material layer, which modified layer <b>21</b> is formed in [Step-340], is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">[Step-380]</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Then, the resist-material layer <b>20</b> is removed with acetone (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>). Since the modified layer <b>21</b> in the surface of the resist-material layer has been removed in [Step-370], the resist-material layer <b>20</b> can be reliably removed. Then, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is fired at 500° C. for 20 minutes.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">[Step-390]</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Then, the display is assembled. Specifically, the anode panel AP and the cathode panel CP are arranged such that the phosphor layer <b>31</b> and the field emission device face each other, and the anode panel AP and the cathode panel CP (more specifically, the substrate <b>30</b> and the supporting member <b>10</b>) are bonded to each other in their circumferential portions through the frame <b>34</b>. In the bonding, a frit glass is applied to bonding portions of the frame <b>34</b> and the anode panel AP and bonding portions of the frame <b>34</b> and the cathode panel CP. Then, the anode panel AP, the cathode panel CP and the frame <b>34</b> are attached. The frit glass is pre-calcined or pre-sintered to be dried, and then fully calcined or sintered at approximately 450° C. for 10 to 30 minutes. Then, a space surrounded by the anode panel AP, the cathode panel CP, the frame <b>34</b> and the frit glass is vacuumed through a through-hole <b>36</b> and a tip tube <b>37</b>, and when the space comes to have a pressure of approximately 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa, the tip tube is sealed by thermal fusion. In the above manner, the space surrounded by the anode panel AP, the cathode panel CP and the frame <b>34</b> can be vacuumed. Then, wiring to external circuits is carried out to complete the display.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">When [Step-340] was omitted for comparison, the resist-material layer <b>20</b> disappeared upon completion of [Step-360], and it was impossible to form any desired electron emitting portion <b>15</b>. Further, when [Step-370] was omitted, the resist-material layer <b>20</b> remained as a residue during the peeling of the resist-material layer <b>20</b>. When the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> was fired in [Step-380], the resist-material layer <b>20</b> was carbonized and remained. Further, when supersonic irradiation was employed in combination during the peeling of the resist-material layer <b>20</b> so that the resist-material layer <b>20</b> did not remain as a residue, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> before the firing was peeled off from the cathode electrode <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">In the method of manufacturing a field emission device, some or all of the carbon-nanotubes may change in their surface state (for example, oxygen atoms or oxygen molecules are adsorbed to their surfaces), and the carbon-nanotubes are deactivated with respect of electric field emission in some cases. In this case, after the [Step-380], it is preferred to subject the electron-emitting portion <b>15</b> to a plasma treatment in a hydrogen gas atmosphere. By the plasma treatment, the electron-emitting portion <b>15</b> is activated, and the efficiency of emission of electrons from the electron-emitting portion <b>15</b> is further improved. Table 5 shows an example of a plasma treatment condition. The plasma treatment can be applied to the various Examples which will be explained hereinafter.</p>

<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Example 4 concerns the method of manufacturing a field emission device and the method of manufacturing a display according to the second aspect of the present invention, and also concerns the manufacturing method-A of the present invention. Further, Example 4 concerns a variant of the method of patterning a thick-film-paste-material layer according to the second aspect of the present invention. The field emission devices in Example 4 and Examples 5 and 6 to be described later are similar in constitution and structure, so that detailed explanations thereof will be omitted. Further, the displays in Example 4 and Examples 5 to 9 to be described later are similar in constitution and structure to the field emission device and the display in Example 3, so that detailed explanations thereof will be omitted. In Example 4, a hole portion <b>11</b>A reaching a supporting member <b>10</b> is formed in that portion of a cathode electrode <b>11</b> which portion is positioned in the bottom portion of an opening portion <b>14</b>. An electron emitting portion <b>15</b> spreads from that portion of the cathode electrode <b>11</b> which portion is positioned in the bottom portion of the opening portion <b>14</b> to the inside of the hole portion <b>11</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The method of manufacturing a field emission device and the method of manufacturing a display in Example 4 will be explained below with reference to FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>C, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B.</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0274">First, a cathode electrode <b>11</b> is formed on the front surface (first surface) of a supporting member <b>10</b> that transmits exposure light. The cathode electrode <b>11</b> has a hole portion <b>11</b>A in the bottom portion of which the supporting member is exposed, is composed of a material that transmits no exposure light and extends in a first direction (direction perpendicular to the paper surface of the drawings). That is, the “cathode-electrode-forming step” is carried out. Specifically, for example, photosensitive silver paste is printed on the front surface (first surface) of the supporting member <b>10</b> made of a glass substrate transmittable to exposure light (ultraviolet ray for exposure), such as a white sheet glass (B-270, supplied by SCHOTT), a blue sheet glass (soda lime glass) or an alkali-free glass (OA2, supplied by Nippon Denki Glass Kabushiki Kaisha). Then, the photosensitive silver paste is irradiated with exposure light through a photomask, followed by development and firing. In the above manner, there can be obtained the stripe-shaped cathode electrode <b>11</b> having the hole portion <b>11</b>A in the bottom portion of which the supporting member is exposed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).

<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Example 10 concerns the method of manufacturing a field emission device and the method of manufacturing a display according to the fourth aspect of the present invention. The displays in Examples 12 and 14 to be explained later are substantially the same as the field emission device and the display in Example 10 in constitution and structure, so that detailed explanations of the displays in Examples 12 and 14 will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">The display in Example 10 is a so-called two-electrode-type display constituted of a cathode electrode and an anode electrode, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a schematic partial cross-sectional view thereof. The field emission device in the above display comprises a cathode electrode <b>11</b> formed on a supporting member <b>10</b> and an electron emitting portion <b>15</b> formed on the cathode electrode <b>11</b>. Unlike the display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an anode electrode <b>33</b>A constituting an anode panel AP is in the form of a stripe. The projection image of the cathode panel <b>11</b> in the form of a stripe and the projection image of the anode electrode <b>33</b>A in the form of a stripe cross each other at right angles. Specifically, the cathode electrode <b>11</b> extends in the direction perpendicular to the paper surface of the drawings, and the anode electrode <b>33</b>A extends leftward and rightward on the paper surface of the drawings. In a cathode panel CP in the display, a great number of electron emitting regions constituted of a plurality of the above field emission devices each are formed in the form of a two-dimensional matrix in an effective field.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">In the above display, electrons are emitted from the electron emitting portion <b>15</b> on the basis of a quantum effect due to an electric field formed by the anode electrode <b>33</b>A, and the electrons are drawn to the anode electrode <b>33</b>A to collide with a phosphor layer <b>31</b>. That is, the display is driven by a so-called simple matrix method in which electrons are emitted from the electron emitting portion <b>15</b> positioned in a region where the projection image of the anode electrode <b>33</b>A and the projection image of the cathode electrode <b>11</b> overlap (anode electrode/cathode electrode overlap region). Specifically, a relatively negative voltage is applied to the cathode electrode <b>11</b> from a cathode-electrode control circuit <b>40</b>, and a relatively positive voltage is applied to the anode electrode <b>33</b>A from an anode-electrode control circuit <b>42</b>. As a result, electrons are emitted into the vacuum space selectively from the electron emitting portion <b>15</b> positioned in the anode electrode/cathode electrode overlap region of a column-selected cathode electrode and a row-selected anode electrode (or a row-selected cathode electrode and a column-selected anode electrode), and the electrons are drawn toward the anode electrode <b>33</b>A and collide with the phosphor layer <b>31</b> constituting the anode panel AP, to excite and cause the phosphor layer <b>31</b> to emit light.</p>

<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Then, a photosensitive thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is formed in the same manner as in [Step-350] of Example 3. Specifically, the photosensitive thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is printed on the entire surface by a screen printing method (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>). Then, the reverse surface (second surface) of the supporting member <b>10</b> is irradiated with exposure light (specifically, ultraviolet ray) with using the hole portion <b>11</b>A as an exposure mask, to expose that portion of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> which portion is above the hole portion <b>11</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>). When the reverse surface (second surface) of the supporting member <b>10</b> is irradiated with exposure light with using the hole portion <b>11</b>A as an exposure mask, preferably, an exposure light shielding material (mask <b>19</b>) is arranged on the reverse surface (second surface) of the supporting member <b>10</b> so that a portion of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b>, which portion is not to be exposed to the exposure light, is not exposed to the exposure light. Then, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is developed to remove an unexposed thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b>, and then the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is dried at 80° C. for 20 minutes to remove the solvent in the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b>. In the above manner, that portion of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> which portion is above the hole portion <b>11</b>A is left, and the electron emitting portion <b>15</b> constituted of the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is formed on the light-transmitting layer <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>).

Since the modified layer <b>21</b> in the surface of the resist-material layer is removed by the ashing treatment, the resist-material layer <b>20</b> can be reliably removed. Then, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> is fired in the same manner as in [Step-380] of Example 3.</p>

<p id="p-0390" num="0389">On the other hand, when supersonic irradiation was employed in combination during the peeling of the resist-material layer <b>20</b> so that the resist-material layer <b>20</b> did not remain as a residue, the thick-film-paste-material layer <b>22</b> before the firing was peeled off from the light-transmitting layer <b>25</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0114" level="1">EXAMPLE 15</heading>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">Example 15 concerns the method of manufacturing a field emission device and the method of manufacturing a display according to the ninth aspect of the present invention. The field emission device and the display in Example 15 are substantially similar to the field emission device and the display explained in Example 7 in constitution and structure, so that detailed explanations thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The method of manufacturing a field emission device and the method of manufacturing a display in Example 15 will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0393" num="0392">[Step-1400] to [Step-1440] of Example 14 are carried out.</p>
<p id="h-0116" num="0000">[Step-1510]</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">Then, an insulating layer <b>12</b> is formed on the entire surface in the same manner as in [Step-310] of Example 3. Then, a gate electrode <b>13</b> extending in a second direction different from the first direction is formed on the insulating layer <b>12</b> in the same manner as in [Step-320] of Example 3 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</figref>). Then, an opening portion is formed through the gate electrode <b>13</b> and the insulating layer <b>12</b> (that is, a first opening portion <b>14</b>A is formed through the gate electrode and further, a second opening portion <b>14</b>B is formed through the insulating layer <b>12</b>), and an electron emitting portion <b>15</b> is exposed in the bottom portion of the opening portion (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0117" num="0000">[Step-1520]</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Then, the display is assembled in the same manner as in [Step-390] of Example 3.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">While the present invention has been explained on the basis of preferred Examples, the present invention shall not be limited thereto. The constitutions and structures explained with regard to the anode panel, the cathode panel, the displays and the field emission devices in Examples are given as examples and may be modified as required. The manufacturing method, various conditions and materials explained with regard to the anode panel, the cathode panel, the displays and the field emission devices are given as examples and may be modified as required. Further, the various materials used in the manufacture of the anode panels and the cathode panels are also given as examples and may be changed as required. With regard to the display, color displays are explained as examples, while the display may be a monochromatic display.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">A focus electrode may be formed in the three-electrodes-type display. The above focus electrode is provided for converging the pass of electrons which are emitted through the opening portion and attracted toward the anode electrode so that the brightness can be improved and that an optical crosstalk among neighboring pixels can be prevented. The focus electrode is effective particularly for a so-called high-voltage-type display in which the anode electrode and the cathode electrode have a potential difference on the order of several kilovolts and have a relatively large distance from one to the other. A relatively negative voltage is applied to the focus electrode from a focus-electrode control circuit. It is not necessarily required to provide the focus electrode provided in every field emission device. For example, the focus electrode may be extended in a predetermined direction in which the field emission devices are arranged, so that a common focusing effect can be exerted on a plurality of the field emission devices.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">One example of the focus electrode can be formed by forming an insulating film made, for example, of SiO<sub>2 </sub>on each surface of a metal sheet made, for example, of 42% Ni—Fe alloy having a thickness of several tens micrometers, and then forming the opening portions in regions corresponding to pixels by punching or etching. And, the cathode panel, the metal sheet and the anode panel are stacked, a frame is arranged in circumferential portions of the two panels, and a heat treatment is carried out to bond the insulating film formed on one surface of the metal sheet and the insulating layer and to bond the insulating film formed on the other surface of the metal sheet and the anode panel, whereby these members are integrated, followed by evacuating and sealing. Whereby, the display can be also completed.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">In the three-electrodes-type display, the gate electrode can be formed so as to have a form in which the effective field is covered with one sheet of an electrically conductive material (having a first opening portion). In this case, a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode. And, a switching element constituted, for example, of TFT is provided between the cathode electrode constituting a pixel and the cathode-electrode control circuit, and the voltage application state to the cathode electrode constituting the pixel is controlled by the operation of the above switching element, to control the light emission state of the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">Alternatively, the cathode electrode can be formed so as to have a form in which the effective filed is covered with one sheet of an electrically conductive material. In this case, a voltage is applied to the cathode electrode. And, a switching element constituted, for example, of TFT is provided between the gate electrode constituting a pixel and the gate-electrode control circuit, and the voltage application state to the gate electrode constituting the pixel is controlled by the operation of the switching element, to control the light emission state of the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">The anode electrode may be an anode electrode having a form in which the effective field is covered with one sheet-shaped electrically conductive material or may be an anode electrode having a form in which anode electrode units each of which corresponds to one or a plurality of electron emitting portions or one or a plurality of pixels are gathered. When the anode electrode has the former constitution, the anode electrode can be connected to the anode-electrode control circuit. When the anode electrode has the latter constitution, for example, each anode electrode unit can be connected to the anode-electrode control circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">In the so-called two-electrode-type display, there may be employed a constitution in which the cathode electrode is formed in the form of a rectangle corresponding to one pixel and each cathode electrode is connected to a cathode-electrode control circuit through a switching circuit constituted, for example, of TFT. In this case, the anode electrode may be an anode electrode having a type in which an effective field is covered with one sheet-like conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">In the manufacturing method of the present invention, there is a case where a selective-growth-region-forming-layer and a selective-growth-region may be formed instead in the step of forming the thick-film-paste-material layer and the electron emitting portion. In the above case, there may be employed a constitution in which the selective-growth-region is finally formed, and then the electron emitting portion constituted of carbon-nanotubes, carbon-nanofibers or the like is formed on the selective-growth-region by a CVD method. The selective-growth-region can be formed from a material having catalytic activity for forming the electron emitting portion by a CVD method.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">In the present invention, the surface of the resist-material layer is modified, and then the thick-film-paste-material layer is formed thereon, so that there can be reliably overcome the occurrence of the problem that the resist-material layer is dissolved due to the thick-film-paste-material layer. As a result, the patterning of the thick-film-paste-material layer and the manufacture of the cold cathode field emission device can be carried out easily, by simple methods and at a low cost, with using the resist-material layer. Further, since the resist-material layer is used, high-definition patterning can be performed. Moreover, when the cold cathode field emission display is a three-electrode-type, there can be reliably overcome the problem of occurrence of short-circuiting of the gate electrode and the cathode electrode by applying the method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission device or the method of manufacturing a cold cathode field emission display provided by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">Further, in the manufacturing method of the present invention, when the electron emitting portion is formed by a reverse-surface exposure method, the electron emitting portion can be formed in a self-alignment manner in the bottom portion of the opening portion with regard to the opening portion formed, for example, through the gate electrode and the insulating layer. When the opening portion is formed by a reverse-surface exposure method, the opening portion can be formed through the gate electrode and the insulating layer in a self-alignment manner with regard to the hole portion. Unlike prior art, therefore, there can be suppressed the occurrence of display nonuniformity caused by a positional deviation caused between the exposure mask and the exposure site due to the deformation or shrinkage of the supporting member. Further, when the reverse-surface exposure method with using the hole portion as an exposure mask is employed, the number of photomasks is decreased, and the number of steps of positional adjustment during exposure can be decreased or omitted, so that a production cost is decreased, and that less expensive cold cathode field emission displays can be provided. Further, by high-definition patterning, the distance between the electron emitting portion and the gate electrode can be decreased, and the electron emission voltage can be decreased. Therefore, less expensive cold cathode field emission displays with low-power consumption can be manufactured. Further, since a screen printing method can be mainly employed, it is no longer necessary to use expensive semiconductor device manufacturing apparatuses in many steps, and finally, the manufacturing cost of cold cathode field emission displays can be decreased.</p>
