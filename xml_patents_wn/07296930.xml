<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a rolling guide device in which a block and a rail are relatively linearly movably engaged to each other via rows of infinitely circulating rolling members, a manufacturing method thereof, and a driving device including the rolling guide device.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Heretofore, there has been known a rolling guide device in which a block and a rail are linearly movably engaged to each other via a plurality of rolling members comprising infinitely circulating balls and rollers. To be specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the rolling guide device comprises a rail <b>80</b>, a block <b>90</b> having a recess <b>93</b> formed on a lower surface thereof in which the rail <b>80</b> fits, and a number of rolling members <b>100</b> interposed so as to form a row between a rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> of the rail <b>80</b> and a loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>91</b> of the block <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Here, the block <b>90</b> is provided with rolling member release holes <b>94</b> through which the rolling members <b>100</b> passed between each pair of the rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>91</b> are released and returned to an original position again to from an infinite circulation passage of the rolling members <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, when the block <b>90</b> is linearly moved relatively along the rail <b>80</b>, the rolling member's <b>100</b> are linearly moved while they roll between the rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>91</b>, passed between the rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> and the loaded rolling ember rolling surface <b>91</b>, returned to the rolling member release hole <b>94</b> through a return passage provided in an end plate (not shown), and then supplied again between the rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, for example, in the case that the block <b>90</b> is fixed and the rail <b>80</b> is moved in the aforesaid rolling guide device, and when a heavy piece is installed at a rail tip portion of the forward side of the rail <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and a moment load is applied thereonto, the load imparts an uneven deformation onto the block <b>90</b>, so that a deformation amount (an opening amount of the recess <b>93</b>) is varied on the forward side and the backward side of the block <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which leads to a problem that the position accuracy of the rail <b>80</b> is impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve this problem, instead of the recess <b>93</b>, a through hole may be provided at the center of the block <b>90</b> to pass the rail <b>80</b> through the inside of the through hole. If constituted in this manner, even in the case that an uneven load is applied onto one side of the rail <b>80</b> and the moment load is generated, the recess <b>93</b> will not be opened, so that the rail <b>80</b> can always securely be held.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, even in the rolling guide device constituted in such a manner, machining positions of the opposing rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>91</b> are required to be changed to various positions (various contact angle positions) in accordance with purposes of use, and hence, the shape of an opening <b>25</b> of the block <b>90</b> and the external shape of the rail <b>80</b> must also be changed in accordance with the above change, thereby causing a complicated problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a rolling guide device in which even if a large moment is applied to a rail, a block is not deformed, and even if machining positions of a rolling member rolling surface <b>81</b> and a loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>91</b> are simultaneously changed, the shape itself of the block and the rail is not required to be changed, a manufacturing method thereof, and a driving device including the rolling guide device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a rolling guide device which comprises a rail in which a rolling member rolling surface is formed along its longitudinal direction, a block in which an opening comprising a through hole is formed, the rail being fitted in this opening, and a rolling member circulation passage including a loaded rolling member rolling surface corresponding to the rolling member rolling surface of the rail is formed, and a plurality of rolling members which are disposed and housed in the rolling member circulation passage and which circulate in accordance with the relative movement of the rail and block, wherein a sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail and a sectional shape of the opening of the block are formed into a mutually geometrically similar longitudinal shape. In this manner, the opening of the block is made to be a through hole, and therefore, the block is a box type block of high rigidity which will not be deformed, so that it is possible to sufficiently maintain a satisfactory position accuracy of the rail even if a large moment is applied thereonto. In addition, according to the present invention, by appropriately changing the machining positions alone of the rolling member rolling surface and the loaded rolling member rolling surface, it becomes possible to optionally change a contact angle of the rolling members by one type of block and rail. Therefore, even in the case that the purpose of use and the condition of use are different by each user, it is possible to cope with these situations, thereby enabling the manufacture of the rolling guide device easily and at a low price.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second aspect of the present invention is directed to the rolling guide device in which the sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail and the sectional shape of the opening of the block are mutually formed into a curved line with respect to a part in which the rolling member rolling surface and loaded rolling member rolling surface are formed. In this manner, by forming the part of both sectional shapes into a curved line, it is possible to change the contact angle easily by changing the positions of the rolling member rolling surface and the loaded rolling member rolling surface as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, a third aspect of the present invention, in the rolling guide device, is to provide a constitution in which the curved line is part of a round shape. If the curved line is a round shape, the relation between the position and the contact angle of the aforesaid rolling member rolling surface and the loaded rolling member rolling surface becomes most important, since the position of each rolling surface can be changed with high accuracy, it is thus possible to change and set the contact angle with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A fourth aspect of the present invention is directed to the rolling guide device in which the curved line is a part of an ellipse. If the curved line is an ellipse, though the relation of the aforesaid rolling member rolling surface and loaded rolling member rolling surface to the contact angle is not simple as in the case of the aforesaid round shape, it is possible to easily change the contact angle in proportion to the round shape.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, a fifth aspect of the present invention is directed to a manufacturing method of a rolling guide device which comprises a process of forming a rolling member rolling surface on a rail along the longitudinal direction, a process of forming a rolling member circulation passage including a loaded rolling member rolling surface corresponding to the rolling member rolling surface of the rail on a block in which an opening comprising a through hole is machined, and a process of inserting the rail into the opening of the block, and disposing and housing, in the rolling member circulation passage, a plurality of rolling members which circulate in accordance with the relative motion of the rail and block, wherein a sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail and a sectional shape of the opening of the block are machined in advance into a mutually geometrically similar longitudinal shape, and machining positions of both the loaded rolling member rolling surface of the block and the rolling member rolling surface of the rail are appropriately changed, whereby the contact angle of the rolling members to the block and rail is optionally changed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, a sixth aspect of the present invention is directed to a driving device including a rolling guide device which comprises a rail in which a rolling member rolling surface is formed along the longitudinal direction; a block in which an opening comprising a through hole is formed, the rail fits in this opening, and a rolling member circulation passage including a loaded rolling member rolling surface corresponding to the rolling member rolling surface of the rail is formed; and a plurality of rolling members which are disposed and housed in the rolling member circulation passage and which circulate in accordance with the relative motion of the rail and block; wherein a sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail and a sectional shape of the opening of the block are formed into a mutually geometrically similar longitudinal shape, and there is disposed a linear motor comprising a secondary side arranged on both the main sides of the rail and a primary side arranged in the opening of the block corresponding to this secondary side.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show a rolling guide device according to an embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a partially cut schematic perspective view, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>) is a schematic sectional side view, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>b</i>) is a plan view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view. As shown in these drawings, this rolling guide device is constituted of a rail <b>10</b>, a block <b>20</b>, and a ball (rolling member) <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A cross section of the rail <b>10</b> is a longitudinal shape, and to be concrete, upper and lower surfaces are substantially parallel planes in which both sides protrude from the substantially parallel planes in a continuous arc shape. Moreover, on the top and bottom of the rail <b>10</b>, two groove-like rolling member rolling surfaces <b>11</b> are formed at right and left, and hence, four groove-like rolling member rolling surfaces <b>11</b> are formed in all.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The block <b>20</b> comprises a block body <b>21</b> and end plates <b>23</b> which are installed on both end faces of the block body <b>21</b>. The block body <b>21</b> is provided with an opening <b>25</b> into which the rail <b>10</b> is inserted, and on upper and lower surfaces of this opening <b>25</b>, there are formed four groove-like loaded rolling member rolling surfaces <b>27</b> corresponding to the respective rolling member rolling surfaces <b>11</b> of the rail <b>10</b>. Between each of the mutually opposing rolling member rolling surfaces <b>11</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surfaces <b>27</b>, a plurality of balls (rolling members) <b>70</b> . . . are movably interposed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The opening <b>25</b> is a through hole and its sectional shape is a longitudinal shape, and detailedly, upper and lower surfaces are substantially parallel planes in which both sides protrude from the substantially parallel planes in a continuous arc shape. That is, a sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail <b>10</b> and a sectional shape of the opening <b>25</b> are formed into a mutually geometrically similar longitudinal shape, in the case of this embodiment, an elliptical shape. Therefore, the outer peripheral surface of the rail <b>10</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the opening <b>25</b> are parallel, and clearance dimensions of both the surfaces are about the same in any part.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the block body <b>21</b>, two rolling member release holes <b>51</b> for releasing the balls in a load area corresponding to the respective loaded rolling member rolling surfaces <b>27</b> are formed on top and bottom of the opening <b>25</b>, respectively, and hence the four holes <b>51</b> are formed in all. On the other hand, on upper and lower surfaces and on both sides of the block <b>21</b>, there are provided screw-holes <b>29</b> for fixing this block body <b>21</b> to other members.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The end plate <b>23</b> is constituted of a rectangular member having about the same shape as the end face of the block body <b>21</b>. At the center thereof, there are an opening <b>53</b> for passing the rail <b>10</b>, and a return passage <b>55</b> for forwarding the balls <b>70</b> in the load area interposed between the block body <b>21</b> and the rail <b>10</b> into a rolling member release hole <b>51</b> to return the balls to the load area again. In addition, on the outer end face of the end plate <b>23</b> is installed a sealing member <b>57</b> for preventing dirt from entering the inside and preventing lubricant from leaking from the inside.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, a rolling member circulation passage is defined by the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> corresponding to the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> of the rail <b>10</b>, the rolling member release hole <b>51</b>, and the return passage <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As a method for machining the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> in the block <b>20</b>, for example, a method can be used in which the opening <b>25</b> is perforated in the block <b>20</b> by wire cut and the like, and a groove is then formed on the inner surface thereof by grinding only to work the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, when the rail <b>10</b> is moved linearly in its longitudinal direction to the block <b>20</b>, the rail <b>10</b> smoothly moves as the ball <b>70</b> between the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> of the rail <b>10</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> of the block <b>20</b> moves while rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, since the opening <b>25</b> is provided in the block <b>20</b> and the rail is passed inside thereof, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>), the block <b>20</b> is fixed to a fixing side member <b>75</b>. On the other hand, even if a moving side member <b>77</b> is fixed at the tip section of the rail <b>10</b> and a moment load is applied to the rail <b>10</b>, there does not occur a problem in which the opening <b>25</b> is opened and deformed, and the rail <b>10</b> always moves smoothly to the same position as in the case where the moving side member <b>77</b> is not used, so that it is possible to always maintain satisfactory position accuracy of the moving side member <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the other hand, in the present invention, as described above, since the sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail <b>10</b> and the sectional shape of the opening <b>25</b> are formed into a mutually geometrically similar ellipse, that is, a longitudinal shape, the clearance dimension of the outer peripheral surface of the rail <b>10</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the opening <b>25</b> is about the same in any part. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, even if the same rail and block as the rail <b>10</b> and block <b>20</b> are used, the machining positions of the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> can be changed to various positions (various positions of a contact angle θ)according to purposes of use. Groove machining of the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> is easy because it can be accomplished by grinding only. That is, according to purposes of use, by changing the machining positions of both the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> appropriately, it is possible to optionally change the contact angle θ (θ<b>1</b>, θ<b>2</b>) of the ball <b>70</b> to the rail <b>10</b> and the block <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">However, in the present embodiment, the sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail <b>10</b> and the sectional shape of the opening <b>25</b> of the block <b>20</b> are mutually formed into continuous arc shape, that is, a curved line with respect to a part in which the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this manner, by forming the part of both sectional shapes into a curved line, it is possible to easily change the contact angle simply by changing the positions of the rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and the loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> as described above. Incidentally, both or one of the part of rail sectional shape and block sectional shape is a straight line, changing the contact angle is not always easy.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present embodiment, the aforesaid curved line is a continuous arc shape, that is, part of a round shape. If the curved line is a round shape, the relation of the position and the contact angle of the aforesaid rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> becomes most important, since the position of each rolling surface can be changed highly accurately, it is also possible to change and set the contact angle with a high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, the aforesaid curved line may be a part of an elliptical shape. In the case of an ellipse, though the relation of the aforesaid rolling member rolling surface <b>11</b> and loaded rolling member rolling surface <b>27</b> to the contact angle is not so simple as the case of the aforesaid round shape, it is possible to change the contact angle in proportion to the round shape.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a transverse sectional view showing a driving device according to the present invention. This driving device is constituted so that magnets (secondary side (secondary conductor)) <b>60</b>, <b>60</b> are installed so as to be respectively embedded on top and bottom surfaces (principal both surfaces) of the rail <b>10</b> of the rolling guide device of the same construction shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and on the other hand, electromagnets (primary side (stator)) <b>61</b>, <b>61</b> are installed so as to be embedded on top and bottom surfaces of the inner periphery of the opening <b>25</b> of the block <b>20</b>. A linear motor formed by a pair of the magnet <b>60</b> and the magnet <b>61</b> of the upper side, and a linear motor formed by a pair of the magnet <b>60</b> and the magnet <b>61</b> of the lower side are provided at a position vertically symmetrical to the center of the rail <b>10</b>. As a linear motor, motors of various construction such as a linear direct current motor and a linear pulse motor can be applied. And, by flowing current to the electromagnets <b>61</b>, <b>61</b>, the rail <b>10</b> is drive so as to advance and reverse to the block <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, since the rail <b>10</b> is covered by the opening <b>25</b> provided in the block <b>20</b>, it is possible to provide a position to install the magnet <b>60</b> and the electromagnet <b>16</b> not only on the upper surface side but also on the lower surface side, that is, on the principal both sides of the rail <b>10</b>. Therefore, it is possible to restrain a deformation of a structural member in the radial direction due to magnet attraction, so that thrust is increased by space saving because of two pairs of motors used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an embodiment in which the magnets <b>60</b>, <b>60</b> of the inside and outside of the rail <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are integrated into one magnet. If the fastening between the rail <b>10</b> and the magnet <b>60</b> can be securely provided by adhesion or bolting and the like, such means simplifies the construction and reduces the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of the present invention are described in the above, but the present invention is not limited to the aforesaid embodiments, and various modifications are possible within the scope of the claims and the scope of technical idea stated in the specification and drawings. In addition, even in the case of any shape or construction or quality of material or method of use which are not directly stated in the specification and drawings, as long as they demonstrate the action and effect of the present invention, they are within the scope of the technical idea of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, in the aforesaid embodiments, the block <b>20</b> is used as the fixed side, and the rail <b>10</b> is used as the movable side, conversely, the block <b>20</b> may be used as the movable side, and the rail <b>10</b> may be used as the fixed side.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, in the aforesaid embodiments, the sectional shape at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the rail <b>10</b> and the sectional shape of the opening <b>25</b> of the block <b>20</b> are mutually formed into round shape or a part of an elliptical shape, that is, a curved line, but other curved line may be applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, in the above embodiments, a case is shown in which balls are used as rolling members, but the present invention may be applicable to the case where rollers are used in a similar construction.</p>
