<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Ser. No. 60/604,227, filed on Aug. 25, 2004.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to vibratory process equipment and, more particularly, to vibratory spiral conveyors for transporting work pieces.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vibratory spiral conveyors are generally known in the art. Such apparatus typically includes a spiral deck, formed in the shape of a helix, and a source of vibration operatively coupled to the deck. The spiral conveyor may be a brute force system, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,927,683 to Carrier, or a two-mass system, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,320 to Musschoot.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Spiral conveyors are often used to heat or cool work pieces or granular material. With foundry castings, for example, red hot castings (which may have a temperature of approximately 1000 degrees F. or more) are fed into the spiral conveyor. Cool air is directed over the castings as the castings travel up the spiral, thereby to reduce the temperature of the castings. Conventional spiral conveyors direct air from a center axis of the conveyor outwardly, with or without nozzles for directing the air toward the castings. The air is exhausted out an exterior of the spiral conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one conventional design, air is generally directed radially across the spiral conveyor from the center core inlets to the outer periphery outlets. As a result, the inner facing side of the castings (or the inner row, should more than one row of castings be fed into the conveyor) will receive a lower temperature air than the outer facing side (or outer row).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another conventional design, both the air inlet and air outlet are positioned at the outer periphery of the spiral conveyor. As the air enters the spiral conveyor area, it passes about the center core in at least two separate sub-streams. The air then exhausts from the spiral conveyor through a common outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the deck used in conventional spiral conveyors is typically constructed of plate steel. As a result, when viewed in cross-section, the conveying surface defined by the deck is typically “flat” across the width of the deck. Stated alternatively, the conveying surface is substantially linear across its width.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While a flat deck is satisfactory for many applications, it may cause unintended and undesirable results when used to convey certain objects. For example, when conveying generally cylindrical objects such as cam shafts along a flat deck, the objects may roll transversely across the width of the deck, and therefore are not located on the deck with any degree of certainty. In addition, the cylindrical objects may become oriented transversely across the deck, and therefore more easily roll into and possibly damage other objects on the deck.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Flat decks are also difficult to employ for certain path configurations. In a spiral conveyor, for example, it is preferable to form the deck in a helicoid shape. To approximate the helicoid shape with flat plate steel, several bends such as cross crimps are typically formed in the deck. Such cross crimps, however, create abrupt changes in the pitch of the deck and cause the conveying surface to be non-linear across its width. Consequently, the cross-crimps create localized high wear area and non-uniform stresses in the deck. These problems are exacerbated during thermal expansion and contraction, which can be significant when the spiral conveyor is used for heating or cooling of the objects being conveyed. In addition, the need for cross crimps or other bends in the deck increases manufacturing costs and makes assembly more difficult, especially for conveyors that are constructed as multiple sub-assemblies that are mated together, such as for large conveyor sizes.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a spiral conveyor <b>10</b> is shown having a frame <b>12</b> supporting a spiral deck <b>16</b>. As used herein, the word spiral includes helix and helicoid shapes. The frame <b>12</b> is resiliently supported above the ground or mounting surface by isolation means, such as springs <b>18</b>. An exciter mass <b>20</b> and vibration generators <b>22</b> are resiliently coupled to the trough frame <b>12</b>, such as by springs <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Any generally known vibration generators may be used, such as motors having rotating shafts carrying eccentric weights.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A housing <b>15</b> is provided for enclosing the spiral deck <b>16</b> and defining a conveyor chamber <b>17</b>. As best shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the spiral deck includes an inner edge <b>19</b> and an outer edge <b>21</b>. The housing <b>15</b> has a cylindrical inner wall <b>38</b> coupled to the spiral deck inner edge <b>19</b> and a cylindrical outer wall <b>50</b> coupled to the spiral deck outer edge <b>21</b>. The housing <b>15</b> may also include a top wall <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), so that the housing <b>15</b> completely encloses the spiral deck <b>16</b> but for a housing inlet <b>24</b> and outlet <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the housing <b>15</b> and spiral deck <b>16</b> define the conveyor chamber <b>17</b>, which has a spiral configuration in the illustrated embodiment. A plurality of access doors <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be formed in the housing outer wall <b>50</b> for accessing the conveyor chamber <b>17</b> and deck <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the illustrated embodiment, the spiral deck <b>16</b> is oriented to vertically elevate work pieces, such as hot castings, from the inlet <b>24</b> to the outlet <b>26</b>. The work pieces may be transferred from an origination point, such as a molding line, to the inlet <b>24</b> by any conveying means, such as by a linear vibratory or other type of conveyor (not shown). The spiral deck <b>16</b> is formed in a helical pattern so that, as the work pieces move circumferentially around the deck, they are also elevated in the vertical direction. At the outlet <b>26</b>, the work piece may be deposited onto an outlet transport (not shown), which may also be a conveyor. While the conveyor <b>10</b> is described herein as conveying the work pieces vertically upward, the inlet and outlet may be reversed so that the work pieces are conveyed vertically downward along the spiral deck <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When viewed in elevational cross-section, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the spiral deck <b>16</b> defines a plurality of stacked tier segments <b>14</b>. The tier segments <b>14</b> are vertically aligned so that adjacent tier segments <b>14</b> define upper and lower boundaries of a cross-sectional area of the conveyor chamber <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The vibration generators <b>22</b> may be controlled in any known fashion to produce the desired vibrational motion of the trough frame <b>12</b> and coupled spiral deck <b>16</b> to advance the work pieces along the deck <b>16</b>. For example, the motors may be rotated in opposite directions (i.e., counter-rotated) and controlled to maintain a desired phase angle between the eccentric weights. While the illustrated embodiment is a two mass system, it will be appreciated that the conveyor <b>10</b> may be provided as a single mass or brute force system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An air distribution system is provided for directing air over the work pieces as they travel along the spiral deck <b>16</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plenum housing <b>29</b> defines an inlet air plenum <b>30</b> formed near a top of the spiral deck <b>16</b> and within a central chamber <b>56</b> defined by the housing inner wall <b>38</b>. A pair of air inlet ducts <b>32</b> is connected to the plenum housing <b>29</b> by flexible joints <b>34</b>. Alternatively, a single inlet duct <b>32</b> or more than two inlet ducts <b>32</b> may communicate with the inlet air plenum <b>30</b>. Extending downwardly from the inlet air plenum <b>30</b> is a plurality of vertical air conduits <b>36</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the housing inner wall <b>38</b> forms outer portions of each conduit <b>36</b>, while concave chamber walls <b>40</b> form a remainder of each conduit <b>36</b>. Air flow may be generated by a positive air pressure source in fluid communication with the inlet air plenum <b>30</b> or a negative air pressure source in fluid communication with the central chamber <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A plurality of air distribution chambers <b>42</b> is attached to a bottom side of the spiral deck <b>16</b> and communicates with each vertical air conduit <b>36</b>. The air distribution chambers may be oriented to extend generally horizontally and, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may be aligned generally radially between the housing inner wall <b>38</b> and housing outer wall <b>50</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a pair of air distribution chambers <b>42</b> on each spiral deck tier portion <b>14</b> fluidly communicates with a respective vertical air conduit <b>36</b>. Alternatively, each air conduit <b>36</b> may fluidly communicate with a single air distribution chamber <b>42</b> or more than two air distribution chambers <b>42</b> on each spiral deck tier portion <b>14</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a single tier portion <b>14</b> of the spiral deck <b>16</b>, it will be appreciated that similar sets of air distribution chambers <b>42</b> may be constructed on each of the spiral deck tier segments <b>14</b>, so that each conduit <b>36</b> may communicate with multiple vertical levels of air distribution chambers <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each air distribution chamber <b>42</b> includes a plurality of spaced nozzles <b>44</b> oriented to direct air flow downwardly toward the next lower tier. The nozzles <b>44</b> may be apertures formed in a bottom of the air distribution chambers <b>42</b>. The apertures are arranged across at least a portion of a lateral width “W” of the spiral deck <b>16</b> to form an air distribution pattern. In the illustrated embodiment, the apertures are generally equally spaced across the entire lateral width “W” of the spiral deck <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The vertical air conduits <b>36</b> and horizontal air chambers <b>42</b> may be formed of structural steel members, such as channels and angles, to provide structural support to the spiral conveyor <b>10</b>. In this case, the conduits <b>36</b> and chambers <b>42</b> provide the dual functions of air distribution and structural support.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The vibratory conveyor <b>10</b> further provides for exhaust of air out of the conveyor chamber. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of outlet openings <b>54</b> are formed in the housing inner wall <b>38</b>, each opening <b>54</b> being positioned between adjacent vertical air conduits <b>36</b>. The outlet openings <b>54</b> fluidly communicate with the central chamber <b>56</b> defined by the housing inner wall. An air exhaust outlet <b>58</b> fluidly communicates with the central chamber <b>56</b> and is coupled, such as by flexible joint <b>60</b>, to exhaust duct <b>62</b>. The exhaust duct <b>62</b> may communicate with an air vacuum source <b>63</b> (schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), such as an exhaust fan, to create air flow through the air distribution system. In the illustrated embodiment, the plenum housing <b>29</b> has a generally annular shape, so that an inner edge <b>31</b> of the plenum housing <b>29</b> defines the exhaust outlet <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the air vacuum source pulls air through the inlet ducts <b>32</b> to the inlet air plenum <b>30</b>. The air stream flows from the plenum through the air conduits <b>36</b> and air distribution chambers <b>42</b> for discharge through the nozzles <b>44</b>, which evenly distribute air across the entire lateral width “W” of the spiral deck <b>16</b>. The air vacuum source is preferably sized so that the air stream discharged from each nozzle <b>44</b> has a velocity sufficiently high to create non-laminar flow around the work pieces. By creating a non-laminar air flow, the heat transfer coefficient for the system is increased, thereby increasing heat transfer, which is beneficial for both heating and cooling applications. The air exits the conveyor chamber <b>17</b> through the outlet openings <b>54</b> and into the central chamber <b>56</b>, where it is discharged through the exhaust outlet <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The conveyor <b>10</b> may include a fines collection system for collecting any fines entrained in the air stream passing through the conveyor chamber <b>17</b>. The objects or work pieces loaded into the conveyor <b>10</b> may include unwanted debris, such as sand, sprue, or other fines material. To remove this debris from the air stream, the fines collection system may include a catch floor <b>70</b> extending across a bottom of the central chamber <b>56</b> and coupled to the housing <b>15</b> below the lowest outlet opening <b>54</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the catch floor includes a conical center portion <b>72</b> attached to a frusto-conical outer portion <b>74</b>. A fines discharge opening <b>76</b> is formed at an outer periphery of the outer portion <b>74</b> and communicates with a fines discharge chute <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The discharge opening communicates with atmosphere via the chute <b>78</b>, and therefore the negative pressure in the central chamber <b>56</b> creates a pressure differential that tends to hold the fines within the chamber <b>56</b>. As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an air lock <b>80</b> may be provided in the chute <b>78</b> to allow and control discharge of fines through the chute.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, air is discharged from the nozzles <b>44</b> at a relatively high velocity, so that fines may become dislodged from the work pieces and entrained in the air stream. The air stream then passes through the outlet openings <b>54</b>, which causes a pressure drop and associated reduction in velocity of the air stream as it enters the central chamber <b>56</b>. The reduced velocity causes the fines entrained in the air stream to drop to the catch floor <b>70</b>. The vibratory motion of the spiral deck <b>16</b> and attached catch floor <b>70</b> moves the particles toward an outer periphery of the catch floor outer portion <b>74</b>. The circular component of the vibratory motion conveys the particles circumferentially about the floor periphery until the particles reach the discharge opening <b>76</b>, at which point they travel down the discharge chute <b>78</b> and into the air lock <b>80</b>. The air lock <b>80</b> may be operated to periodically interrupt fluid communication between the chute <b>78</b> and the central chamber <b>56</b>, thereby to allow a batch of fines to be discharged from the chute <b>78</b> for collection.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fines collection system utilizes the existing internal structure of the spiral conveyor to collect and discharge particles entrained in the air stream. As a result, separate filter houses are not required and the space required for spiral conveyor apparatus is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4–9</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment of a conveyor deck having a conveying surface and a back surface. A rib is attached to the back surface and a “force assembly” is coupled to the rib. By applying a force to the rib with the force assembly, the deck may be bowed either concavely or convexly. If formed with a concave bend, the conveying surface of the deck, when viewed in cross-section, will have a localized low point adjacent the rib that defines a deck along-which objects are conveyed. The concave shape also tends to orient cylindrical objects longitudinally on the deck, defined herein as parallel to the direction of travel. Additionally, when used in a spiral conveyor, the bowed cross-sectional shape allows the deck to be formed more nearly to a pure helicoid, where the pitch of the deck is consistent along the entire conveyor path and each radial cross section of the deck will have linear opposing deck edges, regardless of whether the deck is curved concavely or convexly. While the disclosed embodiment is a spiral conveyor, it will be appreciated that the bowed deck shape provides advantages for other conveyor path configurations, including linear, curved, and inclined paths.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a spiral conveyor <b>110</b> is shown having a frame <b>112</b> supporting a spiral deck <b>116</b>. The frame <b>112</b> is resiliently supported above the ground or mounting surface by isolation means, such as springs <b>118</b>. An exciter mass <b>120</b> and vibration generators <b>122</b> are resiliently coupled to the frame <b>112</b>, such as by springs <b>125</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Any generally known vibration generators may be used, such as motors having rotating shafts carrying eccentric weights.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The spiral deck <b>116</b> is oriented to vertically elevate work pieces, such as hot castings, from an inlet <b>124</b> to an outlet <b>126</b>. The deck <b>116</b> defines a conveying surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>for receiving the work pieces and a back surface <b>116</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 &amp; 8</figref>). The work pieces may be transferred from an origination point, such as a molding line, to the inlet <b>124</b> by any conveying means, such as by a linear vibratory or other type of conveyor (not shown). The spiral deck <b>116</b> is formed in a helical pattern so that, as the work pieces move circumferentially around the deck, they are also elevated in the vertical direction. When the conveyor <b>110</b> is viewed in elevational cross-section, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the spiral deck <b>116</b> defines a plurality of stacked tier segments <b>114</b>. At the outlet <b>126</b>, the work piece may be deposited onto an outlet transport (not shown), which may also be a conveyor. While the conveyor <b>110</b> is described herein as conveying the work pieces vertically upward, the inlet and outlet may be reversed so that the work pieces are conveyed vertically downward along the spiral deck <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The vibration generators <b>122</b> may be controlled in any known fashion to produce the desired vibrational motion of the frame <b>112</b> and coupled spiral deck <b>116</b>, thereby to advance the work pieces along the deck <b>116</b>. For example, the motors may be rotated in opposite directions (i.e., counter-rotated) and controlled to maintain a desired phase angle between the eccentric weights. While the illustrated embodiment is a two mass system, it will be appreciated that the conveyor <b>110</b> may be provided as a single mass or brute force system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7–9</figref>, the spiral deck <b>116</b> includes an inner edge <b>119</b> and an outer edge <b>121</b>. An inner housing wall <b>130</b> is coupled to the spiral deck inner edge <b>119</b> and an outer housing wall <b>132</b> is coupled to the spiral deck outer edge <b>121</b>. More specifically, the deck inner edge <b>119</b> is secured to the inner housing wall <b>130</b> by a first or inner wall support assembly <b>134</b>, which may clamp the deck inner edge <b>119</b> between a bottom flange <b>136</b> and a top retainer <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Similarly, the deck outer edge <b>121</b> may be secured to the outer housing wall <b>132</b> by a second or outer wall support assembly <b>140</b>, which may clamp the deck outer edge <b>121</b> between a bottom flange <b>142</b> and a top retainer <b>144</b>. A plurality of access doors <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be formed in the housing outer wall <b>132</b> for accessing the different tier portions <b>114</b> of the deck <b>116</b>, should the outer housing wall <b>132</b> completely enclose the deck <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A rib assembly <b>150</b> is attached to the deck back surface <b>116</b><i>b </i>between the inner and outer deck edges <b>119</b>, <b>121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7–9</figref>). The rib assembly may <b>150</b> may extend continuously along the deck <b>116</b> in the longitudinal direction, so that, in the illustrated embodiment, the rib assembly has a spiral shape. The rib assembly <b>150</b> may include a pair of ribs <b>152</b> having aligned transverse apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A force assembly <b>160</b> coupled to the rib assembly <b>150</b> to create a force that bends the deck <b>116</b> into an arcuate shape when viewed in cross-section. The exemplary force assembly <b>160</b> includes a pin <b>162</b> mechanically coupled to the rib assembly <b>150</b>, such as by insertion through the transverse apertures formed in the ribs <b>152</b>. A cross support <b>164</b> is spaced from the deck <b>116</b> and supported by the inner and outer housing walls <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>. As shown, the cross support <b>64</b> is provided as a tubular steel member, and has apertures <b>65</b> formed in the upper and lower support surfaces <b>164</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>b</i>. A link <b>166</b> is inserted through the apertures in the cross support <b>164</b> and defines a first end <b>168</b> coupled to the pin <b>162</b> and a second end <b>170</b>. The link <b>166</b> also includes a threaded portion <b>172</b> for receiving a nut <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The nut <b>174</b> may be adjusted on the link threaded portion <b>172</b> to generate a force in the link <b>166</b> that is transferred by the rib assembly <b>150</b> to the deck <b>116</b>, thereby to bend the deck <b>116</b> in an arcuate shape. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 &amp; 8</figref>, the nut <b>174</b> may be located below the cross support <b>164</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the deck <b>116</b> is shown in a relaxed state, where the force assembly <b>160</b> applies no force to the deck <b>116</b>. The nut <b>174</b> may be adjusted upwardly along the threaded portion <b>172</b> so that the nut engages the lower surface of the cross support <b>164</b>, thereby to create tension in the link <b>166</b>. The tension in the link <b>166</b> is transferred by the pin <b>162</b> as a downwardly directed force acting against the rib assembly <b>150</b> and attached deck <b>116</b>. The nut <b>174</b> may be adjusted along the threaded portion <b>172</b> to create a tension force in the link <b>166</b> sufficient to bend the deck <b>116</b> into an arcuate shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an alternative embodiment, the pin <b>162</b> may be provided as a bar coupled to the ribs <b>152</b> and formed with a threaded aperture. The link <b>166</b> may be a bolt or threaded rod with the first end <b>168</b> threadably engaging the bar threaded aperture. The second end <b>170</b> of the bolt is a bolt head, which takes the place of the nut <b>174</b>. Accordingly, bolt may be threaded into the bar threaded aperture to create the tension force.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The ribs <b>152</b> may project sufficiently past the pin <b>162</b> to define stop ends <b>176</b> that are engageable with the top surface <b>164</b><i>a </i>of the cross support, thereby to limit the amount of deflection of the deck <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the deck <b>116</b> is in the relaxed state, the rib stop ends <b>176</b> are spaced from the top surface of the cross support by a known distance “D”. As the nut <b>174</b> is tightened to deflect the deck <b>116</b>, the stop ends <b>176</b> are drawn toward and eventually engage the cross support top surface <b>164</b><i>a</i>, thereby limiting the amount of deflection of the deck <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the illustrated embodiment shows the deck conveying surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>bent into a concave arcuate shape, the conveying surface may also be formed with a convex arcuate shape. To do so, the force assembly <b>160</b> may be modified so that the link threaded portion <b>172</b> is adjacent an upper surface of the cross support <b>164</b>, and the nut <b>174</b> may be adjusted downwardly along the threaded portion to engage the upper surface <b>164</b><i>a </i>of the cross support. Consequently, a compression force is generated in the link <b>166</b> that is transferred by the pin <b>162</b> as an upwardly directed force against the rib assembly <b>160</b> and attached deck <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To create the compression force in the alternative embodiment described above, a nut may simply be provided on the bolt above the cross support upper surface <b>164</b><i>a</i>, and the nut may be adjusted downwardly along the bolt to engage the upper surface <b>164</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While only a single force assembly <b>160</b> is shown coupled to the rib assembly <b>160</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 &amp; 8</figref>, it will be appreciated that a plurality of force assemblies may be coupled to the rib assembly <b>160</b> at points spaced along the longitudinal length of the rib assembly <b>150</b>. In the segment of the deck <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a total of three force assemblies <b>160</b> are shown coupled to the rib assembly <b>150</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also illustrates the ribs <b>162</b> extending along the longitudinal length of the deck <b>116</b>. Furthermore, while a single deck segment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it will be appreciated that multiple deck segments may be fabricated independently and assembled to create the complete conveyor deck. The improved fit of the arcuate shaped deck allows the ends of the deck segments to be more reliably located, thereby facilitating assembly of mating deck segments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While a spiral conveyor path has been described and illustrated, the present disclosure is applicable to other conveyor path configurations requiring different deck shapes, such as linear, inclined, or curved decks, while still providing some or all of the benefits described herein. Still further, multiple concentric (in the case of curved or spiral path configurations) or parallel (in the case of linear path configurations) rib assemblies may be attached to the deck <b>116</b> or adjacent sub-decks, each of which having force assemblies coupled thereto, so that the deck is bent with multiple arcs defining multiple lanes for transporting a column of objects.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another alternative spiral conveyor <b>200</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 &amp; 11</figref> having a deck assembly <b>202</b> that allows air to flow around the deck, thereby to increase the dwell time of the air within the conveyor <b>200</b>. The deck <b>202</b> is coupled to a vibration generator, such as motors having rotating shafts carrying eccentric weights as disclosed above, which creates a vibratory force for advancing objects in the desired direction along the deck assembly <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The deck assembly <b>202</b> includes a deck <b>204</b> supported by cross supports <b>206</b>. The illustrated deck <b>204</b> has a helical shape defining a plurality of vertically stacked tier segments <b>205</b>. The deck <b>204</b> includes inner and outer edges <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> that are spaced from an inner housing <b>212</b> and an outer housing <b>214</b>, respectively, to define inner and outer gaps <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> therebetween. The inner and outer housings <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> enclose the deck <b>204</b> to define a conveyor chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As with previous embodiments, the cross supports <b>206</b> may include apertures (not shown) for distributing air over objects conveyed along the deck. In this embodiment, the inner housing <b>212</b> may be imperforate, so that air from the apertures that is directed toward the deck <b>204</b> passes through the inner and outer gaps <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to an adjacent tier of the deck. A single outlet may be located at the bottom tier to direct exhaust air toward atmosphere. Accordingly, the average dwell time of the air provided to the conveyor <b>200</b> is increased, and construction of the conveyor is simplified by requiring only a single exhaust outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The deck assembly <b>202</b> may further include inner and outer guide rails <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>. The guide rails may be used to at least partially support the objects transported by the conveyor <b>200</b>, and/or to prevent objects and debris from falling through the inner and outer gaps <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Each of the inner and outer guide rails <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> may include a vertical support <b>234</b>, which, for example, may be formed of bar stock, and contact surface <b>236</b>, which, for example, may be formed of tube stock. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the inner and outer rails <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> are secured to the deck <b>204</b> with guide rail supports <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> illustrate yet another embodiment of a spiral conveyor <b>300</b> having inner and outer spiral decks connected in series to increase the dwell time of objects transported through the conveyor <b>300</b> while minimizing additional space requirements. The objects may be castings <b>301</b>, such as drums or rotors that require cooling. The spiral conveyor <b>300</b> includes a first spiral deck <b>302</b> defining a conveying surface, and includes a plurality of tier segments <b>302</b><i>a</i>. A second spiral deck <b>304</b> is operatively coupled to the first spiral deck <b>302</b> and defines a conveying surface, the second spiral deck <b>304</b> also having a plurality of tier segments <b>304</b><i>a</i>. Adjacent ends of the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may simply be connected together to form a single, continuous conveying path that traverses both decks.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An exciter mass assembly <b>306</b> is coupled to the first and second decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, and includes a vibration generator adapted to generate a vibratory force. The vibratory force advances objects, such as castings <b>301</b>, along the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> simultaneously in different vertical directions. For example, objects may be transported vertically downward along the first spiral deck <b>302</b> and vertically upward along the second spiral deck <b>304</b>. Accordingly, the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may be arranged to emulate a “double helix” pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As best shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are substantially concentric about a common axis <b>310</b>. Accordingly, the first spiral deck is disposed substantially at a first radius while the second spiral deck is disposed at a second radius greater than the first radius, so that the first spiral deck is disposed inside or “nested” within the second spiral deck.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A housing <b>312</b> is provided for enclosing the first and second decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and for assisting in directing cooling air to the decks. The housing includes a first chamber <b>314</b> for enclosing the first spiral deck <b>302</b> and a second chamber <b>316</b> for enclosing the second spiral deck <b>304</b>. The first and second chambers <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> define a conveyor chamber extending along the conveyor path defined by the two decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first chamber <b>314</b> defines an inlet for receiving the objects to be conveyed and the second chamber <b>316</b> defines an outlet for discharging the conveyed objects.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An inlet air plenum <b>318</b>, which may include three inlets <b>320</b>, is formed by the housing and is adapted to direct cooling air, provided by an air source, into the conveyor chamber. The inlet air plenum <b>318</b> includes a roughly cylindrical inlet portion <b>322</b> and a generally annular distribution portion <b>324</b> disposed between the first and second housing chambers <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Air distribution chambers <b>326</b> extending generally radially across the first and second housing chambers <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> communicate with the inlet plenum distribution portion <b>324</b> and include apertures <b>327</b> for directing air downwardly toward the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the air distribution chambers <b>326</b> also support the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, which are connected to upper sides of the chambers <b>326</b>. The distribution portion <b>324</b> may include divider walls <b>328</b> for directing air toward the distribution chambers <b>326</b>. Accordingly, a single inlet air plenum <b>318</b> directs cooling air to both the first and second housing chambers <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The conveyor <b>300</b> includes air flow passages communicating between adjacent tier segments of the first and second spiral decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. The first spiral deck <b>302</b> has inner and outer edges <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> that are spaced from inner and outer walls <b>334</b>, <b>336</b> of the housing first chamber <b>314</b>. The space between the inner edge <b>330</b> and inner wall <b>334</b> defines a first deck inner gap <b>338</b>, while the space between the outer edge <b>332</b> and outer wall <b>336</b> defines a first deck outer gap <b>340</b>. Air provided from the air distribution chambers <b>326</b> may therefore flow toward the nearest tier segment <b>302</b><i>a </i>and through the first deck inner and outer gaps <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> to an adjacent tier segment <b>302</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Similarly, the second spiral deck <b>304</b> has inner and outer edges <b>342</b>, <b>344</b> that are spaced from inner and outer walls <b>346</b>, <b>348</b> of the second housing chamber <b>316</b>. The space between the inner edge <b>342</b> and inner wall <b>346</b> defines a second deck inner gap <b>350</b>, while the space between the outer edge <b>344</b> and outer wall <b>348</b> defines a second deck outer gap <b>352</b>. Air provided from the air distribution chambers <b>326</b> may therefore flow toward the nearest tier segment <b>304</b><i>a </i>and through the second deck inner and outer gaps <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> to an adjacent tier segment <b>304</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first and second decks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may further include guide rails for supporting objects to be conveyed, for retaining objects on the decks, or for directing debris removed from the objects to a collection area. In the illustrated embodiment, the first spiral deck <b>302</b> includes inner and outer guide rails <b>360</b>, <b>362</b> and the second spiral deck <b>304</b> includes inner and outer guide rails <b>364</b>, <b>366</b>. The guide rails <b>360</b>, <b>362</b>, <b>364</b>, and <b>366</b> may be located on their respective decks and constructed similar to those described above with reference to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 &amp; 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The housing <b>312</b> may also include an outlet plenum <b>370</b> for receiving cooling air from the conveyor chamber and directing it to atmosphere. In the illustrated embodiment, the outlet plenum <b>370</b> includes a hood section <b>372</b> positioned directly above the top deck tier segment <b>302</b><i>a </i>of the first spiral deck <b>302</b> and an outlet <b>374</b> adapted for connection to ductwork or the like for discharging air to atmosphere. Thus, a single outlet point (i.e., above the first deck tier segment) is provided for discharging air from the conveyor chamber. Accordingly, air provided to other tier segments will pass through the inner and outer gaps <b>338</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>350</b>, and <b>352</b> and ultimately to the outlet plenum <b>370</b>, thereby increasing the period during which this air is resident in the conveyor chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Sand or other fines capable of being carried by the air flow through the conveyor chamber may be removed at any convenient location. For example, where the first spiral deck <b>302</b> transitions to the second spiral deck <b>304</b>, which is near the bottom of the housing <b>312</b>, the reversal of air flow direction provides one possible location for collecting and removing fines.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although certain apparatus constructed in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all embodiments of the teachings of the disclosure fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
