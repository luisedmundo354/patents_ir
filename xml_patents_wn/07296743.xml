<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to electro-optical readers, such as laser scanners for reading indicia, such as bar code symbols and, more particularly, to laser power control arrangements for enhancing reader performance and safety.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various electro-optical systems or readers have been developed for reading indicia such as bar code symbols appearing on a label or on a surface of an article. The bar code symbol itself is a coded pattern of graphic indicia comprised of a series of bars of various widths spaced apart from one another to bound spaces of various widths, the bars and spaces having different light reflecting characteristics. The readers function by electro-optically transforming the pattern of the graphic indicia into a time-varying electrical signal, which is digitized and decoded into data relating to the symbol being read.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, a laser beam from a laser is directed along a light path toward a target that includes the bar code symbol on a target surface. A moving-beam scanner operates by repetitively sweeping the laser beam in a scan line or a series of scan lines across the symbol by means of motion of a scanning component, such as the laser itself or a scan mirror disposed in the path of the laser beam. Optics focus the laser beam into a beam spot on the target surface, and the motion of the scanning component sweeps the beam spot across the symbol to trace a scan line across the symbol. Motion of the scanning component is typically effected by an electrical drive motor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The readers also include a sensor or photodetector which detects light along the scan line that is reflected or scattered from the symbol. The photodetector or sensor is positioned such that it has a field of view which ensures the capture of the reflected or scattered light, and converts the latter into an electrical analog signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In retroreflective light collection, a single optical component, e.g., a reciprocally oscillatory mirror, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,661 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,470, both herein incorporated by reference, sweeps the beam across the target surface and directs the collected light to the sensor. In non-retroreflective light collection, the reflected laser light is not collected by the same optical component used for scanning. Instead, the sensor is independent of the scanning beam, and has a large field of view so that the reflected laser light traces across the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Electronic control circuitry and software decode the electrical analog signal from the sensor into a digital representation of the data represented by the symbol that has been scanned. For example, the analog electrical signal generated by the photodetector may be converted by a digitizer into a pulse width modulated digitized signal, with the widths corresponding to the physical widths of the bars and spaces. Alternatively, the analog electrical signal may be processed directly by a software decoder. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,318.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The decoding process usually works by applying the digitized signal to a microprocessor running a software algorithm, which attempts to decode the signal. If a symbol is decoded successfully and completely, the decoding terminates, and an indicator of a successful read (such as a green light and/or audible beep) is provided to a user. Otherwise, the microprocessor receives the next scan, and performs another decoding into a binary representation of the data encoded in the symbol, and to the alphanumeric characters so represented. Once a successful read is obtained, the binary data is communicated to a host computer for further processing, for example, information retrieval from a look-up table.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Reading performance is a function of many factors, one of which is power output of the laser. Reading performance is enhanced when the laser power output is increased. Yet, stringent safety standards dictate the maximum power output of the laser. Also, reader malfunction must be reliably monitored.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Objects of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is a general object of this invention to control the power output of the laser to enhance system performance while meeting safety standards.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a general object of the present invention to deenergize the laser upon detection of a reader malfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the invention to increase the power output upon reading symbols over a wide field of view.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a further object of the present invention to deenergize the laser at clipping locations before reaching opposite ends of a scan line and increasing the power output between the clipping locations.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A still further object of the present invention is to repetitively deenergize and energize a laser to enhance system performance by serving as a visual indicator that a symbol has been successfully read</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">FEATURES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In keeping with the above objects and others which will become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention resides, briefly stated, in laser power control arrangements in electro-optical readers for reading indicia, such as bar code symbols, by generating a laser beam having an output power upon energizing a laser, by monitoring various operating conditions of the reader, and by controlling the output power of the laser as a function of each monitored operating condition.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one arrangement, the electrical current passing through the laser and/or the output power level of the laser is directly monitored and, if preestablished settings are not met, the laser is deenergized. In another arrangement, the laser includes a laser diode, and a monitor photodiode for monitoring the output power of the diode. If preestablished settings for the monitor photodiode are not met, the laser is deenergized. In yet another arrangement, the temperature of the reader is monitored, and the laser is deenergized if the monitored temperature is outside acceptable levels.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The reader may include a movable scan component, such as a scan mirror, driven by a drive at a prescribed amplitude and frequency over a scan angle so that a scan line is traced over the symbol. The laser is deenergized if the amplitude and/or frequency lies outside preestablished settings for these parameters. The laser output power is preferably increased when the scan angle is increased. The laser is deenergized at clipping locations before the opposite ends of the scan line are reached, and the laser output power is increased between the clipping locations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Whenever the laser is deenergized, this signifies that a reader malfunction has occurred, or may be imminent, in which case, removal of the laser from its source of power discontinues the generation of the laser beam and serves as a safety measure. Whenever the laser power is increased, this boosts reader performance.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Still another arrangement for enhancing reader performance is to repetitively deenergize and energize the laser beam after a symbol has been successfully read. The flashing laser beam serves as a visual indicator on the symbol within the direct line of sight of an operator that the symbol was successfully read and is especially desirable in noisy environments, where the audible beep cannot be heard, and in those cases where the operator's attention is not to be diverted by having the operator look away from the symbol and to the visible indicator conventionally found on the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The novel features which are considered as characteristic of the invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term “symbol” broadly encompasses not only symbol patterns composed of alternating bars and spaces of various widths as commonly referred to as bar code symbols, but also other one- or two-dimensional graphic patterns, as well as alphanumeric characters. In general, the term “symbol” may apply to any type of pattern or indicia which may be recognized or identified either by scanning a light beam and detecting reflected or scattered light as a representation of variations in light reflectivity at various points of the pattern or indicia. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an indicia <b>15</b> as one example of a “symbol” to be read.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a handheld laser scanner device <b>10</b> for reading symbols. The laser scanner device <b>10</b> includes a housing having a barrel portion <b>11</b> and a handle <b>12</b>. Although the drawing depicts a handheld pistol-shaped housing, the invention may also be implemented in other types of housings such as a desk-top workstation or a stationary scanner. In the illustrated embodiment, the barrel portion <b>11</b> of the housing includes an exit port or window <b>13</b> through which an outgoing laser light beam <b>14</b> passes to impinge on, and scan across, the bar code symbol <b>15</b> located at some distance from the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The laser beam <b>14</b> moves across the symbol <b>15</b> to create a scan pattern. Typically, the scanning pattern is one-dimensional or linear, as shown by line <b>16</b>. This linear scanning movement of the laser beam <b>14</b> is generated by an oscillating scan mirror <b>17</b> driven by an oscillating motor <b>18</b>. If desired, means may be provided to scan the beam <b>14</b> through a two-dimensional scanning pattern, to permit reading of two-dimensional optically encoded symbols. A manually-actuated trigger <b>19</b> or similar means permit an operator to initiate the scanning operation when the operator holds and aims the device <b>10</b> at the symbol <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The scanner device <b>10</b> includes a laser source <b>20</b> mounted within the housing. The laser source <b>20</b> generates the laser beam <b>14</b>. A photodetector <b>21</b> is positioned within the housing to collect at least a portion of the light reflected and scattered from the bar code symbol <b>15</b>. The photodetector <b>21</b>, as shown, faces toward the window <b>13</b> and has a static, wide field of view characteristic of the non-retro-reflective readers described above. Alternatively, in a retro-reflective reader, a convex portion of the scan mirror <b>17</b> may focus collected light on the photodetector <b>21</b>, in which case the photodetector faces toward the scan mirror. As the beam <b>14</b> sweeps the symbol <b>15</b>, the photodetector <b>21</b> detects the light reflected and scattered from the symbol <b>15</b> and creates an analog electrical signal proportional to the intensity of the collected light.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A digitizer (not shown) typically converts the analog signal into a pulse width modulated digital signal, with the pulse widths and/or spacings corresponding to the physical widths of the bars and spaces of the scanned symbol <b>15</b>. A decoder (not shown), typically comprising a programmed microprocessor with associated RAM and ROM, decodes the pulse width modulated digital signal according to the specific symbology to derive a binary representation of the data encoded in the symbol, and the alphanumeric characters represented by the symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The laser source <b>20</b> directs the laser beam through an optical assembly comprising a focusing lens <b>22</b> and an aperture stop <b>23</b>, to modify and direct the laser beam onto the scan mirror <b>17</b>. The mirror <b>17</b>, mounted on a vertical shaft and oscillated by the motor drive <b>18</b> about a vertical axis, reflects the beam and directs it through the exit port <b>13</b> to the symbol <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To operate the scanner device <b>10</b>, the operator depresses trigger <b>19</b> which activates the laser source <b>20</b> and the motor <b>18</b>. The laser source <b>20</b> generates the laser beam which passes through the element <b>22</b> and aperture <b>23</b> combination. The element <b>22</b> and aperture <b>23</b> modify the beam to create an intense beam spot of a given size which extends continuously and does not vary substantially over a range <b>24</b> of working distances. The element and aperture combination directs the beam onto the rotary mirror <b>17</b>, which directs the modified laser beam outwardly from the scanner housing <b>11</b> and toward the bar code symbol <b>15</b> in a sweeping pattern, i.e., along scan line <b>16</b>. The bar code symbol <b>15</b>, placed at any point within the working distance <b>24</b> and substantially normal to the laser beam <b>14</b>, reflects and scatters a portion of the laser light. The photodetector <b>21</b>, shown mounted in the scanner housing <b>11</b> in a non-retro-reflective position, detects the reflected and scattered light and converts the received light into an analog electrical signal. The photodetector could also be mounted in a retro-reflective position facing the scan mirror <b>17</b>. The system circuitry then converts the analog signal to a pulse width modulated digital signal which a microprocessor-based decoder decodes according to the characteristics of the bar code symbology rules.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the laser source <b>20</b> includes a laser diode <b>25</b> and a monitor photodiode <b>26</b> operative for monitoring the output power of the diode <b>25</b>. The photodiode <b>26</b> is part of a feedback circuit operative for maintaining the laser output power constant. The feedback circuit includes a comparator <b>27</b> having a reference voltage applied to a positive input of the comparator through a voltage divider comprised of resistors <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. The photodiode <b>26</b> is connected to a negative input of the comparator via a resistive network including resistors <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>. The output of the comparator <b>27</b> is conducted through a resistor <b>32</b> and capacitor <b>34</b> to a gate G of a field effect transistor (FET) <b>33</b>. The drain output of the FET <b>33</b> is connected to the laser diode <b>25</b>. The source output of the device <b>33</b> is connected to ground through a current sense resistor <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described so far, the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is conventional in that the monitor photodiode <b>26</b> detects changes in output power of the laser beam emitted by laser diode <b>25</b> and sends a feedback signal to the comparator <b>27</b> for driving the FET <b>33</b> to allow more or less current to pass through the current sense resistor <b>35</b> and, in turn, through the laser diode <b>25</b>. The greater this current, the greater the laser output power, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with one arrangement of this invention, a current sense comparator <b>36</b> has one input connected to the current sense resistor <b>35</b> to monitor the current flowing therethrough, and another input connected to a reference voltage that corresponds to the maximum current allowable through the resistor <b>35</b>. The output of the comparator <b>36</b> is connected to an OR gate <b>37</b> which, in turn, is connected to a latch <b>38</b> and a switch <b>39</b>, which is connected between a power supply <b>40</b> and the laser diode <b>25</b>. If the comparator <b>36</b> senses that the current passing through the resistor <b>35</b> exceeds a maximum preestablished value, then an output control signal is conducted to the gate <b>37</b> and, in turn, to the latch <b>38</b> for opening the switch <b>39</b> to remove the power source <b>40</b> from energizing the laser diode <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In further accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a window comparator <b>41</b> is connected to the resistor <b>32</b> and monitors the voltage being applied to the gate G of the FET <b>33</b>. A maximum gate voltage and a minimum gate voltage are also applied to the window comparator <b>41</b>. The comparator <b>41</b> is, in turn, connected to the OR gate <b>37</b>. If the comparator <b>41</b> senses that the gate voltage being applied to the gate G is greater than the preestablished maximum gate voltage, or is less than the preestablished minimum gate voltage, then a signal is sent to the OR gate <b>37</b> to operate the latch <b>38</b> and open the switch <b>39</b>, thereby deenergizing the laser diode. Thus, power is removed from the laser diode <b>25</b> in the event of malfunction or failure of the monitor photodiode <b>26</b>, the FET <b>33</b>, the comparator <b>27</b>, the laser diode <b>25</b>, or any circuit connection.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">More specifically, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> circuit removes the power source <b>40</b> from the laser <b>20</b> after detecting an out-of-range condition in the error amplifier <b>27</b> that controls the output power of the laser. This circuit will remove power from the laser in the following conditions:</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A failure of the device <b>33</b> in the output of the laser drive causes excess current to flow through the laser, thereby causing the laser output to exceed the factory set limit.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The monitor diode <b>26</b> connection is lost due to a device <b>33</b> failure or a circuit connection failure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The laser fails and the laser drive current significantly increases as resistor <b>35</b> is used to sense a high current drive condition.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Advantageously, a timer could be added to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> circuit to remove power only when a malfunction persists for a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the laser source <b>20</b> is connected to the power source <b>40</b> by the switch <b>39</b> under control of a microcontroller <b>44</b>, preferably the same component that decodes the symbol and controls overall reader operation. A temperature sensor <b>43</b> is connected to the microcontroller <b>44</b> for monitoring the ambient temperature of the reader, preferably in the vicinity of the laser source <b>20</b>. If the monitored temperature exceeds a preset value, the microcontroller <b>44</b> opens the switch <b>39</b> to protect the laser source. A laser regulator <b>45</b> is connected to the laser source <b>20</b> and enables the microcontroller <b>44</b> to monitor the laser current and/or the laser output power and, if those values or other laser settings are outside preestablished values for these parameters, then the microcontroller <b>44</b> also opens the switch <b>39</b> to protect the laser source.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The aforementioned motor <b>18</b> for oscillating the scan mirror <b>17</b> in alternate circumferential directions denoted by the double-headed arrow <b>46</b> is under the control of a motor regulator <b>42</b> and the microcontroller <b>44</b>. The microcontroller itself monitors the amplitude of scan angle A and the frequency of oscillation at which the mirror <b>17</b> is oscillated. If these values or other motor settings are outside preestablished values for these parameters, then the microcontroller <b>44</b> opens the switch <b>39</b>. The microcontroller <b>44</b> can store the preestablished values, or it can communicate with a remote host <b>47</b> to retrieve the preestablished values, or updated values, or communicate to the host the presence of a fault condition, such as a laser or motor fault, or, at the request of the host, communicate operating parameters of the system such as motor frequency, temperature, and/or laser power, or the host can attempt to resolve such problems by initiating and controlling a system calibration episode to correct such faults, i.e., reduce laser power, or increase scan amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Other arrangements for removing power from the laser source <b>20</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-E</figref>. In each figure, the laser diode <b>25</b> emits the laser beam toward the focusing lens <b>22</b>, and the monitor photodiode <b>26</b> is positioned behind a rear facet of the laser diode <b>25</b> to monitor the output power level.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an auxiliary photodiode <b>48</b> is positioned behind a beam splitter <b>49</b> to monitor the outgoing laser beam. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a diffractive structure is located on the focusing lens <b>22</b> to direct a part of the outgoing beam to the auxiliary photodiode <b>48</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the auxiliary photodiode <b>48</b> itself is shaped as an annulus to serve as the aperture stop <b>23</b>, and the walls bounding the aperture receive the outgoing beam for detection by the auxiliary photodiode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, an auxiliary photodiode is not used, but a light scattering surface <b>50</b> is provided inside the laser source to reflect a part of the outgoing beam back to the monitor photodiode <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, again an auxiliary photodiode is not used, but an incident surface of the focusing lens <b>22</b> is used to backscatter a part of the outgoing beam back to the monitor photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-E</figref>, the additional light detected by either the auxiliary photodiode <b>48</b>, or the monitor photodiode <b>26</b>, is monitored and converted by the microcontroller <b>44</b> to generate a control signal used to open the switch <b>39</b> when the monitored operating condition does not meet a preestablished value. This feature promotes safety in the use of a reader in which a laser beam is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Rather than interrupt power to the laser, system performance is enhanced by increasing laser output power under certain conditions. For example, as noted above, a variable scan angle A is beneficial for readers in that a narrow scan angle (e.g., 35°) is desired for reading far-out symbols located at a distance (e.g., 20″) from the reader, whereas a wide scan angle (e.g., 53°) is desired for reading close-in symbols located at a distance (e.g., 2″) near the reader. Switching between different scan angles can be achieved by software commands, or by hardware, and can be configured in advance of reading indicia, or even during the reading of indicia.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In any event, this invention further proposes increasing the output power of the laser when the scan angle is wide. Safety standards permit increased laser power when the beam is spread. The microcontroller <b>44</b> detects the size of the scan angle via the motor regulator <b>42</b> and when it determines that the scan angle is wide, the microcontroller <b>44</b> commands the laser regulator <b>45</b>, typically by adjusting the attenuation of a digital potentiometer, to enable more current to pass through the laser diode <b>25</b>, thereby increasing the laser output power and, in turn, boosting reader performance while not exceeding prevailing safety standards.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another example in which laser output power is increased occurs during each scan line. Safety standards determine the maximum laser output power when the beam is stationary and therefore most intense. This occurs at the extreme ends of each scan line. It will be recalled that a beam spot decelerates as it approaches in one direction towards each end of a scan line, stops at the extreme end of each scan line, and then accelerates in the opposite direction. It is at these ends when the beam spot is stationary that determine the maximum allowed laser output power.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">This invention further proposes deenergizing the laser source during the approach toward each end and, in effect, electrically clipping the opposite end regions of each scan line. Now, the beam spot is not stationary at these clipping locations and, hence, the maximum laser output power can be increased between the clipping locations without violating safety standards.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The microcontroller <b>44</b> detects the length of the scan line via the motor regulator <b>42</b>, determines the clipping locations, and commands the laser regulator <b>45</b> to increase the laser output power between the clipping locations. For example, it is conventional for the motor regulator to generate a start-of-scan (SOS) signal at each end of the scan line. The microcontroller <b>44</b> detects the length of the scan line by measuring the time between two successive SOS signals. The clipping locations can be set as a percentage, e.g., 95%, of the measured time. The increase in laser power can be achieved, as before, by adjusting a digital potentiometer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">To compensate for the shorter length of the clipped scan line, this invention also proposes the simultaneous increase in the scan angle A. System performance is enhanced by increased laser output power.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In still another proposal for increasing system performance, the laser source is rapidly and repetitively deenergized and energized to generate a flashing scan line after the symbol has been successfully read. As noted above, typically an audible beep is generated to audibly indicate a successful reading. However, the beep is not easily heard in a noisy environment. Also, a green indicator light on the housing <b>11</b> is also generated to visually indicate a successful reading. However, an operator must divert his or her gaze or line of sight away from the targeted symbol to confirm illumination by the green indicator light. The flashing scan line on the symbol after the reading has occurred maintains the operator's line of sight directly on the symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The flashing scan line is generated by commands issued from the microcontroller <b>44</b> to the laser regulator <b>45</b> to rapidly and repetitively decrease and increase the laser current through the laser diode <b>25</b>. By controlling the timing of the commands, the visual indicator need not be a flashing solid scan line, but could be a dotted or dashed scan line in which the laser current is changed during each scan line.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some applications, more than one symbol is covered by a single scan line, and the operator, upon hearing or seeing an indicator, may not know which of the symbols was successfully decoded. One solution would be to generate the above-mentioned dotted scan line only over the symbol that was successfully decoded, thereby advising the operator which symbol was not decoded.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, also may find a useful application in other types of constructions differing from the types described above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in laser power control arrangements in electro-optical readers, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although described in connection with moving-beam readers, the laser control arrangements of this invention can equally well be applied to imaging readers, laser projection displays and, in general, any system in which a light source is used for illumination of, and for aiming at, a target.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention and, therefore, such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the following claims.</p>
