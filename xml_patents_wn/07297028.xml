<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a cable connector type transceiver module having module connectors from whose backside a cable for balanced transmission is extended and is used to connect a HDD (hard disk drive) to a switching device in a RAID (redundant array of independent disks).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a RAID. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, plural HDDs <b>20</b> and a switching device <b>30</b> are disposed in a RAID <b>10</b>, and each HDD <b>20</b> is electrically connected to the switching device <b>30</b> so that data can be transmitted and received between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b>. Plural RAIDs <b>10</b> are disposed and each RAID <b>10</b> is connected to a server <b>40</b> via a network by Ethernet (registered trademark).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a connection between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b>. Since the distance between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b> is as small as one to two meters, conventionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connection between them is performed by electric transceiver modules <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> and a cable connector <b>70</b> which uses a copper wire cable <b>71</b>, instead of by an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electric transceiver module <b>50</b> has a thin and long rectangular parallelepiped shape and provides a control IC package <b>51</b>, a card edge section <b>52</b> at one end, a connector <b>53</b> at the other end, and has a function to receive/transmit data. Similarly, the electric transceiver module <b>60</b> has a thin and long rectangular parallelepiped shape and provides a control IC package <b>61</b>, a card edge section <b>62</b> at one end, a connector <b>63</b> at the other end, and has a function to receive/transmit data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cable connector <b>70</b> provides the copper wire cable <b>71</b> and connectors <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> one at each end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The electric transceiver module <b>50</b> is inserted into a slot <b>21</b> of the HDD <b>20</b> and the card edge section <b>52</b> is connected to a card edge connector <b>22</b> of the HDD <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electric transceiver module <b>60</b> is inserted into a slot <b>31</b> of the switching device <b>30</b> and the card edge section <b>62</b> is connected to a card edge connector <b>32</b> of the switching device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The connector <b>72</b> is connected to the connector <b>53</b> and the connector <b>73</b> is connected to the connector <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The transmission rate of data between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b> is approximately 2 Gbps.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2000-68007</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a next generation RAID, the transmission rate of data between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b> becomes, for example, 4 Gbps or more. That is, the transmission rate becomes high speed. When data are transmitted at high speed, losses of signals in a transmission line become large.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the transmission line between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b>, the losses occur at the connection point between the connector <b>72</b> and the connector <b>53</b>, the connection point between the connector <b>73</b> and the connector <b>63</b>, and entire long wiring patterns on printed circuit boards in the electric transceiver modules <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Consequently, in the above connection between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b>, the losses of signals become large at the transmission rate of 4 Gbps, and the transmission rate of 4 Gbps cannot be efficiently utilized.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, the present invention may provide a cable connector type transceiver module which can be used at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present invention, there is provided a cable connector type transceiver module. The cable connector type transceiver module includes transceiver module connectors disposed one at each end of a cable for balanced transmission which cable provides pairs of wires in which a pair of insulation covered signal wires is bundled, and the transceiver module connector has a transceiver module main body assembled in a housing. The transceiver module main body includes a printed circuit board which provides a card edge connecting section at the tip, plural pads for wire soldering near the card edge connecting section, and wiring patterns extending between the card edge connecting section and the pads for wire soldering, and a control IC package mounted on the printed circuit board. The pairs of wires of the cable for balanced transmission are extended in the card edge connecting section direction over the control IC package, and signal wires which the tips of the insulation covered signal wires are uncovered are soldered to the pads for wire soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to embodiments of the present invention, the pairs of wires at the end of the cable for balanced transmission are extended in the direction of the card edge connecting section over the control IC package and the signal wires extended from the tips of the insulation covered signal wires are soldered to the pads for wire soldering at the position near the card edge connecting section rather than near the control IC package. Therefore, on the printed circuit board, the length of the wiring patterns between the card edge connecting section and the pads for wire soldering can be made short. Consequently, the cable connector type transceiver module can be used at the high speed of the data transmission rate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

Then information of the type of the transceiver module main body <b>120</b>A stored in the control IC package <b>140</b>A in the electric transceiver module connector <b>111</b> is sent to the switching device <b>30</b>, and also information of the type of the transceiver module main body <b>120</b> stored in the control IC package <b>140</b> in the electric transceiver module connector <b>110</b> is sent to the HDD <b>20</b>. By the above information, the switching device <b>30</b> and the HDD <b>20</b> recognize the type of the connected cable connector type transceiver module <b>100</b>; therefore, data transmission can be suitably performed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The data transmission is performed by a balanced transmission system. In the balanced transmission system, a plus signal and a minus signal whose size is the same as that of the plus signal and direction is opposite are transmitted at the same time by using two pairs of wires.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Data from the HDD <b>20</b> to the switching device <b>30</b> are transmitted by, for example, the pair of wires <b>105</b>-<b>1</b> and data from the switching device <b>30</b> to the HDD <b>20</b> are transmitted by the pair of wires <b>105</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram showing a transmission line by using the pair of wires <b>105</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">One end of the metal tape <b>109</b> is electrically connected to a frame ground FG of the HDD <b>20</b> via the housing <b>160</b>A and the other end of the metal tape <b>109</b> is electrically connected to a frame ground FG of the switching device <b>30</b> via the housing <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">One end of the drain wire <b>108</b> is electrically connected to a signal ground SG of the HDD <b>20</b> via the card edge connector <b>22</b> and the other end of the drain wire <b>108</b> is electrically connected to a signal ground SG of the switching device <b>30</b> via the card edge connector <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A plus signal <b>300</b> from the HDD <b>20</b> is transmitted to the switching device <b>30</b> via the card edge connector <b>22</b>, the card edge connecting section <b>123</b>A, the wiring pattern <b>127</b>A, the AC coupling capacitor <b>141</b>A, the wiring pattern <b>128</b>A, the signal wire <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, the wiring pattern <b>128</b>, the AC coupling capacitor <b>141</b>, the wiring pattern <b>127</b>, the card edge connecting section <b>123</b>, and the card edge connector <b>32</b>. A minus signal <b>301</b> from the HDD <b>20</b> is transmitted to the switching device <b>30</b> via a similar route to the above by using the signal wire <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> instead of using the signal wire <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the above transmission line, the connectors <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> in the cable connector <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> do not exist. Therefore, in the present embodiment, losses generated at the connection points at the connectors <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When signal transmission characteristics of wiring patterns formed on a printed circuit board are compared with signal transmission characteristics of signal wires in the pair of wires <b>105</b>-<b>1</b>, the signal transmission characteristics of the signal wires in the pair of wires <b>105</b>-<b>1</b> are more excellent. Therefore, in the cable connector type transceiver module <b>100</b>, the lengths of the wiring patterns <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>127</b>A, and <b>128</b>A are as short as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Therefore, by using the cable connector type transceiver module <b>100</b>, the following advantages can be obtained. That is, first, the number of the connector connecting points is small; second, the length of the wiring patterns <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>127</b>A, and <b>128</b>A is as short as possible; third, a balanced transmission system is used for data transmission; and finally, the impedance of the signal route of the wiring patterns <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>127</b>A, and <b>128</b>A is matched to be 100 Ω. With this, high-speed data transmission of 4 Gbps between the HDD <b>20</b> and the switching device <b>30</b> can be realized. In addition, since the length of the wiring patterns <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>127</b>A, and <b>128</b>A is short, the length of the cable for balanced transmission <b>101</b> can be long. Therefore, the transmission distance where the high-speed data are normally transmitted can be long.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the electric transceiver module connector <b>110</b> is pulled out from the slot <b>31</b> of the switching device <b>30</b>, a user pulls the Y<b>2</b> end of the electric transceiver module connector <b>110</b> in the Y<b>2</b> direction while pushing the unlocking lever <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). By pushing the unlocking lever <b>190</b>, the claw <b>190</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) elastically deforms a part of the slot <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the opening for locking (not shown) is unlocked from the protrusion for locking <b>179</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), then the unlocking is performed. As described above, unlocking operations and pulling out operations of the electric transceiver module connector <b>110</b> can be performed by one action.</p>
