<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Method and apparatus on charges injection using piezo-ballistic-charges injection mechanism are provided for semiconductor device and nonvolatile memory device. The device comprises a strain source, an injection filter, a first conductive region, a second conductive region, and a charge collecting region. The strain source permits piezo-effect in ballistic charges transport to enable the piezo-ballistic-charges injection mechanism in device operations. The injection filter permits transporting of charge carriers of one polarity type from the first conductive region, through the filter, and through the second conductive region to the charge collecting region while blocking the transport of charge carriers of an opposite polarity from the second conductive region to the first conductive region. The present invention further provides an energy band engineering method permitting the devices be operated without suffering from disturbs, from dielectric breakdown, from impact ionization, and from undesirable RC effects.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to semiconductor device and semiconductor memory device. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus on transporting charges in these devices using piezo-ballistic-charges injection mechanism. Charge states of memory devices can be altered by injecting piezo-ballistic holes or by injecting piezo-ballistic electrons on charge storage regions of memory cells for erase and for program operations, respectively.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ballistic transport of charge carriers is a well-known phenomenon in solid state physics. It represents charge carriers transporting in an active layer of conductive material (e.g. a semiconductor crystal) without scattering at all (i.e. transporting in a “ballistic” way). The active layer has to be kept thin enough to permit carrier transmission with substantially no scattering. Under these conditions, the transport of carriers resembles that in vacuum, but with the effective mass and group velocity of the carriers in the conductive material. One application of such physics has been proposed in a three terminals device (or “transistor”) in an article by Mead (see Mead, “The Tunnel Emission Amplifier,” Proceedings of the IRE, vol. 48, pp. 359–361, 1960), which is hereby incorporated by reference. U.S. application Ser. No. 09/942,338, which is hereby incorporated by reference, disclosed operation method on non-volatile memory cells based on the charge injection mechanism and energy band structure illustrated in the noted article. However, there are several fundamental problems associated with the charge injection mechanism and energy band structure in the noted article. Further, there are fundamental problems when such mechanism and band structure are employed for non-volatile memory operation. Moreover, there are several problems in the prior art memory cell need to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention can best be understood with an understanding on how ballistic charge injection mechanism works, how prior art energy band structure is constructed, and how the devices are operated.</p>

The tunneling gate <b>10</b> is biased positively with respect to the ballistic gate <b>12</b> to permit holes <b>30</b> in the tunneling gate <b>10</b> to tunnel through a tunneling barrier having a valence band barrier height <b>32</b> between a valence band <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the tunneling gate <b>10</b> and a valence band <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the tunneling dielectric <b>28</b>.

When this bias is increased to a value such that those holes have energy higher than a hole barrier height <b>34</b> at the interface, the holes will be able to enter a valence band <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the retention dielectric region <b>26</b>, making their way through that region and be collected on the floating gate <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ballistic hot electron injection for programming prior art memory cell is done similarly to the ballistic hot hole injection except by reversing the bias polarity.

<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Problems on Charge Injection Mechanism of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is known that there are various types of holes, namely the light-hole (LH) and the heavy-hole (HH), in semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge, GaAs etc.). The light-hole has a lighter effective mass than the heavy-hole, and difference between them depends on the band structure of the valence sub-bands of semiconductors. Prior art did not distinguish these two different types of holes while employing ballistic hole injection mechanism for erasing prior art memory cells. Further, the prior art did not teach the effects associated with these two types of holes on the injection mechanism. Thus, the injection scheme employed in prior art is believed to suffer from following problems:</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">1) Low Injection Efficiency</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is known that the population of holes in a semiconductor is primarily of the heavy-hole (HH). This is to first order due to its larger density-of-state effective mass. For example, in silicon, it is known the HH occupied about 80 percent of the total population of holes (see, for example, Fischetti et al., Journal of Appl. Physics, vol. 94, pp. 1079–1095, 2003). Further, it is known the ballistic carrier transport is characterized by its mean-free-path, where a ballistic carrier having a longer mean-free-path can transport a longer distance without scattering. The mean-free-path is approximately inversely proportional to the mass of the carriers. Therefore, HH typically has a shorter mean-free-path, and are more likely to experience scattering events through interacting with other types of carriers (e.g. phonons). Thus, a ballistic HH is more prone to loose its ballistic nature during its transport in a semiconductor region. When a ballistic HH transports at energy greater than its thermal energy, it is therefore more likely to loose its energy to become a thermal carrier. Even not loosing all its energy, HH can have its energy component in the direction to the floating gate region (or targeted destination) be significantly lowered such that the hole has insufficient energy to surmount the barrier height <b>34</b> of the insulator <b>26</b>. In other words, when ballistic holes are employed for erasing prior art memory cells, since the majority population of the hole carriers are of the HH type, which has a shorter mean-free-path, most of the supplied holes cannot contribute to the erase operation as anticipate. This causes waste on total current. The combined effects of population and effective mass result in the ballistic hole injection efficiency significantly lower than one usually can expect. (Here, the efficiency is defined as number of charges collected compared to total number of charges supplied).</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">2) Higher Power Consumption and Slower Erase Speed</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The aforementioned effects were ignored in prior art memory cells, and hence the cells require more electrical current be supplied, thus consuming more electric power, in order to complete an erase operation. Further, the low hole injection efficiency in prior art cells can result in slow erase problem when implementing the cells in their product applications.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Problems on Parasitic-Electrons Backward Injection</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> on this problem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> except with additional parasitic electrons <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> in the valence band <b>12</b><i>b </i>and conduction band <b>12</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The electrons <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are also known as the valence electrons <b>36</b> and the conduction electrons <b>37</b>, respectively. Both electrons <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are shown transporting along a backward direction (hereinafter “backward injection”) from ballistic gate <b>12</b> to tunneling gate <b>10</b> when holes <b>30</b> are injected from tunneling gate <b>10</b> to ballistic gate <b>12</b> along a forward direction (hereinafter “forward injection”) for erase operation. To suppress these parasitic electrons, prior art taught requirements on material for ballistic gate <b>12</b>, where material with larger work function, such as a heavily doped p-type polysilicon (“p+ polysilicon”), is required. P+ polysilicon is taught in the prior art because electrons <b>37</b> in that material is usually negligible. Further, prior art taught a symmetrical tunneling stack structure comprising tunneling gate <b>10</b>, tunneling dielectric <b>28</b>, and ballistic gate <b>12</b>, wherein tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b> are of p+ polysilicon. The tunneling dielectric <b>28</b> is constructed in a single layer of oxynitride with oxide fraction engineered at level less than about 77% such that current flow of the backward injected electrons can be kept at similar current level as that of the forward injected holes <b>30</b>. In other words, the current of backward injected electrons in prior art cell cannot be-entirely suppressed. This causes waste on total current as the forward injected charge and its current is the one of interest for cell operations. Further, there are several other fundamental deficiencies on the symmetrical tunneling structure and cell structure of prior art. The issue is described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, for ballistic gate <b>12</b> of a p+ polysilicon in prior art, electrons <b>37</b> in that region is usually negligible when a low voltage is applied between tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b>. Therefore, tunneling current of electrons <b>37</b> is negligible. The parasitic electrons thus mainly comprise electrons <b>36</b> of valence band <b>12</b><i>b </i>and are tunneled to tunneling gate <b>10</b> through a trapezoidal-shaped barrier (also known as “direct tunneling”). However, when a voltage of erase operation (e.g. 5V) is applied between tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b>, the portion of ballistic gate <b>12</b> next to tunneling dielectric <b>28</b> can be inadvertently inverted and thus a layer of electrons <b>37</b> can still be formed therein. The electrons <b>37</b> are formed near the interface between tunneling dielectric <b>28</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b> and can be emitted into tunneling gate <b>10</b> along path <b>37</b><i>a </i>to become hot electrons having energy higher than a minimum of conduction band <b>10</b><i>a </i>of that region. The tunneling can be through a triangle-shaped tunneling barrier (also known as “Fowler-Nordheim tunneling”) having a barrier height <b>33</b> that is lower than that of electrons <b>36</b> by an energy gap <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the ballistic gate <b>12</b>. Therefore, due to the lower barrier height and the triangular shaped barrier for electrons <b>37</b>, a much stronger tunneling current is expected once tunneling process for electrons <b>37</b> starts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the parasitic currents J<sub>CE </sub>and J<sub>VE</sub>, associated with conduction electrons (“CE”) <b>37</b> and valence electrons (“VE”) <b>36</b>, respectively. The voltage dependence of current J<sub>CE </sub>is seen much stronger than that of current J<sub>VE </sub>due to the much stronger dependence of current on voltage when charges tunneling through a triangle-shaped barrier. Parasitic current J<sub>CE </sub>is seen dominating the total current in the higher voltage range (e.g. about 5V). The results show that electrons <b>37</b> dominate the parasitic electrons <b>36</b> in valence band <b>12</b><i>b </i>and hence the total parasitic electrons tunneled into the tunneling gate <b>10</b>. Note that this effect is work function independent. The p+ polysilicon/oxynitride/p+ polysilicon tunneling stack in prior art overlook such effect, and hence the prior art cell <b>100</b> can suffer from the parasitic carriers backward tunneling. Therefore it cannot function properly.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Problems on Parasitic-Holes Backward Injection</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Parasitic holes backward injection problem is another major problem for the mechanism employed in prior art. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> on this problem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> except with additional parasitic holes <b>38</b> shown in the valence band <b>12</b><i>b </i>and some others elements (e.g. electrons <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>′) to be discussed in a later session. Holes <b>38</b> are shown transporting in the backward direction from ballistic gate <b>12</b> to tunneling gate <b>10</b> when electrons <b>31</b> are injected in the forward direction for program operation of prior art cell. The problem on backward injected holes <b>38</b> is caused by the requirement on higher work function in prior art. Further there are shown barrier height <b>10</b><i>c </i>for forward injected electrons <b>31</b>, and barrier height <b>39</b> for backward injected holes <b>38</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, as work function of the ballistic gate <b>12</b> is increased, once it's beyond a level where the barrier <b>39</b> becomes less than the barrier height <b>10</b><i>c</i>, parasitic holes <b>38</b> can be backward injected to tunneling gate <b>10</b> and can result in problems to the program operation similar to that caused by the parasitic electrons to the erase operation. Therefore, the symmetrical tunneling structure of prior art cannot be optimized to suppress parasitic charge carriers for both program and erase operations simultaneously. Such problem prevents tunneling gate <b>10</b> in the prior art cell from being used as a single electrode for supplying both types of charges (i.e. electrons and holes). Therefore, it is believed prior art require two separate tunneling gates: one for electron tunneling injection, and the other one for hole tunneling injection. This requirement results in larger cell size, and limits the cell of prior art from practical application.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This problem also exists in operating the amplifier by Mead, wherein metal is employed as the material for base, which is equivalent to the ballistic gate <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The backward injected holes can unduly increase the base current of the amplifier, and hence degrade the performance of such device when used an amplifier.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Problems on Impact Ionization</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition to the problems described above, the injection mechanism and energy band structure employed in prior art also can suffered from impact ionization problem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the impact ionization problem in the prior art band structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. There are shown electrons <b>40</b> in the conduction band <b>10</b><i>a </i>of tunneling gate <b>10</b>. In the program operation of prior art, a typical voltage of −2 V and a +2 V is applied to the tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b>, respectively. The voltage difference between these gates has to be greater than a minimum voltage in order to supply sufficient energy for electrons <b>31</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) to surmount the barrier height <b>35</b> to enter the floating gate <b>14</b>. However, due to the high bias thus introduced across tunneling dielectric <b>28</b>, an inversion layer of electrons <b>40</b> can be formed in the conduction band <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the tunneling gate <b>10</b> of p+ polysilicon. Further, another mechanism that can form electrons <b>40</b> is through the impact generation process triggered by the backward injected holes <b>38</b>. As is clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> that as these holes <b>38</b> enter into tunneling gate <b>10</b>, their energy can be high enough to generate, through impact ionization process, secondary electrons <b>40</b> in conduction band <b>10</b><i>a </i>or energetic electrons <b>40</b>′ having energy higher than conduction band <b>10</b><i>a</i>. These conduction electrons <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>′ thus generated are termed “Impact-Ionized CE” and behave very differently than the electrons <b>31</b> at the valence band <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, in such range of bias, the current of CE (J<sub>CE</sub>) is much larger than the current of VE (J<sub>VE</sub>). In other words, the generated CE <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>′ (either through inversion or through impact-ionization) can dominate the tunneling current between gates <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> of prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Likewise, impact ionization problem can also happen in ballistic gate <b>12</b> and can be triggered by electrons <b>40</b> or by energetic electrons <b>40</b>′ transported from tunneling gate <b>10</b>. As described above, these electrons <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>′ are inadvertently generated under the bias condition for program operation. The presence of these electrons is not desirable as they carry a much higher energy than that carried by electrons <b>31</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, these electrons <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>′ can tunnel through the tunneling dielectric <b>28</b> at such a high energy into ballistic gate <b>12</b> and subsequently cause impact ionization therein, where pairs of electrons <b>40</b><i>b </i>and holes <b>40</b><i>a </i>are created. The holes <b>40</b><i>a </i>are highly energized and can be backward injected to gate <b>10</b> creating traps in dielectric <b>28</b> as passing through, thus causing reliability problem. It should be noted that similar problem can exist in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when energized electrons (not shown) having energy higher than conduction band <b>12</b><i>a </i>are created in the ballistic gate <b>12</b> by the injected holes <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is now clear that the impact ionization and the inversion layer formation can exist in the tunneling gate <b>10</b> in the energy band structure for the ballistic injection scheme of prior art. All these effects can create parasitic electrons <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>′ in tunneling gate <b>10</b>. The effects and the parasitic electrons in the tunneling gate region <b>10</b> were not taken into account in the prior art. These effects are uncontrollable, where current can unduly increase to result in current loading issue on supporting circuitry for memory operations. The effects further cause reliability problem. To avoid these problems in program operation, the allowable maximum voltage between gates <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> of prior art cells has to be limited under a threshold voltage to avoid the formation of electrons <b>40</b> and/or <b>40</b>′ in tunneling gate <b>10</b>. The range between the minimum and the maximum program voltages defines a workable voltage range for program operation of prior art, and is quite narrow for the injection mechanism employed in prior art (less than about 0.6V). The cell structure in prior art thus demands stringent control on the threshold voltage, and is believed having low manufacturability yield and difficulties in practical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Similar to the program operation, for the erase operation (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), the impact-ionization process can also occur in tunneling gate <b>10</b> due to electrons <b>37</b> backward injected from ballistic gate <b>12</b>. The backward injected electrons <b>37</b> have energy high enough to impact ionize charge carriers in tunneling gate <b>10</b> to cause loading issue on supporting circuitry and reliability problem. The injection mechanism, energy band and cell structure in prior art thus face similar issues in both the program and the erase operations, and the memory is believed having low manufacturability yield and difficulties in practical applications.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Problems on Dielectric Breakdown</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> for the illustration. In the erase operation of prior art, a typical voltage of +2.5 V and a −2.5V is applied to tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b>, respectively. The voltage difference between these two gates has to be greater than a minimum voltage in order to supply sufficient energy for holes <b>30</b> to surmount the barrier height <b>34</b>. However, for the energy band structures proposed in the prior art, such voltage results in a maximum field in the range of about 10 MV/cm to about 20 MV/cm across the tunneling dielectric layer <b>28</b>. In such range of high field, the tunneling dielectric <b>28</b> is believed suffered from dielectric breakdown (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). To avoid a dielectric breakdown event in cell operation, the maximum allowable voltage between gates <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> has to be limited under the dielectric breakdown voltage. The range between the minimum and the maximum voltages defines a workable voltage range for the erase operation, and is quite narrow in prior art (typically less than about 0.7V). The cell structure in prior art thus demands stringent control on the dielectric breakdown, and is believed having difficulties in practical applications.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Problems on Parasitic Capacitance</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the energy band structure and cell structure of prior art, the thickness of the tunneling dielectric layer <b>28</b> is chosen with a limitation typically in the range of about 2 nanometer to 4 nanometer (“nm” hereinafter) in order to permit charge carriers tunneling through that layer. Therefore, it results in a large parasitic capacitance C between gates <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, and is undesirable as it introduces adverse impact on cell operation. The capacitance issue can be better understood by referring to the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> (prior art), wherein C<sub>BG-TG </sub>is the capacitance between ballistic gate <b>12</b> and tunneling gate <b>10</b>, and C<sub>BG-FG </sub>is the capacitance between ballistic gate <b>12</b> and floating gate <b>14</b>. The total capacitance seen by ballistic gate <b>12</b> comprises two main components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, and approximately equals the summation of C<sub>BG-FG </sub>and C<sub>BG-TG</sub>. In most situations, the total capacitance can be dominated by C<sub>BG-TG </sub>due to the much thinner thickness for the tunneling dielectric layer <b>28</b> than that for the retention dielectric layer <b>26</b>, which is typical in the range of about 7 nm to about 12 nm. The capacitance issue is worse when employing dielectric with higher dielectric constant (e.g. oxynitride), which is provided in the prior art for suppressing the parasitic electrons in ballistic gate <b>12</b> during hole injection for the erase operation. Therefore, the cell architecture in prior art further suffer from the compromise between suppressing the parasitic electrons and suppressing the total capacitance of ballistic gate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Problems on Large Resistance</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the prior art, ballistic gate <b>12</b> is the active layer for ballistic transport and is required to be with a thickness in the range of a few times of the mean-free path of carrier scattering (typically in the range of 10–20 nm), in order to permit the injected carriers transporting through ballistic gate <b>12</b> with good efficiency. The needs on a thin thickness unavoidably results in a high sheet resistance to that layer. As described earlier, to reduce parasitic electron tunneling (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), prior art is limited to using p-type Si for both tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b> when polysilicon is used as the material for these gates. It is known that a heavily doped p-type polysilicon (“p+ polysilicon”) typically has a higher resistivity than that of a heavily doped n-type polysilicon (“n+ polysilicon”). Therefore, prior art suffers from a much larger resistance R on both tunneling gate <b>10</b> and ballistic gate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The adverse effect of a large R on memory cell performance can be understood from several directions. First, it can cause a large signal delay due to the combining effects of the large R and the large C (i.e. the RC delay). This is particularly a main issue on cell operation as the RC delay can limit the speed on accessing a memory cell when embedded in a large memory array. Secondly, for disturb prevention on un-selected cells, an optimum set of predetermined voltages usually are required to be applied to those cells. However, due to the RC delay, voltages on un-selected cells can be different than the desired values, and hence cell disturb is more prone to happen. Furthermore, the large R can combine with a large current I to result in a IR effect, which can cause a voltage drop when passing a voltage in a signal line. The effect prevents the voltage on a designated electrode of a memory cell from reaching its desired level, and hence can adversely impact cell operation. For example, the adverse impact on an unselected cell can be an undesired cell disturb, where the cell state is unintentionally changed from one logic state (e.g. a “0”) to the other (e.g. a “1”). The IR impact on a selected cell can be a slower speed on cell operations (i.e. program, erase, and read operations).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Problems on Weak Voltage-Dependence of Tunneling Current</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The energy band structure in prior art is constructed to permit charge carriers of one type tunneling from tunneling gate <b>10</b> to ballistic gate <b>12</b> at a current level similar to that for the backward injected parasitic electrons. This results in weak voltage-dependence on the current-voltage relationship. For example, the current for an erase disable condition (i.e. the condition to prevent an unselected cell from an erase disturb) is seen only 10<sup>4 </sup>times lower than that for the erase condition. Similar results can be seen in the program disable condition of prior art. Therefore, unselected cells in prior art are prone to cell disturb issues in both program and erase operations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The aforementioned problems (e.g. impact ionization, dielectric breakdown, parasitic capacitance, large resistance, and weak voltage-dependent tunneling current etc.) also exist in the transistor by Mead. Further, another major problem encountered by the transistor is to do with the low transfer ratio due to the low efficiency of the injection mechanism. Choosing electron as the ballistic carriers for transistor operation can somewhat improve the transfer ratio due to a higher efficiency for electron than that for holes. However, the efficiency typically still ranges from about 0.01 to about 0.4, and thus prevents the transistor from practical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">These problems can be overcome in accordance with one aspect of the present invention by providing a piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism. Employing the mechanism, the present invention further provides technique altering effective mass of ballistic charge carriers and hence its mean-free-path. Additionally, employing the mechanism, the present invention provides technique increasing carriers population in sub-bands or valleys favorable to their transport. The piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism is implemented in cell structures in accordance with the present invention. Further, these problems can be overcome in accordance with another aspect of the present invention by providing a barrier height engineering concept on energy band structure, by providing a novel method altering barrier heights, by providing injection filter structures, and by providing new structures on cell and devices.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0087">Piezo-effect is a well-known physical phenomenon in solid-state physics. Piezo-effect can change electrical properties of a semiconductor material when a mechanical stress is applied to such material (see Pikus and Bir, Symmetry and Strain-Induced Effects in Semiconductors, New York: Wiley, 1974). The mechanical stress can be originated from a strain source (also can be termed as “stressor”) that is either internal or external to the material. This mechanical stress can be either in compressive form (compression), or in tensile form (tension), and can results in a strain in the material. It breaks the symmetry within the crystal lattice and hence deforms the potential therein. Some well-known applications of the piezo-effect on semiconductors (e.g. silicon) are piezo-resistive effect in resistors, piezo-junction effect in bipolar transistors and diodes, piezo-Hall effect in sensors, and piezo-FETs in MOS transistors (“MOSFETs”).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0088">The present invention provides the application of the piezo-effect to the ballistic charge carrier injection and transport. A novel piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism is provided with illustrations made herein to various embodiments of memory cells and semiconductor devices.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0089">It is known that when a strain is in presence in semiconductors, it can split valleys in conduction band and degeneracy in valence sub-bands of HH and LH (see Hensel et al., “Cyclotron Resonance Experiments in Uniaxially Stressed Silicon: Valence Band Inverse Mass Parameters and Deformation Potentials, Phys. Rev. 129, pp. 1141–1062, 1963). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> provide schematic diagrams illustrating the dispersion relationship between energy E and momentum vector k for a semiconductor without strain, under tensile stress, and under compressive stress, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows electrons <b>41</b> filled in two conduction band valleys <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> having minima <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The minima <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>a </i>are shown at similar energy level. With the different curvatures on the dispersion curves shown for the valleys, the left valley <b>42</b> has a heavier effective mass than the right one <b>44</b>. Also shown are dispersion curves for LH and HH sub-bands <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> filled with holes <b>50</b>. LH and HH sub-bands <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are shown having energy degeneracy at a valence band maximum <b>52</b>. The conduction band minima <b>42</b><i>a </i>or <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the valence band maximum <b>52</b> are separated by an energy band gap <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows dispersion relationship similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except the semiconductor is strained with tensile stress. The conduction band valleys are shown shifted with their minima moving upward (left valley <b>42</b>) or downward (right valley <b>44</b>). This shift redistributes the electron population within the two valleys, where electrons <b>41</b> are more populated in the valley <b>44</b> due to a lower energy level on the conduction band minimum <b>44</b><i>a</i>. Repopulating electrons <b>41</b> to reside primarily in valley <b>44</b> is desirable for two reasons. First, it provides desirable effect on electron transport in the semiconductor due to the lighter electron effective mass in the conduction valley <b>44</b>. Second, the separation of the valleys is known being able to reduce inter-valley scattering of electrons. These effects can be more specifically illustrated by using silicon as an example. The strain in silicon can cause splitting of the six-fold degenerate conduction band into two-fold and four-fold degenerate valleys with most electrons (about 100 percent of the entire electrons) populated in the two-fold degenerate valley having lighter effective mass along electron transport direction. This strain effect is known to increase electron mobility by about 50 percent and drift velocity by about 16 percent in strained-Si MOSFETs (a type of piezo-FETs, see Vogelsang et al., “Electron Mobilities and High-Field Drift Velocity in Strained Silicon on Silicon-Germanium Substrate”, IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, pp. 2641–2642, 1992). Similar strain effect can be applied to enhance the transport of ballistic charge carriers. Thus, ballistic electron injection efficiency in silicon can be enhanced by repopulating electrons to the two-fold degenerate valley. This can be achieved through applying stress to silicon to cause strain along direction of electron transport. It is thus clear the piezo-effect can result in heavily populated “piezo” electrons (i.e. electrons in material under mechanical stress), which have a lighter mass and lower scattering rates. When combining these effects to ballistic electron injection, it provides a piezo-ballistic-electron-injection mechanism in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates the strain effect of tensile stress in semiconductor can further lift the degeneracy of valence sub-bands <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, where the LH sub-band <b>46</b> is shown shifted upward and the HH sub-band <b>48</b> is shown shifted downward. Having this effect and the effect shifting down the conduction band valley <b>44</b>, the energy band gap <b>55</b> can be narrower than the energy band gap <b>54</b> of the unstrained case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Using silicon as an example, for tensile strained silicon layer (e.g. forming a silicon layer on a Si<sub>1-x</sub>Ge<sub>x </sub>layer), the energy level of the two-fold degeneracy in silicon can be shifted down by about 0.18 eV and the LH degeneracy can be shifted up by about 0.12 eV for a Ge mole fraction x equals about 30 percent. The resulted energy band gap <b>55</b> thus is about 0.8 eV. Lifting the LH and HH degeneracy can further reduce inter-band scattering between LH and HH. Moreover, a deformation on valence sub-bands can reduce effective mass of the light-holes. As a result, the mean-free-path of ballistic light-holes can be longer in a strained semiconductor than that in an unstrained one. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows that with lifting the degeneracy of LH and HH sub-bands, holes <b>50</b> can be repopulated from the HH sub-band <b>48</b> to LH sub-band <b>46</b>. In fact, with silicon strained under the tensile stress, LH population can be increased from about 20 percent to about 90 percent of entire holes population (see Fischetti et al., Journal of Appl. Physics, vol. 94, pp. 1079–1095, 2003). Further, it is known that LH has a much lower scattering rate than that of HH (see Hinckley et al., “Hole Transport Theory in Pseudomorphic Si<sub>1-x</sub>Ge<sub>x </sub>Alloys Grown on Si(001) Substrates,” Phys. Rev. B, 41, pp. 2912–2926, 1990). These effects are considered in the injection mechanism of the present invention. The holes injection efficiency can be enhanced by injecting “piezo” holes (i.e. holes in material under mechanical stress) through repopulating holes from HH to LH sub-bands. This can be achieved through applying tensile stress to regions where holes are injected from. With the heavily populated LH and their lower scattering rate, when applying these combined effects to ballistic charge injection, it provides a method employing piezo-effect on ballistic-charge-injection. The method enhances the ballistic holes injection efficiency through injecting piezo ballistic holes (e.g. light-holes), and is provided as another embodiment of the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates dispersion relationship similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> except the semiconductor is under strain of compressive stress. Similar to the tensile stress, the compressive stress can lift the degeneracy of valence sub-bands <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, but in an opposite way as compared to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The LH sub-band <b>46</b> is shown shifted downward and the HH sub-band <b>48</b> is shown shifted upward. Nevertheless, lifting the HH and LH degeneracy can reduce inter-band scattering between LH and HH. Due to this shift on valence sub-bands, the holes are shown primarily populated in the HH valence sub-band. Further, the valence sub-bands are shown with deformed curvatures as compared to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the unstrained case. The deformed HH valence sub-band in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can reduce effective mass of the heavy-holes to a lighter one. As a result, the mean-free-path of holes in a strained semiconductor (i.e. piezo-holes) can be longer than that of an unstrained one. This effect provides another embodiment of the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0093">It is known that the effective mass of a lifted valence sub-band to first order can be shifted linearly with stress (see Hensel et al., “Cyclotron Resonance Experiments in Uniaxially Stressed Silicon: Valence Band Inverse Mass Parameters and Deformation Potentials, Phys. Rev. 129, pp. 1141–1062, 1963, and see Hinckley et al., “Hole Transport Theory in Pseudomorphic Si<sub>1-x</sub>Ge<sub>x </sub>Alloys Grown on Si(001) Substrates,” Phys. Rev. B, 41, pp. 2912–2926, 1990). Employing this relationship in together with the relationship between effective mass and mean-free-path, the present invention provides a method to alter the mean-free-path of piezo-ballistic-charges. This method represents another embodiment of the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism, and is illustrated by adjusting the level of the stress along direction parallel to the direction of charge transport. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of the effect of stress on mean-free-path. The compressive stress on strained silicon is used as an example to illustrate the effect on HH. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the vertical axis represents a normalized mean-free-path, which is the ratio of the mean-free-path in strained silicon to that in unstrained silicon. As can be seen in the plot, the normalized mean-free-path increases linearly with increasing stress. Further, the enhancement effect on mean-free-path is more significant for stress axis parallel to [111] than to [001] of the crystallographic direction in silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the efficiency enhancement versus the compressive stress for the piezo-ballistic hole injection. The efficiency enhancement is the ratio of the efficiency of strained silicon to the efficiency of unstrained silicon. As can be seen in the plot, the enhancement increases super-linearly for stress in a moderate mechanical stress (e.g. in the range of about 200 mega Pascal (“MPa”) or lower), and becomes approximately linearly proportional to the stress in a higher range (e.g. in the range of about 400 MPa or higher). Further, the enhancement effect is much more significant for stress axis parallel to [111] than to [001]. About twenty times and about fifty times higher on the efficiency are illustrated achievable for stress axis along [001] and [111] directions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the sensitivity of the efficiency enhancement on the mean-free-path of unstrained silicon (“mfp*” hereinafter). It should be noted that the difference on the mfp* can be due to, for example, different levels of impurity concentration in semiconductor. The stress in parallel with crystallographic direction [001] is chosen in this illustration. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it is noted that the efficiency enhancement can be more significantly increased in a case having a shorter mfp* (e.g. 4 nm) than in a case having a longer mfp* (e.g. 10 nm) when stresses of both cases are held at a same level. For example, the efficiency enhancement can be 1000 times higher when a stress of 1000 MPa is applied to a silicon having mfp* of 4 nm, whereas the same stress can only achieve 10 times enhancement on efficiency in a silicon having mfp* of 10 nm. The effect demonstrated here is advantageous for scaled memory cell in advanced technologies, where a shorter mfp* is anticipated due to heavier impurity concentration in silicon. This is because a heavier impurity concentration in silicon can assist cell scaling into smaller geometry (for example, it can avoid unduly increase on resistance of regions where ballistic-charges traverse when scaling a memory cell).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096">It should also now be clear that ballistic hole injection with heavy-hole can exist and can reduce the erase efficiency when employing ballistic hole mechanism of prior art for erase operation of memory cells. It should also be clear that the transport mechanism of ballistic carriers (LH, HH, or electrons) can be altered by employing the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism. It should also be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the teachings of this disclosure can be applied to select different type of stress (e.g. tensile or compressive stress) and to change the axis of the stress through which the holes population and their mean-free-path are altered such that the injection efficiency in these cases can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097">Although the forgoing discussion has focused on injection of piezo-holes, it will be clear to those ordinary skills in the art that similar considerations, their effects and advantages apply to piezo-ballistic-electrons-injection. Further, although the forgoing discussion has focused on semiconductor (e.g. silicon), it will be clear to those ordinary skills in the art that similar considerations, their effects and advantages apply to other type of conductors (e.g. TiN, TaN, Si<sub>1-x</sub>Ge<sub>x </sub>alloys etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> provides an energy band diagram to illustrate the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism for injecting piezo-ballistic-holes. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there is shown a strained tunneling-gate (“STG”) <b>60</b> of a conductive material, a charge injection filter <b>62</b> having a tunneling dielectric (“TD”) <b>63</b> and a blocking dielectric (“BD”) <b>64</b>, a strained ballistic gate (“SBG”) <b>66</b> of a conductive material, a retention dielectric (“RD”) <b>70</b>, and a charge receiving or storage region (“CSR”) <b>68</b> of a conductive material. The energy band diagram is illustrated for STG <b>60</b> of a heavily doped p-type polycrystalline silicon (“p+ polysilicon”) and SBG <b>66</b> of a heavily doped n-type polycrystalline silicon (“n+ polysilicon”). Also shown are conduction bands <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>63</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>a</i>, and <b>68</b><i>a </i>of STG <b>60</b>, TD <b>63</b>, BD <b>64</b>, SBG <b>66</b>, RD <b>70</b>, and CSR <b>68</b>, respectively. Likewise, there are shown valence bands <b>60</b><i>b</i>, <b>63</b><i>b</i>, <b>64</b><i>b</i>, <b>66</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, and <b>68</b><i>b </i>of STG <b>60</b>, TD <b>63</b>, BD <b>64</b>, SBG <b>66</b>, RD <b>70</b>, and CSR <b>68</b>, respectively. The spacing between the conduction band and valence band of each region represents an energy gap of that region. In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the injection filter <b>62</b>, the energy band gap of TD <b>63</b> is shown wider than that of the BD <b>64</b>. Further, there are shown a conduction band barrier height <b>76</b> of band offset between conduction bands of <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>a</i>, and a valence band barrier height <b>77</b> of band offset between valence bands of <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>66</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the STG <b>60</b> is strained to have the majority population of holes be comprised of the LH <b>72</b>. This can be done by, for example, applying a tensile stress to the STG <b>60</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is the HH <b>73</b>, which can coexist with the LH <b>72</b> in STG <b>60</b> but at a much lower population (e.g. at about 5 to about 20 percent of the total hole population).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100">The STG <b>60</b> can be biased positively with respect to the SBG <b>66</b> to inject piezo-ballistic holes. The bias permits both types of holes <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> in STG <b>60</b> region to tunnel through a tunneling barrier having a valence band barrier height <b>75</b> between valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>of STG <b>60</b> and valence band <b>63</b><i>b </i>of TD <b>63</b>. While traversing SBG <b>66</b>, the HH <b>73</b> can experience strong scattering and hence lose its energy to become HH <b>73</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, HH <b>73</b> cannot be injected into CSR <b>68</b>. The LH <b>72</b>, however, behaves very differently from the HH <b>73</b>. Due to its longer mean-free-path, the LH <b>72</b> can traverse the SBG <b>66</b> with much less scattering than the HH <b>73</b>. Therefore, LH can preserve their energy at level higher than the valence band <b>66</b><i>b </i>of SBG <b>66</b> while traversing SBG <b>66</b>. Some of these holes are able to reach the interface between SBG <b>66</b> and RD <b>70</b>. When this positive bias is increased to a value such that those LH have energy higher than the barrier height <b>77</b>, the LH <b>72</b> will be able to enter the valence band <b>70</b><i>b </i>of RD <b>70</b>, making their way through RD <b>70</b> and be collected on CSR <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101">It is noted that while STG <b>60</b> is strained under the mechanism described herein, the SBG region <b>66</b> can also be strained under a condition in accordance with another embodiment of the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism such that the mean-free-path of holes traversing the SBG region <b>66</b> can be longer than mfp* of that region. For example, this can be done by applying a compressive stress to SBG <b>66</b> to take advantage on the effect shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102">The charge injection filter <b>62</b> is disposed in between the STG <b>60</b> and the SBG <b>66</b> to permit transporting charge carriers of one polarity type (e.g. LH <b>72</b>) from the STG <b>60</b> through the SBG <b>66</b> to the CSR <b>68</b> and to block transporting charge carriers of an opposite polarity type (e.g. electrons <b>74</b>) from the SBG <b>66</b> to the STG <b>60</b>. For the piezo-ballistic-hole-injection shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, LH <b>72</b> and HH <b>73</b> are shown transporting in a forward direction, whereas under the same bias polarity, electrons <b>74</b> in SBG <b>66</b> are shown transporting in a backward direction. The energy band structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the backward-injected carriers (i.e. electrons <b>74</b>) has to transport through more barriers than the forward-injected carriers (i.e. LH <b>72</b> and HH <b>73</b>) do. A first electron barrier <b>78</b> blocking the backward injected electrons <b>74</b> comprises barrier heights <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> at an entrance side and at an exit side, respectively. Both barrier heights <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> are referenced to conduction band <b>64</b><i>a </i>of BD <b>64</b>. A second electron barrier <b>81</b> having a barrier height <b>82</b> at its entrance side forms another barrier blocking electrons <b>74</b>. The barrier height <b>82</b> is referenced to conduction band <b>63</b><i>a </i>of TD <b>63</b> at the interface between TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0103">The charge injection filter provided herein is based on a barrier height engineering concept. One specific embodiment illustrated in the present invention comprises a p+ polysilicon for the STG <b>60</b>, a silicon dioxide (“oxide”) layer for the TD <b>63</b>, a silicon nitride (“nitride”) layer for the BD <b>64</b>, and an n+ polysilicon for the SBG <b>66</b>. The n+ polysilicon is considered for SBG <b>66</b> due to several considerations. A major consideration lies in the much higher solid solubility for n-type impurities (e.g. Arsenic, phosphorous etc) than that for p-type impurities (e.g. Boron). Impurity with a higher solid solubility is desirable as it usually can dope the silicon heavier to result in a lower sheet resistance, and is favorable for integrated circuits (IC) application. In the embodiment, polysilicon is employed as the material for STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> due to its well proven yieldability, manufacturability, and compatibility with state of the art IC technology. An oxide with a thickness of about 7 nm to 10 nm is employed for the RD <b>70</b> due to the same reason. The oxide layer used for TD <b>63</b> can be with a thickness in the range of about 1.5 nm to 4 nm and preferably in the range of about 2 nm to 3.5 nm. The thickness of TD <b>63</b> layer is chosen in the range where charge-carriers (electrons, LH or HH)) transporting across the layer are primarily through the direct tunneling mechanism. The thickness of BD <b>64</b> is chosen to block charge-carriers from tunneling through both BD <b>64</b> and TD <b>63</b> layers when a modest voltage in the range of about 1 V to about 2.5V is applied between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>. The thickness of BD <b>64</b> is further chosen to permit one type of charge carriers (e.g. LH) transporting in the forward direction and to block the other type of charge carriers (e.g. electrons) from transporting in the backward direction when in a higher voltage range (3V or higher). As will be described in the barrier height engineering theory hereinafter, the selection on thickness of BD <b>64</b> is also determined by it dielectric constant. In general, the thickness of BD <b>64</b> can be thinner or thicker than that of TD <b>63</b> provided the tunneling stack of TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b> can effectively meet the forgoing requirements. For example, in the specific embodiment, if an oxide with 3 nm (or 30 Å) is chosen for TD <b>63</b>, then the minimum thickness for BD <b>64</b> can be about 2 nm (or 20 Å) or thicker. For the specific embodiment, the oxide for TD <b>63</b> can be a HTO (high temperature oxide) or a TEOS layer formed by using conventional deposition technique, or a thermal oxide by using thermal oxidation technique well-known in the art. The nitride for BD <b>64</b> can be a high quality nitride without charge trapping centers in its band gap. This high quality nitride can be formed in NH<sub>3 </sub>(ammonia) ambient at a high temperature (e.g. 1050° C.) by using, for example, RTN (Rapid Thermal Nitridation) technique well-known in the art.</p>

In addition to those regions and their reference indicators shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> there is shown a barrier height <b>83</b> of conduction band offset between <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>a</i>. The barrier height <b>83</b> is at the exit side of the second electron barrier <b>81</b> for blocking the backward injected electrons <b>74</b>. Moreover, there is shown a barrier height <b>84</b> of valence band offset between <b>63</b><i>b </i>and <b>60</b><i>b</i>. The barrier heights <b>75</b> and <b>84</b> are at the entrance and the exit sides, respectively, of a first hole barrier <b>85</b> for blocking the forward injected holes <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>. Further shown are a barrier height <b>86</b> of valence band offset between <b>64</b><i>b </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>at the entrance side of a second hole barrier <b>87</b>, and a barrier height <b>88</b> of valence band offset between <b>64</b><i>b </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>at the exit side of the second hole barrier <b>87</b>. The second hole barrier <b>87</b> also has the effect on blocking the forward injected holes <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>. The STG <b>60</b> is strained to have the hole population in that region be primarily of the LH <b>72</b>. Therefore, the LH <b>72</b> is anticipated having a heavier injection flow. An arrow <b>72</b><i>a </i>of a wider line width is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to illustrate the heavier flow for LH carrier as a result of this effect.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0105">It is now clear that with the energy band structure in accordance with the present invention, there are two hole barriers <b>85</b> and <b>87</b> relevant to the forward injected piezo-ballistic-charges of LH <b>72</b> and HH <b>73</b>. Similarly, there are two electron barriers <b>78</b> and <b>81</b> relevant to the backward injected electrons <b>74</b> in SBG <b>66</b>. To permit an efficient piezo-ballistic-charge-injection, it is desirable that the barriers heights of the first and the second hole barriers <b>85</b> and <b>87</b> can be electrically altered to assist the forward injection of piezo-ballistic-charges. In a contrast, to block the electrons <b>74</b> in SBG <b>66</b> from backward injection into STG <b>60</b>, it is desired to keep the barrier heights <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> of the first electron barrier <b>78</b>, and the barrier heights <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> of the second electron barrier <b>81</b> high enough through out the voltage range for the piezo-ballistic charge injection.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0112">Based on the theory, a concept on engineering barrier height for selectively filtering charge carriers is provided herein. From the formula (1) and (2) provided herein, it is clear that barrier height <b>86</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub>—</sub><sub>TB</sub>) and barrier height <b>82</b> (ΔΦ<sub>CE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>) have different dependence on V<sub>a</sub>. The voltage dependence permits the two barrier heights <b>86</b> and <b>82</b> be electrically altered by applying a voltage across the dielectrics. Furthermore, the barrier height dependence on voltage is asymmetrical and is primarily determined by the combined effects of dielectric constant and dielectric thickness (i.e. the “εT effect”). In other words, by proper selecting a set of “εT” for TD <b>63</b> and for BD <b>64</b>, one barrier height can be electrically altered in a different degree than the other. In an extreme case, at an applied bias, one barrier height can be altered to become disappear while the other one stays in similar range as one in the flat-band condition.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0113">This effect is provided in the present invention and is used for charge injection, charge blocking, and charge filtering. The effect can become clearer with referencing to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an example on the barrier height engineering concept using the theory described herein. As is apparent, the barrier height <b>86</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>) for holes <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> in STG <b>60</b> decreases at a faster rate than the barrier height <b>82</b> (ΔΦ<sub>CE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>) for electrons <b>74</b> in SBG <b>66</b>. In fact, the barrier height <b>86</b> disappears (i.e. equals zero) at an applied voltage of about +3.5 V between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> while there is still a barrier height of about 2.5 eV remained for the barrier height <b>82</b> (ΔΦ<sub>CE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>). Thus, when the applied voltage is altered beyond this point, both LH <b>72</b> and HH <b>73</b> can tunnel through TD <b>63</b> without being blocked by BD <b>64</b> layer (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). This effect permits LH and HH (<b>72</b> and <b>73</b>) be injected along the forward direction. Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the much weaker dependence of the barrier height <b>82</b> (ΔΦ<sub>CE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>) on the applied voltage maintains the barrier for blocking electrons <b>74</b> in this voltage range and hence prevents electrons <b>74</b> from backward injected into STG <b>60</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The barrier height engineering concept here provides a method through which an electrically alterable filter can be constructed to filter out the unwanted carriers (e.g. the backward injected electrons <b>74</b>) without affecting the transport of the wanted carriers (e.g. the forward injected piezo-ballistic-holes <b>72</b> and/or <b>73</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0114">It is desirable to maintain a trapezoidal-shaped band structure for the first electron barrier <b>78</b> in BD <b>64</b> within voltage range used for injecting piezo-ballistic-holes. This can be achieved by keeping the voltage across BD <b>64</b> (V′<sub>BD</sub>) less than the barrier height <b>79</b> (ΔΦ<sub>CE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GB</sub>) of the first electron barrier <b>78</b>. This barrier structure can be clearer captured by referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, wherein barrier heights <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> form a trapezoidal shape of structure in barrier <b>78</b> with barrier heights <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> at its entrance side and at its exit side, respectively. A trapezoidal barrier is advantageous because it provides a stronger effect on blocking electrons <b>74</b> from backward tunneling than that can be provided by a triangular shaped barrier. The barrier height <b>79</b> of the trapezoidal barrier equals the conduction band offset between SBG <b>66</b> and BD <b>64</b>. The barrier height <b>80</b> of the trapezoidal barrier to first order equals ΔΦ<sub>CB</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GB</sub>−V′<sub>BD</sub>, where ΔΦ<sub>CB</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GB </sub>is the conduction band offset between SBG <b>66</b> and BD <b>64</b>. In the specific embodiment, for the applied voltage in the range of about +5 V to about +6V, the barrier height <b>80</b> is about 1.1 eV to about 0.9 eV. Thus, the trapezoidal barrier is maintained through out the injection process of piezo-ballistic-holes. It is clear that the barrier height <b>80</b> can be made higher by lowering V′<sub>BD </sub>through optimizing dielectric constant and thickness of TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b>, as taught in the “εT effect” and the foregoing theory.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0115">The energy band in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is illustrated with piezo-ballistic-holes <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> injected through TD <b>63</b>, through BD <b>64</b>, and into SBG <b>66</b> region. The energy band is illustrated to reflect the barrier engineering concept with emphasis on the barriers that are used to block parasitic electrons <b>74</b> from backward injection. Due to the larger dielectric constant illustrated for BD <b>64</b> region, a smaller band bending and hence a smaller voltage across BD <b>64</b> is illustrated. The voltage across TD <b>63</b> is illustrated larger than that across BD <b>64</b> due to its smaller dielectric constant. A larger dielectric constant for BD <b>64</b> region is desirable for following considerations. First, it permits the energy band of BD <b>64</b> region be more like the original “rectangular shape” structure in the flat-band condition. This provides a more effective first electron barrier <b>78</b> in BD <b>64</b> for blocking unwanted charge carriers (e.g. the parasitic electrons <b>74</b>) from backward injection. Furthermore, the larger dielectric constant of BD <b>64</b> permits a larger portion of the applied voltage appearing across TD <b>63</b> region. It thus preserves the effects on tunneling the wanted charges (e.g. LH <b>72</b>) while the applied voltage is maintained at the same level. Some of these holes will be able to traverse the SBG <b>66</b> region through piezo-ballistic-charges-injection mechanism to reach the interface between SBG <b>66</b> and RD <b>70</b>, and subsequently be collected on CSR <b>68</b> region.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0116">For the specific embodiment, voltage of STG <b>60</b> is chosen in the range of about +5.0 V to about +6.0 V relative to voltage of SBG <b>66</b> for the piezo-ballistic-holes-injection.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0118">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there is shown an energy band diagram with piezo-electrons <b>89</b> in the valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>of STG <b>60</b>, and with LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> in the valence band <b>66</b><i>b </i>of SBG <b>66</b>. The diagram is similar to the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> except STG <b>60</b> is negatively biased with respect to the SBG <b>66</b> by about 1 V to about 2 V. The potential of CSR <b>68</b> is shown positive with respect to the SBG <b>66</b> potential by about 0.75 V. Under this bias polarity between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>, electrons <b>89</b> are shown transporting in a forward direction, whereas under the same bias polarity, LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> SBG <b>66</b> are shown transporting in a backward direction. The energy band diagram is illustrated for a p+ polysilicon STG <b>60</b> and an n+ polysilicon SBG <b>66</b>. The LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> are unlikely to exist in an n+ SBG <b>66</b> in this bias condition. However, in a worse case situation, they can exist in SBG <b>66</b> in the bias range (e.g. 4 V) used for piezo-electron injection, where an inversion layer of holes can be formed. Here, LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> are shown for illustrating the barriers associated with it to consider this effect. It is worth noting that in prior art the n+ polysilicon cannot be employed for the ballistic gate <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> due to its lower work function than that of a p+ polysilicon. The n+ polysilicon is considered for SBG <b>66</b> due to several considerations. A major consideration lies in the much higher solid solubility for n-type impurities (e.g. Arsenic, phosphorous etc) than that for p-type impurities (e.g. Boron). Impurity with a higher solid solubility is desirable as it usually can dope the silicon heavier to result in a lower sheet resistance, and is favorable for integrated circuits (IC) application.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0119">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there are two barriers relevant to the tunneling injection of piezo-electrons <b>89</b> from valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>of STG <b>60</b>.

The barrier height <b>91</b> equals the offset between valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>and conduction band <b>63</b><i>a </i>at the entrance side of the barrier <b>90</b>. The barrier height <b>92</b> equals the offset between valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>and conduction band <b>63</b><i>a </i>at the exit side of the barrier <b>90</b>. The second one is illustrated as a barrier <b>93</b> having barrier heights <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>. The barrier height <b>94</b> equals the offset between valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>and conduction band <b>64</b><i>a </i>at the entrance side of the barrier <b>93</b>. The barrier height <b>95</b> equals the offset between valence band <b>60</b><i>b </i>and conduction band <b>64</b><i>a </i>at the exit side of the barrier <b>93</b>. Similarly, there are two barriers relevant to the backward injected LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> in valence band <b>66</b><i>b </i>of SBG <b>66</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the first one is illustrated as a barrier <b>98</b> having barrier heights <b>98</b><i>a </i>and <b>98</b><i>b</i>. The barrier heights <b>98</b><i>a </i>and <b>98</b><i>b </i>equal the offset between valence band <b>66</b><i>b </i>and valence band <b>64</b><i>b </i>at the entrance side and the exit side of the barrier <b>98</b>, respectively. The second barrier is illustrated as a barrier <b>99</b> having barrier heights <b>99</b><i>a </i>and <b>99</b><i>b</i>. The barrier heights <b>99</b><i>a </i>and <b>99</b><i>b </i>equal the offset between valence band <b>66</b><i>b </i>and valence band <b>63</b><i>b </i>at the entrance side and the exit side of the barrier <b>99</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0120">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the backward injected LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> can result in undesired problems. For example, it can trigger impact-ionization in STG <b>60</b> when they got backward injected into that region due to their higher energy than the valence band <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Further, these holes do not contribute to memory operation when employing the piezo-ballistic-electron-injection for a program operation of a memory cell. Therefore, it can waste electrical current and hence power. It is thus desirable to block LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> from backward injection into STG <b>60</b>. The holes backward injection problem can be overcome in accordance with an aspect of the present invention by keeping the barrier heights of barriers <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> high enough through out the bias range in piezo-ballistic-electron injection.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0127">From the foregoing formula (3) and (4), it is clear that barrier height <b>94</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>) and barrier height <b>99</b><i>a </i>(ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>) have different dependence on V<sub>a</sub>. The barrier height dependence on voltage is asymmetrical and is primarily determined by the combined effects of dielectric constant and dielectric thickness (i.e. the “εT effect”). This effect is similar to that provided by barrier heights <b>86</b> and <b>82</b> in the barrier height engineering for piezo-ballistic-hole-injection. It is therefore clear that the barriers for piezo-ballistic-electron-injection can be electrically altered in a similar way as that provided for piezo-ballistic-hole-injection.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an example on the barrier height engineering concept using the theory described herein for piezo-ballistic-electron-injection. As is apparent, when decreasing the applied voltage between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>, the barrier height <b>94</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>) for electrons at STG <b>60</b> decreases faster than the barrier height <b>99</b><i>a </i>(ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>) for LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b> in SBG <b>66</b>. The barrier height <b>94</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>) in fact disappears (i.e. equals zero) at an applied voltage of about −3.5V while there is still a sufficient barrier height of about 3.4 eV remained for the barrier height <b>99</b><i>a </i>(ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the energy band diagram when the applied voltage is decreased beyond this voltage level. As shown, the second barrier <b>93</b> for piezo-electrons <b>89</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> disappears in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> as the applied voltage is decreased beyond this level. Therefore, piezo-electrons <b>89</b> in STG <b>60</b> can tunnel through TD <b>63</b> in direct tunneling without being blocked by BD <b>64</b> layer. This permit the piezo-electrons be injected in the forward direction. The much weaker dependence of barrier height <b>99</b><i>a </i>(ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GT</sub>) on the applied voltage maintains the barrier <b>99</b> for blocking holes in this voltage range and hence can prevent holes from backward injection. Therefore, the barriers engineering concept here actually provides a method through which an electrically alterable filter is constructed for piezo-ballistic-electron-injection. The filter provides unique feature filtering out the unwanted carriers (i.e. the backward injected LH <b>96</b> and HH <b>97</b>) without affecting the transport of the wanted carriers (i.e. the forward injected electrons <b>89</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> further illustrates the piezo-ballistic-electron-injection mechanism. Proper mechanical stress is provided in STG <b>60</b> and/or SBG <b>66</b> to create strain therein and hence to generate piezo-effect on electrons <b>89</b> on their populations and their transport properties. With a sufficient voltage (e.g. about −4 V) across gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b>, the piezo-electrons <b>89</b> can traverse SBG <b>66</b>, transport through RD <b>70</b>, and finally get collected on CSR <b>68</b>. For the specific embodiment, voltage of STG <b>60</b> is chosen in the range of about −3.5 V to about −4.0 V relative to voltage of SBG <b>66</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows the injection efficiency plotted versus the thickness of the active layer (SBG <b>66</b>) for ballistic transport comparing results from the present invention and from prior art. As illustrated, by using the piezo-ballistic-electron-injection mechanism, the electrons <b>89</b> can be injected onto CSR <b>68</b> at much higher efficiency than that achievable by injecting normal electrons of unstrained silicon. This is due to the lower scattering rate and longer mean-free-path of the piezo-electrons, as described earlier (see, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and its description). This effect provides means in accordance with one aspect of the present invention to fix the problems on large resistance in prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows the dependence of sheet resistance of SBG <b>66</b> on mean-free-path when the injection efficiency is maintained at a fixed value of 1 percent. By employing the piezo-ballistic-electron-injection mechanism, the sheet resistance can be reduced, for example, from 250 Ohms/square for unstrained silicon to about 220 Ohms/square for strained silicon having similar mean-free-path. Employing the mechanism, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> also shows that further reduction on sheet resistance can be achieved by increasing the mean-free-path from 10 nm to about 28 nm without compromising injection efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the effect of voltages across each dielectric and their dependence on the applied voltage between gates STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>. The materials in the specific embodiment here are assumed for TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b>. As is apparent, V<sub>TD </sub>is much larger than V<sub>BD </sub>for a same applied voltage between gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b>. In other words, a much larger voltage is seen across the material having a lower εT effect. Note that εT effect can be dominated by the dielectric constant provided the thicknesses of both dielectrics are in similar range. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> further shows that the injection filter provides a voltage divider function, where the applied voltage is divided and shared by TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b> regions. The effect here can prevent the problem on dielectric breakdown and hence provides advantages over the prior art. For example, for an applied voltage of about −4V, the total voltage across the prior art dielectric <b>28</b> can be about −4.9V, which can be close to the onset of dielectric breakdown. In a contrast, due to the effect on the band structure of the present invention, this applied voltage results in about −3.7V across TD <b>63</b> and about −1.2V across BD <b>64</b>. Thus, the voltage divider function of the filter provides more margins for preventing the dielectric breakdown problem. Although this discussion has focused on injection of piezo-electrons, it will be clear to those ordinary skills in the art that similar considerations, their effects and advantages apply to piezo-ballistic-holes-injection.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0131">It is desirable to keep the voltage across BD (V<sub>BD</sub>) be less than the barrier height <b>98</b><i>a </i>in voltage range normally used for piezo-ballistic-electrons injection. Keeping V<sub>BD </sub>lower than barrier height <b>98</b><i>a </i>is desirable because it can maintain a trapezoidal-shaped band structure for holes barrier <b>98</b> in BD <b>64</b> to block the backward injected LH and HH more effectively. This barrier structure can become clear by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, wherein barrier height <b>98</b><i>a </i>forms one side of the barrier <b>98</b> (the entrance side for holes <b>96</b> and <b>97</b>) and barrier height <b>98</b><i>b </i>forms the other side of the barrier (the exit side for holes <b>96</b> and <b>97</b>). The barrier height <b>98</b><i>b </i>at the exit side of the trapezoidal barrier <b>98</b> to first order equals ΔΦ<sub>VB</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GB</sub>−V<sub>BD</sub>, where ΔΦ<sub>VB</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>GB </sub>is the barrier height <b>98</b><i>a</i>. In the specific embodiment, for an applied voltage of −4V between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>, the barrier height <b>98</b><i>b </i>is about 0.7 eV, and hence the trapezoidal structure for barrier <b>98</b> is maintained. It is clear that barrier height <b>98</b><i>b </i>can be made higher by lowering V<sub>BD </sub>through optimizing dielectric constant and thickness of TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b>, as taught in the foregoing theory.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0132">One of the unique portions of the present invention lies in the effects provided by the barrier height engineering concept and its implementation in the injection filter. The effects remove requirement on a large work function for the SBG <b>66</b> material in prior art. Furthermore, the injection filter provides voltage divider function, permitting voltage applied between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> be divided and shared by BD <b>64</b> and TD <b>63</b> without compromising piezo-ballistic-charge-injection. The voltage divider function can resolve the dielectric breakdown problem in prior art. Moreover, impact-ionization problem in STG <b>60</b>, which can be triggered by the backward injected charge carriers, can be effectively resolved while suppressing these carriers from backward injection by employing the injection filter.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0133">It is thus clear the injection filter and the energy band structure illustrated in the present invention can effectively block charge carriers of one polarity type from transporting along a backward direction while passing charge carriers of an opposite polarity type transporting along a forward direction during the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection. Thus, the charge injection filter <b>62</b> provides charge filtering mechanism to “purify” the charge flow. Though not required, it is generally desirable that the material for SBG <b>66</b> has a Fermi level in the flat band condition lies in about the middle of the energy band gap of BD <b>64</b> of charge filter <b>62</b> to best utilize the charge filtering mechanism when the band structure and the injection mechanism are employed in constructing memory cells.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0134">As employing the ballistic charge injection mechanism and energy band structure of the prior art in memory cell <b>100</b> placed in an array environment, cell state (e.g. a “0”) can be unintentionally changed to the other state (e.g. a “1”) during the useful lifetime of usage due to cumulative disturbance introduced while conducting cell operations (e.g. program, erase, and read) throughout other cells that are within a same memory array. As will be described herein, the prior art cell is prone to these types of disturb problems. These disturb problems can however be solved with the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism and energy band structure of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Program Disturb</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0135">Program disturb can happen in an unselected memory cell in a memory array while programming a selected cell using the piezo-ballistic-electrons-injection mechanism. The worse case for program disturb corresponds to the situation when CSR <b>68</b> of an unselected cell is positively charged (e.g. in the erased state). Turning now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, disturb is caused by inadvertently inject charges onto CSR <b>68</b>, and hence is to do with the forward injected charge carriers (e.g. electrons <b>89</b>). It is thus clear that an effective blocking on forward injected electrons can prevent a disturb event. The charge blocking mechanism of the present invention relies on two barriers provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.

<br/>
where V<sub>TD </sub>is the potential across TD <b>63</b> when a voltage of program disturb is applied between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>. By keeping a positive value for ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TTB</sub>, these two barrier heights can keep the barrier <b>90</b> be a trapezoidal shape barrier in TD <b>63</b>.

<p id="p-0121" num="0136">Similarly, a second barrier is the barrier <b>93</b> having barrier heights <b>94</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>) and <b>95</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) at entrance side and exit side, respectively, for the incoming electrons <b>89</b>.

<p id="p-0123" num="0138">With the barrier height engineering concept, the energy band structure constructed in the present invention provides a more effective structure preventing the program disturb than that in the prior art. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the trapezoidal barrier <b>93</b> formed by BD <b>64</b> provides an additional blocking barrier to the incoming electrons <b>89</b>. The barrier heights <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> of this barrier can be optimized by a proper selection on the dielectric constant and thickness for TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b>, as taught in the theory for barrier height engineering, such that they can be electrically altered in different degree than the barrier heights <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> of TD <b>63</b>. In general, it is desired to keep the two barrier heights <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> of the trapezoidal barrier high enough to block the electrons <b>89</b>. For disturb prevention, a program-disturb voltage V<sub>pd </sub>between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> is chosen such that the energy level of electrons <b>89</b> in STG <b>60</b> is under the barrier heights <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>. It should be noted that the trapezoidal barrier in BD <b>64</b> can be preserved by keeping a positive value for the barrier height <b>95</b> (i.e. the one at the exit side).

A better way to capture the method provided here for disturb prevention is by referring to the expression for the barrier height <b>95</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) described in formula (6), which can be further expressed as

<br/>
As is clear mathematically in this formula, keeping the magnitude of V<sub>pd </sub>lower than a summation of ΔΦ<sub>CB</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>, Eg, and −V<sub>fb</sub>, can keep the barrier height <b>95</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) having a positive height, thus can preserve the trapezoidal barrier shape for barrier <b>93</b>.

<p id="p-0124" num="0139">As described hereinbefore, the barrier height engineering permits a portion of V<sub>pd </sub>be dropped across BD <b>64</b> region.

In the situation where electrons <b>40</b> do get formed in STG <b>60</b>, program disturb of electrons <b>40</b> can be suppressed by keeping the two barrier heights, <b>94</b> and <b>95</b>, of the trapezoidal barrier high enough such that electrons <b>40</b> can be blocked from tunneling through TD <b>63</b> and BD <b>64</b>. This can be done through optimizing the barrier structure, as taught in the barrier height engineering theory.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0140">Erase disturb can happen in an unselected memory cell in a memory array while erasing a selected cell using the piezo-ballistic-holes-injection mechanism.

where V′<sub>TD </sub>is the potential across TD <b>63</b> during the erase disturb. Thus, by keeping a positive value for ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TTB</sub>, these two barrier heights can maintain a trapezoidal shape barrier for the barrier <b>85</b> in TD <b>63</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0141">Similarly, a second barrier is the barrier <b>87</b> having barrier heights <b>86</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>) and <b>88</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) at entrance side and exit side, respectively, facing the incoming LH <b>72</b> and HH <b>73</b>.

In general, it is desired to keep the two barrier heights, <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>, of the trapezoidal barrier <b>87</b> high enough in unselected cells for disturb prevention, and to keep such two barriers low enough in selected cells for erase operation.

<p id="p-0131" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates the effect of the barrier height engineering on tunneling currents when STG <b>60</b> is positively biased relative to SBG <b>66</b>. For comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> further shows various components on tunneling currents for energy band structure in prior art when gate <b>10</b> is positively biased relative to gate <b>12</b>. The tunneling currents of prior art comprise the hole current in the modest bias range (0 to 3 V) and the parasitic CE current in the higher bias range (3V and higher). As described hereinbefore (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), the CE current is from the electrons <b>37</b> of inversion layer formed in gate <b>12</b>, which is formed of p+ polysilicon. The CE current and its formation mechanism were overlooked in the prior art. This problem constitutes a major issue on functionality of memory cell in the prior art. In a clear contrast, the total tunneling current of the present invention is found comprising the hole current only. There is no parasitic current observed within the entire bias range. The parasitic CE issue is prevented in the energy band structure of the present invention because a portion of the applied voltage is now absorbed by BD <b>64</b>. Furthermore, the hole current of the present invention show a much stronger voltage dependence than that in the prior art. As illustrated, the hole current is found at similar level as that in prior art at the erase voltage of about 5V, and is found negligible at a disturb prevention voltage of about 2 V. As is shown at an applied voltage of 2V, the hole current density of the present invention is about 10<sup>4 </sup>times lower than that of prior art. In other words, with the barrier height engineering and the energy band structure provided in the present invention, a memory cell thus constructed can have an erase disturb strength about 10<sup>4 </sup>times stronger than that of memory cells constructed in prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> shows the total capacitance seen by SBG <b>66</b> and its dependence on the thickness of BD (TBD), and is used to illustrate the advantage on suppressing parasitic capacitance provided in the present invention. The parasitic capacitance between gates <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> of prior art is shown to be about 1.2×10<sup>−6 </sup>Farad/cm<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to the thickness of dielectric <b>28</b> around 3 nm required for tunneling injection in prior art. In the present invention, such capacitance can be significantly reduced to the range of about 9×10<sup>−7 </sup>Farad/cm<sup>2 </sup>for structure with TD <b>63</b> of oxide having same thickness as dielectric <b>28</b> in the prior art cell and BD <b>64</b> of nitride having a thickness of 2 nm. The capacitance can be further reduced to the range of about 7×10<sup>−7 </sup>and 5.8×10<sup>−7 </sup>Farad/cm<sup>2 </sup>as thickening BD to 4 nm and 6 nm, respectively. It should be noted that thickening BD does not have adverse impacts on disturb prevention for program and for erase. This can be better understood by referring to the expressions for the barrier height <b>88</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) for erase and for the barrier height <b>95</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VE</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) for program. For the case of erase, as is apparent in the expression for ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>(=ΔΦ<sub>VB</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>−(V<sub>ed</sub>−V<sub>fb</sub>)), the barrier height <b>88</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) is independent of the thickness of BD <b>64</b>, and hence thickening BD <b>64</b> will not change the barrier height <b>88</b>. As described hereinbefore, keeping a positive barrier height <b>88</b> can preserve the valence band barrier <b>87</b> of BD <b>64</b> in a trapezoidal shape, which is important for blocking tunneling charge carriers. The effect here is advantageous as it permits the optimization on the barrier height <b>88</b> for disturb prevention and the optimization on BD <b>64</b> thickness for parasitic capacitance suppression be made separately. Therefore, there is no compromise in the optimization process. In fact, thickening BD <b>64</b> can permit the trapezoidal barrier be a more effective tunneling barrier to charge carriers on either side of the barrier due to a thicker tunneling distance for these carriers. Furthermore, a thicker BD <b>64</b> permits a larger voltage drop across BD <b>64</b>, and hence a smaller voltage drop across TD <b>63</b>. The effect of the thickness of BD <b>64</b> on barrier heights and on voltage drop across the dielectrics is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>. The illustration is made for the specific embodiment, where nitride and oxide are employed as the material for BD <b>64</b> and TD <b>63</b>, respectively. As is apparent, the barrier height <b>88</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TBG</sub>) is found independent of BD thickness (T<sub>BD</sub>), and is maintained at a value of about 0.8 eV when V<sub>ed </sub>is set at 2V for disturb prevention. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, thickening BD <b>64</b> results in a higher barrier height <b>86</b> (ΔΦ<sub>VH</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>TB</sub>). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a higher barrier height <b>86</b> is favorable for blocking LH <b>72</b> and HH <b>73</b> from forward tunneling, and hence is desirable for disturb prevention</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0148">Although the forgoing discussions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> have focused on the erase disturb, it will be clear to those ordinary skills in the art that similar considerations, their effects and advantages apply to the program disturb.</p>

The cell <b>200</b> comprises a source <b>56</b>, a drain <b>57</b> with a channel <b>58</b> therebetween, a body <b>59</b> in a substrate <b>1</b> of a semiconductor having a first conductivity type (e.g. p-type), a strained tunneling gate (STG <b>60</b>), an injection filter <b>62</b>, a strained ballistic gate (SBG <b>66</b>), a strain source of a strain material <b>65</b>, and a charge receiving or storage region (CSR <b>68</b>). The source <b>56</b> and drain <b>57</b> are formed in the substrate and are typically heavily doped by impurity of a second conductivity type (e.g. n-type) having doping level in the range of about 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 5×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. The CSR <b>68</b> is disposed over and insulated from the channel <b>58</b> by a channel dielectric <b>61</b>. The SBG <b>66</b> is disposed over and insulated from the CSR <b>68</b> and the source/drain <b>56</b>/<b>57</b> by a retention dielectric (RD <b>70</b>) and by a diffusion dielectric <b>69</b>, respectively. The SBG <b>66</b> can be a heavily doped polysilicon, polycrystalline Silicon-Germanium (“poly SiGe”), low resistivity interconnect material such as metalized silicon (“silicide”), or a refractory metal. The STG <b>60</b> is disposed over and insulated from the SBG <b>66</b> by the injection filter <b>62</b> comprising a tunneling dielectric (TD <b>63</b>) and a blocking dielectric (BD <b>64</b>). The STG <b>60</b> can be a heavily doped polysilicon, poly SiGe, low resistivity interconnect material such as silicide, or a refractory metal, with a thickness in the range of about 20 nm to 400 nm. The TD <b>63</b> is disposed in between the STG <b>60</b> and the BD <b>64</b>. The material for TD <b>63</b> can be oxide, nitride, oxynitride, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide or an alloy of these materials, and has a thickness in the range of about 1.5 nm to about 4 nm. The material for BD <b>64</b> can have a narrower energy band gap than that of TD <b>63</b>, and can be selected from the group of oxynitride, nitride, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide and alloys of these materials. The thickness for BD <b>64</b> can be in the range of about 1 nm to about 6 nm. The strain material <b>65</b> can be the strain source providing mechanical stress to strain SBG <b>66</b> disposed thereunder, and/or to strain STG <b>60</b> disposed laterally adjacent to and insulated therefrom by the injection filter <b>62</b>. Though not shown, a portion of the strain material <b>65</b> can also be disposed over the STG <b>60</b> to further provide strain to that region. The STG <b>60</b> overlaps with the SBG <b>66</b> at an overlapping region, where at least a portion of the CSR <b>68</b> is disposed thereunder. In a preferred embodiment, the SBG <b>66</b> comprises two portions: A first portion <b>67</b><i>a </i>having a thickness on the order of about 40 mn to about 400 nm is disposed generally over the source <b>56</b> and drain <b>57</b>, and a second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>having a thickness on the order of about 10 nm to about 200 nm is disposed generally over CSR <b>68</b>. The surfaces of the first and the second portions <b>67</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>b </i>of SBG <b>66</b> can generally be at same level.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0151">The strain material <b>65</b> can be a dielectric providing different types of stress (e.g. compressive stress or tensile stress) and is used for generating piezo-effect in STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> for the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection. The stress can be a uniaxial stress with a stress axis generally parallel to the surface of the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>of SBG <b>66</b> and along a first direction shown in a dash arrow <b>71</b>. A preferred embodiment for the strain material <b>65</b> comprises nitride. The stress level and physical properties of the nitride can be controlled by the thickness and process conditions in its formation. For example, by changing the pressure on chemical elements (e.g. silane) during its formation, magnitude on stress level in the range of about 50 MPa to about 1 giga Pascal (“GPa”) can be achieved. The nitride can be formed to have either tensile stress or compressive stress by employing well-known chemical-vapor-deposition (“CVD”) techniques such as thermal-CVD (for tensile stress nitride) or plasma-CVD (for compressive stress nitride). Further, the stress level of nitride can be tailored or even be relaxed if necessary by using well-known technique, such as ion implanting Ge into the nitride with implant dosage above a threshold level (e.g. about 1×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0152">It should be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the strain source resulting in piezo-effect on SBG and STG in the present invention need not be originated from the strain material <b>65</b> and need not be from its shown location, but rather can be from any other means and in any other regions in the memory cell. Further, the stress need not be of the uniaxial type but rather can be other type (e.g. biaxial type). For example, the strain source can be from the SBG when a polysilicon is employed as material for that region. This is because polysilicon can provide tensile stress with stress level typically in the range of about 200 MPa to about 500 MPa. Another material for the strain source is tungsten-silicide, which is a widely used material in manufacturing semiconductor IC. Tungsten-silicide provides stress level in the range of about 1.5 GPa to about 2 GPa, and can be employed alone as the material for SBG or can be formed atop of a polysilicon layer to collectively form the SBG. Other materials such as amorphous silicon, poly SiGe, TaN, TiN etc. can also be considered as material for supporting the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection. Moreover, means introducing strain need not be from employing strain materials, but rather can be through other approaches, such as ion implanting heavy atoms (e.g. Si, Ge, As etc.) into the regions of crystal to be strained. Implanting heavy atoms at dosage above a critical dosage can disturb the periodicity of crystal lattice, and create dislocation loops and hence stress in that region. Further the stress in that region can provide strain to region adjacent to it. The stress in the implanted region can be preserved by implanting atom such as nitrogen in that region to prevent stress from being relaxed in later processing steps during cell manufacturing. The ion implantation approach has the advantage on process simplicity as it does not require depositing and etching strain material. Further it can form stress in implanted regions and hence can localize the stress in regions where strain effect is most desired. Among all these approaches, they all provide desired piezo-effect for the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection in accordance with the present invention. Additionally, although one strain source is illustrated in memory cells in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that two or more strain sources can coexist in the same cell to provide any variations on stress (tensile or compressive) to various regions of memory cell falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a cross sectional view of a memory cell <b>300</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment of the present invention differs from cell <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> in that the strain material <b>65</b> is disposed over and isolated from the SBG <b>66</b> by the injection filter <b>62</b>. Further, the sidewalls of strain material <b>65</b> are disposed laterally adjacent to but in contact with the sidewalls of STG <b>60</b>. This can provide stronger strain to STG <b>60</b> and hence stronger piezo-effect on charge carriers in that region. Though not shown, a portion of the strain material <b>65</b> can also be disposed over STG <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows a cross sectional view of a memory cell <b>400</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The memory cell <b>400</b> is in all respects except one the same as cell <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The difference is that the strain material <b>65</b> is in contact with both STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> regions. As shown, the strain material <b>65</b> is disposed over the SBG <b>66</b> with its bottom in contact with a portion of the surface of SBG <b>66</b>. Similarly to cell <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the sidewalls of strain material <b>65</b> are disposed laterally adjacent to but in contact with the sidewalls of STG <b>60</b>. With direct contact made between the strain source (i.e. the strain material <b>65</b>) and the strained regions (i.e. STG or SBG), this architecture provides a more effective mean to strain these regions and hence results in a stronger piezo-effect in these regions while employing the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism for cell operations.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0155">It is thus clear that the strain source can be arranged in different ways to strained regions (e.g. STG <b>60</b>) in memory cell in accordance with the present invention. The strength of the strain effect of a strain source on strained regions is typically stronger in regions in direct contact with the strain source, and can be somewhat weaker and relaxed in regions not in direct contact therewith. In some cases, the strain can be even of a reverse type in strained regions not in direct contact with the strain source. For example, the strain in these regions can be of compressive type of strain when a tensile type of strain source is disposed adjacent thereto and insulated therefrom. These combined effects provide a scheme to separately optimize the strains in STG and in SBG for an optimum usage of the piezo-ballistic-charges-injection mechanism.</p>

The CSR <b>68</b> can be with a width on the order of about 10 nm to about 500 nm and with a depth on the order of about 100 nm to about 4000 nm and is generally in a rectangular shape. Disposed over the CSR <b>68</b> is a retention dielectric (RD) <b>70</b> having a thickness on the order of 5 nm to 40 nm. The material for RD <b>70</b> can be made from oxide, nitride, oxynitride, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide or a combination of these materials, such as oxide/nitride/oxide composite film. Disposed over the RD <b>70</b> and the diffusion dielectric <b>69</b> is the SBG <b>66</b> having material similar to that in cell <b>200</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the SBG <b>66</b> comprises two portions: A first portion <b>67</b><i>a </i>having a thickness on the order of about 40 nm to about 400 nm generally disposed over the diffusion dielectric <b>69</b>; a second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>having a thickness in the range of about 10 nm to about 200 nm generally disposed over the CSR <b>68</b>.

<p id="p-0142" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows enlarged view illustrating partial cross sections of three alternative embodiments on SBG <b>66</b>. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-A</figref> and <b>25</b>-B, the object is to form the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>of the SBG <b>66</b> with a reduced thickness than the first portion <b>67</b><i>a </i>to enhance the piezo-ballistic-charges-injection efficiency during a program or erase operation of the cells in accordance with the present invention. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-A</figref>, the reduced thickness is achieved by providing the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>with a recessed surface <b>67</b><i>c </i>inward toward the SBG <b>66</b>, wherein the recessed surface <b>67</b><i>c </i>is substantially a concave contour. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-B</figref>, the reduced thickness on the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>is achieved by providing the recessed surface <b>67</b><i>c </i>of the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>in line with the bottom surface <b>504</b><i>a </i>of a semi-recessed trench formed within the SBG <b>66</b>, wherein the trench sidewall <b>504</b><i>b </i>is substantially perpendicular to the substrate surface. The degree of thinning on the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>can be determined based on the type of materials used for the SBG <b>66</b> and based on the desired optimum performance of the cell operation, and is in general range from about 10% to about 80% of the thickness of the first portion <b>67</b><i>a</i>. Finally, there is shown an embodiment with a simpler configuration on SBG <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-C</figref>. The structure comprises SBG <b>66</b> configured with the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>being substantially identical, in thickness, to the first portion <b>67</b><i>a</i>. The main advantage of this embodiment is on a simpler process for forming the SBG <b>66</b> during cell manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a cross sectional view of a memory cell <b>520</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Memory cell <b>520</b> comprises similar provisions as defined in the memory cell <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> except with a major difference on the CSR <b>68</b>. The memory cell <b>500</b> defines CSR <b>68</b> substantially in a rectangular shape, whereas memory cell <b>520</b> defines CSR <b>68</b> substantially in a “V” shape or a truncated “V” shape. The “V”-shape CSR <b>68</b> comprises two portions: An upper portion <b>503</b> can be with a width on the order of about 100 nm to about 2000 nm; a lower portion <b>504</b> can be with a width on the order of about 10 nm to about 100 nm. The provision of a “V” shape CSR <b>68</b> results in a minimum coupling capacitance between CSR <b>68</b> and source <b>56</b>, and hence has the advantage of enhancing capacitive coupling from SBG <b>66</b> to CSR <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a cross sectional view of a memory cell <b>540</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.

The memory cells <b>500</b> and <b>520</b> define CSR <b>68</b> with the trench bottom <b>502</b> reside within the source <b>56</b>, whereas memory cell <b>540</b> define CSR <b>68</b> extending through the source <b>56</b> with the trench bottom <b>502</b> reside within the substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows a cross sectional view of a memory cell <b>560</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Memory cell <b>560</b> comprises similar provisions as defined in the memory cell <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> except with a difference on the CSR <b>68</b>. The memory cell <b>500</b> define CSR <b>68</b> substantially in a rectangular shape with the surface of CSR <b>68</b> be substantially co-planar with a surface of substrate <b>1</b>, whereas memory cell <b>560</b> define CSR <b>68</b> substantially in a “T” shape with a protruding portion <b>503</b> of the upper portion of CSR <b>68</b> be disposed over and insulated from a portion of the substrate surface. The protruding portion results in the top surface of CSR <b>68</b> substantially higher than the substrate surface. The “T”-shape CSR <b>68</b> comprises generally two portions: the protruding portion <b>503</b> can be with a width on the order of about 150 nm to about 2000 nm; the lower portion <b>504</b> adjacent to the trench sidewall <b>501</b> and bottom <b>502</b> can be with a width on the order of about 50 nm to about 1500 nm. The provision of a “T”-shape CSR <b>68</b> has the advantage of a stronger capacitive coupling between the SBG <b>66</b> and the CSR <b>68</b>. Furthermore, the topography of the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>of SBG <b>66</b> can have a convex shaped structure over the protruding portion <b>503</b> of CSR <b>68</b>. A thinner thickness for the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>of the SBG <b>66</b> can be naturally achieved in manufacturing process and thus can be formed in a self-aligned manner to the CSR <b>68</b> thereunder. The thinner thickness for the second portion <b>67</b><i>b </i>has the advantage on cell operation using piezo-ballistic-carriers-injection mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0161">The isolation scheme for all the memory cells disclosed so far are illustrated based on junction isolation scheme, where drain <b>57</b> of two adjacent cells are isolated by the well <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows an example on an alternative scheme for isolating cells in accordance with the present invention. Memory cell <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is used as an example on cell structure for this illustration. Additional elements on this illustration are shown in cell <b>580</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, there are shown two isolation regions <b>6</b> with an active region <b>5</b> disposed therebetween. Field insulators <b>506</b> can be formed in the well <b>3</b> to provide isolation function isolating adjacent cells from each other. As shown, field insulators <b>506</b> can be disposed under the first portion <b>67</b><i>a </i>of the SBG <b>66</b> with a depth deeper than the depth of drain <b>57</b> but not quite to an upper surface of the source <b>56</b>. This type of field insulator can be formed by conventional techniques, such as LOCOS process or shallow-trench-isolation (“STI”), well-known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the field insulator <b>506</b> of STI is employed as it can be more precisely formed at smaller design rules. The field insulator <b>506</b> is substantially in a rectangular shape with a thickness on the order of about 200 nm and a width of about 100 nm, and can be typically made from insulator such as oxide or other dielectrics well-known in the art. The object in this embodiment is to minimize capacitive coupling between SBG <b>66</b> and well <b>3</b> on parasitic capacitive components contributed from the first portion <b>67</b><i>a </i>of SBG <b>66</b>. Minimizing the capacitive coupling of SBG <b>66</b> has the advantage on reducing capacitance seen by that region in each memory cell and thereby can reduce the operation speed in cell operations (e.g. program, erase, and read) of memory cell. The scheme on cell isolation using region <b>506</b>, whereby adjacent cells are divided from each other, and the effect of this scheme on minimizing capacitive loading become more appreciable with cross sectional view on structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, wherein there is shown three identical memory cells <b>580</b> interconnected together. The active regions <b>5</b>, wherein memory cells reside, are interlaced with field insulator <b>506</b> in isolation regions <b>6</b> to form a segment of memory array <b>600</b>. It should be appreciated that while only a small segment of array <b>600</b> is shown, the provisions here illustrate any size of array. The SBG <b>66</b> regions of each cell are interconnected to define a SBG line trace <b>508</b>, which is typically extended across the entire array of memory cells. For example, with an array having a plurality of interlaced columns of isolation and active regions, with a plurality of memory cells in each active region, memory cell elements such as SBG <b>66</b> can be interconnected to continuously extend across an entire row or column of memory cells. As a result, the capacitive loading effect appear at the SBG <b>66</b> is a multiplication of the total number of cells on a same SBG line to the capacitance of SBG of each individual cell. Therefore, a reduction of 50% on capacitance of SBG in each individual cell can be directly translated to a reduction of 50% on total capacitance of each SBG line, thereby a 50% improvement on speed accessing a cell in a memory array providing other parameters and conditions in cell operation kept the same.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0162">It should be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that although the cell structures from <b>500</b> to <b>580</b> in forgoing embodiments are illustrated with the strain material <b>65</b> in contact with SBG <b>66</b> directly, other alternative configurations on the SBG <b>66</b>, such as examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, can be employed for these cell structures to benefit the piezo-ballistic-charges-injection mechanism. Further, although memory cell <b>500</b> is used as the example on illustrating the alternative scheme for isolating cells, it should be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that other cells in accordance with the present invention can be readily used for the same illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0163">In the prior art, material with a larger work function is one of the major criteria on material selection for ballistic gate <b>12</b>, where ballistic charges traverse. The present invention removes this constraint totally, and the material for the ballistic transport region SBG <b>66</b> can be any kind of conductive materials. To emphasize this effect, the piezo-ballistic-charges-injection mechanism of the present invention is illustrated by choosing material of a smaller work function, namely, n+ polysilicon, for SBG <b>66</b>. It should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the material for SBG <b>66</b> of the present invention is not limited to n+ polysilicon, but can encompass any other type of conductive materials such as p+ polysilicon, amorphous silicon, porous polysilicon, poly SiGe, Pt, Au, Tungsten (W), Mo, Ru, Ta, silicide (e.g. NiSi, CoSi), TaN, TiN etc.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0164">It should be noted that in the injection filter the dielectric constant of BD <b>64</b> is illustrated to be greater than that of TD <b>63</b>. It should be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the teaching of this disclosure can be applied to modify the injection filter to effectively block the parasitic charge carriers (electrons or holes) from backward injection. For example, the BD <b>64</b> layer of the filter can be modified to material having energy gap narrower and dielectric constant similar to that of TD <b>63</b>. Moreover, the layer of BD <b>64</b> need not be a material with a uniform chemical element but can be a material with graded composition on its element. Further, the filter need not comprise two dielectrics (i.e. TD and BD) but can comprise any number of layers of dielectrics such that the filter can effectively block and filter charges. For example, an additional layer of dielectric can be placed on the other side of BD <b>64</b> to form the filter having BD <b>64</b> disposed in between TD <b>63</b> and the additional layer. The additional layer can have material property and thickness similar to that of TD described earlier. In addition, any appropriate dielectric, such as oxynitride (“SiON”), aluminum oxide (“Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>”), hafnium oxide (“HfO<sub>2</sub>”), zirconium oxide (“ZrO<sub>2</sub>”), tantalum pen-oxide (“Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>”) etc. can be used in place of oxide or nitride. Furthermore, any composition of those materials and the alloys formed thereof, such as hafnium oxide-oxide alloy (“HfO<sub>2</sub>—SiO<sub>2</sub>”), hafnium-aluminum-oxide alloy (“HfAlO”), hafnium-oxynitride alloy (“HfSiON”) etc. can be used in place of oxide or nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0165">It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the illustrated herein and embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all variations falling within the scope of the appended claims. For example, although the present invention is illustrated in nonvolatile memories of electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), it should be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art that it can be extended to any other type of nonvolatile memories (such as Electrical Programmable Memory or EPROM). Further, although the present invention is illustrated in a single cell, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that a plurality of cells of the present invention can be arranged in a rectangular array of rows and columns in a NAND or a NOR array architecture well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0166">Additionally, the present invention is illustrated in non-volatile memory cell storing charges on CSR of a conductive or semiconductor material (i.e. the “floating-gates”) that is electrically insulated from but capacitively coupled to surrounding electrodes. In such storage scheme, charges are evenly distributed through out the conductive region. However, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention is not limited to the illustrated herein and embodiments described above, but can encompass any other types of schemes and media for storing charges. For example, the memory cells of the present invention can store charges in localized storage sites such as nano-particles or in traps of a dielectric layer. The advantage of these charge storing schemes is a negligible interference between adjacent cells when they are arranged in a memory array. Furthermore, in the event there is a local breakdown in surrounding insulators of one of the storage sites, charges stored at other sites can still be retained. The dielectric having traps as the storage sites can be a nitride layer formed, for example, by using LPCVD (Low-Pressure-Chemical-Vapor-Deposition) technique well-known in the art. Other dielectrics such as HfO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>having traps of a deeper trapping energy can also be considered as material for the trapping dielectric. The nano-particles as the storage sites can be silicon nano-crystals each in an oval shape having a diameter in the range of about 2 nm to about 7 nm, and can be formed by using well-known CVD technique. The nano-particles are not limited to the silicon nano-crystals but can be nano-particles of any other type of materials (e.g. Ge, SiGe alloy, HfO<sub>2 </sub>etc.) that can effectively store charges.</p>

Additionally, the strain material of the present invention need not be nitride, need not be a dielectric, need not be providing tensile stress, need not be providing compressive stress, but rather can be any other types of material and can provide any type of stress (e.g. shear stress) that effectively provide piezo-effect for piezo-ballistic-charges injection.</p>

Program Operation

<p id="p-0156" num="0177">Self-limiting injection mechanism is illustrated for program operation when a first type of charges (e.g. electrons) is selected as the ballistic carriers. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, there is shown a partial portion of the conduction energy band diagram presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> for a CSR potential at its initial state. The conduction band diagram is shown for regions from SBG <b>66</b> to CSR <b>68</b>. The electrons <b>89</b> are shown transporting at a kinetic energy <b>102</b> that is sufficient to surmount the conduction band barrier height <b>76</b> of RD <b>70</b>. In the illustration provided here, the kinetic energy <b>102</b> is shown higher than the barrier height <b>76</b> at the interface between SBG <b>66</b> and RD <b>70</b> by an amount <b>102</b><i>a</i>. The electrons <b>89</b> then enter the conduction band <b>70</b><i>a </i>of RD <b>70</b>, making their way through and eventually collected by CSR <b>68</b>. Through the injection process, negative charges (electrons) will gradually build up on CSR <b>68</b>, and subsequently modify CSR potential and hence electric field in RD <b>70</b>. As injection continues, this effect can change the direction of electric field in RD <b>70</b> from one assisting the electron charge transport (diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>) to the other opposing electron charge transport (diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0178">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, there is shown an energy band diagram similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> with a major difference on the CSR potential. Here the CSR potential has been modified from its initial state after negative charges (electrons <b>89</b><i>a</i>) accumulated thereon. As the event on charge injection continue, the incoming electrons <b>89</b> transporting with same energy <b>102</b> are now shown be repelled back toward the SBG <b>66</b> to become carriers <b>89</b><i>b</i>, and can be conducted away therein as thermal carriers. It is further shown that these electrons <b>89</b> are only able to enter the conduction band <b>70</b><i>a </i>of a portion of RD <b>70</b> but unable to surmount the conduction band barrier height <b>76</b><i>a </i>in RD <b>70</b>. There is shown further yet a portion of electron carriers <b>89</b> can tunnel through a distance <b>76</b><i>b </i>through quantum mechanical tunneling to reach CSR <b>68</b> and become electron carriers <b>89</b><i>c</i>. However, the tunneling probability for carriers <b>89</b><i>c </i>is generally very low (e.g. about a millionth), and is expected to decrease rapidly (to be explained hereinafter). With these effects, the accumulated electron charges on CSR induce a mechanism to limit the incoming electron carriers from continuously reaching CSR <b>68</b>. The illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref> provides the basis for the self-limiting mechanism disclosed in this invention. The voltage dependence of flow rate for the electron carriers <b>89</b> can be stronger than that seen in Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. There are several reasons for this. First, RD <b>70</b> is provided with a thickness on the order of about 6 nm or thicker, and thus is considered as a Fowler-Nordheim tunneling dielectric. Therefore, without considering other effects, the voltage dependence of flow rate for electron carriers <b>89</b> is similar to that in Fowler-Nordheim tunneling characteristics, where a strong current dependence on voltage is seen (particularly at lower voltage range, e.g. a typical value is about 1 order of magnitude of current change for about every 100 mV voltage change). Secondly, as charges constantly built up on CSR <b>68</b> by injected electrons, the energy barrier in RD <b>70</b> is increased accordingly to develop an opposing field E, and the field becomes more effective on opposing the incoming electrons <b>89</b>. The opposing field E can be approximated by

</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0183">Therefore, in the situation where Φ<sub>e </sub>is less than zero (i.e. ΔK<sub>e </sub>being greater than q(Q<sub>CSR</sub>−Q<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>fb</sub>)/C<sub>total</sub>), the ballistic charges are permitted to transport through RD <b>70</b>, and the effect of opposing field on blocking the incoming electron charges is negligible. As injection continue till a situation where Φ<sub>e </sub>equals to zero (i.e. ΔK<sub>e </sub>being equal to q(Q<sub>CSR</sub>−Q<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>fb</sub>)/C<sub>total</sub>), the effect of opposing field takes place to block incoming electron charges. With injection continued further, the barrier height <b>76</b><i>a </i>seen by electron carriers <b>89</b> in RD <b>70</b> start to form and can continue to increase as more electron charges build up on CSR <b>68</b>. Along with the effect, the number of repelled carriers <b>89</b><i>b </i>increases rapidly to become equal to the incoming carriers <b>89</b>. As a result, the effect reduces the amount of carriers available to participate the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and hence effectively reduces the tunneling carriers <b>89</b><i>c </i>that can reach the CSR <b>68</b>. This mechanism further increases the effect on blocking incoming electrons from entering CSR <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0184">Both the effects described above forms the self-limiting injection mechanism for cell programmed by using piezo-ballistic charge injection. In the initial program stage, so long as the electron carriers <b>89</b> can surmount the barrier height <b>76</b>, carriers are allowed to transport through RD <b>70</b> to reach CSR <b>68</b>. As program event continues, electron charges will continue build up on CSR <b>68</b>, the potential of CSR <b>68</b> will decrease to reach a lower value V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>P </sub>such that a new barrier <b>76</b><i>a </i>is now formed to block all incoming electron carriers from further reaching the CSR <b>68</b>. This then complete a programming cycle, in which the programming event ends as the self-limiting mechanism take place.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0185">At the completion of a programming event, the total amount of charges on the CSR <b>68</b> can be approximated by a simple equation shown as below:

</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0186">Therefore, at the end of a programming cycle, the total charges accumulated on the CSR <b>68</b> are determined by two major parameters. First, it's determined by the extra energy <b>102</b><i>a </i>(ΔK<sub>e</sub>) that is over the barrier height <b>76</b> for the electron carriers <b>89</b>. Since the extra energy <b>102</b><i>a </i>is set by the voltage difference between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>, a selection on the bias between gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> hence determines the amount of charges stored on CSR <b>68</b>. The total cell capacitance C<sub>total </sub>has a scaling effect and can be optimized through cell design to assist the effect herein. For example, a larger value for the total cell capacitance will result in the need on a smaller bias between gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> for storing a same amount of charges on CSR <b>68</b>. The second parameter determining the total CSR charges is to do with the CSR charges yielding the flat band condition in RD <b>70</b>, which in turn can be determined by the voltages applied to each electrodes (e.g. drain <b>57</b>) of the memory cell as well as the capacitor components of corresponding electrodes. Thus with a choice on a set of these parameters, the present invention allows memory cells be programmed to a state a priori.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0187">Both formulas (11) and (12) suggest effects that can be applied to store multi-level logic states in a memory cell. For example, as suggested in formula (11), to store four levels of logic states (namely, 00, 01, 10, and 11 states) in cell <b>200</b> of the present invention, four discrete amounts of charges for Q<sub>CSR </sub>can be stored on CSR by setting V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>i </sub>at four levels of voltages during electrons injection. Settings for V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>i </sub>can be done, for example, by applying four different levels of voltages (e.g. 0V, 1V, 2V, and 3V) to source <b>56</b> or drain <b>57</b> or to both of these regions while voltages for gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> held at a fixed setting (e.g. −2V and 2V at gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b>, respectively). It is obvious the four levels of states can be handled in many different ways. For example, a simpler way on setting the four levels of states can be done by setting the initial state (i.e. state of erased cell) as the 00 state. This scheme leaves the remaining three states (01, 10, and 11) be established by setting V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>i </sub>at three levels of voltages in similar way as described above. The four discrete amounts of charges for Q<sub>CSR </sub>can be arranged such that the amount of charges for one state (e.g. the 11 state) is greater than that for its preceding state (e.g. 10). The formula (12) suggests another scheme for storing multi-level states. The scheme is done by utilizing the linear dependence of Q<sub>CSR </sub>on ΔK<sub>e </sub>(i.e. the extra energy <b>102</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>) to establish multi-level states through storing discrete amount charges for Q<sub>CSR </sub>by setting ΔK<sub>e </sub>at different levels. Using the above example on four level states with the initial state being the 00 state as an illustration, the multi-level storage scheme here can be done by setting three different voltages between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b> while fixing voltages at source, drain and body. For example, the three voltages for STG <b>60</b> can be −2V, −2.5V, and −3V with SBG <b>66</b> held at +2V. For a cell having a total capacitance of about 2.25×10<sup>−16 </sup>Farad, the bias scheme can add an incremental amount of charges of about 700 electrons to CSR for each increment on STG voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0188">It is now clear that the injection of electrons onto CSR will continue until the blocking effect on the ballistic electrons taking place. The blocking effect is due to the rising of the energy bands in the CSR <b>68</b>, which is equivalent to the lowering of the CSR potential as electron charges accumulated thereon. As a result, an injection barrier and its opposing field is formed in RD <b>70</b> and the barrier continue to rise as more ballistic electrons injected into and accumulated on the CSR <b>68</b>. This effect decreases the electron flow from STG <b>60</b> onto the CSR <b>68</b> until to a point the barrier is high enough to completely block incoming ballistic electrons. The charge blocking mechanism is highly voltage-sensitive. In other words, its current dependence on voltage is more sensitive than that usually observed in the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Further, RD <b>70</b> is typically with thickness of about 6 nm or thicker, where the voltage-less-sensitive charge tunneling, namely the direct-tunneling phenomenon, is not permitted. These effects provide an effective self-limiting mechanism for ballistic charge injection. The self-limiting mechanism provides a method permitting charges be stored on CSR at multi-level states. This can be done by for example, injecting incremental levels of charges on CSR through incrementally adjusting the bias at regions (such as the drain <b>57</b>) adjacent to the CSR <b>68</b> or through incrementally adjusting the bias between STG <b>60</b> and SBG <b>66</b>. The mechanism thus permits storing multi-level logic states in memory cells of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Erase Operation</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0189">Self-limiting injection mechanism is further provided for erase operation when a second type of charges (e.g. holes) is selected as the injected carriers. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</figref>, there is shown a partial portion of the valence energy band diagram presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> for CSR <b>68</b> at initial state of erase where a first type of charges (e.g. electrons <b>89</b><i>a</i>) reside thereon. The injected holes <b>72</b> are shown transporting across SBG <b>66</b> at a kinetic energy <b>104</b> sufficient to surmount the valence band barrier height <b>77</b> of RD <b>70</b>. The kinetic energy <b>104</b> is shown higher than the barrier height <b>77</b> by an amount <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The holes <b>72</b> can then enter the valence band <b>70</b><i>b </i>of RD <b>70</b>, making their way through and eventually collected by the CSR <b>68</b>. These holes can gradually build up positive charges on the CSR <b>68</b>, and subsequently modify the CSR potential and hence the electric field in RD <b>70</b>. As such injection process continues, this effect can change the direction of the electric field from one assisting the charge transport (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</figref>) to the other opposing the charge transport (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0190">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref>, there is shown an energy band diagram similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</figref> with a major difference on the CSR potential. Here the CSR potential has been modified from its initial state where initial electrons <b>89</b><i>a </i>have been neutralized and positive charges (holes <b>72</b><i>c</i>) have built up. As the event on charge injection continues, the holes <b>72</b> transporting with same energy <b>104</b> is now shown repelled back towards the SBG <b>66</b> to become carriers <b>72</b><i>b</i>, and can be conducted away therein as thermal carriers. It is further shown these carriers are only able to enter the valence band <b>70</b><i>b </i>of a portion of RD <b>70</b> but unable to surmount the valence band barrier height <b>77</b><i>a </i>in RD <b>70</b>. Among these holes <b>72</b>, it is shown further yet a small portion of them can reach the CSR <b>68</b> through quantum mechanical tunneling to tunnel through a distance <b>77</b><i>b</i>. They finally become the hole-carriers <b>72</b><i>d </i>in CSR <b>68</b> and reside thereon. However, the tunneling probability for carriers <b>72</b><i>d </i>is generally very low, and decrease rapidly as more holes <b>72</b><i>c </i>built up on CSR <b>68</b>. With these effects, the accumulated charges on CSR <b>68</b> induce a mechanism to limit the incoming holes <b>72</b> from reaching CSR <b>68</b>. The illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref> provides the basis for the self-limiting mechanism for erase operation disclosed in this invention. It is notable that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref> except with differences on carriers type and on energy band where carriers transport. It is therefore obvious to those having ordinary skill in the art that the characteristics of the self-limiting erase mechanism using holes are similar to that of the self-limiting program mechanism using electron injection described earlier. For erase operation using holes, in the initial erase stage, so long as the energy of holes <b>72</b> can surmount the barrier height <b>77</b>, the charges are allowed to transport through RD <b>70</b> and reach CSR <b>68</b>. As total electrons on CSR are fully neutralized by injected holes, positive charges (holes <b>72</b><i>c</i>) start building up on CSR <b>68</b> to increase the potential of CSR to a higher value V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>E </sub>such that a new barrier <b>77</b><i>a </i>and an opposing field are formed to effectively block all incoming holes from further reaching CSR <b>68</b>. This then complete an erase cycle, in which the event ends as the self-limiting erase mechanism take place.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0191">At the completion of an erase cycle, the total charges on the CSR <b>68</b> can be approximated by a simple equation shown as below:

In a different form, the total charges can be expressed approximately as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Q</i><sub>CSR</sub><i>=Q</i><sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>fb</sub>+(<i>C</i><sub>total</sub><i>/q</i>)*Δ<i>K</i><sub>h</sub>  (14)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where ΔK<sub>h </sub>is the energy difference <b>104</b><i>a </i>between the hole-carrier kinetic energy <b>104</b> and barrier height <b>77</b> at the interface between SBG <b>66</b> and RD <b>70</b>, and is set by bias between gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0192">Therefore, at the end of an erase cycle, the total charges accumulated on CSR <b>68</b> are determined by two major parameters in formula (14). First, it can be determined by the extra energy <b>104</b><i>a </i>(ΔK<sub>h</sub>) that is over the barrier height <b>77</b> for the holes <b>72</b>. A selection on the bias between gates <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> hence determines the amount of charges stored on CSR <b>68</b>. The second parameter determining the total CSR charges is Q<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>fb</sub>, which is to do with the CSR charges yielding the flat band condition in RD <b>70</b>, and can be determined by the voltages appeared at electrodes (e.g. drain) of the memory cell as well as the capacitor components of corresponding electrodes. Thus with a choice on a set of these parameters, the present invention allows the memory cells be erased to a state a priori. Furthermore, the linear dependence of Q<sub>CSR </sub>on ΔK<sub>h </sub>(i.e. the extra energy <b>104</b><i>a</i>) also provides an advantage to the present invention to allow memory cells be erased to a state a priori. Both of these effects can be used to prevent over-erase issue in non-volatile memory cells in conventional technologies employing Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism for erase. Moreover, these effects can be used to allowed memory cell be erased to multi-level states. For example, using four levels logic states (namely, 00, 01, 10, and 11 states) and effect suggested in formula (13) as an illustration, four levels states can be set by storing four discrete amounts of hole charges for Q<sub>CSR </sub>by setting V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>i </sub>at four levels of voltages during holes injection. Setting V<sub>CSR</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>i </sub>can be done, for example, by applying four different voltages (e.g. 0V, −1V, −2V, and −3V) to bias source <b>56</b> or drain <b>57</b> or both of these regions. In consideration of biasing scheme in this example, a proper bias (e.g. −3V) can be applied to the body <b>59</b> to avoid forward-biasing the source/drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0193">It should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the provision disclosed herein on the self-limiting mechanism is generally true for operating cells using either type of charges. For example, holes can be selected for program operation and electrons can be selected for erase operation. Further, the multi-level logic states can be stored in memory cells by using either type of injection mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0194">For memory cells in accordance with the present inventions, it should be noted that both program and erase operations can be done with absolute bias at a level less than or equal to 3.3V. Furthermore, the erase mechanism and cell architecture enable the individually erasable cells feature, which is ideal for storing data such as constants that required periodically changed. The same feature is further extendable to small group of such cells which are erased simultaneously (e.g. cells storing a digital word, which contains 8 cells). Additionally, the same feature is also further extendable to such cells which are erasable simultaneously in large group (e.g. cells storing code for software program, which can contain 2048 cells configured in page, or contain a plurality of pages in block in array architecture).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0195">Finally, the read operation of the cells in accordance with the present invention is described herein for completeness on cell operations. The read operation can best be described when cells are arranged in a rectangular array of rows and columns, wherein a plurality of cells are constructed in NOR or NAND architecture well-known in the art. The read operation can be illustrated in cells having source <b>56</b> and drain <b>57</b> of n-type conductivity, and body <b>59</b> of p-type conductivity. To read a selected memory cell in an array, a ground potential is applied to the source of the cell. A read voltage of approximately +1 volt is applied to the drain and approximately 2.5 volts (depending upon the power supply voltage of the device) is applied to SBG <b>66</b> of the selected cell. Other regions (i.e. STG <b>60</b> and body <b>59</b>) are at ground potential. If CSR <b>68</b> of the selected cell is positively charged (i.e. CSR is discharged of electrons), then the channel <b>58</b> is turned on. Thus, an electrical current will flow from source <b>56</b> to drain <b>57</b> of the selected cell. This would be the “1” state.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0196">On the other hand, if CSR <b>68</b> is negatively charged, the channel <b>58</b> is either weakly turned on or is entirely shut off. Even when SBG and drain are raised to the read potential, little or no current will flow through channel <b>58</b>. In this case, either the current is very small compared to that of the “1” state or there is no current at all. In this manner, the selected memory cell is sensed to be programmed at the “0” state. Ground potential is applied to source <b>56</b>, drain <b>57</b>, and SBG <b>66</b> for cells in non-selected columns and rows so only the selected memory cell is read. For both selected and non-selected memory cells, ground potential is applied to the body region <b>59</b>. It should be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art that although the read scheme here is illustrated on cell having two logic states (i.e. “0” and “1”), it should be obvious that the scheme can be applied to cell having multi-level of states (e.g. 00, 01, 10, and 11).</p>

The transistor <b>700</b> further comprises a strain source of strain material <b>65</b> providing mechanical stress to strain the base <b>66</b> disposed thereunder, and/or to strain the emitter <b>60</b> disposed laterally adjacent to. The material properties, formation methods, specifications and other information on these regions can be referred to their counter-parts having same reference indicator described earlier in the memory cells. For example, the emitter, base, and collector are conductive materials (e.g. silicon, polysilicon, SiGe, TiN, TaN, Au, Mo, Pt, NiSi, CoSi etc.). The transistor can be operated by employing the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism to transport charge carriers (either electrons or light-holes) from the emitter <b>60</b> to the collector <b>68</b>. Using electron as an illustration, the transfer ratio of the transistor can be optimized to a range of about 0.95 or higher through applying mechanical stress to the base along material orientation favorable to electrons traversing the base. The mechanical stress can repopulate the electrons to conduction band valley having a lighter effective mass, and hence can further be utilized to reduce the base sheet resistance. Further, the filter structure in accordance with the present invention can suppress the parasitic capacitance between emitter and base to the range of about 6×10<sup>−7 </sup>Farad/cm<sup>2</sup>, and solves the capacitance problem which was one time considered as a major problem in the amplifier in the noted article by Mead. In fact, this capacitance is significantly lower than the emitter-base capacitance (1.76×10<sup>−6 </sup>Farad/cm<sup>2</sup>) reported in a state-of-the-art bipolar transistor (see Bock et al, “3.3 ps SiGe Bipolar Technology”, IEDM Technical Digest, pp. 255–258, 2004.). Either one or all of these effects can suppress the RC delay associated thereto. Therefore, the shortest transistor speed for transistor in accordance with the present invention can be limited by the transit time through the structure, and can be less than 0.5 pico-second, permitting tera-Hertz device operation.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0199">The unique portion of present invention lies in the effects provided by the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism and by the barrier-height-engineering. These effects result in unique components in the cell and transistor structures, namely, the strain source for the piezo-ballistic-charge-injection mechanism and the injection filter for the barrier-height-engineering. Although both the components are illustrated simultaneously in the structures, it should be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the two components need not coexist in the same cell or transistor, but can exist in any variations falling within the scope of the appended claims. For example, the memory cells of the present invention can comprise the strain source without the injection filter.</p>
