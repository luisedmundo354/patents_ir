<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus and method of securing a bicycle handlebar stem to the front wheel fork steerer tube with handlebar height adjustability and rotation of the handlebar and stem for easy storage. A steering assembly is provided where the handlebar stem is moveably fastened to the front fork steerer tube using a manually operated primary locking device and requiring a secondary action to allow for movement in the form of either height adjustment, or rotation, or both. The connection between the handlebar stem and the front fork steerer tube can be on the interior or the exterior of the front fork steerer tube. With the interior connection, the steerer tube can be elongated to extend above the top of the headset bearings where it is fitted with a collar for clamping onto the internally mounted stem. The handlebar stem and fork steerer tube are fitted with corresponding octagonal or other cross sectional shapes, or a safety tracking system. For bicycles equipped with handlebar stems which clamp to the outside of the fork steerer tube, the handlebar stem is equipped with a safety lock and can be rotated for storage with no height adjustability.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">I. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">a. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the steering assembly on bicycles. In particular, this invention relates to the method and apparatus of securing a bicycle handlebar stem to the front wheel fork steerer tube in a manner that is both safe and convenient for the operator. The steering assemblies of this invention are intended to improve upon existing technology in the two areas—handlebar height adjustability and rotation of the handlebar such that the handlebars end up parallel to the front wheel and the vehicle frame for easy storage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">b. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Bicycles are often used only occasionally and stored frequently for extended periods of time. Yet, due to the laterally protruding handlebars, storage is not particularly convenient. To date, there have been few bicycle steering assemblies that could be manually (without the use of tools) adjusted in height, and none that are manually height adjustable and rotatable for storage. Increasingly, consumers are demanding more comfort with an easily adjustable wide range of handlebar heights or positions. Height adjustability, using tools, has always been available and recently has been augmented by offering an adjustable tilt up of the horizontal stem section. But so far, manually (without the use of tools) adjustability has never been available on regular bicycles. The word “manually” shall be used in the context of this disclosure to mean “without the use of tools”. In fact, the standard quill type stem found on many bicycles of today requires that a tool be used for height adjustment. While some operators use the tool properly, it has been found that many do not, leading to the potentially unsafe situation of the handlebar rotating differently from the front wheel during riding.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0024">In the prior art there have been no handlebar steering assemblies that could be safely rotated horizontally (rotating about the steering axis) 90 degrees for easy storage. In addition, other than co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/823,765 there have been no handlebar stems whose height is adjustable by hand, that can be rotated for storage. A great number of handlebar stems have focused on being light and strong with U.S. Pat. No. 5,095,770 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,680,798 representative of those proposals. However, all are limited by not having the ability to be manually adjustable in height nor can they be rotated for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0025">A number of patents address the issue of storage but not in a useful manner. The most common approach to reducing the width of the handlebar is by breaking the handlebar into pieces and pivoting them. Some examples of this include U.S. Pat. No. 5,570,614, EP 0 687 620 A1, JP10119866A2, and JP07052862A2. Another method used to reduce the width is by tilting one end of the handlebar up in the air making the bicycle narrower but much taller. This is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,427 and JP08332986A2.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0026">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/823,765 overcomes the problems of the above-mentioned prior art. The present application compliments application Ser. No. 09/823,765 by including the most straightforward and safe methods for controlled 90-degree rotation of the handlebars and with optional height adjustability if desired. The handling of the bicycle during the rotation only mode is a simpler process than handling the bicycle in the rotation and fold down options used in application Ser. No. 09/823,765.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">II. SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0027">This invention defines a safe manually operated bicycle handlebar steering assembly with optional handlebar height adjustability and with optional storage rotation ability. The system is made safe by ensuring that the handlebar stem cannot be in the rideable position without some form of lock being engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0028">Almost all bicycles currently on the market can be divided into two categories, 1) bicycles using a stem that mounts inside a steerer tube (the upwardly extending straight tube of a wheel fork) using a quill type internal stem, and 2) bicycles using an external stem that clamps onto the outside of a steerer tube at a point just above the headset bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0029">Because there are two different systems used on almost all bicycles, this invention includes embodiments which are compatible with both internal stem bicycles and external stem bicycles. In the case where an external stem is required, the stem can be rotated for storage but is not height adjustable. In the case where an internal stem is required, the stem can be height adjustable, in most cases, or the stem can rotate for storage, or the stem can do both.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0030">In all embodiments herein, it should be noted that the wheel “fork” is integrally made of at least two fork blades, and a “steerer tube” extending upwards through the vehicle frame. There are no embodiments of this invention where the wheel fork does not have a steerer tube. It should be noted that many small wheel folding bicycles use forks which do not have a “steerer tube” extending upwards through the bicycle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0031">A first preferred embodiment utilizes stems mounted inside the steerer tube. The manual height adjustable, internally mounted, steering assembly is primarily made up of three parts, the stem, the collar, and the steerer tube headset assembly. The steering assembly consists of a steerer tube connected to the fork blades and front wheel, wherein the top end of the steerer tube extends through and above the top of the upper bearings to allow it to be fixed to the interior stem. The interior stem generally consists of a vertical member, which rides inside the steerer tube, and a horizontal member which protrudes forwards to connect to the handlebar. The upper end of the steerer tube is fitted with a clamping, or fastening device such as a collar. The collar, in some cases, has one or more bolts, some of which may protrude beyond the inner surface of the steerer tube into a track in the interior mounted stem.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0032">In this preferred embodiment, the stem vertical member is primarily made of a cross sectional shape that is not able to rotate about the steering axis due to a corresponding inner shape of the collar. The rotation process is accomplished by unlocking the collar quick release, turning the protrusion retracting knob, and pulling the stem all the way up to a point where the protrusion is on the round rotation area of the stem and the vertical motion comes to a stop. At this point the shaped stem upper area has left the shaped collar area, and, if the protrusion is held retracted, the stem can be rotated to the storage position and then push all the way down into a steerable storage position. Many other safety options can be built into the riding, rotating, and storage tracks as disclosed in detail in this preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0033">In other height adjustable, rotatable embodiments, the vertical stem member has either a shape, a round with a shape, or is round with a vertical track or tracks to keep it from rotating. In each case, the collar, equipped with a quick release, is fixed to the steerer tube and has a shape that matches the exterior shape of the stem. In the cases where the collar does not have a matching interior shape, the steerer tube has the matching interior shape and is squeezed onto the stem. After the collar quick release is released, stems with vertical tracks control the vertical movement of the stem. Rotation can occur at either the top or the bottom of the stem in rotation areas or, if retractable, ball bearings or other protrusions are used it can occur at any level.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0034">It is very likely that in many cases, manual height adjustability may be the only desired function and therefore the stem would not allow for rotation about the steering axis.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0035">Collars can be one or two level, and can have either compression collars, as in the preferred embodiment, dimensionally stable collars, using interior compression cylinders, or have a ball bearing locking system. A two level collar can also use a combination of dimensionally stable pressure cylinders and slotted compression systems. Each of these components is shown separately but, for simplicity, the combination is not shown but obvious to those skilled in the trade. The collars can squeeze directly onto the stem, or indirectly onto the stem by squeezing onto the steerer tube which, in turn, squeezes onto the stem. The collars can also squeeze partly on the stem and partly on the steerer tube. Protrusions can be moveable, fixed, and combined with the alignment system. Steerer tubes can be threaded or threadless, with interior shapes to match the stem and exterior configurations including slots, notches and large and small holes to tie to the collars. Alignment can be at the top of the stem, at the collar, or at the steerer tube, fork junction. A two level collar can be configured such that one section is shaped to match a shaped vertical stem section and this section of the collar can rotate relative to the other section of the collar to allow the stem to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0036">In other embodiments, the vertical and horizontal members of the stem are not integrally connected but rather the horizontal stem member can rotate about the vertical stem member for storage. In some cases, the vertical stem member is fastened to the steerer tube in a manually adjustable manner such that manual height adjustment is done between the stem and the steerer tube while rotation for storage is done between the two stem members. In other cases, the vertical stem member is fastened to the steerer tube with a tool such that rotation is done between the two stem members but height adjustment requires the use of a tool. Also shown are cases where a two part stem is configured such that rotation for storage occurs about an axis other than the steering axis. The restraining device in this case can either be located at the steering axis or at another location. These, and all other embodiments, can be equipped with an option wherein the bicycles can be locked using a standard key lock in a public place with the handlebar rotated such that it cannot be ridden. Alternatively, the vertical stem member can consist of two hinged portions wherein the stem is pulled up such that, when the upper portion has exited the steerer tube, it can be folded down for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0037">For internal stems with height adjustment and rotation, the rotation is always a two step process where the primary locking device is undone and then a secondary function must be performed to allow the stem to be rotated for storage. In many cases a track is used in conjunction with a shape. Tracks can be bumped on the bottom surface whereby a spring loaded protrusion must be continually activated in order to allow for any movement of the stem. The track can also have bumps in only certain sections of the track, for example, when the stem is raised beyond a “minimum insertion line” or when the protrusion is getting near to the part of the track where rotation is possible. In summary, the track can have no bumps, some bumps, or be complete with bumps in all areas such that the user must continually activate the protrusion in order to allow for any motion of the stem. Some configurations of the locking mechanisms ensures that the bicycle can never appear to be in the rideable position with the handlebar stem able to rotate making the bicycle not safe to ride.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0038">In the rotation options where there is no horizontal track, there are two alternatives. The horizontal stem section can be rotated about a non-rotatable vertical stem section using an additional clamping collar connecting the horizontal and vertical sections. If the stem sections are fixed together, the protrusions can be made to be retractable pulling out of the vertical track to allow rotation. All the options which raise or lower the stem can use a wide variety of fixed or retractable protrusions such as one or two protrusions located in the front, one above the other, or two side protrusions in the same horizontal plane. The protrusions can be set above or below or within the compression collars in integral, joined or separate collars which when used work in all different shapes of tracks. Angled or curved tracks can be used to warn the rider that the stem is moving into an area where rotation is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0039">There are a wide range of secondary safety or locking devices shown in the different embodiments. A secondary safety lock is some form of obstacle such that, even if a primary lock is unfastened, the handlebar will still remain loosely fixed to the front wheel. For example, when a shaped stem is used, even if the primary locking quick release is unlocked, the handlebar stem still cannot rotate because the shaped surfaces prevent it. Some secondary safety devices block the access from the vertical track to the horizontal track by blocking the vertical movement of the entire stem using a different lock or obstruction moved by different hand operated control means or by automatic means. With the systems that restricts the access to the horizontal rotation by limiting the vertical movement of the stem, ball bearings work very well. With a stem being pushed all the way down the horizontal track is still not accessible unless a single or set of ball bearing is moved out of way to permit the rotation processes. The blocking ball bearings, unlike various warning devices, cannot be overridden and by-passed unless the surface holding it in position is moved out of the way. Not shown in the Figures are numerous options for providing warnings to the operator that the handlebar stem is approaching a rotatable state. These include a written warning on the stem, a button that makes a clicking sound, a color coded section of the stem that appears when pulled up and other methods obvious to those skilled in the trade.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0040">The primary and secondary restraining devices are shown in many cases, mounted axially around the steering axis. However, both the primary and secondary restraining devices can be located at points other than at the steering axis. Furthermore, a stem mounted to the interior of the steerer tube can be restrained by a exterior mounted restraining device. Alternatively, a stem mounted to the exterior of the steerer tube can be restrained by an interior mounted restraining device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0041">A second preferred embodiment employs stems mounted to the outside of the steerer tube. Many bicycles today use a different handlebar stem mounting from the traditional quill type stem. These bicycles use a threadless steerer tube which extends above the top of the headset bearings where the stem clamps onto the outside of the steerer tube. It is therefore necessary to include configurations that work with this existing technology.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0042">For external mounted, fixed height, stems of this invention, the stem vertical section is mounted on the exterior of the steerer tube and held fixed by using either vertical or horizontal pressure or a combination thereof. If vertical pressure is used, the vertical section of the stem is squeezed downward onto a rotation restraining shape. The vertical pressure can be achieved using an inside threaded collar on an outside threaded steerer tube, or a outside threaded bolt on an inside threaded steerer tube. The restraining shape has a tooth or notch which projects into a tooth or notch in the vertical stem member. The lower surface of the vertical stem member has a concave or convex surface and the lower collar has a matching concave or convex shape which reduces minute stem movement. The stem is then rotated for storage by first loosening the upper restraining device, and then moving the stem vertically upward such that it clears the rotation restraining shape and can rotate. In some cases, the steerer tube may have a non-round cross sectional shape that does not allow a stem with a matching internal cross sectional shape to rotate unless the stem is lifted above the steerer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0043">If horizontal pressure is used as the primary method to secure the stem to the steerer tube, the vertical stem section is slotted and manually clamped on the steerer tube. In some cases, the stem vertical member may have an inner surface shape that either squeezes onto a corresponding outer surface shape of a steerer tube, or squeezes onto a corresponding outer surface shape of an interior mounted collar which is locked to the outside of the steerer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0044">Secondary locking devices include spring loaded buttons mounted interior to the steerer tube and retractable and non-retractable teeth mounted on exterior collars or to the stem vertical section.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0045">In all cases, where horizontal pressure, or vertical axial pressure is used to secure the riding position, the quick release or tightening nut can be relocked after completing the rotation process to prevent any turning of the stem and to aid in steering the bicycle as it is moved around in the storage position. In some cases because of the safety device pops into the storage position holding it so it is not necessary to relock the quick release.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0096" num="0110">The steering assemblies of this invention are intended to improve upon existing technology in the two areas—handlebar height adjustability and rotation of the handlebar and stem for easy storage. This invention relates to the method of securing the handlebar stem to the fork steerer tube in a manner that is both safe and convenient for the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0111">This invention comprises a steering assembly where the handlebar stem is manually moveably fastened to the front fork steerer tube using a primary locking device and requiring a secondary action to allow for movement which comprises of either height adjustment, or rotation, or both. In all cases, even if the primary locking device is unlocked, the secondary locking device or function must be performed in order to allow for rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0112">In the figures, the steering assembly use a standard handlebar, usually not shown, a stem which attaches to the handlebar on one end and either mounts inside or outside of a front fork steerer tube with the other. The steerer tube is integral to the front fork and front wheel. The steerer tube is fitted concentrically through the head tube of the bicycle frame and is steerably connected to the frame so that it can be rotated using an industry standard headset bearings system.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0113">The steering assemblies can be generally broken up into two categories. Height adjustable assemblies are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 15D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-C</figref>, <b>22</b> A-B, <b>23</b>A, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b>A-C. Non-height adjustable steering assemblies are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 20B</figref>, <b>23</b>B, and <b>24</b>A-E. Virtually all bicycles currently on the market use either a tool-height adjustable interior mounted steering assembly or an exterior non-height adjustable steering assembly. Therefore it is desirable to have embodiments that mirror these two different categories.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0114">All height adjustable assemblies are interior mounted stems which are comprised of at least a vertical member and a horizontal member. The vertical member is always mounted inside the steerer tube. Within the height adjustable assemblies, there are manually height adjustable systems that allow the rider to raise and lower the handlebar stem assembly without the use of tools which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 15D</figref> and FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>A-C. These include systems where the handlebar and stem are manually height adjustable and can be rotated approximately 90 degrees for convenient storage using the same quick release locking lever. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-C</figref>, <b>22</b>A-B, and <b>23</b>A are tool-operated height adjustable stems which use a standard quill type attachment method.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0115">In most of the Figures, there is a shape that meets a shape or a track and a protrusion securing the steering assembly from unwanted rotation. In most cases, one shape is part of the stem and the second shape is imbedded in either the collar or the steerer tube, or in some cases is found in the second part of a two part stem.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0116">Steering assemblies shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>A-B, <b>8</b>A-D, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>C, <b>11</b>A-B and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A through 20B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A-C</figref> use non-standard steerer tubes where the steerer tube is not the standard round, slotted, or has holes, threaded or threadless steerer tube found on bicycles on the market today.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0117">All steering assemblies shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 22B</figref>, FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>A-C fasten and unfasten for height adjustment and/or rotation on the steering axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-B</figref>, and <b>24</b>A-E do not fasten on the steering axis but rather fasten at a point offset from the steering axis. While a standard quick release lever is shown in most figures for simplicity, a number of other standard binding methods could be substituted for the quick release, the most simple being a wing nut.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0118">Many different cross sectional shapes can be used to avoid unwanted rotation between the stem and the steerer tube. When rotation is performed at the lower end of the stem vertical member, and it is required that the stem then be able to be lowered in the rotated or storage position, then a cross sectional shape that will fit again after being rotated 90 degrees is required. For example, a hexagon no longer has the same cross section after being rotated 90 degrees. However, a square or an octagon does have the same shape after 90 degree rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref> show variations of the first preferred embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> shows a preferred embodiment which is an octagonal, interior, rotatable, manually height adjustable steering assembly which is retrofittable onto an existing bicycle as it uses a standard threadless steerer tube. The handlebar <b>1</b> is not shown but is attached to the horizontal section of the stem <b>2</b>, which is welded to the vertical, shaped stem section <b>4</b>, which has a cap <b>3</b>, and a pull out blocking section <b>6</b> which holds the stem in the steerer tube while it is being rotated. This steering assembly is operated by releasing quick release lever <b>65</b>, rotating turning knob <b>81</b>, and, while holding turning knob <b>81</b> in the rotated position, pulling up stem <b>4</b> to the desired height. If rotation for storage is desired, stem <b>4</b> is lifted all the way up until the stem turning section <b>5</b> is adjacent to the octagonal shape collar <b>63</b>, controlled with a quick release, where the stem can then be rotated approximately 90 degrees for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0120">As the stem is rotating, retractable protrusion <b>80</b> rides along crossover track <b>11</b>. If desired, once the stem is rotated, it can be lowered with protrusion <b>80</b> riding up sloping vertical track <b>9</b> and then along the octagonal surface of stem section <b>4</b>. The octagonal shaped vertical stem section <b>4</b> is held within an octagonal shaped top section <b>63</b> of a two level collar <b>60</b>-<b>70</b>. This slotted compression collar works using compression both in its top section and its bottom section. The bottom section, steerer tube restraining collar <b>70</b>, has a round inner surface <b>71</b> used to clamp onto the standard threadless steerer tube <b>110</b> to permit it to be retrofitted onto any standard bicycle while the top stem restraining collar section <b>60</b> is used to clamp onto the interior mounted octagonal stem <b>4</b>. In this way, the stem attaches to the collar and the collar attaches to the steerer tube. There is no direct attachment between the stem and the steerer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0121">Regarding safety features, this design offers a very safe system as when the two octagonal surfaces are clamped together, unwanted rotation is not possible. When the stem is raised and the stem turning section <b>5</b> encounters the octagonal shaped collar area <b>63</b>, it could rotate if it were not also equipped with a safety sloping vertical track <b>9</b> which does not allow it to rotate. Even when protrusion <b>80</b> reaches the bottom of sloping vertical track <b>9</b>, it cannot enter the crossover track <b>11</b> unless it is raised manually by turning knob <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0122">As shown, vertical track <b>7</b> is equipped with a series of recessed bumps <b>29</b> such that, even when quick release <b>65</b> is unlocked, stem <b>4</b> is restrained from moving relative to stem restraining collar <b>60</b> by protrusion <b>80</b> which encounters recessed bumps <b>29</b> if the stem is pushed in a vertical direction and encounters the side wall of track <b>7</b> if the stem is rotated about the steering axis. Safety protrusion <b>80</b> is spring loaded and rests extended and engaged against the bottom of the vertical track <b>7</b> and against recessed bumps <b>29</b>. Track barrier <b>10</b> prevents the stem from being raised to an unsafe position. Crossover track <b>11</b> serves several purposes. First, it does not allow the stem to completely exit the collar. Second, it guides the stem in the rotation process so that it rotates in the correct direction and does not rotate too far—typically 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0123">Once the stem is rotated, it remains tracked until the stem is pushed back down and the two octagonal surfaces meet again. This makes the stem steerable in folded position. It should be noted that, collar <b>60</b>-<b>70</b> attaches to stem <b>4</b> and attaches to the threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, there is no direct attachment between the stem <b>4</b> and the threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>. While it is shown using a threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, it can also be mounted to a threaded steerer tube by threading the inner surface of lower steerer tube restraining collar <b>70</b>. For threadless steerer tubes, a standard “problem solver” inserted wedge nut is used to adjust the headset bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0124">Alignment of the system is accomplished by simply aligning the handlebars with the front wheel, and then locking bolt <b>73</b>. In the perspective, and in vertical cross-sections A-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), C-C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>), D-D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>), and top view sections B-B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>) and E-E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>), the collar is shown with two distinct parts. The top part is the stem compression restraining collar <b>60</b>, and its compression slot <b>62</b>, squeezed tight by the quick release bolt <b>72</b>, and quick release arm <b>65</b>, with a hand adjustable nut <b>67</b>, thus forcing the octagonal shaped inside area <b>63</b>, onto the stem, and with a cut <b>61</b> between it and the lower steerer tube restraining compression collar.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0125">In this case, the lower steerer tube restraining section <b>70</b>, houses a threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, which is held by the round inside of the collar area <b>71</b>, squeezed tight with another compression slot, by a tool tightened bolt <b>73</b>. Also shown is a perspective of the threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, with a round inside surface <b>112</b>, which is a standard threadless steerer tube integrally connected to front fork <b>116</b>, and held in the standard bicycle frame head tube <b>130</b>, which has a standard headset bearing housing and the top bearing <b>131</b>, and bottom bearings <b>132</b>, the head tube being connected to the standard bicycle frame tubes <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0126">Before the stem is inserted into the collar, it is assumed that a problem solver mechanism with a lower cap <b>6</b>′, would be used within the steerer tube, by pulling downward on the lower part of the stem vertical member to set adjustment of the headset bearings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, Section A-A shows the protrusion <b>80</b>, controlled by a turning knob <b>81</b>, which causes the protrusion to retract and move outward when twisted. This outward motion is produced by the sloping surface <b>83</b>, and the compression of the inward pushing spring <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> the upper compression collar area can be constructed with hinged compression arm <b>69</b>, rotating about a hinge <b>69</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4E</figref> show the various tracking options for controlling access to rotation, for controlling rotation itself, for controlling going to the storage position, and for controlling returning from the storage position to the riding position. The figures show the track, as if it were embedded in a flat surface instead of a round stem surface for clarity. The cross hatched line density shows the depth of the track, as does the section profile line running next to the track. The more dense the cross-hatching, the deeper the track at a given point. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, starting on the upper end of the middle track, in order to rotate the stem from the riding position, the protrusion follows the arrow downward, off the track <b>7</b> with bumps <b>29</b>, then hits a track barrier <b>10</b>, and must be retracted upward, then enters the sloping track <b>9</b>, then down to the bottom, then hits a sideways track barrier <b>10</b>, and must be retracted upward again, then onto one of two cross-over tracks <b>11</b> with a sloping surface, turns and rises up to the storage track and storage position. In this configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the stem can be rotated in either direction such that the handlebar ends up either on the left side of the bicycle or on the right side of the bicycle. This can be used in any number of configurations shown in this invention. In order to go from the storage position to the riding position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the protrusion follows the same path however, in this case it rides up ramps and over the barriers without requiring the retraction of the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> also illustrates a configuration where there is one long track <b>7</b> on the stem <b>4</b> and no rotated tracks as the protrusion rides on the surface on stem <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a configuration where there are no tracks on stem <b>4</b>, the tracks are only located on stem turning section <b>5</b>. In order to rotate the stem from riding to rotated positions, the protrusion comes down the right side track, falls into a track hole <b>16</b>, then must be retracted, then onto a slope and down into a deeper track hole <b>16</b><i>a</i>, again pulled up this time a double height, then back down a horizontal slope <b>11</b>, and up vertical slope <b>9</b>. In reverse, the protrusion falls into the double depth track hole <b>16</b><i>a</i>, when the stem comes to the riding position thereby locking it from any movement both vertically and rotationally, such that the rider cannot get to the riding position without manually retracting the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows a track system with no tracks on stem <b>4</b> where there is one track barrier <b>10</b>, blocking entry to the rotation track <b>11</b>, and there are no reverse direction barriers. There can also be riding and storage tracks on the upper stem and a stop on the horizontal section which blocks the stem from the rotation track as well as blocking the stem from reaching the riding track in reverse.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0130">The primary reason to have a tracking system combined with a cross sectional shape such as an octagon, is that, in order to rotate, the octagonal surfaces must be removed from one another and the track becomes the primary safety mechanism at that point. Likewise, the reason to have recessed bumps <b>29</b> is so that, even if quick release <b>65</b> is forgotten or ignored, the steering assembly will still be functional and not able to rotate or to move vertically unless the rider manually turning knob <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0131">These variations on tracking systems can also be used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7F</figref>, <b>8</b>A-D, and <b>12</b>A, all of which have retractable protrusions. The tracks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-E</figref> show some options for the preferred embodiment. Many other cross sectional shapes as well as many variations of tracks could also work and are not shown for simplicity. Other options not shown but obvious to those skilled in the trade are a system which would rotate when the stem is pushed all the way down with a round rotation section at the top of the stem as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7F and 8A</figref>. Alternatively, this embodiment could be built without the rotation capability and only with height adjustability. In this case, crossover track <b>11</b>, and turning section <b>5</b> are simply eliminated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. In fact, all tracks can be eliminated, as illustrated, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>11</b>A and <b>14</b>. The overall preferred embodiment is shown using a quick release <b>65</b>, however it is apparent to those skilled in the art that, any number of other standard locking systems could take the place of the quick release. A non-retractable protrusion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, could be used in place of the retractable protrusion, however a one level continuous, unchanging track would be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows perspectives of the octagonal shaped interior rotatable, manually height adjustable stem and octagonal shaped steerer tube which is squeezed with a single level compression collar onto the stem which also has rotation capability. The stem restraining collar <b>60</b> squeezes on the slotted steerer tube <b>110</b> which in turn squeezes onto interior stem <b>4</b>. The stem has a front fixed depth vertical riding track <b>7</b>, connected to a curved cross-over track <b>11</b>, having a fixed depth downward sloping surface, then on the turning section <b>5</b>, which in turn is connected to a fixed depth side storage track <b>8</b> which allows the bicycle to be steered to a parking spot when the handlebar is rotated for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0133">The perspective of stem restraining collar <b>60</b>, shows its round inside surface <b>64</b>, to go around the steerer tube <b>110</b> being attached to the front of the steerer tube with two bolts <b>85</b>, extending through the threaded collar holes <b>84</b>, on into the steerer tube, the upper bolt having a fixed protrusion <b>86</b>, extending even farther and into the stem tracking system. In this system, in lieu of the “problem solver” used in the first preferred embodiment, to adjust the headset bearings, the system uses a two-part collar with a top piece, having a lower edge <b>87</b>, which is beveled to match the beveled top edge <b>121</b>, of the threadless locking collar <b>120</b>, shown below it. The top stem restraining collar <b>60</b>, is locked with quick release <b>65</b>, then the lower locking collar is turned using wrench slot <b>123</b>, and secured with locking bolts <b>122</b>, when the proper pressure is achieved on the headset. The perspective of the round outside threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, with the octagonal shaped interior <b>112</b><i>a </i>which can be found either just in the upper section of the steerer tube or running all the way to the bottom. The steerer tube <b>110</b> has a compression slot <b>113</b>, and bolt holes <b>114</b>. This steerer tube extends through the standard headset and frame construction to the bottom section of the steerer tube with its fork <b>116</b><i>a</i>, having compression slot flanges <b>117</b>, with bolts <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0134">Since the stem and the steerer tube shapes cannot be turned relative to one another, the alignment must be done, not at the collar, but at either the top or the bottom, in this case both alternatives are shown however only one would be needed. Bolts <b>118</b> are used if the fork and steerer tube alignment is used, and if alignment is done at the top, it requires a rotating compression collar <b>26</b>, riding on a round stem area <b>23</b>, secured by bolts <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0135">Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the trade, is a retractable protrusion replacing upper bolt <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>, which can be retracted out of a hole (located at the intersection of tracks <b>7</b> and <b>11</b>) in the bottom of a fixed depth track but cannot be retracted out of the track itself as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0136">Another option not shown is using a single bolt <b>85</b> or using no bolts <b>85</b> but instead using a protrusion attached directly to the collar and either lapping over the top of the steerer tube or through the slot of the steerer tube. Other options not shown but apparent to those skilled in the trade are a system which would rotate when the stem is pushed all the way down with a round rotation section at the top of the stem as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7F</figref>, <b>8</b>A, and <b>12</b>B. In this case, the octagonal steerer tube inner shape <b>112</b><i>a </i>would only be present in the top clamping portion of the steerer tube. The steerer tube shown has a threadless outer surface however, a threaded outer surface could also be used. Many other combinations of stem/steerer tube cross sectional shapes could also be used as well as many other tracking configurations. In some situations, rotation for storage may not be required and this embodiment could be used as a height adjustable stem only by simply ending track <b>7</b> short of the bottom of the octagonal shape, or by the elimination of all tracks and protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0137">It is likely that in some situations, the utility of manually adjustable handlebar stem height will be required independent of the utility of rotation for storage. All configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 15D</figref> can be easily modified to be height adjustable only with no rotation capability. In order to illustrate this invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref>, show height adjustable only stems, with no rotation capability shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref> shows perspectives of a height adjustable only stem which uses a single level collar, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref>, the collar inner surface has a shape and is equipped with an additional piece <b>68</b> attached at the top of the collar and located inside the steerer tube. This collar secures the stem by squeezing the slotted steerer tube onto the stem in a manner similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as well as squeezing directly on the stem which is not done in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0138">The steerer tube <b>110</b> has a round interior <b>112</b>, like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> however, unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The cross sectional shape of the round shaped stem <b>4</b><i>a</i>, when storage rotation is not required, can be any number of shapes such as the flatted round shown, a pentagon, a hexagon, etc. These shapes do not need to be the same shape after 90 degrees of rotation as is the case with stems which rotate when pulled all the way up like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. A flat front round, shaped stem <b>4</b><i>a</i>, with a flat front area <b>12</b>, is prevented from being raised out of the collar by a restraining cable <b>13</b>. The restraining cable <b>13</b> also is used to avoid allowing the stem to be raised to a level with insufficient overlap of the round shaped stem <b>4</b><i>a </i>and steerer tube <b>110</b> for safe riding. Cable <b>13</b> could be replaced by a simple bolt mounted in the front of stem flat <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0139">The flat front collar inner shape <b>68</b>, inside of the stem restraining collar <b>60</b>, extends downward inside the compression collar, shown in vertical side section A-A residing inside the steerer tube <b>110</b>. Again in this case the stem and the collar shapes are form fitting to each other. Alignment is accomplished using the offset position disk <b>88</b>, shown in the collar perspective and section A-A with the tightening nut <b>89</b>, which permits the bolt to be tightened onto the threaded holes <b>84</b>, on the collar thus fixing the positioning of the steerer tube <b>110</b> to the stem restraining collar <b>60</b>. The center of the circle of disc <b>88</b> is offset from the center of the bolt <b>85</b><i>a</i>. Bolt <b>85</b><i>a</i>, is inserted from the inside through the hole <b>88</b><i>a</i>, in the inside section <b>68</b>. The upper part of the steerer tube <b>110</b>, shows the compression slot <b>113</b>, and non-threaded large hole <b>115</b>, to house the offset position disk <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0140">Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> the collar perspective shows the stem restraining collar <b>60</b>, having a flat bottom edge which would go up against the flat top edge of the threadless locking collar <b>120</b>, as shown section A-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). This configuration, as in the preferred embodiment, assumes the use a “problem solver” type mechanism pulling down on cable <b>13</b> for setting the headset bearings. Lower collar <b>120</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> but not in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. A threaded steerer tube could be used if the inner surface is also threaded. If the stem in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> were replaced by a two part stem as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the stem could be made to rotate within itself for storage. Also, a spring loaded protrusion and a vertical movement track could be used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> if it was required that the stem not be allowed to move vertically without continually activating a button.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0141">Another variation in locking the stem to the steerer tube is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref> and <b>8</b>A-D where neither the steerer tube nor the binding collar is slotted, but rather the binding collar is dimensionally stable and is equipped with interior mounted pressure cylinders which lock the collar to the stem and lock the collar to the steerer tube. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref> shows perspectives and horizontal sections of a manually height adjustable only, octagonal stem steering assembly set in a dimensionally stable two level collar that can be retrofitted onto any standard threadless steerer tube. The perspective of the stem shows the horizontal section of the stem with an adjustable tilting option arm <b>14</b>, rotating around a pivot point <b>18</b>, the octagonal stem having a front surface with height control non-recessed bumps <b>36</b>, and a small pull out blocking area <b>6</b> which prevents the stem from being raised to an unsafe level.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0142">The two level, dimensionally stable collar has an upper level <b>60</b><i>a </i>which holds the stem, with an interior octagonal shape <b>63</b> and a lower level <b>70</b><i>a </i>holding the, steerer tube with an interior round shape <b>71</b>. Within the upper level the pair of interior pressure cylinders <b>90</b>, with their flat faces <b>91</b>, are inserted into the collar openings <b>93</b>, and are poked through the inside opening <b>97</b> for the stem, onto the flat face of the stem <b>4</b>, and are tightened using bolt <b>94</b>, and the quick release <b>65</b> and the hand adjustable nut <b>67</b>. Within the lower level another set of pressure cylinders <b>90</b>, with their round faces <b>92</b>, are inserted into the lower collar openings <b>93</b>, poked through the inside steerer tube opening <b>95</b>, and onto the round face of the steerer tube <b>110</b>, and are fastened using a tool in head bolt <b>96</b>, attached to cylinder through bolt <b>94</b>, having a hand adjusted end <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0143">Horizontal section A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows how the pressure cylinders are tightened directly onto the stem <b>4</b>, which in turn is held against the retractable protrusion <b>80</b>, held by the twisting knob <b>81</b>, which is used to control the height adjustment of the stem. Horizontal section B-B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows how the lower set of pressure cylinders, independent of the upper set, are tighten directly onto the steerer tube <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, is a horizontal section showing an alternate means of applying pressure onto stem shapes using parallel moving pressure cylinder <b>90</b><i>a</i>, as opposed to diagonal moving cylinders as found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. This straight inward moving system could also be used to secure the steerer tube. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref> shows another alternate were only one pressure cylinder is used. Clearly any combination of these dimensionally stable means can be used to lock the steerer tube or a stem of any one of a number of cross sectional shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref> shows an alternate where the octagonal shaped stem <b>4</b> is pushed down and out of the octagonal shaped collar <b>63</b> into an upper rotation area <b>5</b><i>a </i>so the protrusion <b>80</b> is able to line up with the horizontal top track <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the stem can be rotated. Since the lower cylinders <b>90</b> secure the collar to the steerer tube at any angle, alignment is easily accomplished and requires no additional components. If the lower collar inner surface <b>71</b> were threaded, a threaded steerer tube <b>111</b> could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> in that it uses a octagonal stem, a standard threadless steerer tube, and a two level shaped collar. However, the collar in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a dimensionally stable collar which does not change in diameter when clamped while the collar in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> does change in diameter when clamped. A dual level collar using a combination of a dimensionally stable collar with a slotted collar is not shown but obvious to those skilled in the trade. It is also obvious to those skilled in the trade that the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> could be made to be rotatable for storage in a similar manner to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0147">A wide variety of other shapes and/or tracks would also work with the dimensionally stable collars shown.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-D</figref> show perspectives of a manually height adjustable steering assembly similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-F</figref>, however the two levels of pressure cylinders of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-F</figref> have been combined into one single level in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-D</figref> shows a part round, part shaped, tracked, stem <b>4</b><i>a </i>which can be rotated for storage, where the stem is fastened by a dimensionally stable, single level stem restraining collar where one side fastens to the stem with two pressure cylinders <b>90</b> and the other side fastens to the steerer tube using two additional pressure cylinders <b>90</b>. The perspective of the part round stem <b>4</b><i>a </i>shows the vertical track <b>7</b>, with the bottom height control recessed bumps <b>29</b>, and an optional rotation control track hole <b>16</b>, before the horizontal top track <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The perspective of the one level stem restraining collar <b>60</b><i>a </i>and steerer tube restraining collar <b>70</b><i>a </i>shows section <b>70</b><i>a</i>, fastening to the steerer tube <b>110</b>, with round surfaces <b>92</b>, on the cylinders <b>90</b>, and stem restraining section <b>60</b><i>a</i>, fastening to the stem with flat surfaces <b>91</b>, on pressure cylinders <b>90</b>. This single level closeness is possible because the collar is dimensionally stable and the steerer tube <b>110</b>, with a round interior <b>112</b>, is heavily penetrated in the back with large openings <b>119</b>, for the stem cylinders <b>90</b> and surface <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a back view section A-A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> is a side view section B-B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> is a top view section C-C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, section B-B shows how the retractable protrusion <b>80</b>, controlled by twisting knob <b>81</b>, extends through a collar opening just underneath the cylinder through bolt <b>94</b>, in the front section and, reaches back into the stem track <b>7</b>. When knob <b>81</b> is twisted and retractable protrusion <b>80</b> moves outward off the recessed bumps <b>29</b>, it still cannot move outward far enough to leave the track <b>7</b> in order to allow rotation. Rotation is then only possible when the quick release is unlocked and unscrewed such that the pressure cylinders recede, then the tracked stem <b>4</b><i>a </i>is pushed all the way down and retractable protrusion <b>80</b> is allowed to enter horizontal top track <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The lower portion of track <b>7</b> is not shown but stops at a point such that the end of the track encounters retractable protrusion <b>80</b> and does not allow stem <b>4</b><i>a </i>to be raised to a position that is unsafe for riding.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0150">Alignment is accomplished simply by loosening pressure cylinder <b>90</b> with round faces <b>92</b>, aligning the handlebar, then tightening them again. Large opening <b>119</b> and large hole <b>114</b><i>a </i>are slightly oversized to accommodate for small alignment adjustments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the assembly requires a number of redundant steps to be taken to allow for rotation, a) unlock quick release, b)retract and hold the protrusion, c) adjust the height to a specific level, and d) unscrew the quick release to retract pressure cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0151">It is possible that four redundant locks is an excess, and it is obvious to those skilled in the trade that any combination of these four redundant fastening devices is possible. Not shown but also apparent to those skilled in the trade is a round tracked stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and corresponding collar with the cylinders <b>91</b> set to accommodate the round stem.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0152">Not shown is an additional interior mounted spring and button as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> which would be, this time, mounted on the inside of the stem <b>4</b><i>a</i>, positioned so that when the stem is raised, it would pop out, through the steerer tube and collar so as to not allow the stem to reach the rotating position. This interior stem, side mounted button would have to then be depressed by a finger so as to clear the inside of the steerer tube, thus permitting the stem to be farther raised and then rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0153">This invention relates to the method of securing the handlebar stem to the fork steerer tube in a manner that is both safe and convenient for the operator. Simply fastening a round collar quick release on a round stem does not adequately secure the stem from unwanted rotation given the wide variation of operators. Therefore having a shape or a track in the stem and a corresponding shape or track in either the steerer tube or the collar, ensures that unwanted rotation will not occur even if the primary lock is not operated properly. The concept of including a shape in the fork steerer tube inner surface which marries to the corresponding shape in an interior mounted stem is novel and possible in many configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows partial perspectives of optional non-standard novel steerer tubes, as a incomplete sample, having non-standard heights, non-standard interior shapes from round threaded on the inside <b>112</b><i>h</i>, to notched inward and outward <b>112</b><i>b</i>, to hexagonal <b>112</b><i>c</i>, to octagonal <b>112</b><i>a</i>, to square <b>112</b><i>d</i>, to round notched inward <b>112</b><i>e</i>, to round notched outward <b>112</b><i>f</i>, to round with a flat cut off <b>112</b><i>g</i>. These interior shapes and the plain round shapes could have top sections with threadless tubes having a threaded top <b>119</b><i>a</i>, notched tops <b>119</b><i>b</i>, large portions missing <b>119</b><i>c</i>, threaded tubes having a non-threaded top <b>119</b><i>d</i>, and/or large openings <b>119</b>. All of the mentioned options could be provided with threaded exteriors, partially threaded exteriors, or threadless exteriors and be provided with or without slot cut depending on how they are used. All members could also have varying exterior shapes such as element <b>112</b><i>i </i>or element <b>112</b><i>j</i>. Not shown, of course, are the standard height, round, steerer tubes used in the preferred embodiment and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Not shown for simplicity, are the corresponding interior mounted stem members as well as the exterior stem members. In addition, it is obvious to those skilled in the trade that a collar attached to the upper surface of a round steerer tube, could also have any of these interior shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0155">To secure the stem to the steerer tube, a number of different cross sectional shapes can be used, some of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> on the interiors of steerer tubes. In some cases, it may be required to have the shape integral to a collar rather than to the interior of the steerer tube. Many other cross sectional shapes can be used in addition to those illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref> show some examples of cross sections of shaped collars and internal stems and how forces are transmitted between them. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows and octagonal stem and octagonal collar where the shape of the octagonal stem is made such that some sides are shorter than other sides, allowing for pressure to be applied to four sides of the octagonal surface rather than three. This is accomplished by making the stem surface immediately adjacent to small gap <b>62</b><i>a </i>longer than the two stem surfaces next to it, thereby forcing a small gap <b>62</b><i>a </i>to form and ensuring that the two surfaces next to it are in contact with the collar. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> are several locations for hinge <b>69</b><i>a </i>which can either be a single hinge or a double hinge breaking the collar into two or three pieces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows a square stem <b>4</b> with corners cut off so forces are applied on the flat surfaces. Space <b>62</b><i>a </i>in this case is found at the corners. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> shows a different configuration with stem restraining collar <b>60</b> squeezing onto slotted threadless steerer tube <b>110</b> which, in turn, squeezes onto interior stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Fixed protrusion <b>86</b> is adjustable and the end is round such that there is no micro-movement when the collar is squeezed shut. Stem <b>4</b><i>b </i>also shows an optional protrusion <b>17</b> extending into slot <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0157">In all previous configurations, every steering assembly which is able to rotate for storage, requires that the stem be adjusted to a particular height where the two shapes of the stem and the collar or the stem and the steerer tube no longer prevent rotation. In addition, the collar has, in all previous figures, been fixed to the steerer tube. It is possible that a collar that is rotatable relative to the steerer tube could be required. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows stem and collar perspectives and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows side vertical section A-A of a height adjustable, interior, rotatable at any height flat front round stem <b>4</b><i>a</i>. The stem has a flat front area <b>12</b>, which is prevented from being raised out of a two part collar by a restraining cable <b>13</b>. The upper rotating stem restraining collar <b>60</b><i>c </i>with a flat front shape <b>63</b><i>a</i>, is able to rotate relative to the lower threadless locking collar <b>120</b>. The lower fixed threadless locking collar <b>120</b>, has a locking flange <b>39</b> which is spring loaded by spring <b>41</b>, and resides, when the bicycle is being operated, in notch <b>38</b>. Upper rotating stem restraining collar <b>60</b><i>c </i>hooks onto the raised flanges <b>39</b><i>a </i>on the lower threadless locking collar <b>120</b> allowing the two collars to rotate with respect to each other but not come apart as shown on vertical side section A-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0158">Again the stem and the interior collar shapes are integral to each other as they were in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref>, but in this case the rotating stem restraining collar <b>60</b><i>c </i>turns along with the round shaped stem <b>4</b><i>a</i>, on the steerer when the drop flange <b>39</b>, on the threadless locking collar <b>120</b> is manually lowered out of the notch <b>38</b> by pushing down on lever arm <b>40</b>. Not shown, but apparent to those skilled in the trade, is any cross sectional shaped stem and matching collar where the collar is a two part collar with the upper collar able to rotate relative to the lower collar. The cross sectional shape does not have to be the same shape after having been rotated 90 degrees as is the case with interior stems which rotate when pulled all the way up. While drop flange <b>39</b> is shown, any number of other restraining devices could be used to secure the upper and lower collars from rotating relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0159">Various methods for avoiding unwanted rotation have been shown. One method is to simply block the protrusion that rides in a track from entering the horizontal rotation track. Another is to stop the entire stem from being moved to the height where the protrusion could enter a rotation track. There are a wide variety of methods to block a stem from being moved to a specific height. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows a vertical cross-section of a round tracked stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, with vertical riding track <b>7</b>, a top horizontal track <b>11</b><i>a</i>, which is inaccessible to fixed protrusion <b>86</b> unless a top button <b>19</b>, held in cap <b>3</b>, pushes down the rod <b>15</b>, depressing spring <b>19</b><i>a</i>, and lowering the control disk <b>15</b><i>a</i>, which had been forcing the ball bearings <b>21</b>, in an outward position in slot <b>23</b><i>a</i>, blocking vertical movement of surrounding collar <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0160">When the button <b>19</b> is pushed down, the ball bearings <b>21</b>, are allowed to move inward allowing the surrounding collar <b>22</b> to move upward compressing the surrounding collar spring <b>20</b>, and allowing the stem to be lowered such that the fixed collar fixed protrusion <b>86</b>, reaches the horizontal top rotation track <b>11</b><i>a</i>, allowing the round tracked stem <b>4</b><i>b </i>to rotate for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates a method where the blocking apparatus is mounted on the stem as opposed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> where the blocking apparatus is mounted on the collar/steerer tube. The blocking method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> could also be used on any of the other rotatable interior steering assemblies shown. It should also be pointed out that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, for the first time, shows the safety control button being located on the stem and not on the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0162">Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the art is a shaped stem <b>4</b>, and corresponding collar or steerer tube, with an octagonal or other shape which, on shaped stem <b>4</b> ends becoming and round rotation area <b>5</b><i>a </i>above a line just below the horizontal track <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0163">In some cases, multiple protrusions can be used riding in one or more tracks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows multiple protrusions riding in one track. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-C</figref> show multiple protrusions riding in multiple tracks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> is a vertical section of a height controlled round tracked stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, with a round bottom, with a vertical riding track <b>7</b>, with bottom height control recessed bumps <b>29</b>, held in a fixed stem restraining collar <b>60</b>, having a fixed protrusion <b>86</b>, and a retractable protrusion <b>80</b>, which can be retracted with the spring loaded button <b>103</b>, controlled by the lever arm <b>104</b>, rotating off the pivot point <b>105</b> which holds the fixed protrusion <b>86</b>. When quick release axle <b>72</b> is unlocked and retractable protrusion <b>80</b> is retracted, stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, can move vertically, and if rotation for storage is desired, it can be pulled all the way up to its turning section <b>5</b>, such that the fixed protrusion <b>86</b>, can move into the horizontal rotation track <b>11</b> only if lever <b>104</b> is depressed, and then up side storage track <b>8</b> for storage. Not shown, but clear to those skilled in the art is a steering assembly using the tracking methods of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> at the top of the stem rather than, as shown, at the bottom. In this case, side storage track <b>8</b> would not be necessary. The multiple protrusion configuration could be used on any embodiment where protrusions are used.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0164">The steering assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-C</figref>, like the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-B</figref>, does not need to be adjusted to a specific height in order to rotate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows an expanded perspective and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B-C</figref> show cross sections of a multitracked steering assembly which uses ball bearings riding in tracks as the safety fastening system. The round dual tracked stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, shown in sections A-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>) and B-B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>), is held within a two level collar where the lower portion of the steerer tube restraining collar <b>70</b> is a compression collar which squeezes onto the slotted, threaded steerer tube <b>111</b> which, in turn, squeezes onto the interior mounted stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The upper control stem restraining collar <b>60</b><i>b</i>, is partially separated from lower steerer tube restraining portion <b>70</b> at division point <b>61</b>, where stem restraining collar <b>60</b><i>b </i>has a side opening <b>100</b>, which holds a flat surrounding disk <b>98</b>, with a handle <b>99</b> on the outside, and on the inside of the disk a sloping cutout <b>102</b>, which forces the ball bearings <b>21</b>, to remain in an outward position blocking the rotation of the stem <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0165">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> top section B-B, when the handle <b>99</b> is turned to the dotted position <b>99</b>′, the ball bearings <b>21</b>, can slide outward into the slot <b>23</b><i>a</i>, and thus out of the stem track <b>7</b>, allowing the stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, to rotate. These ball bearings <b>21</b>, are being held horizontally by the holding ring <b>101</b>, which, in the front, extends downward into steerer tube slot <b>119</b><i>b</i>. The steering assembly is aligned at the top or the bottom using a system similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Two vertical riding tracks <b>7</b> are shown as well as two storage tracks <b>8</b>. It is apparent to those skilled in the trade that any number of riding and storage tracks could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0166">In some situations, it may be required that the vertical stem member <b>4</b>, or <b>4</b><i>a</i>, or <b>4</b><i>b </i>of an internal stem does not rotate relative to the steerer tube for storage while the horizontal member <b>2</b> of the stem does. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an expanded perspective of stem, collar, and steerer tube, that has an octagonal shaped height adjustable stem <b>4</b>, with a rounded top section <b>23</b>, holding a stem ring <b>25</b>, which keeps the stem rotating collar <b>26</b>, from moving vertically. The octagonal stem <b>4</b> is married to the octagonal interior <b>112</b> of the threaded steerer tube <b>111</b>. Threaded steerer tube <b>111</b> is slotted <b>113</b>, with bolt holes <b>114</b>, for the dual bolts <b>85</b>. The rotating stem section <b>2</b> has a horizontal locking device <b>27</b>, and a key <b>28</b>, which enables the user to lock the stem in the rotated storage position when the bike is parked in a public place. The inner surface of the stem restraining collar <b>60</b> is threading <b>66</b> allowing it to attach to threaded steerer tube <b>111</b>. This type of threaded inner surface could be used on any number of different embodiments in the present invention. It is apparent to those skilled in the trade that a two part stem such as the stem shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, could be used on any internal stem embodiment in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0167">It is generally known that, in mass production, small variations always keep components from being produced with perfect alignment. Therefore it is important to be able to, after production, align the various embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> shows a round collar which fastens to a round steerer tube making alignment easily accomplished. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, alignment is done using one of two different methods, a two part stem, or a break between the steerer tube and the fork crown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref> shows a offset bolt alignment system for threadless steerer tubes only.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0168">For threaded steerer tubes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-D</figref> show a perspective and sections of a threaded compression stem restraining collar <b>60</b>, with a round, tracked stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, having a built in collar alignment system designed for threaded collars. This system is possible because the alignment drop-in piece <b>106</b> has a top round hole <b>84</b><i>a</i>, above an oval hole <b>84</b><i>b</i>. This oval hole <b>84</b><i>b </i>permits the drop-in piece <b>106</b>, with its top bolt <b>85</b>, with fixed protrusion <b>86</b>, to move sideways for alignment. The bottom bolt <b>85</b>, secures this drop-in piece <b>106</b> to the stem restraining collar <b>60</b> and steerer tube <b>111</b> when the alignment is correct. This drop-in piece <b>106</b>, with its extension area <b>107</b>, drops in front opening <b>109</b>, and hooks onto the back opening area <b>108</b>, so it does not slide outward, where both collar openings have horizontal movement space to permit sideward motion of the drop-in piece <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0169">All embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 15D</figref>, show interior mounted, manually height adjustable stem steering assemblies. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 20B</figref> show another preferred embodiment using non-height adjustable exterior stems which are mounted to the steerer tube by clamping or fastening to the outside of the steerer tube. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-C</figref> and <b>17</b> use vertical axial pressure to secure the stem in the rideable position. These embodiments also are shown not using the standard quick release found in many other configurations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> is an expanded perspective of a steering assembly using a fixed height external stem collar <b>30</b>, which fits directly onto a threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, which is threaded at the top <b>119</b><i>a</i>. Rotation of the stem is accomplished by manually loosening the top threaded locking collar <b>32</b>, with interior threading <b>34</b>, thereby removing the downward forces that hold external stem collar <b>30</b> in place, then pulling upward on the horizontal section of the stem <b>2</b>, which raises the external stem collar <b>30</b>, lifting its notch <b>31</b>, off the lower raised bump <b>141</b>, on the fixed threadless locking collar <b>120</b>. Fixed threadless locking collar <b>120</b> is squeezed onto the threadless section of the steerer tube <b>110</b>, with locking bolt <b>122</b>, permitting threadless locking collar <b>120</b> to maintain headset pressure and be aligned. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the stem collars top edge <b>33</b><i>a</i>, and its bottom edge <b>33</b><i>b </i>are both beveled laterally and are married into the corresponding beveled edges <b>33</b> of the top threaded locking collar <b>32</b> and the beveled edge <b>33</b><i>c</i>, on the bottom locking threadless collar <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0170">Not shown for simplicity is another notch <b>31</b> which holds the stem in the rotated position and allows the handlebar stem to be used to steer the bicycle a short distance into a parking location. It is possible that the steering assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> could be retrofitted onto existing bicycles in some situations. It should be noted that no quick release lever is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. Setting the bearings pressure is done simply by releasing locking bolt <b>122</b>, then tightening top threaded locking collar <b>32</b> until the headset is adjusted properly, then tightening locking bolt <b>122</b> for riding. Alignment is accomplished by simply rotating locking threadless collar <b>120</b>. If a completely threaded steerer tube is used, then locking threadless collar <b>120</b> is threaded on its inner surface and external stem collar <b>30</b> is made with a slightly larger inner diameter. Adjustable tilt arm <b>14</b> is shown in situations where an angle adjustable stem is required rotating about bolt <b>18</b>. Lower raised bump <b>141</b> is shown on the side, however it could easily be in the front or back, or be replaced by multiple notches or teeth that have corresponding members on the locking threadless collar <b>120</b>. Various shapes of teeth could also be used. The top threaded locking collar could be equipped with an additional flip out lever to increase the moment arm of the rider when locking it. In addition, not shown for simplicity is a spring loaded protrusion, mounted on the outside of external stem collar <b>30</b> and poking through a hole to rest on steerer tube <b>110</b> in an area where steerer tube <b>110</b> had a bumpy surface, which would require that the spring loaded protrusion be continually activated by the rider in order to rotate the stem for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0171">Other modifications not shown include the top threaded locking collar being replaced by a quick release cam type collar with no major effect on the configuration. It is obvious to those skilled in the trade, that the threaded portion of the threadless steerer tube <b>110</b> could be replaced by a removable quill type threaded insert into a completely threadless steerer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows a steering assembly similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> except the top threaded locking nut <b>32</b><i>b </i>is integrally connected to inner bolt <b>142</b> which threads into the inside of a steerer tube which has a threaded inner surface <b>112</b><i>h</i>. The interior threading on a steerer tube <b>112</b><i>h </i>could be used to apply vertical pressure in any configuration where vertical pressure is required. It can also be used to apply vertical pressure to set the adjustment of the headset bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref> again shows a steering assembly similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> except notch <b>141</b> is replaced by an exterior shaped octagonal steerer tube <b>112</b><i>i </i>which rides against inner stem surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>and does not allow rotation unless top threaded locking nut <b>32</b><i>b </i>is loosened within the inner steerer tube threading <b>112</b><i>h</i>, and the external stem collar <b>30</b> is allowed to raise above the exterior shaped steerer tube <b>112</b><i>h</i>. More leverage can be achieved using lever arm <b>138</b> which raises out of slot <b>134</b> when used around axis <b>135</b>. Not shown but obvious to those skilled in the trade are any number of other cross sectional shapes or tracks replacing the octagonal shape. In addition, not shown for simplicity is an inner stem surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>which is round on the lower part and shaped on the upper part allowing rotation after raising the stem only part way off the shaped steerer tube shape <b>112</b><i>i</i>. In addition, steerer tube shape <b>112</b><i>i </i>could be round and threaded at the top allowing for a top threaded locking collar <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a steering assembly similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-C</figref>, except in this case the external stem collar <b>30</b> has an interior square truncated sloping pyramid shape <b>129</b> which fits onto a truncated shaped interior slotted collar <b>124</b>, with slot <b>125</b> and recessed bolts <b>122</b><i>a</i>, which in turn, is squeezed onto threadless steerer tube <b>110</b>, with top threaded area <b>119</b><i>a</i>. Again the top stem collar must be raised clear of the lower shape after the top threaded locking collar <b>32</b> is unscrewed in order for rotation to occur. Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the trade are any number of other cross sectional shapes or tracks, or serrated round surfaces that allow 90 degree rotation replacing the truncated square pyramid shape. Also not shown is a top threaded locking nut <b>32</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> with a threaded inner surface <b>112</b><i>h </i>on the steerer tube could also be used. Like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> could be retrofitted onto certain existing bicycles. Truncated shaped interior slotted collar <b>124</b> could also have an interior threaded surface if the steerer tube were completely threaded.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b>A-B, and <b>20</b>A-B show stem compression collars on exterior stems that are not height adjustable and are equipped with a primary locking system and a secondary safety lock. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a perspective of an exterior, fixed height, rotation, retrofitable, slotted compression stem <b>37</b>, with a threadless steerer tube and a standard star nut cap <b>42</b>. Rotation is accomplished by unlocking quick release lever <b>65</b>, pressing down on lever arm <b>40</b>, and rotating stem <b>2</b>. Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-C</figref> and <b>17</b>, the stem in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> does not need to move upward along the vertical steering axis direction in order to rotate since drop flange <b>39</b> is retractable. On the bottom of the collar is a notch <b>38</b>, but this time it works with the retractable drop flange <b>39</b>, activated by pushing down on the lever arm <b>40</b>, overcoming the lever spring <b>41</b>, on the lower threadless locking collar <b>120</b>. The star nut cap <b>42</b>, is tightened onto the collar with the star nut bolt <b>46</b>, connected to the star nut <b>49</b> (not shown), but backed off enough to let the collar rotate when the quick release <b>65</b>, is released. Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the art is a system where retractable drop flange <b>39</b> and notch <b>38</b> are reversed. Also not shown is a second storage notch. It could also be possible to fit retractable drop flange <b>39</b> into quick release compression slot <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> is a side vertical section having an upper slotted compression rotating stem <b>37</b>, similar to the stem shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> only this time, instead of having a secondary safety lock such as notch and locking flange <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, it has a interior rotation restraining device, projecting button <b>43</b>, with a beveled finger opening cut <b>44</b>, and an outward pushing spring <b>45</b>. Projecting button <b>43</b> restrains the stem from rotation by fastening it directly to the steerer tube as opposed to a collar as is the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In order to rotate for storage, quick release <b>65</b> is released, and projecting button <b>43</b> is depressed. Not shown is a second finger opening cut <b>44</b> for storage. Bearings <b>46</b><i>a </i>allow bolt <b>46</b> to rotate relative to the star nut cap <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> shows a top view horizontal section of a restraining button this time moved to the side of the slotted compression stem collar <b>37</b>, and activated indirectly by an outside button <b>48</b>, which pushes on the inside projecting button <b>43</b> when activated.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> is a expanded perspective and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> a side vertical cross-section A-A of a round slotted compression external stem <b>37</b>, similar to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b>A, and <b>19</b>B, again with an interior rotation restraining projecting button <b>43</b> only in this case a controlled spring <b>50</b> is used allowing only a minimum spring depression ensuring the restraining projecting button <b>43</b> stays within an interior rotation channel <b>47</b>, to prevent over-rotation and to prevent undesired vertical movement of the collar and to allow the protrusion to reach another opening cut <b>44</b>, used for storage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, section A-A illustrates the steerer tube and bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0179">In lieu of a star nut and problem solver as used before, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> uses two threaded interlocked collars <b>120</b>, and <b>120</b><i>a </i>where collar <b>120</b><i>a</i>, is locked with nuts <b>122</b>, then its exterior threaded surface <b>136</b>, turns against the interior threaded surface <b>137</b>, of threadless locking collar <b>120</b>, using wrench slot <b>123</b>, achieving the correct vertical pressure on the headset bearings <b>131</b>, and then it is locked with locking bolt <b>122</b>. This system of threaded interlocking collars can be used on any threadless steerer tube in this invention in order to set headset bearing adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0180">It is possible that manual rotation is required with tool adjustable height. This embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref> A-C, <b>22</b>A-B, and <b>23</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref> is a combined vertical cross-section A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> is a perspective of a quill-type, tool height adjustable, internal round stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, with a deep serrated top area <b>55</b>, held to the horizontal stem section <b>2</b>, with a dual dimensionally stable system having internal pressure cylinders <b>90</b><i>b</i>, connected together with stem through bolt <b>52</b>, and the cylinders having deep serrated areas <b>51</b>, which are pressed against the stem deep serrated area <b>55</b> to avoid rotation. At the bottom of the stem the quill <b>53</b>, holds the stem to the steerer tube with a quill bolt <b>54</b>. When quick release <b>65</b> is released, stem <b>2</b> is still not able to rotate because deep serrated area <b>55</b> is still interlocked with cylinders deep serrated areas <b>51</b>. When quick release <b>65</b> is rotated in a loosening manner or hand adjusted nut <b>67</b> is loosened, the two deep serrated surfaces release allowing for stem rotation. In this way, the quick release must be released, and a secondary action is required in order to allow for rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> shows an alternate option with a one sided dimensionally stable system where the bolt <b>52</b> is threaded directly into the stem <b>2</b> and there is only one internal pressure cylinder <b>90</b><i>b</i>. Shown also is a serrated area <b>56</b>, where the stem can be held in the storage position. This system could be retrofitted on any existing bicycle. It is clear that the internal pressure cylinders <b>90</b><i>b </i>could be located on the back side of steerer tube so that stem can be angle adjustable. In addition, these cylinders could be of the oblique variety. Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the art, is the use of the serrated rotation system found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, or in combination with any of the other manually height adjustable options. It could also be used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref> to allow for rotation of those embodiments. In addition, stem member <b>4</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-B</figref> could be replaced by a threadless steerer tube <b>110</b> where the top area of the steerer tube is deeply serrated corresponding to the serrated pressure cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0182">Another dimensionally stable, tool height adjustable stem is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> shows an expanded perspective and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> a vertical section A-A of a two piece quill-type, tool height adjustable, internal, round stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The stem has a pyramid shaped top <b>53</b><i>a</i>, having a top internal threaded area <b>35</b>, and which is allowed to rotate by unscrewing the top pressure nut <b>32</b><i>b</i>, with its lower threaded bolt area <b>32</b><i>a</i>, then lifting the external stem collar <b>30</b>, with its interior pyramid shape <b>129</b> so the stem can be rotated. This stem could be retrofitted onto any existing bicycle. It is steerable in the rotated position. Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the art are any number of other restraining shapes such as an octagon or serrated round or other shapes that allow a 90 degree rotation. Also not shown is the use of the shaped system found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-B</figref> in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, or in combination with any of the other manually height adjustable options. It could also be used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref> and <b>7</b>A-E to allow for rotation of those embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0183">All steering assemblies shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 22B</figref> have a primary locking system which fastens the stem to the steerer tube at, or concentric to, the steering axis. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-B</figref> and <b>24</b>A-E, the primary locking system is located in a position other than at the steering axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> is again a quill-type, tool height adjustable, internal two part, round stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, held with remote locking system, where the fastening bolt <b>57</b>, is held with a remote stem restraining arm <b>56</b>, either bolted or welded as shown to the vertical round section <b>4</b><i>b</i>, having a quill <b>53</b> at the bottom. When quick release <b>65</b> is released, bolt <b>57</b>, is then pushed down and the disk <b>57</b><i>a </i>can escape the multi-level box <b>59</b> allowing for rotation of the stem <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0184">A more complete overview of this system can be seen in the sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A-E</figref>. Spring <b>58</b> keeps disc <b>57</b><i>a </i>resting in an upward position and therefore disc <b>57</b><i>a </i>cannot exit multi-level box <b>59</b> unless spring <b>58</b> is compressed. Likewise, when rotating the handlebar stem to the riding position, disc <b>57</b><i>a </i>cannot enter multi-level box <b>59</b> unless spring <b>58</b> is compressed. In this way, the stem is always locked if it is in the riding position. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> is retrofittable on any existing bicycle. The height of the round stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>, can be set for a specific rider, then the stem horizontal section <b>2</b> can be rotated for storage and allowed to drop to the lowest position without loosing the tool height adjusted level of round stem <b>4</b><i>b</i>. When quick release <b>65</b> is locked and pulls the horizontal stem section <b>2</b> together with the remote stem restraining arm <b>56</b>, it removes any unwanted minute movement between stem section <b>2</b> and section <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0185">Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the art, is locating the remote fastening device on the rear or side of the steering axis allowing for the use of an angle adjustable horizontal stem member. Like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-B</figref>, the rotation system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> can be used in a number of other embodiments of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> shows an external stem which fastens to an internally mounted remote restraining arm while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> shows an internally mounted stem which fastens to an externally mounted remote securing arm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> shows a steering assembly very similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> except the stem is an external, non-height adjustable stem where stem horizontal section <b>2</b> is mounted directly to the outside of steerer tube <b>110</b>, and remote stem restraining arm <b>56</b> attaches to the inside of steerer tube <b>110</b> using a quill system. Stem horizontal section <b>2</b> is held between two locking collars <b>126</b> and <b>140</b>. Not shown but apparent to those skilled in the art is an assembly where remote stem restraining arm <b>56</b> fastens to the exterior of the steerer tube <b>110</b> in the form of a locking collar giving an assembly where an exterior stem and an exterior locking device are fastened using an offset fastening position.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> is a vertical cross-section of a remote secured, fixed height, internal stem system with a fastening bolt <b>57</b> having a bottom disk <b>57</b><i>a</i>, which must be depressed in order for it to clear the multi-level box <b>59</b> for stem rotation. In the riding position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> and front section A-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>), the stem horizontal section <b>2</b>, and the remote securing arm <b>56</b><i>a</i>, are squeezed together by the fastening bolt <b>57</b>. The views B-B, C-C and D-D illustrate various phases of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0188">When the quick release <b>65</b> is released, the bottom disk <b>57</b><i>a </i>remains trapped in the box as shown in side and top sections B-B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>), but when quick release <b>65</b> is pushed down, disk <b>57</b><i>a </i>drops down to an area where it can clear the box as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24D</figref> which also shows section C-C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24E</figref> includes section D-D with the disk <b>57</b><i>a </i>having moved outside the box <b>59</b>, and quick release <b>65</b> pushed back up by spring <b>58</b> whereby the disk <b>57</b><i>a </i>is unable to re-enter the box. In this figure the stem is rotated just far enough so that disk <b>57</b><i>a </i>is no longer in lock box <b>59</b>. For the rotated stem to go back to the riding position, the quick release <b>65</b> must be depressed again to allow disc <b>57</b><i>a </i>to re-enter box <b>59</b> and then quick release <b>65</b> must be tightened down. This acts as a safety feature so the bicycle can never be ridden in an unsecured manner. The assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A-E</figref> could be retrofitted onto some existing bicycles.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0189">All rotatable embodiments shown so far, have always rotated along the steering axis. It might be required that a steering assembly rotate for storage such that rotation occurs at a location other than the steering axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a perspective of a height adjustable, two part interior stem with a remote front pivot post <b>128</b>, held to a lower horizontal stem section <b>127</b> with lock box <b>59</b>, and to the upper horizontal stem section <b>2</b>. To rotate the stem, stem quick release <b>65</b> is released in the same manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-B</figref>, and <b>24</b>A-E. In order to adjust the height, collar <b>60</b> quick release <b>65</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0190">The assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> allows for a narrower profile when the steering assembly is rotated wherein the handlebars, in the rotated position, rest closer to the plane of the bicycle frame than they would if a steering axis rotation were used. Not shown but obvious to those skilled in the trade, the axis of rotation could be to the rear or sides of the steering axis depending on the desired storage position of the handlebar. Also not shown is an assembly where member <b>127</b> is exterior mounted onto the steerer tube for a non height adjustable assembly. Also not shown is the use of the rotation system found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, or in combination with any of the other manually height adjustable options. It could also be used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref> and <b>7</b>A-E to allow for rotation of those embodiments. Also not shown is an assembly where both fastening and rotation points are offset from the steering axis.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A-C</figref> show perspectives of a shaped stem <b>4</b> and a interior shaped <b>112</b><i>a </i>threadless steerer tube <b>110</b> which is squeezed with a compression stem restraining collar <b>60</b> onto the stem <b>4</b> in the same manner as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, however, in this case, the stem has a fold down capability. The stem <b>4</b> with front track <b>7</b>, connected to an angled sloping downward track <b>11</b>, which travels approximately 110 degrees on rotation area <b>5</b> and then turns downward continuing onto a lower vertical track <b>74</b> on the stem lower portion <b>79</b>, has two side flanges <b>77</b>, and a cut away area <b>78</b> to house the upper flange <b>76</b>, and pivots about the fold-down rotation point <b>75</b>. Perspectives show the stem in the riding and in the fold down position so the handlebar would be set parallel to the ground. The collar, steerer tube and headset are the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When folded down for storage fixed protrusion <b>86</b> encounters the end of track <b>74</b> and therefore lower stem portion <b>79</b> is not allowed to exit the threadless steerer tube <b>110</b> and the bicycle is steerable using the folded down handlebars for rolling into a storage location. Not shown for simplicity is a similar stem where the sloping downward track <b>11</b> is located on lower stem portion <b>79</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0192">Not shown, but apparent to those skilled in the art are many other combinations of stem/steerer tube shapes as well as a spring loaded protrusion and vertical movement track which would not allow vertical movement without continually activating a button. Also not shown are a wide variety of hinge configurations.</p>
