<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-360999 filed on Oct. 21, 2003 including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is related to an internal combustion engine capable of reforming and recycling a portion of fuel included in exhaust gas from a combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are known internal combustion engines that are provided with a reformer (catalyst device) within an exhaust passage, which includes a passage in which exhaust gas flows and a reforming catalyst disposed so as to be heated by exhaust gas flowing through the passage (refer to Japanese Patent Publication No. 60-37310 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-35375 for examples). In this type of internal combustion engine, fuel is mixed into a portion of exhaust gas taken from the exhaust passage downstream from the reformer. The mixture is delivered into the reforming catalyst which is heated using heat of exhaust gas in the aforementioned passage. Moreover, an endothermic reforming reaction using heat from the exhaust gas is advanced in the reforming catalyst to create a reformed fuel including hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The reformed fuel obtained is then supplied as fuel to an air intake system and reused.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, there is also a known natural gas reforming engine system that reforms reforming source gas such as natural gas and supplies the reformed gas to the engine, and uses a portion of exhaust gas as additive gas for reforming source gas (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-98010 for an example). In such an engine system, a heat exchanger for heating source gas and a gas reformer are disposed in this order from the upstream side of a fuel supply passage that connects a source gas supply and the engine. Furthermore, the gas reformer is provided in an exhaust passage of the engine in order to use heat of engine exhaust gas as a heat source. Therefore, a portion of exhaust gas is taken from the exhaust passage downstream from the gas reformer in this system, and this exhaust gas is mixed into source gas via an exhaust branch passage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in internal combustion engines such as described above, exhaust gas to be mixed with fuel or source gas is taken from the vicinity of the farthest downstream portion of the exhaust passage. Thus, when the amount of residual fuel in the exhaust gas is increased in order to increase the amount of fuel fed to the gas reformer, this leads to a corresponding increase in the amount of unreformed fuel released to the atmosphere.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the invention to provide an internal combustion engine capable of efficiently reforming and effectively recycling a portion of fuel included in exhaust gas from a combustion chamber, and thoroughly suppress the release of fuel in the exhaust gas to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the invention relates to an internal combustion engine capable of reforming and recycling a portion of fuel included in the exhaust gas from the combustion chamber. Such an internal combustion engine includes an exhaust passage where exhaust gas from the combustion chamber flows; a reformer that has a reforming reaction chamber including a fuel reforming catalyst for the fuel of the exhaust gas; a branch passage that branches from the exhaust passage at a branch portion provided upstream from the reformer, and directs exhaust gas to the reforming reaction chamber; and a fuel removal portion that removes the fuel, which is provided downstream from the branch portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the internal combustion engine, the reformer with the reforming reaction chamber including the fuel reforming catalyst is disposed in the exhaust passage. Exhaust gas taken from the exhaust passage at the branch portion provided upstream from the reformer is directed to the reforming reaction chamber via the branch passage. Thus, the fuel included in the flowing exhaust gas is reformed in the reforming reaction chamber. The reformed fuel obtained can then be supplied to an air intake system as fuel again. In contrast, fuel in the exhaust gas not flowing from the exhaust passage to the branch passage is removed by the fuel removal portion provided downstream from the branch portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in the internal combustion engine, exhaust gas flowing to the reforming reaction chamber is taken from the exhaust passage at the branch portion provided upstream from the fuel removal portion. Therefore, it is possible to supply exhaust gas including the fuel to the reforming reaction chamber, and then efficiently reform and effectively recycle the fuel included in the exhaust gas. Furthermore, the fuel in the exhaust gas heading from the branch portion to the reformer is removed by the fuel removal portion provided downstream from the branch portion. Therefore, the release of fuel in the exhaust gas to the atmosphere is effectively suppressed.</p>

Moreover, a fuel reforming catalyst <b>16</b> such as Co, Ni or Rh, is disposed in the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A branch passage <b>8</b> branches from the exhaust passage <b>7</b> at a branch portion BP provided upstream from the reformer <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the branch pipe <b>8</b> is connected to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>, thus allowing exhaust gas to be taken from the exhaust passage <b>7</b> and supplied to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b>. Furthermore, an end of a reformed fuel return passage <b>9</b> is connected to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>. The reformed fuel return passage <b>9</b> has flow control valve FCV situated partway, and another end that is connected to the intake passage <b>6</b> downstream from the throttle valve TV.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A secondary air supplier AI, such as an air pump, is connected to the exhaust passage <b>7</b> at a point downstream from the branch portion BP and upstream from the reformer <b>10</b> (a portion of the exhaust passage <b>7</b> between the branch portion BP and the reformer <b>10</b> will hereinafter be described as a main exhaust passage <b>30</b>). Operating the secondary air supplier AI allows the supply of air (oxygen) to the heat medium passage <b>14</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>. In addition, an exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> such as a platinum catalyst or the like is adhered (laminated) on an outer surface (surface on the heat medium passage <b>14</b> side) of the wall <b>12</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>. The secondary air supplier AI and the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> disposed on the heat medium passage <b>14</b> of the reformer <b>10</b> function as fuel removal means positioned downstream from the branch portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, the internal combustion engine <b>1</b> is provided with an electronic control unit (hereinafter referred to as ECU) <b>20</b> that functions as control means. The ECU <b>20</b> includes a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, input and output ports, and a storage device (all not shown), which stores various data, maps and the like. Connected to the input and output ports of the ECU <b>20</b> are the fuel injection valves <b>5</b>, the throttle valve TV, the flow control valve FCV, and the secondary air supplier AI. In addition, the valve train for opening and closing the intake valves Vi and the exhaust valves Ve, as well as various types of sensors are also connected to the input and output ports of the ECU <b>20</b>. The ECU <b>20</b> controls a fuel injection amount and the like from the fuel injection valves <b>5</b> provided at each combustion chamber <b>2</b>, based upon detection values or the like from various sensors, in addition to using various maps or the like stored in the storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The reform and reuse of fuel in exhaust gas in the internal combustion engine <b>1</b> structured such as described above will be described next. While the internal combustion engine <b>1</b> is operating, the exhaust gas taken from the exhaust passage <b>7</b> at the branch portion BP (provided upstream from the reformer <b>10</b>) is introduced via the branch passage <b>8</b> to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>. In the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>, a reforming reaction (endothermic reaction) such as that shown in equation (1) below is advanced using heat from the exhaust gas flowing through the inside of the heat medium passage <b>14</b>.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>1.56(7.6CO<sub>2</sub>+6.8H<sub>2</sub>O+40.8N<sub>2</sub>)+3C<sub>7.6</sub>H<sub>13.6</sub>+984.8 kcal→31H<sub>2</sub>+34.7CO+63.6N<sub>2</sub>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, fuel (for example, unburned fuel) within exhaust gas that flows from the exhaust passage <b>7</b> to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> via the branch passage <b>8</b> is reformed. As a result, a reformed fuel containing the fuel components H<sub>2 </sub>and CO is obtained. The reformed fuel obtained is supplied to the intake passage <b>6</b> via the reformed fuel return passage <b>9</b>, which is provided with the flow control valve FCV, and effectively reused.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">On the contrary, unburned fuel in the exhaust gas which does not flow from the exhaust passage <b>7</b> to the branch passage <b>8</b>, and instead heads toward the heating medium passage <b>14</b> of the reformer <b>10</b> is removed using the secondary air supplier AI and the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> provided downstream from the branch portion, and serve as the fuel removal means. In other words, air from the secondary air supplier AI is supplied to unburned fuel in the exhaust gas which flows to the heat medium passage <b>14</b> of the reformer <b>10</b> via the branch portion BP and the main exhaust passage <b>30</b>, and the unburned fuel then reacts with and is purified by the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> in the heat medium passage <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ECU <b>20</b> in the embodiment controls the secondary air supplier AI based upon an air-fuel ratio of a mixture in each combustion chamber <b>2</b>. That is, in the internal combustion engine <b>1</b>, the amount of air supplied to the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> is controlled according to the amount of fuel supplied (the air-fuel ratio control) to each combustion chamber <b>2</b>. As a result, the amount of air supplied from the secondary air supplier AI to the inside of the heat medium passage <b>14</b> is set with high precision, in order to remove unburned fuel in the exhaust gas flowing into the heat medium passage <b>14</b> of the reformer <b>10</b> via the branch portion BP and the main exhaust passage <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described above, in the internal combustion engine <b>1</b>, it is possible to increase the amount of reformed fuel obtained by the reformer <b>10</b> as needed, by changing the mixture of the air and fuel in each combustion chamber <b>2</b> to rich using the ECU <b>20</b>. In other words, leaving a considerable amount of unburned fuel in the exhaust gas from the combustion chambers <b>2</b> will result in the efficient reform and effective reuse of unburned fuel included in the exhaust gas from the combustion chambers <b>2</b> without an exclusive fuel supply mechanism which supplies fuel to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> of the reformer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, it is no longer necessary to provide an exclusive fuel supply mechanism (fuel injection valve) in the vicinity of the exhaust passage <b>7</b>, the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> or the like, whose temperature becomes high during operation of the internal combustion engine <b>1</b>. Therefore, the cost of the engine can be lowered and the engine itself simplified, in addition to improving reliability. Moreover, the need to consider cooling of the fuel supply mechanism and the decrease in energy efficiency is also eliminated. Furthermore, in the internal combustion engine <b>1</b>, exhaust gas flowing to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> is taken from the exhaust passage <b>7</b> at the branch point BP provided upstream from the secondary air supplier AI and the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b>, which serve as the fuel removal means. Consequently, it is possible to provide exhaust gas including a sufficient amount of unburned fuel to the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, unburned fuel in the exhaust gas flowing from the branch portion BP to the heat medium passage <b>14</b> of the reformer <b>10</b> via the main exhaust passage <b>30</b> is removed by the secondary air supplier AI and the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> provided downstream from the branch portion BP. As a result, in the internal combustion engine <b>1</b>, it is thus possible to purify unburned fuel in the exhaust gas well, thereby thoroughly suppressing the release of unburned fuel to the atmosphere. The temperature of the reforming reaction chamber <b>15</b> can also be increased using heat generated by the reaction in the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b> in the internal combustion engine <b>1</b> provided with the secondary air supplier AI and the exhaust purification catalyst <b>17</b>, which serve as the fuel removal means. This results in highly satisfactory acceleration of the above-mentioned reforming reaction expressed by equation (1) in the fuel reforming catalyst <b>16</b>.</p>
