<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention pertains to a foundation for a mattress in which the height of the foundation can be adjusted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A mattress foundation is an integral part of most beds. The foundation serves to distribute loads applied to the mattress which, in turn, can make the mattress feel more comfortable and prolong its life relative to a mattress that is not supported by a foundation. While the mattress foundation serves these important purposes, existing foundations suffer from several limitations inherent to their design.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, assembled foundations often occupy a rather large volume, much of which is empty space unoccupied by the springs or frame members that provide structure to the foundation. Thus, when the assembled foundations are shipped to distributors or customers, much of the âfreightâ that is hauled from the manufacturer is actually just air. This waste decreases the number of assembled foundations that can be shipped using a finite capacity and, accordingly, the cost associated with this finite shipping capacity is spread among fewer foundations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, typical mattress foundations are made from fixed frames whose dimensions cannot be adjusted. Therefore, the height of the foundation, which will impact the overall height of the bed (i.e., stacked mattress and foundation), cannot be adjusted. However, customers may wish, for various aesthetic and functional considerations, to have the ability to select from a number of different bed heights. In order to provide this option using typical mattress foundations, the manufacturer must produce and the distributor or retailer must stock several different foundations, each having a different height, for a given bed. The increased/custom manufacturing capacity and increased inventory necessary to provide this option to consumers would further increase the cost of each foundation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need therefore exits for a mattress foundation that can be provided at different heights, thereby permitting the overall height of a bed utilizing the foundation to be varied. A need also remains for a mattress foundation whose overall volume can be reduced during shipping, thereby permitting more foundations to be shipped using a finite capacity. The invention provides such a mattress foundation. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides a foundation for a mattress. The foundation comprises (a) a lower frame having a top, a bottom, a perimeter, and one or more lower frame members disposed around at least a portion of the perimeter of the lower frame, (b) an upper frame having a top, a bottom, a perimeter, and one or more upper frame members disposed around at least a portion of the perimeter of the upper frame, and (c) a plurality of movable supports attached to one or more of the lower frame member and the upper frame member. The movable supports are adapted to maintain the upper frame and the lower frame in spaced apart relation and to permit vertical movement of the upper frame into a plurality of spaced apart relations relative to the lower frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The upper and lower frames can have any suitable configuration. For example, the upper and lower frames can be substantially rectangular in shape. In such an embodiment, the foundation preferably comprises at least four movable supports, one of which is disposed in each corner of the upper frame or the lower frame.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the movable supports comprise a support member and a receiving member. The receiving member is attached to the lower frame member and/or the upper frame member and is adapted to receive the support member and restrict lateral movement of the support member relative to the upper frame and the lower frame. The support member can have any suitable configuration. However, in a preferred embodiment, the support member is substantially rectangular in shape and has a length, a width, and a height, all of which are unequal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the support member comprises a top surface, a bottom surface, a recess in the bottom surface, and a key disposed on the top surface thereof. The receiving member comprises an upper receiving member attached to the upper frame member and a lower receiving member attached to the lower frame member, the upper receiving member comprising a recess adapted to receive the key disposed on the top surface of the support member, and the lower receiving member comprises a second key adapted to communicate with the recess in the bottom surface of the support member. Alternatively, the recess can be disposed on the top surface of the support member and the key can be disposed on the bottom surface of the support member. In such an embodiment, the lower receiving member comprises a recess disposed on the bottom surface of the support member, and the upper receiving member comprises a key adapted to communicate with the recess in the top surface of the support member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, each movable support can comprise a plurality of support members, an upper receiving member attached to the upper frame member, and a lower receiving member attached to the lower frame member. Each support member comprises a top surface, a bottom surface, a recess in the bottom surface thereof, and a key disposed on the top surface thereof. The upper receiving member comprises a recess adapted to receive the key disposed on the top surface of one of the support members, and the lower receiving member comprises a second key adapted to communicate with the recess in the bottom surface of one of the support members. Alternatively, each support member can comprise a recess in the top surface thereof, and a key disposed on the bottom surface thereof. In such an embodiment, the lower receiving member comprises a recess adapted to receive the key disposed on the bottom surface of one of the support members, and the upper receiving member comprises a second key adapted to communicate with the recess in the top surface of one of the support members.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, the support member can comprise a substantially circular post having a circumference and a helical thread disposed around the circumference of the post. In such an embodiment, the receiving member comprises a sleeve adapted to receive the post, the sleeve comprising a helical thread disposed around the circumference of its inner surface. In this embodiment, one of the sleeve or post is rotatably mounted to the upper frame member or the lower frame member. Thus, as the post or sleeve is rotated, the vertical distance between the upper and lower frames can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the movable supports comprise a post, a sleeve adapted to receive the post, and a pin. The post has at least one hole through the distal end thereof, and the sleeve has a plurality of aligned holes disposed along its length. The pin is adapted to pass through at least one of the holes in the sleeve and the hole in the post.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the movable supports comprise a support member comprising an arm and a receiving member adapted to receive a pin attached to the distal end of the arm. In particular, the support member comprises an arm having a pin attached to its distal end and is pivotally attached to the upper frame member or the lower frame member at its proximal end. The receiving member comprises a plurality of recesses disposed along its length, and the recesses are adapted to receive the pin attached to the arm of the support member. Thus, as the arm is pivoted with respect to the frame member, the pin on the distal end of the arm can be set into a different recess on the receiving member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the foundation can comprise a cover that masks the frames and movable supports from view. In particular, the cover has a top portion and a side portion, the top portion of the cover rests on the top of the upper frame, and the side portion of the cover extends around at least a portion of the perimeter of the upper frame. The cover can further comprise a bottom portion having a perimeter and a resilient material attached to a least a portion of the perimeter of the bottom portion of the cover. In such an embodiment, the side portion of the cover extends around at least a portion of the perimeter of the lower frame, and the bottom portion of the cover contacts the bottom of the lower frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As noted above, the invention provides a foundation for a mattress. The foundation is adapted to permit adjustment of its overall height, thereby permitting the distance between the upper surface of a mattress resting on the foundation and the surface on which the foundation rests (e.g., a floor or a bed frame) to be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the foundation <b>100</b> comprises a lower frame <b>102</b>, an upper frame <b>104</b>, and a plurality of movable supports <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> attached to the lower frame <b>102</b> or the upper frame <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the lower frame <b>102</b> has a top <b>112</b>, a bottom <b>114</b>, a perimeter, and one or more lower frame members <b>118</b> disposed around at least a portion of the perimeter of the lower frame <b>102</b>. The upper frame <b>104</b> also has a top <b>120</b>, a bottom <b>122</b>, a perimeter, and one or more upper frame members <b>126</b> disposed around at least a portion of the perimeter of the upper frame <b>104</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the movable supports <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> are attached to the lower frame member <b>118</b>; however, the movable supports can be attached to the upper frame member or both the upper frame member and the lower frame member. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the means of attaching the movable supports to the frame member(s) should not interfere with the movement of the movable supports necessary to permit vertical movement of the upper frame relative to the lower frame.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The upper and lower frames can have any suitable configuration. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the upper frame <b>104</b> and the lower frame <b>102</b> can be substantially rectangular in shape. In such an embodiment, the foundation <b>100</b> preferably comprises at least four movable supports <b>107</b>, with one of the four movable supports <b>107</b> disposed in each corner of the upper frame <b>104</b> or the lower frame <b>102</b>. The upper and lower frames can be made from any suitable material(s). For example, the upper and lower frames can be made from wood (e.g., pine, maple, oak, etc.) or from metal (e.g., steel, aluminum, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the movable supports <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> can comprise a support member <b>128</b>, <b>132</b> and at least one receiving member <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>. The receiving member <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> is attached to one of the lower frame member <b>118</b> and the upper frame member <b>126</b> and is adapted to receive the support member <b>128</b>, <b>132</b> and restrict lateral movement of the support member <b>128</b>, <b>132</b> relative to the upper frame <b>104</b> and the lower frame <b>102</b>. The support member can have any suitable configuration. For example, support member can be substantially rectangular in shape. Such an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where the support member <b>128</b> is substantially rectangular in shape and has a length, a width, and a height, all of which are unequal. In such an embodiment, the height of the upper frame <b>104</b> relative to the lower frame <b>102</b> can be adjusted between one of three predetermined heights based on the orientation of the support member <b>128</b> within the foundation <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the support member can have a substantially triangular cross section when viewed from the top of the support member (i.e., from a direction that is parallel to the height of the support member). Such an embodiment is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where the support member <b>132</b> has a substantially triangular cross section. A support member having this configuration is particularly well suited for placement in the corners of substantially rectangular upper and lower frames.</p>
