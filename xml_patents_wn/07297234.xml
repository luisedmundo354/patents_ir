<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/334,249, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,022,208, filed Dec. 31, 2002 entitled “Methods for Bonding Structural Elements of Paper Machine and Industrial Fabrics to One Another and Fabrics Produced Thereby”, the enclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates, in part, to the papermaking arts, and specifically to the fabrics, commonly referred to as paper machine clothing, on which paper is manufactured on paper machines. The present invention also relates to the manufacture of nonwoven articles and products by processes such as hydroentanglement, and specifically to the so-called industrial fabrics on which such articles are manufactured. More specifically still, the present invention concerns the bonding of structural elements, such as individual yarns or separate layers, of such fabrics to one another by methods in which polymeric resin materials are used as bonding agents and are deposited in a highly controlled and precise manner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During the papermaking process, a cellulosic fibrous web is formed by depositing a fibrous slurry, that is, an aqueous dispersion of cellulose fibers, onto a moving forming fabric in the forming section of a paper machine. A large amount of water is drained from the slurry through the forming fabric, leaving the cellulosic fibrous web on the surface of the forming fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The newly formed cellulosic fibrous web proceeds from the forming section to a press section, which includes a series of press nips. The cellulosic fibrous web passes through the press nips supported by a press fabric, or, as is often the case, between two such press fabrics. In the press nips, the cellulosic fibrous web is subjected to compressive forces which squeeze water therefrom, and which adhere the cellulosic fibers in the web to one another to turn the cellulosic fibrous web into a paper sheet. The water is accepted by the press fabric or fabrics and, ideally, does not return to the paper sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The paper sheet finally proceeds to a dryer section, which includes at least one series of rotatable dryer drums or cylinders, which are internally heated by steam. The newly formed paper sheet is directed in a serpentine path sequentially around each in the series of drums by a dryer fabric, which holds the paper sheet closely against the surfaces of the drums. The heated drums reduce the water content of the paper sheet to a desirable level through evaporation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It should be appreciated that the forming, press and dryer fabrics all take the form of endless loops on the paper machine and function in the manner of conveyors. It should further be appreciated that paper manufacture is a continuous process which proceeds at considerable speeds. That is to say, the fibrous slurry is continuously deposited onto the forming fabric in the forming section, while a newly manufactured paper sheet is continuously wound onto rolls after it exits from the dryer section.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Contemporary fabrics are produced in a wide variety of styles designed to meet the requirements of the paper machines on which they are installed for the paper grades being manufactured. Generally, they comprise a woven or other type base fabric. Additionally, as in the case of fabrics used in the press section, the press fabrics have one or more base fabrics into which has been needled a batt of fine, nonwoven fibrous material. The base fabrics may be woven from monofilament, plied monofilament, multifilament or plied multifilament yarns, and may be single-layered, multi-layered or laminated. The yarns are typically extruded from any one of the synthetic polymeric resins, such as polyamide and polyester resins, used for this purpose by those of ordinary skill in the paper machine clothing arts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The woven base fabrics themselves take many different forms. For example, they may be woven endless, or flat woven and subsequently rendered into endless form with a woven seam. Alternatively, they may be produced by a process commonly known as modified endless weaving, wherein the widthwise edges of the base fabric are provided with seaming loops using the machine-direction (MD) yarns thereof. In this process, the MD yarns weave continuously back-and-forth between the widthwise edges of the fabric, at each edge turning back and forming a seaming loop. A base fabric produced in this fashion is placed into endless form during installation on a paper machine, and for this reason is referred to as an on-machine-seamable fabric. To place such a fabric into endless form, the two widthwise edges are brought together, the seaming loops at the two edges are interdigitated with one another, and a seaming pin or pintle is directed through the passage formed by the interdigitated seaming loops.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the base fabrics may be laminated by placing at least one base fabric within the endless loop formed by another, and by typically needling a staple fiber batt through these base fabrics to join them to one another as in the case of press fabrics. One or more of these woven base fabrics may be of the on-machine-seamable type. This is now a well known laminated press fabric with a multiple base support structure. In any event, the fabrics are in the form of endless loops, or are seamable into such forms, having a specific length, measured longitudinally therearound, and a specific width, measured transversely thereacross. Also disclosed are “subassemblies” of various materials which are then spiraled or laid up in parallel strips to form substrates for press fabrics; the subassemblies are formed by techniques including lamination.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Turning now to industrial process belts, laminated structures are known in the textile industry. Lamination techniques are also used to form roll covers used in papermaking. One prior art belt is composed only of nonwoven fibrous material as the substrate. Also previously disclosed are laminated nonwovens for use as press fabrics with each layer has different properties such as hydrophobicity, and multiple extruded sheets as support structures for belts. Another prior patent teaches spirally winding strips of various types of materials to form a support structure for a belt. The prior art also teaches a substrate of expanded film, and narrow composite “tapes”. Additional prior art includes the following:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 3,042,568 shows a method and apparatus for the manufacture of laminated fabric belting. A heating chamber and pressure rollers are used to bond a plurality of lengths of plastic-coated fabric into a laminated unitary belt;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 3,673,023 shows a process for producing a reinforced laminate for use in belts where high tensile strength is required. The belts are made by laying helically wound, continuous reinforcing cords in what is essentially a screw thread or threads extending between the lateral margins of a base. The belt is finished by a top ply laid over the wound carcass, which is then cured with heat and pressure to form a consolidated belt structure;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,543 shows a composite laminate. The laminate comprises a hot-melt-type thermoplastic material and a textile woven fabric material formed of spun yarns constructed primarily of staple fibers. They are combined with each other using heat and pressure to form a belt; and</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. Pat. No. 5,240,531 shows an endless conveyor belt consisting of a core member and an elastic laminate layer. The layers are together passed through a pressing apparatus that bonds them together through the use of heat and pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the case of many applications, including woven fabrics, fabrics produced by spirally winding a strip of woven or knitted fabric (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,656 to Rexfelt), laminated fabrics all require some mechanism for either keeping the yarns in place or for joining the fabric together. Typically heretofor needling of staple fiber through a multilayer fabric was utilized to keep it together. Other methods as aforenoted were utilized such as bonding or welding.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides another approach towards bonding and providing dimensional stability to fabrics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, the present invention may find application in any of the fabrics used in the forming, pressing and drying sections of a paper machine, and in the industrial fabrics used in the manufacture of nonwoven products. As such, the papermaker's or industrial fabric comprises a base substrate which takes the form of an endless loop. In one embodiment, a plurality of discrete, discontinuous deposits of polymeric resin material are disposed at the crossover points or locations of the yarns in the fabric. These deposits bond the yarns together at these points and provide dimensional stability to the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The preselected locations for the discrete, discontinuous deposits of polymeric resin material may be where the yarns in one direction of the fabric pass over or under the yarns in the other direction. Bonding can take place at all or just some of the crossover points.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, preselected locations may be used to join adjacent steps of spiral wound fabric strip to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a third embodiment, the preselected locations for the bonding resin are knuckles formed by crossover yarns or other locations which will allow upon heating or other activating means to bond additional layers to the base fabric to create a laminate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As stated above, in a first embodiment of the present invention, the yarns in a woven paper machine or industrial fabric are bonded to one another at their crossing points. Typically, the fabric, which may be a base substrate for a coated belt or some other item of paper machine clothing and which may be of an open weave in which the yarns would tend to shift from their intended positions unless bonded to one another in accordance with the present invention, is woven from monofilament yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">More broadly, however, the fabric may be a woven, nonwoven, spiral-link, MD or CD yarn arrays, or knitted fabric comprising yarns of any of the varieties used in the production of paper machine clothing or of the industrial fabrics used to manufacture nonwoven articles and products, such as monofilament, plied monofilament, multifilament and plied multifilament yarns. These yarns may be obtained by extrusion from any of the polymeric resin materials used for this purpose by those of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, resins from the families of polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, polyaramid, polyolefin and other resins may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, the fabric may be produced by spirally winding a strip of woven, knitted or other material in accordance with the methods shown in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,656 to Rexfelt et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The fabric may accordingly comprise a spirally wound strip, wherein each spiral turn is joined to the next by a continuous seam making the fabric endless in a longitudinal direction. The joining of the spiral turns to one another may be accomplished in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention to be discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The above should not be considered to be the only possible forms for the fabric. Any of the varieties of fabric used by those of ordinary skill in the paper machine clothing and related arts may alternatively be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Whatever the specific form of the fabric, it is mounted on the apparatus <b>10</b> shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that polymeric resin material may be deposited onto the points where its yarns cross one another in either a woven structure or nonwoven structure such as an MD or CD yarn array, in accordance with this first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be understood that the fabric may be either endless or seamable into endless form during installation on a paper machine. As such, the fabric <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> should be understood to be a relatively short portion of the entire length of the fabric. Where the fabric <b>12</b> is endless, it would most practically be mounted about a pair of rolls, not illustrated in the figure but most familiar to those of ordinary skill in the paper machine clothing arts. In such a situation, apparatus <b>10</b> would be disposed on one of the two runs, most conveniently the top run, of the fabric <b>12</b> between the two roll. Whether endless or not, however, the fabric <b>12</b> is preferably placed under an appropriate degree of tension during the process. Moreover, to prevent sagging, the fabric <b>12</b> may be supported from below by a horizontal support member as it moves through apparatus <b>10</b>. It should finally be observed that, where the fabric <b>12</b> is endless, it may be desirable to invert it, that is, to turn it inside out, following the application of polymeric resin material in accordance with this first embodiment of the present invention to place the polymeric resin material on the backside of the fabric <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the fabric <b>12</b> is indicated as moving in an upward direction through the apparatus <b>10</b> as the method of this first embodiment of the present invention is being carried out, apparatus <b>10</b> comprises a sequence of several stations through which the fabric <b>12</b> may pass incrementally.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The stations are identified as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0039">1. optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0040">2. imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0041">3. optional setting station <b>36</b>; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0042">4. optional grinding station <b>44</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">In the first station, the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>, a piezojet array <b>16</b> mounted on transverse rails <b>18</b>,<b>20</b> and translatable thereon in a direction transverse to that of the motion of the fabric <b>12</b> through the apparatus <b>10</b>, as well as therebetween in a direction parallel to that of the motion of the fabric <b>12</b>, may be used to deposit a polymeric resin material in a repetitive fashion if necessary to provide the proper bonding onto or within the fabric <b>12</b> while the fabric <b>12</b> is at rest. Optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b> may be used to deposit the polymeric resin material more uniformly over the fabric <b>12</b> than could be accomplished using conventional techniques, such as spraying, if desired. It should be understood, however, that the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b> would apply the polymeric resin material indiscriminately to both the yarns of the fabric <b>12</b> and to the spaces or interstices between the yarns. This may not be desired in all applications and, as such, the use of polymer deposition station <b>14</b> is optional in this and other embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">However, for the sake of completeness, the piezojet array <b>16</b> comprises at least one but preferably a plurality of individual computer controlled piezojets, each functioning as a pump whose active component is a piezoelectric element. As a practical matter, an array of up to 256 piezojets or more may be utilized, if the technology permits. The active component is a crystal or ceramic which is physically deformed by an applied electric signal. This deformation enables the crystal or ceramic to function as a pump, which physically ejects a drop of a liquid material each time an appropriate electric signal is received. As such, this method of using piezojets to supply drops of a desired material in response to computer controlled electric signals is commonly referred to as a “drop-on-demand” method.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the piezojet array <b>16</b>, starting from an edge of the fabric <b>12</b>, or, preferably, from a reference thread extending lengthwise therein, translates lengthwise and widthwise across the fabric <b>12</b>, while the fabric <b>12</b> is at rest, deposits the polymeric resin material in the form of extremely small droplets having a nominal diameter of 10μ (10 microns) or more, such as 50μ (50 microns), or 100μ (100 microns), onto the fabric <b>12</b>. The translation of the piezojet array <b>16</b> lengthwise and widthwise relative to the fabric <b>12</b>, and the deposition of droplets of the polymeric resin material from each piezojet in the array <b>16</b>, are controlled by computer to apply a desired amount of the polymeric resin material per unit area of the fabric <b>12</b>, if desired. In addition, the deposit of the material need not only be traversing the movement of the base substrate but can be parallel to such movement, spiral to such movement or in any other manner suitable for the purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">In the present invention, in which a piezojet array is used to deposit a polymeric resin material onto or within the surface of the fabric base substrate <b>12</b>, the choice of polymeric resin material is limited by the requirement that its viscosity be 100 cps (100 centipoise) or less at the time of delivery, that is, when the polymeric resin material is in the nozzle of a piezojet ready for deposition, so that the individual piezojets can provide the polymeric resin material at a constant drop delivery rate. A second requirement limiting the choice of polymeric resin material is that it must partially set during its fall, as a drop, from a piezojet to the fabric <b>12</b>, or after it lands on the fabric <b>12</b>, to prevent the polymeric resin material from flowing and to maintain control over the polymeric resin material to ensure that it remains in the form of a drop where it lands on the fabric <b>12</b>. Suitable polymeric resin materials which meet these criteria are</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">1. Hot melts and moisture-cured hot melts;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">2. Two-part reactive systems based on urethanes and epoxies;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">3. Photopolymer compositions consisting of reactive acrylated monomers and acrylated oligomers derived from urethanes, polyesters, polyethers, and silicones; and</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">4. Aqueous-based latexes and dispersions and particle-filled formulations including acrylics and polyurethanes.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">It should be understood that the polymeric resin material needs to be fixed on or within the fabric <b>12</b> following its deposition thereon. The means by which the polymeric resin material is set or fixed depends on its own physical and/or chemical requirements. Photopolymers are cured with light, whereas hot-melt materials are set by cooling. Aqueous-based latexes and dispersions are dried and then cured with heat, and reactive systems are cured by heat. Accordingly, the polymeric resin materials may be set by curing, cooling, drying or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The proper fixing of the polymeric resin material is required to control its penetration into and distribution within the fabric <b>12</b>, that is, to control and confine the material within the desired volume of the fabric <b>12</b>. Such control is important below the surface plane of the fabric <b>12</b> to prevent wicking and spreading. Such control may be exercised, for example, by maintaining the fabric <b>12</b> at a temperature which will cause the polymeric resin material to set quickly upon contact. Control may also be exercised by using such materials having well-known or well-defined curing or reaction times on fabrics having a degree of openness such that the polymeric resin material will set before it has time to spread beyond the desired volume of the fabric <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">The degree of precision of the jet in depositing the material will depend upon the dimensions and amount of the material being deposited. The type of jet used and the viscosity of the material being applied will also impact the precision of the jet selected.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">When any desired amount of polymeric resin material has been applied per unit area in a band between the transverse rails <b>18</b>,<b>20</b> across the fabric <b>12</b>, if any, the fabric <b>12</b> is advanced lengthwise an amount equal to the width of the band, and the procedure described above is repeated to apply the polymeric resin material in a new band adjacent to that previously completed. In this repetitive manner, the entire fabric <b>12</b> can be provided with any desired amount of polymeric resin material per unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">One or more passes over the base substrate <b>12</b> may be made by piezojet array <b>16</b> to deposit the desired amount of material and to create the desired bond.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">Alternatively, the piezojet array <b>16</b>, again starting from an edge of the fabric <b>12</b>, or, preferably, from a reference thread extending lengthwise therein, is kept in a fixed position relative to the transverse rails <b>18</b>,<b>20</b>, while the fabric <b>12</b> moves beneath it, to apply any desired amount of the polymeric resin material per unit area repetitively so as to provide bonding in a lengthwise strip around the fabric <b>12</b>. Upon completion of the lengthwise strip, the piezojet array <b>16</b> is moved widthwise on transverse rails <b>18</b>,<b>20</b> an amount equal to the width of the lengthwise strip, and the procedure described above is repeated to apply the polymeric resin material in a new lengthwise strip adjacent to that previously completed. In this repetitive manner, the entire fabric <b>12</b> can be provided with the desired amount of polymeric resin material per unit area, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">At one end of the transverse rails <b>18</b>,<b>20</b>, a jet check station <b>22</b> is provided for testing the flow of polymeric resin material from each piezojet in the piezojet array <b>16</b>. There, the piezojets can be purged and cleaned to restore operation automatically to any malfunctioning piezojet unit.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">In the second station, the imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>, the only station not optional in the present invention, transverse rails <b>26</b>,<b>28</b> support a digital-imaging camera <b>30</b>, which is translatable across the width of fabric <b>12</b>, and a piezojet array <b>32</b>, which is translatable both across the width of the fabric <b>12</b> and lengthwise relative thereto between transverse rails <b>26</b>,<b>28</b>, while the fabric <b>12</b> is at rest.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">The digital-imaging camera <b>30</b> views the surface of the fabric <b>12</b> to locate the locations where the material is to be deposited for bonding purposes. For example, the knuckles where the yarns in one direction of the fabric <b>12</b> weave over those in the other direction may be the location points or where one yarn crosses the other in a nonwoven yarn array may be another. Comparisons between the actual surface and its desired appearance are made by a fast pattern recognizer (FPR) processor operating in conjunction with the digital-imaging camera <b>30</b>. The FPR processor signals the piezojet array <b>32</b> to deposit polymeric resin material onto the locations requiring it to match the desired appearance. In this first embodiment of the present invention, the polymeric resin material is deposited onto the yarns in a controlled manner over the cross over location or where the knuckles are formed and adjacent to the respective yarns to bond the yarns to one another at their crossing points. As in optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>, a piezojet check station <b>34</b> is provided at one end of the transverse rails <b>26</b>,<b>28</b> for testing the flow of material from each piezojet. There, each piezojet in the piezojet array <b>32</b> can be purged and cleaned to restore operation automatically to any malfunctioning piezojet unit.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">By way of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of the surface of a fabric <b>50</b>, which is woven in a fairly open, plain weave from lengthwise yarns <b>52</b> and crosswise yarns <b>54</b>. Knuckles <b>56</b> are formed where lengthwise yarns <b>52</b> pass over crosswise yarns <b>54</b> and where crosswise yarns <b>54</b> pass over lengthwise yarns <b>52</b>. Because interstices <b>58</b> are relatively large, a measure of the openness of the weave, it is straightforward to imagine that the lengthwise and crosswise yarns <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> could readily shift from the idealized positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and that the fabric <b>50</b> may be somewhat sleazy.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of the surface of fabric <b>50</b> showing the manner in which polymeric resin material is deposited thereon in imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>. On either side of each knuckle <b>56</b>, polymeric resin material <b>60</b> is deposited on the lengthwise or crosswise yarn <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> over which the knuckle <b>56</b> is formed to bond the two yarns <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> to one another at the crossing point represented by the knuckle <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">In the third station, the optional setting station <b>36</b>, transverse rails <b>38</b>,<b>40</b> support a setting device <b>42</b>, which may be required to set the polymeric resin material being used. The setting device <b>42</b> may be a heat source, for example, an infrared, hot air, microwave or laser source; cold air; or an ultraviolet or visible-light source, the choice being governed by the requirements of the polymeric resin material being used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">Finally, the fourth and last station is the optional grinding station <b>44</b>, where an appropriate abrasive is used to provide any polymeric resin material above the surface plane of the fabric <b>12</b> with a uniform thickness. The optional grinding station <b>44</b> may comprise a roll having an abrasive surface, and another roll or backing surface on the other side of the fabric <b>12</b> to ensure that the grinding will result in a uniform thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">In a variation of the present invention, the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>, the imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>, and the optional setting station <b>36</b> may be adapted to treat fabric <b>12</b> according to a spiral technique, rather than by indexing in the cross-machine direction as described above. In a spiral technique, the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>, the imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>, and the optional setting station <b>36</b> start at one edge of the fabric <b>12</b>, for example, the left-hand edge in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and are gradually moved across the fabric <b>12</b>, as the fabric <b>12</b> moves in the direction indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The rates at which the stations <b>14</b>,<b>24</b>,<b>36</b> and the fabric <b>12</b> are moved are set so that the polymeric resin material desired in the finished fabric is spiraled onto the fabric <b>12</b> as desired in a continuous manner. In this alternative, the polymeric resin material deposited by the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b> and imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b> may be partially set or fixed as each spiral passes beneath the optional setting device <b>42</b>, and completely set when the entire fabric <b>12</b> has been processed through the apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">Alternatively, the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>, the imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b> and the optional setting station <b>36</b> may all be kept in fixed positions aligned with one another, while the fabric <b>12</b> moves beneath them, so that the polymeric resin material desired for the finished fabric may be applied to a lengthwise strip around the fabric <b>12</b>. Upon completion of the lengthwise strip, the optional polymer deposition station <b>14</b>, the imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b> and the optional setting station <b>36</b> are moved widthwise an amount equal to the width of the lengthwise strip, and the procedure is repeated for a new lengthwise strip adjacent to that previously completed. In this repetitive manner the entire fabric <b>12</b> can be completely treated as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">Furthermore, the entire apparatus can remain in a fixed position with the material processed. It should be noted that the material need not be a full width structure but can be a strip of material such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,656 to Rexfelt, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and subsequently formed into a full width fabric. The strip can be unwound and wound up on a set of rolls after fully processing. These rolls of fabric materials can be stored and can then be used to form an endless full width structure using, for example, the teachings of the immediately aforementioned patent.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">In this regard, a second embodiment of the present invention, apparatus <b>10</b> is now used to bond adjacent turns of a spirally wound fabric strip to one another to form an endless fabric. A method for doing so employing an ultrasonic welding apparatus is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,399 to Collette et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">More specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,399 discloses a method for manufacturing a papermaker's fabric by spirally winding a woven fabric strip, narrower than the intended width of the fabric, and the papermaker's fabric manufactured in accordance with the method. The fabric strip includes lengthwise and crosswise yarns, and has a lateral fringe along at least one lateral edge thereof, the lateral fringe being formed by unbound ends of the crosswise yarns extending beyond the lateral edge. During the spiral winding of the fringed strip, the lateral fringe of a turn overlies or underlies an adjacent turn of the strip. The lateral edges of adjacent turns abut against one another. The spirally continuous seam so obtained is closed by ultrasonically welding or bonding the overlying or underlying lateral fringe to the fabric strip in an adjacent turn.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which shows apparatus <b>10</b> as previously shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but adapted to practice this second embodiment of the present invention with the addition of a first roll <b>62</b> and a second roll <b>64</b>, which are parallel to one another and which may be rotated in the directions indicated by the arrows, a woven fabric strip <b>66</b> is wound from a stock roll <b>68</b> around the first roll <b>62</b> and the second roll <b>64</b> in a continuous spiral. It will be recognized that it will be necessary to translate the stock roll <b>68</b> at a suitable rate along the second roll <b>64</b>, that is, to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as the fabric strip <b>66</b> is being wound around the rolls <b>62</b>,<b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">Woven fabric strip <b>66</b> has a first lateral edge <b>70</b> and a second lateral edge <b>72</b>. Extending beyond the woven fabric strip <b>66</b> along its first and second lateral edges <b>70</b>,<b>72</b> are a first and a second lateral fringe <b>74</b>,<b>76</b>, respectively, which are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">As woven fabric strip <b>66</b> is spirally wound around the first and second rolls <b>62</b>,<b>64</b>, its first lateral edge <b>70</b> is abutted against the second lateral edge <b>72</b> of the previously wound turn to define a spirally continuous seam <b>78</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a plan view of a portion of the seam <b>78</b> before any bonding has taken place, first lateral fringe <b>74</b> formed by unbound ends of crosswise yarns <b>80</b> extending past lateral edge <b>70</b> overlies the previous turn of the woven fabric strip <b>66</b> when the first and second lateral edges <b>70</b>,<b>72</b> are abutted against one another. Moreover, second lateral fringe <b>76</b> formed by unbound ends of crosswise yarns <b>80</b> extending past lateral edge <b>72</b> underlies the subsequent turn of the woven fabric strip <b>66</b> when the first and second lateral edges <b>70</b>,<b>72</b> are abutted against one another.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">In accordance with this second embodiment of the present invention, imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b> is used to close the spirally continuous seam <b>78</b> instead of the ultrasonic welding apparatus shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,399. Specifically, the digital imaging camera <b>30</b> views the surface of the spirally wound woven fabric strip <b>66</b> at the spirally continuous seam <b>78</b> to locate the points where the crosswise yarns <b>80</b> of the first lateral fringe <b>74</b> overlying the previous turn of the woven fabric strip <b>66</b> cross the lengthwise yarns <b>82</b> therein, and to locate the points where the crosswise yarns <b>80</b> of the second lateral fringe <b>76</b> underlying the subsequent turn of the woven fabric strip <b>66</b> cross the lengthwise yarns <b>82</b> therein. Comparisons between the actual surface and its desired appearance are made by a fast pattern recognizer (FPR) processor operating in conjunction with the digital-imaging camera <b>30</b>. The FPR processor signals the piezojet array <b>32</b> to deposit polymeric resin material onto the locations requiring it to match the desired appearance. In this second embodiment of the present invention, the polymeric resin material is deposited onto the underlying yarn adjacent to the overlying yarn at the crossing points to bond the yarns to one another, thereby to close the spirally continuous seam <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a plan view of the portion of the seam <b>78</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> after the bonding has been carried out. As shown, crosswise yarns <b>80</b> of the first lateral fringe <b>74</b> are bonded to the underlying lengthwise yarns <b>82</b> by polymeric resin material <b>84</b> deposited onto the lengthwise yarns <b>82</b> adjacent to crosswise yarns <b>80</b> by imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>. Similarly, crosswise yarns <b>80</b> of second lateral fringe <b>76</b> are bonded to the overlying lengthwise yarns <b>82</b> by polymeric resin material <b>84</b> deposited onto the crosswise yarns <b>80</b> adjacent to lengthwise yarns <b>82</b>. In this manner, the spirally continuous seam <b>78</b> is closed by imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>. Similarly, the apparatus can be used to bond an array of MD yarns (or CD yarns) to each other. For example, an array of MD yarns is fed into the apparatus instead of the Rexfelt strip of material. The piezojet then deposits resin at precise, discontinuous locations along the length of coincident yarns in the space therebetween causing the yarns to bond to one another at that point. As the yarn array is fed into the apparatus, the piezojet will traverse to the next set of MD yarns and continue as such until the appropriate length and width of fabric is created. Subsequent additional passes of the piezo jets can be made for additional deposits, if so desired. Lengths of such fabric may be rolled up and stored for subsequent use in creating a full width fabric or as a layer of a laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">In a third embodiment of the present invention, apparatus <b>10</b> is used to laminate one fabric layer to another. A method for doing so is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,350,336 to Paquin, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. More specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 6,350,336 discloses a method for manufacturing a press fabric for a paper machine, which method includes the attachment of a strip of top laminate layer material to a base fabric using a heat activated adhesive film. The top laminate layer material may be a woven fabric, a nonwoven mesh or a thermoplastic sheet material, and, in any case, has the heat-activated adhesive film bonded to one of its two sides. The strip of top laminate layer material and heat activated adhesive film together form a multi-component strip, which is spiraled onto the outer surface of the base fabric, with the side of the strip of top laminate layer material having the heat-activated adhesive film against the outer surface, in a closed helix, and bonded thereto with heat and pressure. The portions of the multi-component strip overhanging the lateral edges of the base fabric are then trimmed and a staple fiber batt is needled into and through the top laminate layer formed by the multi-component strip to firmly attach it to the base fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">In accordance with this third embodiment of the present invention, imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b> is used to apply a thermoplastic polymeric resin material onto the knuckles formed where the yarns in one direction of the base fabric weave over those on the other direction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">Specifically, the digital-imaging camera <b>30</b> views the outer surface of the base fabric to locate the knuckles formed where the yarns in one direction of the base fabric weave over those in the other direction. Comparisons between the actual surface and its desired appearance are made by a fast pattern recognizer (FPR) processor operating in conjunction with the digital-imaging camera <b>30</b>. The FPR processor signals the piezojet array <b>32</b> to deposit polymeric resin material onto the locations requiring it to match the desired appearance. In this third embodiment of the present invention, a thermoplastic polymeric resin material is deposited onto the knuckles on the outer surface of the base fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a plan view of the surface of the base fabric <b>90</b> as it could appear following this deposition. Base fabric <b>90</b> is woven from lengthwise yarns <b>92</b> and crosswise yarns <b>94</b> in a single-layer plain weave, although it should be understood that the inventors do not intend the practice of the present invention to be limited to such a weave. The lengthwise yarns <b>92</b> form knuckles <b>96</b> where they pass over crosswise yarns <b>94</b>. Similarly, the crosswise yarns <b>94</b> form knuckles <b>98</b> where they pass over lengthwise yarns <b>92</b>. Knuckles <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> have a coating <b>100</b> of thermoplastic polymeric resin material precisely applied thereto by imaging/precise polymer deposition station <b>24</b>. Although each knuckle <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> is shown to have such a coating <b>100</b>, it need not be so, as it is within the scope of this third embodiment of the present invention to apply coating <b>100</b> only to certain preselected knuckles <b>96</b>,<b>98</b>, while leaving the remaining knuckles <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> uncoated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which, like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shows apparatus <b>10</b> as previously shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but adapted to practice this third embodiment of the present invention with the addition of the first roll <b>62</b> and the second roll <b>64</b>, which are parallel to one another and which may be rotated in the directions indicated by the arrows. Base fabric <b>90</b> remains entrained about the first and second rolls <b>62</b>,<b>64</b> following the application of coating <b>100</b> onto knuckles <b>96</b>,<b>98</b>, and a strip <b>102</b> of top laminate layer material is spirally wound thereon in a closed helix from stock roll <b>68</b>. The strip <b>102</b> of top laminate layer material may be, for example, a woven fabric, a nonwoven mesh, MD or CD yarn arrays or a thermoplastic sheet material. After the strip <b>102</b> of top laminate layer material is dispensed onto base fabric <b>90</b>, it passes beneath the setting station <b>36</b>, which, for this third embodiment of the present invention, is a heat source which melts the thermoplastic polymeric resin material on the knuckles <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> to adhere the strip <b>102</b> of top laminate layer material to the base fabric <b>90</b>. The base fabric <b>90</b> and strip <b>102</b> then pass together under the grinding station <b>44</b> which, functioning as a roll, presses them together while the thermoplastic polymeric resin material resolidifies to bond them to one another. Such a laminate can be the industrial fabric itself. Or, if required, needled batt can be applied to one or more surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">Modifications to the above would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, but would not bring the invention so modified beyond the scope of the appended claims. For example, depending upon the application, it may be desirable to have some piezojets deposit one polymeric resin material while others deposit a different polymeric resin material. Also, while piezojets are disclosed above as being used to deposit the material, in preselected locations on the base substrate, other means for depositing droplets thereof in the size range desired may be known to those of ordinary skill in the art or may be developed in the future, and such other means may be used in the practice of the present invention. The use of such means would not bring the invention, if practiced therewith, beyond the scope of the appended claims.</p>
