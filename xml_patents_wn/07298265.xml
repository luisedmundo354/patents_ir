<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag that exchanges information with an external device in a noncontact manner and a method of manufacturing the same. In some cases, among those skilled in the technical field corresponding to the present invention, the “RFID tag” referred to in this specification is called “RFID tag inlay” as an internal constituent member (inlay) for an “RFID tag”. In some other cases, this “RFID tag” is called “wireless IC tag”. Also, this “RFID” tag includes a noncontact-type IC card.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, various types of RFID tags capable of noncontact information exchange by means of radio waves with external devices typified by reader/writers have been proposed. One of the various types of RFID tags proposed has an antenna pattern for radio wave communication and an IC chip mounted on a base sheet made of a plastic or paper. A conceivable usage form of such type of RFID tag is that the RFID tag is attached to an article and information about the article is exchanged with an external device for identification or the like of the article.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> is a front view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref> is a sectional side view, respectively, of an example of an RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The RFID tag <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A) and 1(B)</figref> is constituted by an antenna <b>12</b> provided on a base <b>13</b> formed of a sheet-like material such as a polyethylene telephthalate (PET) film, an IC chip <b>11</b> connected to the antenna <b>12</b> through bumps <b>16</b>, and a cover sheet <b>14</b> bonded to the base <b>13</b> by an adhesive <b>15</b> so as to cover the antenna <b>12</b> and the IC chip <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The IC chip <b>11</b> constituting the RFID tag <b>1</b> is capable of exchanging information with an external device by performing wireless communication through the antenna <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various use forms including the above-mentioned use form have been conceived with respect to this type of RFID tag. In use of this type of RFID tag, how to reduce the manufacturing cost of the RFID tag has been a serious problem and various attempts have been made to solve this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As one of the attempts to reduce the manufacturing cost, there is proposed the idea of forming an antenna by using a paste material which is made conductive by blending a metallic filler (Ag in ordinary cases) with a resin material such as an epoxy resin (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-311226 (paragraph [0066])). If such a paste material can be used as a material for forming an antenna in place of a thin metallic material such as Cu, Al or Au that is conventionally used, it can largely contribute to a reduction in the manufacturing cost of the RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When manufacturing the RFID tag in which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the IC chip <b>11</b> is connected to the antenna <b>12</b> formed on the surface of the base <b>13</b> that is a sheet-like PET member or the like through the bumps (metal protrusions) <b>16</b> formed on electrodes of the IC chip <b>11</b>, if the antenna <b>12</b> is formed by printing a paste material, a problem described below may arise with the connection between the IC chip <b>11</b> and the antenna <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> shows a case where a metal is used as an antenna material and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref> shows a case where a paste is used as an antenna material for comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An antenna <b>121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>) formed of a thin sheet of a metal or an antenna <b>122</b> formed of a paste material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>) is formed on the base <b>13</b> formed of a PET. The bumps <b>16</b> are formed on electrodes <b>111</b> formed on the IC chip <b>11</b> in each of the cases shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the states shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref> shows a state in which the IC chip <b>11</b> with bumps <b>16</b> is placed on the base <b>13</b> on which the antenna <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> is formed such that the bumps <b>16</b> face the base <b>13</b> and the IC chip <b>11</b> is connected to the antenna <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> through the bumps <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>, illustration of the adhesive <b>15</b> and the cover sheet <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref> is omitted. At the time of connection, the IC chip <b>11</b> is pressed from above as viewed in the figure with a jig (not shown). A pressing force is thereby applied from the bumps <b>16</b> to the antenna <b>121</b> or <b>122</b>. In the case of the antenna <b>121</b> made of a metallic material as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, there is no problem with this pressing, since the hardness of the antenna <b>121</b> is high. In the case of the antenna <b>122</b> made of a paste material as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, there is a problem described below. The paste material deforms by the pressing force received by the antenna <b>122</b> from the bumps <b>16</b> so as to conform to the shape of the bumps <b>16</b>, and compression bending of the paste material is thereby caused at the connection between the antenna <b>122</b> and the bumps <b>16</b>, resulting in pattern breakage and sinking at the bent portion. In this case, the necessary insulation distance cannot be maintained between the IC chip <b>11</b> and the antenna <b>122</b>. If this distance is changed, characteristics of the RFID tag including a wireless communication characteristic (hereinafter referred to as tag characteristics) are changed, which results in variations in tag characteristics when a large number of RFID tags are manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method of mounting various types of IC chips on a circuit board apart from the RFID tag is being widely practiced. In ordinary cases, many bumps are formed on an IC chip and the pressing force per bump is small even when a paste material is used as a wiring material on a circuit board and, therefore, protrusion of the paste material is not a serious problem.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In contrast, in the case of the RFID tag, since the number of bumps provided in one IC chip for connection to the antenna is about two or four, the pressing force per bump is extremely large and thus the above-mentioned sinking problem arises. In order to reduce the pressing force, it is necessary to reduce the pressing force, which is applied by an apparatus for placing the IC chip on the base when placing the IC chip, to an extremely small value in comparison with the case of placing an ordinary IC chip on which many bumps are formed. Also, since an adhesive exists between the base and the IC chip, it is extremely difficult to reduce the pressing force to an extremely small value while enabling a reliable connection to be made in a short time.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides an RFID tag using a paste as a material for an antenna and capable of avoiding the problem that the tag characteristics are changed by sinking of bumps, and a method of manufacturing the RFID tag.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The present invention will be described below with respect to embodiments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and other figures referred to below, constituents corresponding to those of the RFID tag described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are indicated by the same reference numerals and the description for them will not be repeated. Description will be made only of points different from the above-described RFID tag. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the other figures referred to below, illustration of the adhesive <b>15</b> between the base <b>13</b> and the IC chip <b>11</b> and the base sheet <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>) that covers upper portions of the RFID tag is omitted in principle, as is that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, a feature of the present invention described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> resides in an adhesive. Therefore, the adhesive is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Also, in the embodiments described below, the base <b>13</b> is formed of a PET and the antenna <b>122</b> is formed by using a paste prepared by blending an Ag filler with a resin material such as an epoxy resin unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a polyimide film <b>21</b> having holes at positions corresponding to bumps is formed on the IC chip <b>11</b>. The polyimide film <b>21</b> is slightly lower than the height of bumps <b>16</b> (thinner than bumps <b>16</b>). When the IC chip <b>11</b> with bumps <b>16</b> and polyimide film <b>21</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, the polyimide film <b>21</b> functions as a stopper to limit sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> (see FIG. <b>2</b>(B)), thus stabilizing the tag characteristics of the RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a PET member <b>22</b> having holes is adhered to the base <b>13</b>. The thickness of the PET member <b>22</b> is slightly smaller than the height of the bumps <b>16</b>. When the IC chip <b>11</b> with the bumps <b>16</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, the PET member <b>22</b> functions as a stopper to limit sinking of the bumps <b>16</b>, thus stabilizing the tag characteristics of the RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the RFID tag IC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a protrusion (stopper portion <b>23</b>) slightly lower in height than the bumps <b>16</b> is formed on the base <b>13</b> side before the IC chip <b>11</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>. When the IC chip <b>11</b> with the bumps <b>16</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> is limited by the function of the stopper portion <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) to 6(C)</figref> show an RFID tag as an example of a modification of the third embodiment of the present invention (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> is a sectional view, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref> is a plan view showing the base before the IC chip is mounted, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref> is a plan view showing the base after mounting the IC chip. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, the position of the IC chip is indicated only by the broken line.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Also in the RFID tag <b>1</b>C′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) to 6(C)</figref>, a protrusion (stopper portion <b>23</b>) slightly lower in height than the bumps <b>16</b> is formed on the base <b>13</b> side before the IC chip <b>11</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, as is that in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When the IC chip <b>11</b> with the bumps <b>16</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> is limited by the function of the stopper portion <b>23</b>. In the case of the RFID tag <b>1</b>C′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) to 6(C)</figref>, the stopper portion <b>23</b> is formed on the portion of the base <b>13</b> on which the IC chip <b>11</b> is mounted except the portions on which connections to the bumps <b>16</b> are made. That is, the stopper portion <b>23</b> extends so as to fill the almost entire region where no antenna portion exists between two ends of the antenna <b>122</b>. If the stopper portion <b>23</b> conforms to the region where no antenna pattern portion exists, it is possible to maintain the balance (attitude) of the IC chip <b>11</b> at the time of mounting of the IC chip <b>11</b> on the base <b>13</b> as well as to improve the intimate contact between the IC chip <b>11</b> and the base <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a plastic filler <b>24</b> having a diameter slightly smaller than the height of the bumps <b>16</b> is blended with an adhesive (not shown). When the IC chip <b>11</b> with the bumps <b>16</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, the plastic filler <b>24</b> functions as a stopper to limit sinking of the bumps <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a hard resin layer <b>25</b> is provided between the base <b>13</b> formed of a PET and the antenna <b>122</b>. When the IC chip <b>11</b> with the bumps <b>16</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> is limited thanks to the existence of the hard resin layer <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a PET sheet <b>26</b> harder than the base <b>13</b> is placed between the base <b>13</b> formed of a PET and the antenna <b>122</b>. When the IC chip <b>11</b> with the bumps <b>16</b> is connected to the antenna <b>122</b>, sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> is limited thanks to the existence of the hard PET sheet <b>26</b>, as in the case of the RFID tag <b>1</b>E shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>G shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, supports <b>27</b> made of a metal are disposed on the portions of the antenna <b>122</b> on the base <b>13</b> which correspond to the positions of the bumps <b>16</b>. The bumps <b>16</b> are directly connected to the supports <b>27</b> and connected to the antenna <b>122</b> through the supports <b>27</b>. In the case of this RFID tag <b>1</b>G, sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> is prevented thanks to the existence of the supports <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view of an RFID tag according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the RFID tag <b>1</b>H shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the Ag filler filling factor of bump mount portions <b>122</b><i>a </i>of the antenna <b>122</b> to be connected to the bumps <b>16</b> is increased relative to that of the portion other than the bump mount portions <b>122</b><i>a </i>so that the bump mount portions <b>122</b><i>a </i>are higher in hardness than the other portion, thereby limiting sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> when the antenna <b>122</b> receives the pressing force from the bumps <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a sectional view of base and antenna portions of an RFID tag according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Any fault due to the above-described sinking has not been considered in the conventional techniques. Thus, typically, when adopting a paste as the material of the antenna <b>122</b>, blending of a filler with the paste, e.g., blending of an Ag filler or the like with a resin material such as an epoxy resin shown in Part (A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, has been performed mainly for the purpose of giving the necessary conductivity to the paste so that the paste functions as the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In contrast, in the case of the RFID tag <b>1</b>I having the base and the antenna shown in Part (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a filler such as an Ag filler for giving the necessary conductivity to the paste so that the paste functions as the antenna is blended with a resin material such as an epoxy resin, and a filler <b>28</b> for giving the necessary hardness to the antenna formed of the paste, e.g., Cu, Pd or Ni is also blended with the resin material. An antenna <b>122</b><i>b </i>is formed by using the paste in which such fillers are blended. In this way, sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> caused by the pressing force from the bumps <b>16</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Methods of manufacturing the various RFID tags <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>I described above will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13(A) to 13(C)</figref> illustrate a method of forming the bumps on the electrodes of the IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">First, a thin metal wire <b>30</b> to be formed as bumps is caused to project from the tip of a jig <b>20</b> with a hole, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A)</figref>, and electric discharge is caused between the thin metal wire <b>30</b> and a discharge electrode <b>40</b>. A portion of the thin metal wire <b>30</b> at the tip is molten by the discharge energy to form a metal ball <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Subsequently, the metal ball <b>31</b> is pressed against the electrode <b>111</b> of the IC chip <b>11</b> and ultrasonic waves are applied to the metal ball <b>31</b> through the jig <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(B)</figref>. The metal ball <b>31</b> is joined to the electrode <b>111</b> of the IC chip <b>11</b> by the ultrasonic waves. When the jig <b>20</b> is removed, the metal ball <b>31</b> and the thin metal wire <b>30</b> at the foot are torn off to form the bump in original form <b>32</b> on the electrode <b>111</b> of the IC chip <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(C)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram showing a method of leveling the bump, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15(A) to 15(C)</figref> are diagrams showing the bump after leveling.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">After being formed on the electrode <b>111</b> of the IC chip <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the bump in original form <b>32</b> is pressed on a flat surface of a glass plate <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The load for this pressing and the pressing height are selected to change the shape of the bump. That is, the bump <b>16</b> having the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(A)</figref> is formed in the case of low-load high-position pressing; the bump <b>16</b> having the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(B)</figref> is formed in the case of medium-load medium-position pressing; and the bump <b>16</b> having the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(C)</figref> is formed in the case of high-load low-position pressing.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The polyimide film <b>21</b> is formed on the surface of the IC chip <b>11</b> on which the electrodes <b>111</b> are provided (FIG. <b>16</b>(A)), and only portions of the polyimide film <b>21</b> corresponding to the electrodes <b>111</b> are removed by laser machining or etching, thereby forming the polyimide film <b>21</b> having holes <b>212</b> formed in correspondence with the electrodes <b>111</b> on which bumps will be formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref>). Thereafter, the bumps in original form <b>32</b> are formed on the electrodes <b>111</b> by the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13(A) to 13(C)</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(C)</figref>. Leveling is performed on the bumps in original form <b>32</b> by the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15(A) to 15(C)</figref> to form the bumps <b>16</b> slightly higher in height than polyimide film <b>21</b>. The bumps <b>16</b> facing the base <b>13</b> and the antenna <b>122</b> are connected to each other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(D)</figref>).

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The PET member <b>22</b> with holes <b>221</b> is prepared (FIG. <b>17</b>(A)), and is applied to the base <b>13</b> on which the antenna <b>122</b> is formed, the holes <b>221</b> being aligned with the bump connection portions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(B)</figref>). The IC chip <b>11</b> is thereafter mounted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(C)</figref>). At this time, the PET member <b>22</b> functions as a stopper to prevent sinking of bumps <b>16</b>.</p>

The film <b>231</b> thereby formed has a thickness slightly smaller than the height of bumps <b>16</b> formed afterward. Unnecessary portions of the film <b>231</b> are removed by chemical etching and only a portion of the film <b>231</b> adjacent to the portions of the antenna <b>122</b> to be connected to the bumps are left, thereby forming the stopper portion <b>23</b> on the base <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(B)</figref>). The IC chip <b>11</b> with bumps <b>16</b> is mounted on the base <b>13</b> and the bumps <b>16</b> and the antenna <b>122</b> are connected to each other. Since the stopper portion <b>23</b> is formed so as to be slightly lower in height than the bumps <b>16</b> before connection, the bumps <b>16</b> are connected to the antenna <b>122</b> with reliability, and sinking of the bumps <b>16</b> is prevented by the function of the stopper portion <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">While the method of manufacturing the RFID tag according to the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18(A) to 18(C)</figref>, the RFID tag shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) to 6(C)</figref> as an example of modification of the third embodiment can also be manufactured by forming the stopper portion <b>23</b> whose shape however is the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thereafter, the IC chip <b>11</b> with bumps <b>16</b> is mounted on the base <b>13</b> and the bumps <b>16</b> and the antenna <b>122</b> are connected to each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(B)</figref>. At this time, however, since the plastic filler <b>24</b> has a diameter slightly smaller than the height of the bumps <b>16</b>, the bumps <b>16</b> are connected to the antenna <b>122</b> with reliability, and the plastic filler <b>24</b> functions as a stopper to prevent sinking of the bumps <b>16</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Thereafter, the printing master <b>80</b> for forming the protrusion is removed, followed by drying. The antenna <b>122</b> is thereby formed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As the printing master <b>80</b>, a thin Al or SUS plate or the like having holes formed at desired positions by etching can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">No method has been described with respect to making of the antenna <b>122</b> in the description of the other embodiments since the technique for printing the paste is well known.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">After the antenna <b>122</b> has been printed on the hard resin layer <b>25</b>, the IC chip <b>11</b> is mounted with the bumps <b>16</b> pressed on the antenna <b>122</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(D)</figref>.
