<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a system for supporting a smaller container within a larger container and, more particularly, pertains to a container support system employing a support device which provides support from the bottom wall of the smaller container and enables enhanced portability thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many people today choose to decorate their properties by displaying various plant and flower arrangements in large open top decorative containers commonly known as “whiskey barrel” containers which are widely available in most home and garden stores. Such large containers are typically fabricated from a number of wooden members encircled by metal straps, and have an upper diameter of about 25 inches and a height of about 16 inches. When filled with soil and foliage, the whiskey barrels can weigh approximately 125 pounds which can make them difficult to move.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result, it is desirable to provide an alternative way of displaying floral and other arrangements from large ground-based containers such as whiskey barrels without having to fill the large container with soil or other filler. That is, there exists a need for supporting a smaller, relatively wide based container capable of holding such arrangements from the open top of the larger container in a manner which will improve installation, maintenance and removal of a display arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a general object of the present invention to provide a container support system for supporting a smaller, filled open top container within a larger open top container.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a support device for supporting a smaller, filled container within a larger open top container wherein substantially the entire bottom wall of the smaller container is supported.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the present invention to provide a support device for supporting a smaller filled container within a larger open top container such that the portability of the smaller container is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a container support device fabricated from a resilient material which will self-adjust in response to expansion and contraction of the larger container.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a support device in the form of a smaller container having handles integrally formed thereon for supportive engagement on the upper edge of a larger container.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect of the invention, a container support system includes a first open top container having an outer, upper edge. The first open top container is adapted to rest upon a support surface. A second open top container has a bottom wall and a continuous sidewall extending upwardly from the bottom wall. The second open top container has an interior surface adapted to be filled by a substance. A support rack is interposed between the first open top container and the second open top container for supporting the second open top container within the first open top container. The support rack includes a base underlying the bottom wall of the second open top container and having a central region and a periphery, and a series of spaced apart support structures joined to the base. Each support structure is provided with a first portion connected to the base and extends along the base from the central region to beyond the periphery thereof. The first portion supports the bottom wall of the second open top container. A second portion diverges upwardly and outwardly from the first portion. A third portion is secured to and extends outwardly from the second portion, and defines a handle supported upon and extending outwardly of the upper edge of the first open top container, the handle being adapted to be easily grasped by one's entire hand.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the invention, a container support system is adapted for displaying flowers and plants. The system includes a first open top container having an outer, upper edge, the first open top container being adapted to rest upon a support surface. A second open top container is sized smaller than the first open top container and has a bottom wall and a continuous sidewall extending upwardly from the bottom wall. The second open top container has an interior surface adapted to be filled by flowers and plants. A resilient support rack is interposed between the first and second open top containers for supporting the second open top container within the first open top container. The support rack includes an arrangement of concentric rings connected together by a series of equally spaced apart support structures. Each support structure is formed by a pair of parallel wire rods joined to the concentric rings and extending radially from an innermost concentric ring to an outermost concentric ring. A second pair of parallel wire rods diverges upwardly and outwardly from the first pair of wire rods. A curved wire rod handle interconnects top ends of the second pair of wire rods. The handle is supported from and extends outwardly of the upper edge of the first open top container wherein the first pairs of wire rods engage and support the bottom wall of the second open top container.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The concentric rings further support the bottom wall of the second open top container. The handle has a semi-circular configuration. The arrangement of the concentric rings includes an intermediate concentric ring between the innermost and outermost concentric rings. The first pairs of wire rods have outer ends extending beyond the periphery of the outermost concentric ring. The sidewall of the second open top container has an upper edge lying above the curved handle when the second open top container is supported by the support rack.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the invention, a container support device is adapted to be interposed between first and second open top containers for supporting the second open top container within the first open top container. The support device includes a resilient wire support rack including an arrangement of concentric rings connected together by a series of equally spaced apart support structures. Each support structure is formed by a first pair of parallel wire rods joined to the concentric rings and extending radially from an innermost concentric ring to an outermost concentric ring.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> illustrate various components of a container support system <b>10</b> comprised of a first open top container <b>12</b>, a second smaller open top container <b>14</b> and a support device <b>16</b> interposed between the containers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> for conveniently and efficiently supporting the second container <b>14</b> within the first container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the preferred embodiment to be described, the support system <b>10</b> is particularly useful in supporting a natural or artificial flower and/or plant arrangement <b>18</b>. However, it should be appreciated that other solid or fluid substances may be supported, displayed and, if desired, more easily transported in the second open top container <b>14</b> of the container support system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first open top container <b>12</b> is a rigid vessel having a bottom wall <b>20</b> and a continuous upwardly flaring sidewall <b>22</b> terminating in an outer upper edge <b>24</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the first container <b>12</b> is shown in the form of a commercially available wooden container <b>26</b> surrounded by metal straps <b>28</b> and known as a whiskey barrel. The first container may take other forms and be comprised of other suitable strong, rigid and weather resistant materials.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second open top container <b>14</b> is a semi-rigid construction designed to be supported within the upper interior space of the larger first open top container <b>12</b>. The second container <b>14</b> is fabricated preferably of a recycled high-density polyethylene plastic and includes a circular bottom wall <b>30</b> and a continuous upwardly diverging sidewall <b>32</b>. The sidewall <b>32</b> forms an interior surface which is adapted to be filled as desired by a substance <b>33</b> such as soil, sand, styrofoam, water, etc. and, as above noted, flowers and plants. The second container <b>14</b> may also be manufactured of other lightweight but extremely durable, weather impervious materials in addition to plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The support device <b>16</b> is composed of a flexible or resilient, cylindrical wire rod rack having a base <b>34</b> and a series of four equally spaced apart support structures <b>36</b> joined to the base <b>34</b> and organized in two diametrically opposed pairs. The base <b>34</b> has a central region <b>38</b> and a periphery <b>40</b>, and is comprised of an innermost ring <b>42</b>, an intermediate ring <b>44</b> and an outermost ring <b>46</b>, all of which are concentric with each other. Each support structure <b>36</b> is identical in size and shape and is formed integrally with three distinct portions. A first portion <b>48</b> is connected to the base <b>34</b> and runs generally horizontally along the base <b>34</b> from the central region <b>38</b> to beyond the periphery <b>40</b> of the base <b>34</b>. More particularly, the first portion <b>48</b> includes a first pair of parallel wire rods <b>50</b> joined to and overlying concentric rings <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and extending radially from inside the innermost ring <b>42</b> to beyond the outermost ring <b>46</b>. A second portion <b>52</b> is formed by a second pair of parallel wire rods <b>54</b> extending from the outermost ends of the first pair of wire rods <b>50</b>. The second pair of wire rods <b>54</b> diverges or angles upwardly and outwardly from the first pair of wire rods <b>50</b>. A third portion <b>56</b> is defined by a curved, semi-circular handle <b>58</b> which interconnects top ends of the second pair of wire rods <b>54</b> and extends outwardly therefrom. The handles <b>58</b> are suitably sized so that one may grasp its surface with their entire hand, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, the second open top container <b>14</b> is positioned on the support device <b>16</b> such that the entire bottom wall <b>30</b> of the container <b>14</b> is engaged directly with and supported upon the first pairs of wire rods <b>50</b> of the support structures <b>36</b> with additional support from the base <b>34</b>. The sidewall <b>32</b> of the second container <b>14</b> lies inwardly of the second pairs of wire rods <b>54</b> with an upper edge <b>60</b> of the container <b>14</b> lying an at elevation slightly above the handles <b>58</b>. With the second container <b>14</b> supported by the support device <b>16</b>, one pair of opposed handles <b>58</b> are grasped to place a bottom portion of the handles <b>58</b> into supporting engagement with the upper edge <b>24</b> of the empty first open top container <b>12</b>. Curved portions of the handles <b>58</b> project outwardly of the upper edge <b>24</b> so that the support device <b>16</b> can be easily installed or removed relative to the first container <b>12</b>. The second container <b>14</b> may be filled, such as with soil <b>33</b>, flowers and/or plants <b>18</b>, either before or after the support device <b>16</b> is engaged with the upper edge <b>24</b> of the first container <b>12</b>. When used to display natural flowers and plants which require regular irrigation, the first container <b>12</b> may be provided, if desired, with drainage holes near the bottom wall <b>20</b> of the container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the second container <b>14</b> and the support device <b>16</b> are combined into a second container <b>62</b> having outwardly extending handles <b>64</b> which are supported and engaged on the upper edge <b>24</b> of the first container <b>12</b>. The second container <b>62</b> has a bottom wall <b>66</b> reinforced by radial ribs <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be appreciated that the invention provides a lightweight yet extremely durable support device <b>16</b> for supporting a smaller container <b>14</b> filled with flowers and plants or the like within a larger supporting container <b>12</b> in a manner which supports the entire bottom wall <b>30</b> of the smaller container <b>14</b>, and provides for enhanced portability of the smaller container <b>14</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the second container <b>14</b> requires a greatly decreased fill capacity compared to the first container <b>12</b> enabling simplified setup and replacement of the particular display in the second container <b>14</b>. Each curved handle <b>58</b> not only permits for proper balanced support of the filled second container, but provides a gripping surface engageable with one's entire hands when installing or removing the second container <b>14</b>. The resiliency of the wire rod support device <b>16</b> allows for a self-adjusting support should the wooden first container <b>12</b> expand or contract due to changing environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The support device <b>16</b> enables the filled second container <b>14</b> to be more easily transported inside for frost or inclement weather, or for the transfer of perennials during winter. When breaking down multiple container systems <b>10</b> for winter, the support devices <b>16</b> may be conveniently stacked for storage. Besides displaying natural flowers and plants, the second container <b>14</b> may be filled with plastic winter foliage in soil or styrofoam. The second container <b>14</b> may also be provided with a sand-based display or may be filled with water and used as a birdbath.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain substitutions, alterations and omissions may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. Accordingly, the foregoing description is meant to be exemplary only and should not be deemed limitative on the scope of the invention set forth with the following claims.</p>
