<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A screen apparatus for improved separation of particulates from a fluid stream. The screen is configured and arranged to filter relatively large particulates from the fluid stream as the fluid stream passes from a storage chamber of the tank to a tank outlet. The screen is removably affixed to a diverter, such as a baffle, used to divert a portion or all of the fluid into the storage chamber. The screen is preferably shaped to substantially conform to the shape of the diverter to aid in the smoothing of the fluid flow within the retention section of the tank. The screen may be entirely porous, or it may be non-porous at its leading edge to minimize particulate build-up at the transition from the tank interior wall to the screen. The apparatus may optionally include a second screen to provide additional filtering of floating particulates as the fluid level in the tank exceeds the crown elevation of the inlet. The second screen may be substantially horizontally oriented and may be combined with a collection weir. Alternatively, the second screen may be conical in shape. A high flow bypass arrangement for the separation system may include an upper baffle and a lower baffle or a screen instead of the lower baffle. The upper baffle is set closer to the center of the tank than the lower baffle or screen, thereby providing more volume for flow diversion behind the upper baffle.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to systems for separating particulates from fluids such as drain water and stormwater. Such particulates include particulates that float under most fluid movement conditions, particulates that do not float under most fluid movement conditions, and particulates that may be caught up in the fluid stream when the fluid is flowing, but that may otherwise float or be suspended within the fluid when the fluid is substantially stagnant. More particularly, the present invention relates to a separation system that may be independent, or form part, of a larger fluid transfer system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluid transfer systems have been and will remain an important aspect of municipal services and commercial facilities management. The protection of ground water and natural bodies of water requires systems for diverting and/or treating water that contacts roadways, parking lots, and other man made structures. If such diversion or treatment systems are not provided, particulates and contaminants located on or forming part of such structures may be carried by drain water or stormwater to the natural water bodies and contaminate them. Local, state and federal laws and rules require municipalities, businesses and, in some instances, private entities, to establish means to reduce particulate and contaminant levels permissibly transferred to natural bodies of water from property under their control. Particular requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all are likely to become more, rather than less, stringent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previously, municipal water transfer and treatment facilities provided the only mechanism for diverting contaminated water away from natural bodies of water, either for holding or treatment for subsequent transfer to natural settings. In general, that process involved, and continues to involve, the establishment of a system of drains, such as in a parking lot or at a street curb, by which water enters a system of pipe conduits. Eventually, the water received from the drains reaches either a final outlet destination or is directed to a treatment system for contaminant removal. For purposes of the description of the present invention, “contaminated water” is to be understood to mean any water including floating particulates, such as Styrofoam™ containers and oil, for example; non-floating particulates, such as sand and silt, for example; and entrained contaminants, such as dissolved nutrients or metals, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Land development produces increased levels of drain water and stormwater runoff, resulting in increased strain on existing water transfer and treatment infrastructure and an increased likelihood of natural water contamination. In an effort to reduce the impact of development on natural resources and municipal services, initial upstream fluid treatment has become a requirement in many land development, restoration and repair projects. That is, requirements in various forms have been established to ensure that before contaminated water enters the municipal water transfer and/or treatment system, it must be treated in a manner that reduces the level of contaminants entering the municipal system. Therefore, most new land development plans and upgrades to existing paved surfaces involve the insertion of a preliminary separation system, generally for connection to the municipal water-handling infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Any preliminary separation system must be designed with the capability to receive fluid flowing in at a wide range of rates. For example, a mild rainfall resulting in rain accumulation of less than 0.25 inches over a span of 24 hours produces a relatively low flow rate through the system. On the other hand, for example, a torrential rainfall resulting in rain accumulation of more than two inches over a span of three hours produces relatively high flow rates through the system. It is desirable, then, to have a separation system capable of handling variable fluid flow rates with reduced likelihood of backup and flooding of the surface above. It is also desirable to control the flow through the system such that trapped particulates are not scoured or washed out of the device and re-entrained during high flows for passage downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to having a reasonable fluid flow throughput capacity, the separation system must be capable of performing the separation function for which it is intended. Specifically, it may be required to remove from the fluid flow path a certain number, type, or size of particulates. For example, some California municipalities require the removal of any particulates with dimensions greater than five millimeters. It would be preferable to have such a separation system that can remove from the fluid flow path the particulates for which it is designed at the widest range of flow rates but without causing backup or scouring/washout. For that reason, some such systems are designed with a bypass mechanism to permit direct flow through of fluid without preliminary treatment when relatively high flow rates are reached. Unfortunately, ineffectively designed separation systems fail to provide the best particulate removal and further fail to do so under flow rates that may not be particularly high.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is an increasing need and requirement for separation systems associated with drain water and stormwater introduction to municipal water handling systems. However, it is important that they not be prohibitively expensive in order to ensure that meeting those needs and requirements is feasible. It is also of importance that such separation systems are relatively easy to access for maintenance. It is also preferable that separation systems provide a reasonable arrangement for storing accumulated particulates to minimize the possibility of clogged inlets and outlets and to extend the required maintenance cycle. Inline treatment systems of relatively modest size are particularly desirable for incorporating into existing fluid transfer systems, however, they may be prone to shorter maintenance cycles as a result of competing goals of reduced size, exit blockage minimization, and flow through capacity requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, what is needed is a separation system that may or may not be part of a larger fluid handling system that is effective in accommodating varied fluid flow rates. What is also needed is such a separation system that conforms or substantially conforms with established particulate removal requirements. Further, what is needed is such a separation system that is configured to minimize clogging possibilities and to maximize particulate removal capability in a cost effective arrangement. Yet further, what is needed is such a separation system that includes means to minimize exit blockage under anticipated fluid flow conditions without compromising separation capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to remove particulates including, but not limited to, trash, oil, dirt, and grease from fluid systems. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a separation system that is effective in accommodating varied fluid flow rates. It is another object of the present invention to provide such a separation system that conforms or substantially conforms with established particulate removal requirements. Further, it is an object of the invention to provide such a separation system that is configured to minimize clogging possibilities and to maximize particulate removal capability in a cost effective arrangement. Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide such a separation system that includes means to minimize exit blockage under anticipated fluid flow conditions without compromising separation capability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objectives are achieved with the present invention. The invention is a fluid separation system including an apparatus for screening particulates from the fluid stream in a manner that reduces flow blockage without compromising fluid flow through capacity. For the purpose of the description of the present invention, the types of particulates principally to be separated from the fluid stream passing through the fluid separation system are those particulates that may be caught up in the fluid stream when the fluid is flowing, but that may otherwise float, sink, or be suspended within the fluid when the fluid is substantially stagnant. Such particulates will be referred to herein as neutrally-buoyant particulates. Examples of such particulates include, but are not limited to, newspapers, plastic and paper bags, envelopes, leaves, branches, and anything else that may not otherwise always float or always sink under all fluid movement conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The screening apparatus is preferably combined with a diverter element of a separation system, such as a baffle, wherein the diverter is arranged to shape fluid flow patterns and to prevent floating particulates from exiting the separation system. More particularly, the screening apparatus aids the diverter by capturing any entrained or neutrally-buoyant floatables from circumventing the diverter without substantially reducing fluid flow rate past the diverter. The screening apparatus is substantially porous and may extend from and beyond the diverter. The objects of the present invention may be further advanced by the addition of a secondary screening apparatus of the present invention. The secondary screening apparatus is designed to capture floating particulates, particularly when the fluid surface elevation in the separation system is relatively high. As the fluid surface elevation is lowered under reduced fluid flow conditions, the secondary screening apparatus retains a portion of the floating particulates above the fluid surface elevation for subsequent removal. The secondary screening apparatus thereby reduces the amount of floating particulates in the separation system that may block the system exit. Further, the secondary screening apparatus may allow any particulates residing thereon to dry out when the fluid surface elevation drops. That drying slows particulate decomposition and may make particulate removal easier. Moreover, the retention of the particulates out of the fluid on the secondary screening apparatus prevents the leaching out of any contaminants retained on those particulates into the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided for separating particulates, including floating, non-floating, and neutrally-buoyant particulates, from a fluid. The apparatus includes a tank having a bottom and interior sidewalls to define a storage chamber, an inlet at a first location on the interior sidewalls for receiving the fluid, and an outlet at a second location on the interior sidewalls for transferring the fluid out of the tank, a baffle positioned in the tank and having a lower portion including a bottom spaced above the bottom of the tank, and a screen positioned in the tank, wherein the screen extends from the bottom of the baffle into the lower portion of the storage chamber. The screen may be fabricated of a porous material such as perforated metal, for example, but is not limited thereto. One portion of the screen may be porous while another portion is non-porous. The leading edge of the screen, defined as that portion of the screen first contacted by the fluid stream within the storage chamber prior to exiting the storage chamber, may be non-porous. The apparatus may also include a second screen spaced above the substantially vertically oriented screen, wherein the second screen is substantially horizontally oriented and positioned above the expected resting fluid surface in the tank. In an alternative embodiment, the second screen may be of conical shape. The apparatus may also include a collection weir, wherein the second screen may be separate from, or removably affixed to, the collection weir. The combination of the collection weir and the second screen including a port through which fluid from the storage chamber passes before passing onto the second screen. The bottom surface of the second screen is preferably disposed above a crown of the tank inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the invention, an apparatus to improve the separation of particulates, including neutrally-buoyant particulates, from a fluid passing into a separation tank including an inlet, an outlet, and an arrangement for diverting at least a portion of the fluid from the inlet into the tank prior to the fluid exiting via the outlet is provided. The apparatus is a screen positionable within the tank and configured to filter out relatively large particulates from the diverted fluid prior to the fluid exiting the tank via the outlet, the screen is further configured to minimize the inhibition of fluid flow from the tank to the outlet. The screen is fabricated of a porous material such as perforated metal, and one portion may be porous while another is non-porous, the non-porous portion preferably being the leading edge of the screen. The apparatus may include a second screen spaced above the substantially vertically oriented screen, wherein the second screen is substantially horizontally oriented and positioned above the expected resting fluid surface in the tank. Further, the second screen may form part of a collection weir system, the combination of the collection weir and the second screen including a port through which fluid from the tank passes before passing onto the second screen.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A separation system <b>10</b> including a screen apparatus of the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the system <b>10</b> includes a tank <b>11</b> having an inlet pipe socket <b>50</b> and an outlet pipe socket <b>60</b>. The tank <b>11</b> is preferably made of concrete but may alternatively be fabricated in whole or in parts of metal, plastic, such as fiberglass, or other suitable materials. It may be fabricated of an existing manhole or manhole design and modified in the manner to be described herein. The inlet pipe socket <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is used to connect the tank <b>11</b> to an upstream fluid source or transfer system, such as through an upstream conduit (not shown). Similarly, the outlet pipe socket <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is used to connect the tank to a downstream fluid transfer system, such as through a downstream conduit (not shown). For example, the upstream fluid transfer system may include a drainage system from a roadway or a parking lot and the downstream fluid transfer system may include a municipal water treatment plant or natural or artificial surface waters. It is to be understood that the tank <b>11</b> may not be specifically connected to an upstream conduit transfer arrangement, nor to a downstream conduit transfer arrangement. Instead, fluid may enter the tank <b>11</b> through some form of inlet, and may exit the tank <b>11</b> through some form of outlet, including spilling directly out of the tank onto or into an unspecified container, body of fluid, or any sort of receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The tank <b>11</b> includes an inlet <b>12</b> associated with the inlet pipe socket <b>50</b>, an outlet <b>13</b> associated with the outlet pipe socket <b>60</b>, a diverter for directing fluid flow and/or for trapping particulates, such as baffle <b>14</b>, and a screen <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The tank <b>11</b> establishes a storage chamber <b>16</b> defined by a tank bottom <b>17</b>, sidewalls <b>18</b> in a cylindrical form that may alternatively be in a polygonal form, and a lid <b>19</b>. The lid <b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> substantially completely covers the tank <b>11</b> and may include an access port with access port cover <b>72</b> for accessing the interior of the storage chamber <b>16</b> for maintenance purposes without removing the entire lid <b>19</b>. Alternatively, the height of the sidewalls <b>18</b> and the baffle <b>14</b> may be set to ensure that they are above the highest possible fluid surface elevation, thereby eliminating the need for a lid while allowing the interior of the tank <b>11</b> to be open for inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The baffle <b>14</b> is located within the tank <b>11</b> as a sectional wall removably attachable to an interior side <b>20</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b>. The baffle <b>14</b> may optionally be positioned within the tank <b>11</b> by means other than attachment to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. For example, it may be slottingly fitted into the tank <b>11</b>, attached to the bottom <b>17</b> of the tank <b>11</b>, or suspended within the tank <b>11</b>. The baffle <b>14</b> extends downward from a top area <b>21</b> of the tank <b>11</b> to a point above the tank bottom <b>17</b> and effectively divides the tank <b>11</b> into a bypass region behind the baffle <b>14</b> and a treatment region that is the storage chamber <b>16</b> in front of and below the baffle <b>14</b>. An inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> is configured to prevent floating particulates from exiting the storage chamber <b>16</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an outer sidewall <b>30</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and the screen <b>100</b> are spaced from the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. The tank <b>11</b> may include a flow control system <b>40</b> designed to aid in the shaping of fluid flowing into the storage chamber <b>16</b> and an outlet tube <b>50</b> that reduces the likelihood of any floating material, such as oil, exiting the outlet <b>13</b> through the screen <b>100</b>. The outlet tube <b>50</b> preferably extends below the expected fluid surface elevation such that any floatables passing through the screen <b>100</b> would be trapped under the flow control system <b>40</b>. A tube arrangement of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may not be desired or required for a separation system having a solid structure, such as a baffle, extending below flow control system <b>40</b>. Instead, an outlet port may be used, as any floating particulates would be trapped by the solid structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the baffle <b>14</b> includes a baffle port <b>27</b> spaced from the tank inlet <b>12</b>. The baffle port <b>27</b> is preferably configured to direct flow entering the tank <b>11</b> at the tank inlet <b>12</b> in a manner that generates a fluid flow tangential to the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle and the interior side <b>20</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. The baffle <b>14</b> may terminate at or below the level of the flow control system <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The shape and dimensions of the baffle port <b>27</b> may be varied or selected as a function of the particular flow conditions to be expected. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one embodiment of the baffle port <b>27</b> is shaped to have a smaller opening nearer the inlet <b>12</b> and increase in size and extending downwardly toward the tank bottom <b>17</b> moving away from the inlet <b>12</b>. As a result, under low fluid flow conditions, the fluid is restricted from immediately entering the storage chamber <b>16</b> through the baffle port <b>27</b> as it passes between the outer sidewall of the baffle <b>14</b> and weir <b>24</b> until reaching the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b>. That shaping of the baffle port <b>27</b> enables the fluid to enter the storage chamber <b>16</b> tangentially. The noted shape of the baffle port <b>27</b> also allows relatively high fluid flows to enter the storage chamber <b>16</b> without unnecessary restriction. A baffle port <b>27</b> of constant dimensions would be less effective in regulating fluid flow under all flow conditions. Under relatively low flow conditions, the weir <b>24</b> diverts all fluid into the storage chamber <b>16</b>. Under relatively high flow conditions, the baffle port <b>27</b> becomes submerged and floating particulates within the storage chamber <b>16</b> are retained therein by the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and that portion of the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank not behind the baffle <b>14</b>. Eventually, the flow rate is such that the fluid surface elevation exceeds the height of the weir <b>24</b> and bypass occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, the tank <b>11</b> enables the separation of particulates from a fluid. The fluid enters the tank <b>11</b> via the tank inlet <b>12</b> and initially passes behind the baffle <b>14</b>. The fluid then passes through the baffle port <b>27</b> to the interior sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle where a swirling motion is established along the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. The swirling motion of the fluid directs floating particulates to the center of the storage chamber <b>16</b> at or near the surface water elevation, dependent upon fluid flow rate, as indicated above. Non-floating particulates are directed downwardly to the tank bottom <b>17</b> and swept to the center of the tank <b>11</b>. The treated fluid then passes through the screen <b>100</b>, and out of the tank <b>11</b> via the outlet <b>13</b>, either directly or through outlet tube <b>50</b>. The screen <b>100</b> aids in supplemental filtering of neutrally-buoyant particulates from the fluid prior to the fluid exiting. That is, the screen <b>100</b> is preferably positioned within the tank <b>11</b> between where floating particulates are expected to accumulate above and non-floating particulates are expected to accumulate below. The weir <b>24</b> diverts fluid through the baffle port <b>27</b> and forms part of a bypass arrangement wherein relatively high fluid flows result in a portion of the fluid passing from the inlet <b>12</b> to the outlet <b>13</b> without being treated in the storage chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the screen <b>100</b> includes an upper screen portion <b>101</b> removably attachable to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. When the tank <b>11</b> is deployed for use in treating fluid, the baffle <b>14</b> and the screen <b>100</b> are preferably oriented substantially vertically. The screen <b>100</b> further includes a first or leading edge side screen flange <b>102</b> at screen leading edge <b>104</b>, and a second or trailing edge side screen flange <b>103</b> at screen trailing edge <b>105</b>, for removable attachment of the screen <b>100</b> to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. The screen <b>100</b> preferably extends downwardly from the baffle <b>14</b> into the lower portion of the storage chamber <b>16</b>, extending closer to the tank bottom <b>17</b> than does the baffle <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a bottom portion of the screen <b>100</b> includes screen extension <b>106</b> extending from the screen <b>100</b> to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b> in the region of the tank <b>11</b> behind the screen <b>100</b>. The screen extension <b>106</b> prevents particulates such as neutrally-buoyant particulates from passing up behind the screen <b>100</b> to the tank outlet <b>13</b>. The screen extension <b>106</b> may be made of the same material as is the main body of the screen <b>100</b>. The screen extension <b>106</b> is preferably configured to allow any relatively small particulates that may be located behind the baffle <b>14</b> to pass therethrough and fall to the tank bottom <b>17</b> of the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The screen <b>100</b> is preferably configured and arranged to aid in the separation of neutrally buoyant particulates from the fluid in the storage chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The baffle <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> is formed with a single curvature aspect to direct the fluid flow within the tank <b>11</b>, and an angled weir <b>24</b> to direct the fluid flow through the baffle port <b>27</b>. The screen <b>100</b> is preferably similarly curved to minimize fluid flow pattern disruption. Alternatively, the baffle <b>14</b> may be formed of a complex curvature, and the weir <b>24</b> may also be curved. If the baffle <b>14</b> is shaped with such complex curvature, the screen <b>100</b> may also be similarly curved, although that is not specifically required, as the fluid flow pattern is likely already established by the time the screen leading edge <b>104</b> is reached and the likelihood of producing turbulence with a screen curvature different from the baffle curvature at the screen trailing edge <b>105</b> is minimized; however, a screen <b>100</b> of different curvature would likely complicate the manufacturing of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The screen <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> includes a plurality of openings that make it substantially completely porous. The flanges <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may be solid or porous, dependent upon the method for affixing the screen <b>100</b> to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. The screen <b>100</b> may be fabricated of a metallic material, such as a perforated metal, or a non-metallic material such as a plastic screen. In an alternative embodiment of the screen <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the screen leading edge <b>104</b> of the screen <b>100</b> is nonporous. That is, the material selected to fabricate the screen <b>100</b> may be made with a porous section and a non-porous section. Alternatively, the screen <b>100</b> may be fabricated of two pieces joined together, one solid and the other porous. The solid leading edge <b>104</b> of the screen <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is designed to improve fluid velocity distribution at the tank-to-screen interface. The improved fluid velocity distribution reduces particulate accumulation on the screen <b>100</b> at that interface. Particulates accumulating at the leading edge <b>104</b> may cause a build up that would prevent follow-on particulates from reaching the screen <b>100</b> downstream, thereby accelerating the need for screen maintenance. The extent to which the leading edge <b>104</b> remains nonporous should be determined by the expected flow conditions, maintenance scheduling, and the operational environment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a supplemental second screen <b>200</b> may be deployed in the tank <b>11</b> as a means to filter floating particulates. When the tank <b>11</b> is deployed for use in fluid filtering, the second screen <b>200</b> is preferably oriented substantially horizontally with respect to the centerline of the tank <b>11</b>. However, it is to be understood that the second screen <b>200</b> may be oriented at an angle that aligns it other than horizontally with respect to the centerline of the tank <b>11</b>. The second screen <b>200</b> includes a plurality of openings that make it substantially porous. A collection weir system <b>201</b> includes a screen port <b>202</b> formed as part of an arcuate frame <b>203</b> that is removably attachable to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b> at frame flange <b>204</b>. The second screen <b>200</b> is preferably retained in place by the frame <b>203</b> at a position above the crown elevation of inlet <b>12</b> such that the baffle port of the baffle <b>14</b> will become fully submerged when the fluid surface elevation reaches the second screen <b>200</b>. The frame <b>203</b> may be positioned above the second screen <b>200</b> as an frame upper section <b>205</b>. Alternatively, the frame <b>203</b> may be a split frame having a frame upper section <b>205</b> above the position of the second screen <b>200</b>, and a frame lower section <b>206</b> below the screen <b>200</b>. For either version, the frame upper section <b>205</b> further includes a weir plate <b>207</b>. The height of the weir plate <b>207</b> in combination with the frame upper section <b>205</b> in combination define the fluid surface level at which fluid in the screen port <b>202</b>, and any floating particulates contained therein, spills out above the upper portion of the second screen <b>200</b>. The second screen <b>200</b> may also be used without the collection weir system <b>201</b> and without the screen <b>100</b>. In that embodiment, the second screen <b>200</b> includes the screen port <b>202</b> and is positioned above the resting fluid surface to retain thereon floating particulates entering through the screen port <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, in operation, the second screen <b>200</b> in combination with the arcuate frame <b>203</b> provide a means for keeping floating particulates in the center of the tank <b>11</b>, particularly at relatively low fluid flow rates, and in capturing floating particulates when the fluid surface elevation in the tank is very high. Specifically, storage chamber fluid, represented by arrow <b>210</b>, swirling in the storage chamber <b>16</b> has a fluid surface elevation that rises with fluid entry into the tank <b>11</b>. Between storm events, the standing elevation of the fluid is at the bottom level of the outlet <b>13</b>. Under relatively low flow conditions, that level is substantially maintained, and the frame lower section <b>206</b> acts to capture floating particulates as a baffle, but does so in a manner that keeps the floating particulates away from baffle <b>14</b> and screen <b>100</b>. That function by the frame lower portion <b>206</b> improves the fluid flow either through the screen <b>100</b>, or directly under the baffle <b>14</b>, by reducing floating particulate blockage.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the fluid flow rate increases into the tank <b>11</b>, the fluid elevation surface rises. The frame lower portion <b>206</b> continues to center any floating particulates in the tank <b>11</b>. Further, the underside of second screen <b>200</b> blocks floating particulates from entering the upper region of the storage chamber <b>16</b> as the fluid elevation continues to rise. When the fluid elevation exceeds the screen <b>200</b>, submerging the baffle port, the fluid and any floating particulates not otherwise trapped on the underside of the screen <b>200</b> enter the screen port <b>202</b>, represented by arrow <b>211</b>. When the fluid surface elevation exceeds the height of the frame upper portion <b>205</b> and weir plate <b>207</b>, the fluid containing floating particulates, represented by arrows <b>212</b>, spills over into an area above the second screen <b>200</b>. As the incoming fluid flow rate subsides and the fluid surface elevation drops, floating particulates in the fluid <b>212</b> are captured on the upper surface of the second screen <b>200</b>. These floating particulates are thereby prevented from re-entering the lower part of the storage chamber <b>16</b> where the outlet is located and cannot block the fluid from exiting the tank <b>11</b>. Those floating particulates not captured by second screen <b>200</b> recede back into port <b>202</b> and are prevented from re-entering the storage chamber <b>16</b> by frame lower portion <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The screen <b>100</b> of the present invention improves the separation of entrained floating or neutrally-buoyant particulates from a treated fluid by trapping them prior to exiting the tank <b>11</b>. The second screen <b>200</b> and the collection weir system <b>201</b> provide supplemental means for capturing floating particulates and/or isolating floating particulates from the area of the storage chamber <b>16</b> where the treated fluid passes to the tank outlet <b>13</b>. The screen apparatus and the supplemental screen apparatus improve particulate removal for a system for separation floating and non-floating particulates from a fluid stream. Either or both devices may also extend maintenance periods by reducing blockage situations.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment of the second screen <b>200</b>′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the second screen <b>200</b>′ is configured to direct floating particulates toward a second screen port <b>202</b>′, effectively replacing the diverting function of the collection weir system <b>201</b>. Specifically, the second screen <b>200</b>′ is conical in shape, and preferably a truncated cone shape. The second screen <b>200</b>′ includes a second screen port <b>202</b>′ that is shown substantially centered in the space between the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b> and the interior sidewall of the baffle <b>14</b>, but may alternatively be positioned off center. A screen apex <b>220</b> of the second screen <b>200</b>′ is preferably positioned farthest above the resting fluid surface. The preferred conical shape of the second screen <b>200</b>′ directs floating particulates toward the second screen port <b>202</b>′ as the fluid elevation rises. When the fluid surface exceeds the top of the second screen port <b>202</b>′, any floating particulates therein spill over above the second screen <b>200</b>′ and remain thereon as the fluid recedes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A first alternative embodiment of the fluid diversion and bypass portion comprising the baffle arrangement and the bypass of the separation system <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. This first alternative embodiment includes an upper baffle <b>300</b> and a lower baffle <b>310</b> positionable within the tank <b>11</b> shown in the other figures. The tank <b>11</b> remains configured to separate particulates from a fluid entering the storage chamber <b>16</b> in the manner previously described. A tank including the alternative arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> continues to function as a means to separate particulates from a fluid entering the tank, however, the alternative arrangement enables a greater volume of fluid to bypass the tank storage chamber, such as storage chamber <b>16</b>, under relatively high flow conditions. The upper baffle <b>300</b> is preferably spaced further from the tank interior side, but at smaller radius of curvature than the baffle <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example. The radius of curvature is preferably maintained to be greater than or equal to approximately half the radius of curvature of the tank. This arrangement allows a greater volume of fluid to bypass the tank storage chamber while simultaneously maintaining the development of separation-enhancing swirling patterns in the storage chamber. That is, the combination of the upper baffle <b>300</b> and the lower baffle <b>310</b> baffle continues to isolate the storage chamber from the bypass in the manner previously described. Systems incorporating an upper baffle with a radius of curvature smaller that one half the radius of curvature of the tank, for example, can have little or no development of swirling flow in the storage chamber resulting in poor separation performance. The upper baffle <b>300</b> is spaced from the interior side by bypass flow control system <b>40</b>′. The upper baffle <b>300</b> includes a bottom <b>301</b> that is approximately at the level of the bottom of the bypass flow control system <b>40</b>′. The lower baffle <b>310</b> is spaced more closely to the tank interior side than the upper baffle, but below the bypass flow control system <b>40</b>′ and at a radius of curvature more closely matching the interior dimensions of the tank within which the baffle and bypass are positioned. The lower baffle <b>310</b> includes a bottom <b>311</b> arranged to be spaced above the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bypass flow control system <b>40</b>′ includes a bypass plate <b>41</b>′, an inlet flow control zone <b>42</b>′, an outlet flow control zone <b>43</b>′, a weir <b>44</b>′, a head equalization baffle <b>45</b>′, and an outlet port <b>50</b>′. The dimensions of the bypass plate <b>41</b>′ define the displacement of the upper baffle <b>300</b> from the interior side of the tank. The upper baffle <b>300</b> includes an upper baffle port <b>302</b> through which fluid entering the tank passes from the inlet flow control zone <b>42</b>′ into the tank storage chamber. The weir <b>44</b>′ diverts fluid through the baffle port <b>302</b> into the tank storage chamber. Treated fluid within the storage chamber passes behind the lower baffle <b>310</b> and into the outlet flow control zone <b>43</b>′ through the outlet port <b>50</b>′. As the fluid entering the tank <b>11</b> reaches a relatively high flow rate, the baffle port <b>302</b> becomes fully submerged, with a portion of the fluid diverted through the baffle port <b>302</b> while the balance spills over the weir <b>44</b>′, bypassing the treatment provided by the storage chamber. Particulates in the fluid entering the storage chamber through the baffle port <b>302</b> continue to be treated as before, with floating particulates retained in the upper portion of the storage chamber by the upper baffle <b>300</b> and, to an extent, the lower baffle <b>310</b>, and nonfloating particulates retained in the bottom of the tank. The head equalization baffle <b>45</b>′ moderates the flow rate through the storage chamber when flow over weir <b>44</b>′ occurs. Low flows passing only through the baffle port <b>302</b> are allowed to freely discharge through outlet port <b>50</b>′ and underneath the head equalization baffle <b>45</b>′. However, as flow crests the weir <b>44</b>′ and enters the area above outlet port <b>50</b>′, the additional flow is restricted by the head equalization baffle <b>45</b>′ and begins to rapidly submerge the outlet port <b>50</b>′. This pooling of fluid creates an additional resistance to flow through the outlet port <b>50</b>′. This arrangement results in a relatively consistent flow rate through the storage chamber even as flow through the entire system increases. When the fluid level in the outlet flow control zone <b>43</b>′ rises above the level of the head equalization baffle <b>45</b>′, it spills over and exits the tank. The top of the head equalization baffle <b>45</b>′ is preferably at a level equal to or higher than the top of the weir <b>44</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The portion of the separation system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> may further include a wedge <b>315</b> positioned between the weir <b>44</b>′ and the back side of the baffle <b>300</b> at about the crown of the baffle port <b>302</b> at the weir <b>44</b>′ to baffle <b>300</b> interface. The wedge <b>315</b> is configured and arranged to prevent particulates from becoming wedged into the space occupied by the wedge <b>315</b>. When the wedge <b>315</b> is not placed in what is effectively a dead space, particulates, and floating particulates specifically transported by relatively high fluid flows to and over the weir <b>44</b>′, become entrapped in that space and disrupt fluid flow. The wedge <b>315</b> is preferably shaped to conform to the dimensions of the space between the baffle <b>300</b> and the weir <b>44</b>′. The use of the wedge <b>315</b> is not limited to deployment in a separation system for relatively high fluid bypass such as the system represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. It may also be used in any separation system in which a baffle with port and fluid bypass behind the baffle are used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A second alternative embodiment of the fluid diversion and bypass portion of the system of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The second alternative embodiment is similar to the first alternative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> as it is intended to provide for high fluid volume bypass when needed and as compared to the arrangement of the separation system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It is also similar to the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> in that baffle <b>300</b> remains in use; however, the lower baffle <b>310</b> is replaced by screen <b>320</b>. The screen <b>320</b> is positioned below bypass plate <b>41</b>′ and is attachable to the interior side of the tank and or the underside of the bypass plate <b>41</b>′. The screen <b>320</b> extends downwardly into the lower portion of the tank storage chamber from the bypass plate <b>41</b>′, whereas the bottom of the upper baffle <b>300</b> substantially terminates at the bypass plate <b>41</b>′. The radius of curvature of the screen <b>320</b> is greater than the radius of curvature of the baffle <b>300</b> in this alternative embodiment of the fluid diversion and bypass portion of the separation system.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As earlier noted, when a screen forms part of the separation system, and that screen is positioned within the tank at or below the level of the bypass flow control system <b>40</b>′ (or <b>40</b> for the first embodiment of the separation system <b>10</b>), the outlet tube <b>50</b> is preferred over the outlet port <b>50</b>′ as the storage chamber outlet so that any floating particulates that pass through the screen <b>320</b> (or screen <b>100</b>) remain trapped under the bypass plate <b>41</b>′ (or bypass plate <b>41</b>). When a solid structure such as the lower baffle <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> is used instead of the screen <b>100</b> or screen <b>320</b>, such floating particulates are blocked by that structure and the outlet tube <b>50</b> is not required, and the outlet port <b>50</b>′ may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A bottom portion of the screen <b>320</b> includes screen extension <b>321</b> extending from the screen <b>320</b> back to the interior side of the tank behind the screen <b>320</b>, substantially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> regarding screen <b>100</b> and screen extension <b>106</b>. The screen extension <b>321</b> prevents particulates such as neutrally-buoyant particulates from passing up behind the screen <b>320</b> to the tank outlet via outlet tube <b>50</b>. The screen extension <b>321</b> may be made of the same material as is the main body of the screen <b>320</b>. The screen extension <b>321</b> is preferably configured to allow any relatively small particulates that may be located behind the baffle <b>300</b> to pass therethrough and fall to the bottom of the tank storage chamber. The screen <b>320</b> and the screen extension <b>321</b> are preferably configured and arranged to aid in the separation of neutrally buoyant particulates from the fluid in the storage chamber. The second alternative embodiment of the portion of the separation system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may further include the wedge <b>315</b> described above.</p>
