<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to racks and other types of chassis for receiving equipment, including but not limited to electronic equipment and the like, and more particularly, to a fixture for mounting such equipment in regions which are difficult to access.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Support frames, generally referred to in the industry as “racks”, are conventionally used to receive desired electrical components such as circuit boards, modules or similar equipment and to support the received electrical components in desired position. Such racks can either be open, or enclosed to develop a housing (or cabinet) for receiving desired equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Racks of this general type are conventionally comprised of a series of framing elements which are combined to develop an enclosure for the equipment which is to be received in the resulting structure. To this end, a series of brackets is generally connected between a pair of support plates to develop an open enclosure for receiving desired equipment. The brackets are then provided with a series of holes for cooperating with equipment which is to be received in the resulting rack.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In use, electrical equipment which is to be mounted in the rack is positioned between the opposing brackets and is attached to the brackets using conventional hardware. Electrical connections between electrical components mounted in the rack and support components for interfacing with the mounted electrical components (for example, power strips, hub switches, firewalls, etc.) are then established, generally to the rear of the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To facilitate servicing of the electrical equipment mounted in the rack, including any system supporting components, it is often required to access such equipment and the electrical interconnections associated with such equipment through the rear of the rack, between the rearward brackets which comprise the rack. To permit free access to such equipment from the rear of the rack, it is generally necessary for such equipment to be located in regions of the rack where access will not be hampered by any interfering structures. This generally requires support components such as power strips, hub switches and firewalls to occupy regions of the rack which could otherwise be used to receive primary electrical components such as circuit boards, modules or similar electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regions exist within the confines of the rack which could otherwise accept the relatively small support components which are used to interface with the remainder of the system, but for the need to be able to conveniently access such components. For example, power strips have at times been placed along the upper and/or lower regions of the rack, regions which are often used to house ducting and fans for ventilating the rack and the equipment mounted in the rack. Such placement avoids the need to position the power strips in regions of the rack which could otherwise be used to receive primary electrical components. However, placement of the power strips along the upper and/or lower regions of the rack has the corresponding disadvantage that significantly longer power cables are then required to connect the power strips with the electrical components which are to be supplied with power for operation. Moreover, some of the more recent racks which have been developed already make use of such space, in such cases preventing components from being positioned in such regions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would also be possible for relatively small support components such as power strips, hub switches and firewalls to be located in regions of the rack which are blocked by the support brackets which form the rack, but for the need to have to access the support components which are located in such “blind” spots, which will hereinafter be referred to as areas of “limited access”. This would then free remaining space, which is otherwise freely accessible, to receive primary electrical components such as circuit boards, modules and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present invention, relatively small components can be received within regions of limited access using an installation table including a pair of mounting plates which are pivotally connected to each other at a corner of the respective mounting plates. One of the mounting plates includes a mounting bracket for fixed connection to a framing element of the rack, and the other mounting plate includes a surface for receiving a desired component. Rotation of the mounting plate receiving the desired component relative to the mounting plate fixed to the framing element permits the component to be conveniently accessed when servicing is desired, and returned to the region of limited access during normal operations of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A channel is preferably provided to guide and limit movement of the mounting plate which receives the component. A locking mechanism is preferably provided for securing the mounting plate and the component it receives in desired position during normal operations of the system.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> show a preferred embodiment of the installation table <b>1</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the installation table <b>1</b> is shown in a closed, or retracted position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show the installation table <b>1</b> in an open, or deployed position. The installation table <b>1</b> is generally comprised of a pair of mounting plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> which are separated by an intermediate, bearing plate <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The upper mounting plate <b>2</b> includes a surface <b>5</b> for receiving desired components as will be described more fully below. In the configuration illustrated, the surface <b>5</b> is planar, with an overall rectangular shape, and one or more apertures <b>6</b> are provided in the surface <b>5</b> of the mounting plate <b>2</b> for securely receiving a component. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the underside <b>7</b> of the mounting plate <b>2</b> includes a pin <b>8</b> located in a corner <b>9</b> of the mounting plate <b>2</b>, and a follower <b>10</b> on a side of the mounting plate <b>2</b> which opposes the pin <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> includes a surface <b>11</b> having a pair of apertures <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and a pair of flanges <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> for use in mounting and support of the installation table <b>1</b> as will be described more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the configuration illustrated, the surface <b>11</b> is planar, with an overall rectangular shape, and preferably corresponds in shape to the overall configuration of the mounting plate <b>2</b>. The surface <b>11</b> of the mounting plate <b>3</b>, and the cooperating surface <b>5</b> of the mounting plate <b>2</b>, are preferably planar in configuration to effectively mate with any of a variety of components. The surface <b>5</b> and/or the surface <b>11</b> can also have non-planar configurations, and additional openings (not shown) can also be provided, to facilitate the mating of components having irregular shapes with the installation table <b>1</b>. The configuration of the surface <b>5</b> will ordinarily complement the configuration of the surface <b>11</b>, although the use of surfaces <b>5</b>, <b>11</b> having different configurations is equally possible if appropriate to receive a desired component.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aperture <b>12</b> is located, and is sized to slidingly receive the pin <b>8</b> associated with the upper mounting plate <b>2</b>. In this way, the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> and the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> are pivotally connected to each other at the corner <b>9</b> of the respective mounting plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. Pivotal connection at the corner <b>9</b> is preferred to develop a clockwise rotation of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> relative to the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> as the mounting plate <b>2</b> is deployed. A pivotal connection at the opposing corner <b>16</b> is preferred to develop a counter-clockwise rotation of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> relative to the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> as the mounting plate <b>2</b> is deployed. Other placements for the resulting pivot point are also possible, if desired for a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The aperture <b>13</b> is provided to receive and cooperate with a locking mechanism <b>17</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The locking mechanism <b>17</b> is itself known, and generally includes an outer barrel <b>18</b> and an inner plunger <b>19</b> separated by a spring <b>20</b>. The outer barrel <b>18</b> is fixed to the surface <b>11</b> of the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> so that the plunger <b>19</b> extends through the aperture <b>13</b>. Retraction of the plunger <b>19</b>, for example, by grasping the cap <b>21</b> of the plunger <b>19</b>, causes the tip <b>22</b> of the plunger <b>19</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to withdraw from the aperture <b>13</b> against the forces developed by the spring <b>20</b>, establishing a position for releasing the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> for rotation as will be described more fully below. Release of the cap <b>21</b> of the plunger <b>19</b> permits the tip <b>22</b> to resume its passive position, once again extending through the aperture <b>13</b>, and establishing a position for locking the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> in a closed position, as will be described more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The flange <b>14</b> depends from an edge <b>23</b> of the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>, and includes an aperture <b>24</b> for receiving conventional hardware for mounting the installation table <b>1</b> to a rack as will be described more fully below. A corner <b>25</b> preferably extends from an end <b>26</b> of the flange <b>14</b> to assist in stabilizing the installation table <b>1</b> against the rack which is to receive it, by preventing longitudinal rotation of the installation table <b>1</b> relative to the support structure which receives the installation table <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The flange <b>15</b> depends from an edge <b>27</b> of the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>, which is preferably adjacent to the edge <b>26</b> which receives the flange <b>14</b>, to provide vertical support for the installation table <b>1</b> and the component which is to be mounted using the installation table <b>1</b>. The shape and configuration of the flanges <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> can be freely varied, as needed, to suit a particular rack configuration or to effectively receive and support a desired component.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The upper mounting plate <b>2</b> and the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> can be directly combined to yield an effective structure for receiving components and for mounting the received components in a rack. It would also be possible to lubricate the interface between such components, to provide enhanced operation, or to separate such components with a friction-reducing (for example, a friction-reducing plastic) layer, if desired. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the intermediate, bearing plate <b>4</b> is positioned between the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> and the lower mounting plate <b>3</b> to enhance operations of the installation table <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the surface <b>30</b> of the bearing plate <b>4</b> is similar in configuration to the surface <b>5</b> of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> and the surface <b>11</b> of the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>. To this end, the surface <b>30</b> is preferably planar, with an overall rectangular shape. As with the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> and the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>, the configuration of the surface <b>30</b> of the bearing plate <b>4</b> can freely be varied to suit a particular application, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The bearing plate <b>4</b> includes an aperture <b>31</b> and a channel <b>32</b>. The aperture <b>31</b> is sized and positioned to cooperate with the pin <b>8</b> of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> so that, following assembly, the aperture <b>31</b> is in general alignment with the pin <b>8</b> of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> and the receiving aperture <b>12</b> of the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>. The channel <b>32</b> preferably receives a guide <b>33</b> which operates to facilitate rotation of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> relative to the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The guide <b>33</b> and the channel <b>32</b> are complementary and are both generally arc-shaped in overall configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Central regions <b>34</b> of the guide <b>33</b> are open, and following assembly of the installation table <b>1</b>, slidingly receive the follower <b>10</b> depending from the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> for movement along an arcuate path which is defined by the central regions <b>34</b>. The guide <b>33</b> is in turn slidingly received within the channel <b>32</b>, for movement along an arcuate path which is defined by the channel <b>32</b>. A pair of tabs <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> project from opposing sides of the guide <b>33</b>, and are received in a corresponding pair of detents <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> formed in the bearing plate <b>4</b>. As is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the tab <b>35</b> associated with the detent <b>37</b> is preferably smaller than the tab <b>36</b> associated with the detent <b>38</b> so that the tabs <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> simultaneously contact the ends of the detents <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> when the guide <b>33</b> assumes either its fully extended (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or fully retracted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and the guide <b>33</b> can be formed of any of a variety of materials. Plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> formed of metal are preferred, although plastic materials could also be used, if desired. The guide is preferably formed of a plastic material, to facilitate movement of the upper plate <b>2</b> relative to the lower plate <b>3</b>, although the guide <b>33</b> could also be formed of a metal if desired. A particularly useful material for forming the guide <b>33</b> is a friction-reducing plastic material, such as “Celcon GC-25A”, a glass-filled acetal copolymer which is available from the Celanese Corporation of America.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show an installation table <b>1</b> mounted to the support <b>40</b> of a rack for receiving desired components (not shown). The support <b>40</b> has the usual shape of an angle-bracket, and includes a series of apertures <b>41</b> for receiving conventional hardware (for example, screws, bolts, or other threaded, or other types of fasteners) in conventional fashion. In accordance with the present inventions the installation table <b>1</b> is positioned on an inside corner of the support <b>40</b>, with the flange <b>14</b> facing the rear of the support <b>40</b>. When in its desired position, and at its desired height, the aperture <b>24</b> in the flange <b>14</b> of the installation table <b>1</b> is aligned with one of the apertures <b>41</b> in the support <b>40</b>, and desired hardware (not shown) is inserted through the apertures <b>24</b>, <b>41</b> to fix the installation table <b>1</b> to the support <b>40</b>. This brings the corner <b>25</b> of the flange <b>14</b>, and the flange <b>15</b>, into engagement with the support <b>40</b>, providing structural and weight-bearing support for the installation table <b>1</b> and a component <b>42</b> (shown in phantom) received by the installation table <b>1</b>. An end of the component <b>42</b> is conveniently fixed to the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> using, for example, conventional hardware engaging the apertures <b>6</b> formed in the surface <b>5</b> of the mounting plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">To be noted is that the preferred rectangular shape for the plates <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> causes such structures to follow the contour of the adjacent support <b>40</b>, maximizing the support surfaces which are available for receiving a desired component. Also to be noted is that the pin <b>8</b> will then be located on the side of the installation table <b>1</b> about which the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> is to rotate, leaving the upper mounting plate <b>2</b> free to rotate relative to the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>. It will be understood that a mirror-image placement of such structures would be established for an installation table which is to be affixed to a support (not shown) positioned on an opposing side of the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Let it now be assumed that a servicing procedure is called for which requires the component <b>42</b> mounted to the installation table <b>1</b> to be accessed. Because such servicing would ordinarily take place from the rear of the rack (from the position <b>43</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>), the support <b>40</b> would then prevent the component <b>42</b> from being conveniently accessed. The installation table <b>1</b> allows the component <b>42</b> to be withdrawn from the region of limited access <b>44</b> which receives the component <b>42</b> to permit convenient servicing of the component <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To accomplish this, and additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the cap <b>21</b> of the plunger <b>19</b> of the locking mechanism <b>17</b>, if used, is grasped and pulled down. This operates to release the tip <b>22</b> of the plunger <b>19</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The component <b>42</b>, or the upper mounting plate <b>2</b>, is grasped and rotated outwardly about the pivoting pin <b>8</b> to assume a deployed position which is preferably normal to the lower mounting plate <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In the fully deployed position, the guide <b>33</b> will be in its fully extended position and the follower <b>10</b> will lie at the outer end <b>45</b> of the central regions <b>34</b> of the guide <b>33</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this way, outward movement of the component <b>42</b> will be limited by interaction between the guide <b>33</b>, the channel <b>32</b> of the bearing plate <b>4</b> and the follower <b>10</b> of the upper mounting plate <b>2</b>. Convenient servicing of the component <b>42</b> can then proceed, as desired, with the component <b>42</b> (and the upper mounting plate <b>2</b>) in an orientation which laterally projects from the region <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Following desired servicing of the component <b>42</b>, the component <b>42</b> is conveniently pushed back along the path defined by the guide <b>33</b>. Initially, this will bring the follower <b>10</b> in contact with the end <b>46</b> of the guide <b>33</b>, in turn pushing the guide <b>33</b> into the channel <b>32</b>. The guide <b>33</b> will eventually come to a fully retracted position, with the follower <b>10</b> lying against the end <b>46</b> of the central regions <b>34</b> of the guide <b>33</b> and with the guide <b>33</b> fully retracted into the channel <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this way, the component <b>42</b> will be returned to the region <b>44</b>, which could not otherwise be accessed because of the blocking support <b>40</b>, and which could not otherwise be used to receive a component requiring any servicing. If a locking mechanism <b>17</b> is employed, the cap <b>21</b> of the plunger <b>19</b> would be grasped and retracted as the follower <b>10</b> moves to the end <b>46</b> of the guide <b>33</b>, serving to lock the upper mounting plate <b>2</b>, and the component <b>42</b>, in the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be understood that various changes in the details, materials and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the following claims.</p>
