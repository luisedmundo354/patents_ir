<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Such devices are used to control gas exchange valves in such a way, that it becomes possible to operate reciprocating engines without the throttle valve that would otherwise be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such a device is disclosed in DE 101 23 186 A1, for example. In this device, a rotating cam first drives a connecting link, which executes a pure oscillating rotary motion and carries a radial cam which is composed of a rest area and a lift area. The radial cam transfers the lifting curve necessary for actuation of the valve to the roller of a driven element similar to a cam follower which in turn actuates the valve. The desired different valve lifting curves are produced by the fact that the center of rotation of the connecting link is displaced on an arc-shaped path which is concentric to the roller of the driven element when it is in the position that it assumes when the valve is closed. The center of rotation is formed by a roller which is provided on the connecting link and which is supported in a non-positive manner on an arc-shaped track in the housing; this track is also concentric to the roller of the driven element, that is, it forms an equidistant to the path of the center of rotation and is designated as the courses. In addition, the roller on the connecting link is supported against a cam disk, whose angular position determines the position of the center of rotation on its arc-shaped path. However, the prior art device is encumbered by some disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">First, the roller on the connecting link only lies against the courses when the gas forces and inertial forces of the valve train are correspondingly oriented and the roller is actually supported on the courses. If this is not the case, which can happen when an overspeed occurs, for example, then the non-positive connection is lost and a liftoff occurs, which causes noise and even damage when it comes back down. In addition, it is relatively difficult to machine the coulisses, which are segments of an inside cylinder and cannot be machined in a continuous manner, and the commonly used housing materials are insufficiently hard for the contact between the roller and the courses. There is a disadvantage concerning mounting, which is that the valve gear housing cannot be set on the cylinder head in completely premounted form.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other devices of this type have been disclosed in which the center of rotation of the connecting link driven by the cam is supposed to be adjusted on a circular path (OS 195 32 334 A1; EP 0 717 174 A1; DE 101 64 493 A1). However, the previous publications do not contain any teaching about how to construct the devices to realize such adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is a common disadvantage of all devices that, due to manufacturing tolerances, as the valve strokes of the individual cylinders are reduced further for the purpose of controlling the load, the differences between the valve strokes of the individual cylinders become greater.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to create a device, which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art and allows secure control.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pursuant to the invention, the centers of rotation of the connecting links driven by the cams are restricted to the adjustment curve, that is they are guided by a positive fit. This ensures that the center of rotation of a connecting link cannot leave the adjustment curve, avoiding noise and damage which would result from it doing so. The design preferably realizes this feature by the fact that one or more connecting links are mounted on a cylindrical bolt on whose axis the centers of rotation lie, and that the axis of the bolt is restricted to the adjustment curve. If the active area on the driven element to which the radial cam of the connecting link transfers its motion is a circular cylinder, that is if it is formed by a roller, for example, it is possible to assume that the adjustment curve is arc-shaped and that its center coincides with the center of the circular cylindrical active area, that is, the roller.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such an adjustment curve is realized according to another inventive proposal by pendulum supports, each of whose first joints are connected with the cylinder head or the control housing, and each of whose second joints are connected with the bolt. In this arrangement, the axis common to the joints on the cylinder head side coincides with the axis of the mentioned cylindrical active areas on the driven element, and that of the bolt-side joints coincides with the axis of the bolt. This has the result that the force flows exclusively through flat contact areas on the shortest paths from the bolt to the cylinder head or the control housing. In particular, no forces are transferred through Hertzian stress on the cylinder head or the control housing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the driven elements of neighboring valves, whether they should be similar to a cam follower or straight, should have insufficient space between them for the above solution, then it is also possible, according to the inventive solution, for the bolt or its axis to be restricted to the adjustment curve with four-bar linkages formed from pendulum supports. The adjustment curve which can be realized in this way approximates the shape of an arc and matches it exactly at the design point, if the system lines meet in the center of this arc. The deviations outside the design point are taken up by hydraulic play compensation elements which are provided on the driven elements which are similar to a cam follower or also straight.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third embodiment of the inventive device involves guiding the bolt by a slide which is linearly adjustable in the control housing. This embodiment makes it possible to meet other, special space requirements. Relatively large contact areas are realized between the slide and the control housing, so that the strength properties of the housing material suffice in any case. The resulting adjustment curve is a straight line whose deviations from the shape of an arc are also taken up by play compensation elements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In all three embodiments, the position of the bolt or its axis on the respective adjustment curve is preferably determined by direct or indirect contact against one or more cam disks, which are put on one or more adjusting shafts that are connected in a torsionally rigid manner. The adjusting shaft or the adjusting axle can in turn be rotated or displaced through a suitable transmission or a connecting element by means of adjustment, for example an adjusting motor. Of course the adjustment can also be accomplished by hydraulic elements. If the bolt is guided by a linearly adjustable slide, the adjustment can also be accomplished directly from the adjusting motor through a spindle which has a movement thread.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">All embodiments also share the fact that the connecting links or their cam rollers have to be held in contact with the cams by special springs. This is immediately seen from the situation at zero lift, when there is cylinder cutout.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A variant of the three embodiments which is especially advantageous with regard to space and part variety consists of simultaneously making the bolt on which the connecting links are mounted in the form of an adjusting shaft by providing it with cam disks, mounting it so that it can rotate in the pendulum supports, the four-bar linkage, or the slide, and rotating it by means of adjustment, for example an adjusting motor, according to the desired valve lifting curve. In this variant, in the valve gear housing it is necessary to provide sliding blocks for the cam disks which are made of a material of increased hardness. Since, as a rule, the adjusting motor is arranged so that it is fixed to the housing, but the bolt or the control shaft is displaced parallel to itself during the adjustment movement, it is necessary to arrange a connection element between the two which allows this displacement. Depending on space conditions, this can be an articulated shaft, a Schmidt coupling, an Oldham coupling, or also a toothed gear or a chain gear. If it is hydraulically actuated, a lever mechanism is another option.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inventive device, including an adjusting motor or an adjusting device, can be separately provided for every valve of an engine, so that any combination of valve strokes or opening angles of the individual valves of an engine is possible, including the turning off of individual cylinders. However, as a rule common adjustment of several valves is provided. This applies especially for intake and exhaust valves of a cylinder in multiple-valve engines. For example, two intake valves can be actuated by a cam through a connecting link which has a radial cam for each valve. Since only one connecting link and only one bolt is present, both valves are adjusted together and in the same way. However, the inventive device also allows the common connecting link to have two different radial cams on it with the result of two different lifting curves on the two valves, despite the fact that they are adjusted together. This variant makes it possible, especially in the lowest load range, to open only one of the two valves. The special advantage of this possibility is that in the lowest load range it is possible to expose only very small cross sections which can be more precisely observed, if they are only exposed by one valve. In addition, opening only one of the intake valves makes it possible to produce swirl in the cylinder charge. The inventive device further expands the possibilities for producing different valve lifting curves for two intake or exhaust valves of a cylinder by the fact that two different cams and two connecting links are used with different radial cams. Nevertheless, the two valves can be adjusted together, since the two connecting links can be mounted on a common bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also possible to adjust the connecting links of a larger number of parallel valves together by an adjusting motor or mechanism, especially when it is mounted on a common bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since it is of great significance for the acceptance of variable valve actuation, that is also the inventive device, to keep the adjusting power small, and since it is higher when the device or its slip joints and links are in loaded condition than when they are in the load-free state that is present to a great extent when the valve is closed, the inventive device provides adjustment essentially during the common rest phases of all valves to be adjusted in common. These rest phases are derived from the signals of [sensors on] the crankshaft and the camshaft, and become shorter and shorter the more valves are adjusted together. Thus, the number of valves adjusted together is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The common adjustment of the intake and exhaust valves only of one cylinder in every case produces long rest phases that are “friendly” to adjustment. However, it also makes possible individual load control of the individual cylinders with an inventive adjustment strategy that involves controlling the torques of the individual cylinders for each load state of the entire engine. This is essential for engine smoothness, especially in the lower load range, since manufacturing tolerances mean that the valve strokes do not sufficiently coincide. The signals necessary for this adjustment strategy are also supplied by the rotational angle sensor of the crankshaft and assigned to the individual cylinders by the rotational angle sensor of the camshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The largely independent adjustment of the intake and exhaust valves offers the possibility of turning off selected valves by means of a continuous adjusting shaft, that is no longer opening them or at least adjusting a smaller valve stroke. To accomplish this, sections of the described cam disks of the adjusting shaft are formed as a rest for the valves that are not turned off. The rest area is a contour which is formed from an arc that is concentric to the center of rotation of the adjusting shaft. Twisting the adjusting shaft does not change the valve stroke of the units controlled by the cam disks with rest within the range of action of the rest, while the valve stroke of the units controlled by the cam disks without rest is changed. This change can be carried out until the valve is held completely closed. If all intake valves or/and the exhaust valves of the same cylinder are triggered in this way, the change in load is turned off for selected cylinders. Of course the same function is achieved by using a straight guided draw key with a corresponding cam contour. The rest area is then a contour which is formed from a line parallel to the sliding direction of the draw key.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventive solution has advantageously found an exact, low-wear adjustment device for gas exchange valves, which also works with great accuracy.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a camshaft <b>1</b>, which has a cam <b>2</b>. The cam moves roller <b>3</b> at the end of connecting link <b>4</b>. Connecting link <b>4</b> has a radial cam <b>5</b> which is composed of a rest area <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a lift area <b>5</b><i>b. </i>Connecting link <b>4</b> is mounted on a bolt <b>6</b> whose axis <b>7</b> is guided on an arc-shaped adjustment curve <b>8</b>. The center of the arc-shaped adjustment curve <b>8</b> is on the axis <b>9</b> of the roller <b>10</b> of the driven element <b>11</b> which is supported through a joint <b>12</b> in a housing (not shown) and actuates valve <b>13</b>. It can clearly be seen that adjustment of axis <b>7</b> on the adjustment curve <b>8</b> in the direction of arrow <b>14</b> has the consequence of reducing the opening angle and stroke of valve <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an embodiment in which the bolt <b>6</b> or its axis <b>7</b> is guided on the arc-shaped adjustment curve <b>8</b> by positive connection to a pendulum support <b>15</b>. Cylinder head-side joint <b>16</b> of pendulum support <b>15</b> or its axis coincides with the axis <b>9</b> of roller <b>10</b> of driven element <b>11</b>. Adjusting shaft <b>17</b> holds cam disks <b>18</b>, which determine, through tappet <b>18</b><i>a, </i>the position of bolt <b>6</b> or its axis <b>7</b> on the adjustment curve <b>8</b>. Axis <b>7</b> is adjusted on adjustment curve <b>8</b>, as shown by the direction arrow <b>14</b>, by rotating cam disk <b>18</b> or adjusting shaft <b>17</b> in the direction arrow <b>14</b><i>a. </i>The described adjustment movement has the consequence of reducing the stroke and opening angle of valve <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective illustration of the inventive device with a pendulum support <b>15</b> for intake valve <b>19</b> and exhaust valve <b>20</b> of a cylinder, singled out from a series of cylinders or valves. It is easy to see the cylinder head-side joint <b>16</b> of pendulum support <b>15</b>, whose axis coincides with the axis <b>9</b> of roller <b>10</b> of driven elements <b>11</b>, so that bolt <b>6</b> is restricted to an arc-shaped adjustment curve. In distinction to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, here bolt <b>6</b> simultaneously assumes the function of the inventive device's adjusting shaft. It holds cam disks <b>18</b>, which are supported on hardened sliding blocks <b>21</b> in the housing, and it can rotate in the pendulum support. Bolt <b>6</b> is connected, through a suitable connection element, with the adjusting motor <b>23</b> that is fixed with respect to the housing. In this example, the connection element is an articulated shaft <b>22</b>. This embodiment presents substantial advantages with respect to part variety, but also space in the area where the actual valve actuation occurs. Since connection elements other than articulated shafts can be used, such as Schmidt couplings, Oldham couplings, toothed gears, or a chain gears, this provides a certain flexibility for placement of the adjusting motor <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross section of another embodiment of the invention for a valve or cylinder arrangement such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Here bolt <b>6</b> is restricted by four-bar linkages (<b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>) to an adjustment curve <b>28</b> which approximates the shape of an arc. If system lines <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> meet on axis <b>9</b> of roller <b>10</b> of driven element <b>11</b>, then the bolt's instantaneous center of rotation even lies precisely there. Deviations in the other area must be taken up by the play compensation element <b>31</b>. Here again bolt <b>6</b> could assume the function of the adjusting shaft, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, it is also possible to use a separate adjusting shaft <b>17</b> with cam disks <b>18</b>, as shown. The embodiment shown is especially suitable for preassembly of valves along with springs, levers, and play compensation elements in the cylinder head as a lower part, and complete preassembly of all other parts in the valve gear housing as a top part. In this regard it is advantageous that bearing blocks <b>32</b> for joints <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be bolted in the same plane as the cover <b>33</b> of the camshaft bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective illustration of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is easier to see intake valve <b>19</b> and exhaust valve <b>20</b> of the cylinder that is singled out, as well as the direct actuation of bolt <b>6</b> by cam disks <b>18</b>. It can clearly be seen that not only bolt <b>6</b> and camshaft <b>1</b>, but also adjusting shaft <b>17</b> can be preassembled in the top part of the housing, the valve gear housing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross-section through an embodiment of the invention using a slide <b>34</b>, which can be used separately for each valve or each pair of valves. The separate use results in the longest possible rest phases or common rest phases, so that it is easy for the adjustment to be done only during the rest phases. Controlling the individual cylinders using the inventive device even requires the separate arrangement. In this embodiment, bolt <b>6</b> is guided in a form-fit manner in the housing by slide <b>34</b>, so that its axis <b>7</b> is guided along adjustment curve <b>35</b>, a line. This line is only more or less approximately an arc about the axis <b>9</b> of roller <b>10</b> of the resting driven element <b>11</b>. The deviation is exaggerated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Now if the threaded spindle <b>36</b> driven by adjusting motor <b>23</b> rotates and displaces toothed rack <b>37</b> by the amount shown by arrow <b>38</b><i>a, </i>then adjusting shaft <b>17</b> and cam disks <b>18</b> rotate according to arrow <b>38</b><i>b </i>and slide <b>34</b> along with bolt <b>6</b> rotates in direction <b>38</b><i>c. </i>Because of the deviation of line <b>35</b> from the shape of an arc, play compensation element <b>31</b> must be lowered by a certain amount, which is shown by arrow <b>38</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagrammatic illustration of the interaction of gas pedal <b>40</b>, adjusting motors <b>23</b>, rotational angle sensor <b>42</b> on the flywheel, and rotational angle sensor <b>43</b> on the camshaft with the engine management system <b>44</b>. A signal coming from gas pedal <b>40</b>, that is from a sensor for its position, is converted by engine management system <b>44</b> into a signal to adjusting motors <b>23</b> to increase or reduce the valve strokes. After the desired load state is achieved for the entire engine, the engine management system <b>44</b> evaluates the signals from the high-resolution rotational angle sensor <b>42</b> on the flywheel. They are assigned to the individual cylinders with the help of the low-resolution rotational angle sensors <b>43</b> on the camshaft or on another shaft running at half the crankshaft speed. This information is used to send signals to the individual adjusting motors <b>23</b> to even out the torque peak or the crankshaft speed, by correcting the valve strokes of the cylinders with smaller torques upward and correcting those of the cylinders with larger torques downward. In the inventive process an adjustment takes place, with or without compensation, during the common rest phases of the valves operated by an adjusting motor. The engine management system <b>44</b> takes their phase positions at the same time from sensor <b>43</b> of the camshaft.</p>
