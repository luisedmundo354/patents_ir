<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to location and management of many objects. More specifically, present invention relates to the evaluation of moving continual queries over moving objects.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Advances in mobile computing and object or position sensing technologies, for example global positioning systems (GPS), radio frequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth technologies and wireless networking technologies, have facilitated the emergence of numerous applications for the continuous location and management of moving objects. These emerging applications include, for example, environmental awareness applications, object tracking and monitoring services, inventory control systems, wireless communication systems, and computer games. These applications need to track many moving objects simultaneously, including physical objects that move in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, for example people, cars, airplanes and cargo ships. Moving objects can also be stock prices, distributed sensor readings for environmental surveillance including temperature and pressure, and public health data such as a number of sick people and a type of illness.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to provide tracking capabilities, the moving objects are equipped with location-awareness or remote identification equipment and are treated as points in multidimensional space whose positions change with time. The locations of these points can be tracked and queried. Tracking of points in space can be accomplished by technologies available in the art such as GPS, triangulation, and RFID systems. These tracking systems are used to locate objects or points that satisfy a given set of criteria called queries. These queries over moving objects tend to be continual, i.e., repeated periodically over time. In addition, queries can be stationary or can be associated with moving objects and hence moving. Moving queries can be general range queries, for example finding all the objects currently located inside the boundaries of a range, or k-nearest neighbors (kNN) queries, for example finding the k-nearest objects that are closest to a given point.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Previous approaches, however, assumed that the queries were stationary. A continual stationary range query specifies a spatial range together with a time interval and identifies the set of objects located within the spatial range during the specified time interval. The result of the query changes as time progresses due to the moving nature of the objects that are being queried. A moving range query has a fundamental difference when compared with a stationary query. A moving range query is associated with a moving object, called the focal object of the query, and the spatial range of the query moves together with the movement of the query's focal object. With a moving query, the identification of objects that satisfy the query over a given time period becomes more complex.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because of the continuously changing positions of moving objects, it is very time consuming to process queries over moving objects. This problem becomes even more challenging when the queries are also moving. To speed up the query processing, various approaches have been proposed to index moving objects alone (e.g., “Indexing moving objects,” by P. K. Agarwal et al., Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, 2000; “On indexing mobile objects,” by G. Kollios et al., Proceedings of Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, 1999), or to index queries alone (e.g., “Query indexing and velocity constrained indexing: scalable techniques for continuous queries on moving objects,” by S. Prabhakar et al., IEEE Transactions on Computers, 51:1124-1140, October 2002).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With both moving queries and moving objects, searching and maintaining the object index or the query index becomes exceedingly costly, because updates to the indexes are required once either the objects or the queries have moved. As an alternative to indexing, a brute force linear search, where each moving query is evaluated against every moving object, can be used to process moving queries over moving objects. This brute force approach, however, is not scalable to a large number of moving queries and moving objects. The need exists, therefore, for an efficient system and method for evaluating moving queries over moving objects. In addition, it is desired to provide the fastest access possible to large volumes of data and to preserve the spatial relationships among indexed objects such as nesting and neighborhood.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a system and a method for evaluating a plurality of moving queries over moving objects. The method for evaluating the moving queries involves constructing a bounding box to contain and to correspond with each one of the moving objects and moving queries. Using the corresponding bounding box, an object index is created for each one of the moving objects, and a query index is created for each one of the moving queries. The objects and queries are indexed based upon the associated bounding boxes as opposed to the location of the objects and queries themselves. The moving queries are then evaluated periodically using the query and object indexes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The bounding boxes are motion-adaptive bounding boxes that vary in size and shape depending on the speed and direction of the moving objects and queries. Although the objects and queries move, the bounding boxes are constructed so that the objects and queries remain within a given box for a period of time so that multiple evaluations can be conducted before new bounding boxes need to be created.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention also uses predictive query results in combination with the bounding boxes to identify when the motion functions associated with the objects and queries need to be updated and to narrow the number of objects to be considered in query evaluations. The objects to be considered in query evaluations are determined based upon whether or not the bounding boxes associated with the moving objects intersect the bounding boxes associated with a given query. Only moving objects having bounding boxes that intersect the bounding box of the query are considered. The necessary information about the moving objects and moving queries are contained in tables that are periodically scanned and updated. The tabulated information is used in the query evaluations. The present invention also includes a computer readable medium that contains a computer executable code that when read by a computer causes the computer to perform a method for evaluating a plurality of moving queries over a plurality of moving objects.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is also directed to a system for evaluating a plurality of moving queries over a plurality of moving objects. The system includes a plurality of moving objects and a plurality of moving queries associated with a spatial range. A plurality of motion-adaptive bounding boxes are associated with one of the moving objects or moving queries. The system also includes at least one monitoring system capable of monitoring the location and motion of the moving objects and moving queries and of evaluating the moving queries. The monitoring system includes a motion-adaptive query index and a motion-adaptive object index for use in evaluating the plurality of moving queries.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system and method in accordance with the present invention can be applied to moving continual range queries in multidimensional space. Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of a system <b>10</b> for evaluating moving queries over moving objects in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. As shown, the system <b>10</b> includes a plurality of moving objects <b>12</b> and a plurality of moving queries <b>14</b>. Each of the moving objects <b>12</b> is associated with a motion vector <b>16</b>, indicating present direction and speed. The present invention can accommodate any number of moving objects <b>12</b>. The moving objects <b>12</b> can represent physical objects that move in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, for example people, cars, airplanes, cargo ships, delivery vans, cellular phones, taxi cabs, police vehicles, fire department equipment, laptop or portable computers, packages and inventory items. Moving objects may also include things not traditionally associated with the conventional meaning of “object”. For example, moving objects may also include stock prices and distributed sensor readings for environmental surveillance, such as temperature and barometric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Any suitable method of defining temporal and spatial ranges can be used to define the moving queries <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, each moving query <b>14</b> is associated with at least one focal object <b>18</b> and a spatial range <b>20</b> surrounding that focal object <b>18</b>. Alternatively, the moving query can be associated with a spatial range that does not have a focal object <b>18</b>. For stationary queries, the focal object <b>18</b> is stationary, and for moving queries <b>14</b>, the focal object <b>18</b> is in motion. The current speed and direction of each focal object <b>18</b> is indicated by the motion vector <b>16</b>. Since the moving queries <b>14</b> move in association with the focal objects <b>18</b>, the motion vectors <b>16</b> also indicate the moving directions of the queries <b>14</b>. The focal object <b>18</b> can be located throughout the area or volume of the spatial range <b>20</b>. For example, the focal object <b>18</b> can be disposed at the center of the circle for a circular spatial range <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Suitable spatial ranges <b>20</b> include, but are not limited to, two-dimensional shapes such as circles, ovals, triangles, rectangles and squares and three-dimensional shapes such as spheres, cylinders, cones and cubes. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the moving queries <b>14</b> are illustrated with circular spatial query ranges <b>20</b>. In general, a moving query is an analysis or evaluation of the moving objects based upon parameters that spatially or temporally change. An example of a moving query <b>14</b> is “Locate all the moving taxicabs that at any given time are located within a square mile of a moving car.” In this example, the taxicabs are the moving objects, and the spatial range of the moving query encompasses the one square mile spatial region surrounding the moving focal object, which is the moving car.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and <b>2</b><i>c</i>, the moving objects <b>12</b> and moving queries <b>14</b> move over time relative to each other, affecting both the locations of the moving objects <b>12</b>, focal objects <b>18</b> and moving queries <b>14</b> and the results of the moving queries <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows, at time t<b>0</b>, the moving query <b>14</b> and four moving objects <b>12</b>, labeled <b>01</b>-<b>04</b>. The moving objects <b>12</b> and focal object <b>18</b> are represented as single points. The query result at time t<b>0</b> is O<b>2</b> because moving object O<b>2</b> is inside the range of spatial range <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b> at that time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>shows that at time t<b>1</b> moving object O<b>2</b> has moved outside the spatial range <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b> and that no moving object <b>12</b> is currently within the spatial range <b>20</b>. Hence, the query result at time t<b>1</b> is the empty or null set. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>shows that at time t<b>2</b> moving objects O<b>3</b> and O<b>4</b> have moved inside the spatial range <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b>. As a result, the query results now contain moving objects O<b>3</b> and O<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The system <b>10</b> also includes one or more monitoring systems <b>22</b>. Each monitoring system <b>22</b> is arranged to monitor and evaluate at least one of the plurality of moving queries <b>14</b> and moving objects <b>12</b> disposed within a monitoring region <b>24</b>. The monitoring systems <b>22</b> can be arranged to passively receive signals that are broadcast from one of the moving objects <b>12</b> or moving focal objects <b>18</b> or to actively scan or obtain information from the moving objects <b>12</b> and focal objects <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the moving object <b>12</b> and moving focal objects <b>18</b> include systems to report their location, for example location awareness signals systems such as a global positioning system (GPS). Alternatively, each moving object <b>12</b> and moving focal object <b>18</b> includes an excitation coil to be utilized in a radio frequency identification system (RFID).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">There is a separate monitoring region <b>24</b> for each monitoring system <b>22</b>, and these monitoring regions <b>24</b> can be completely separate or can overlap. The monitor systems include signal receivers <b>26</b>. Suitable receivers <b>26</b> include wireless receivers such as satellite communication dishes <b>28</b> and radio communication towers <b>30</b> or other antennas or WIFI systems. The receivers <b>26</b> monitor signals broadcast from the moving objects <b>12</b> and the focal objects <b>18</b> around which the moving queries <b>14</b> are based.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The moving objects <b>12</b> and focal objects <b>18</b> broadcast signals containing information, for example information about their position and motion. Alternatively, the moving objects could simply provide a unique identification signal, and the location and movement of the objects would be determined using methods such as triangulation. Preferably, the moving objects <b>12</b> and focal objects <b>18</b> broadcast information regarding their motion when there is a change in the function describing that motion.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each monitoring system <b>22</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>32</b> or other logic control unit. Suitable logic control units <b>32</b> include programmable logic controllers, computer servers, mainframe type computers, desktop computers, portable or laptop computers and personal digital assistants. The logic control units <b>32</b> are capable of receiving, reading, interpreting and recording the information broadcast by the moving objects <b>12</b> and moving focal objects <b>18</b> and of analyzing and indexing solutions to the moving queries <b>14</b>. The logic control units <b>32</b> are in communication with the receivers <b>26</b>. Although the logic control units <b>32</b> can operate independently as stand-alone processors, preferably the logic control units are in communication with one another across a communication network <b>34</b>. Suitable communication networks <b>34</b> include local area networks (LAN), personal area networks, wide area networks (WAN), for example the Internet or World Wide Web, wired or wireless telephone networks and combinations thereof. Each logic control unit <b>32</b> is in communication with one or more storage systems <b>37</b> to store the information received from the moving objects <b>12</b>, moving focal objects <b>18</b> and moving queries <b>14</b>, the evaluation results associated with the moving queries <b>14</b>, motion equations, indexes of object information and query results and other necessary information.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An evaluation of a moving query involves finding a set of moving objects that currently meet the moving queries criteria. This solution set is the information that the person or system that created the moving query wants. For example, a dispatcher could want to locate all taxicabs within six blocks of a cellular phone carried by a person that is walking. In another example, the U.S. Coast Guard could wish to track the locations of patrolling rescue vessels in relationship to moving cargo ships to provide for the quickest response time should an incident occur. In this example, the moving queries could be associated with either the patrol vessels or the cargo ships. As the number of moving queries and moving objects grow, the amount of computational resources involved in periodically evaluating each query grows. Queries that have solution sets that change rapidly increase the demand on resources even more. This increased demand increases costs and the amount of time necessary to conduct the periodic query evaluations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system of the present invention, can reduce the demands on computational resources by minimizing the number of moving objects that have to be considered in periodic query evaluations. In one embodiment, the use of a motion-adaptive query index and a motion-adaptive object index by the monitoring systems <b>22</b> provides for efficient evaluations and reduced costs. Although each monitoring system <b>22</b> can utilize either the motion-adaptive query index or the motion-adaptive object index, preferably each monitoring system <b>22</b> maintains both of these indexes, increasing the overall performance and efficiency of the evaluation process. Instead of indexing directly on the positions of moving objects <b>12</b>, focal objects <b>18</b> and moving queries <b>14</b>, the motion-adaptive indexes use motion-sensitive bounding boxes <b>36</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A separate motion-sensitive bounding box <b>36</b> is constructed for each moving object <b>12</b> and each moving query <b>14</b>. The motion-sensitive bounding boxes <b>36</b> are then used in place of the spatial ranges <b>20</b> of the moving queries <b>14</b> in the query index and in place of the actual location of the moving objects <b>12</b> in the moving object index.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A spatial index method is used as the underlying index structure for the query and object indexes. Any suitable spatial indexing system can be used. For example R-tree or R+-tree indexing can be used. R-tree indexing uses approximation of spatial objects with bounding objects, for example rectangles. R-trees may use approximation of spatial objects with bounding rectangles with the sides of the rectangle parallel to the axes of the data space. In one embodiment, the spatial indexing system is R*-tree. R*-tree indexing uses overlap enlargement criterion on the level preceding to the leaf level, reducing the number of disk accesses.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The size and shape of each bounding box <b>36</b> can be varied based upon the speed and direction of the moving object <b>12</b> or moving query <b>14</b> with which it is associated. In one embodiment, the size of a bounding box <b>36</b> can be adaptive to both the speed and the frequency of changes in direction of the object <b>12</b> or query <b>14</b> to which it is associated. If the bounding box <b>36</b> is too large, then the cost of search operations will be too high, because larger bounding boxes <b>36</b> produce increased overlapping among bounding boxes <b>36</b>. Increased bounding box <b>36</b> overlapping results in decreased indexing performance due to the increased amount of data necessitated by the increased overlapping. Conversely, if the bounding boxes <b>36</b> are too small, the moving objects <b>12</b> will quickly move out of the boxes <b>36</b>. Once the moving objects <b>12</b> are out of the bounding boxes <b>36</b>, the index is updated to reflect the new bounding boxes <b>36</b>, increasing the update cost of the index.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, the bounding box <b>36</b> occupies a larger spatial area than the object <b>12</b> or query <b>14</b> contained within it. Hence, the moving object <b>12</b> or moving query <b>14</b> can move within the bounding box <b>36</b>. The length of time that a moving object <b>12</b> or moving query <b>14</b> spends within a given bounding box <b>36</b> depends on the speed and direction of the moving object <b>12</b> or moving query <b>14</b>, the size and shape of the bounding box <b>36</b> and the initial position of the moving object <b>12</b> or query <b>14</b> within the bounding box <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The initial position of the moving object <b>12</b> or query <b>14</b> is selected to maximize the duration of the object <b>12</b> or query <b>14</b> within the bounding box <b>36</b> given current speed and direction. For a rectangular bounding box <b>36</b>, the moving object <b>12</b> or moving query <b>14</b> would be initially disposed at one of the corners with its motion vector <b>16</b> aligned generally along a diagonal of the rectangle. Therefore, although a given object <b>12</b> or query <b>14</b> may have changed its position from one evaluation period to the next, the object <b>12</b> or the query's spatial region <b>20</b> is still contained within the same bounding box <b>36</b>. Therefore, the position of the bounding box <b>36</b> does not have to change and the associated indexes do not have to be updated. Because the bounding boxes <b>36</b> change less often than the positions of the moving objects <b>12</b> and queries <b>14</b>, the costs associated with updating and searching the query index and the object index are significantly reduced. In addition, the time needed for each query evaluation is reduced, facilitating more frequent evaluations of query results.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An embodiment of motion-sensitive bounding boxes for a moving object and a moving query is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Given a moving query <b>14</b> or a moving object <b>12</b> and its associated velocity vector <b>16</b>, which can be received or calculated, a motion-sensitive bounding box <b>36</b> for the query <b>14</b> or object <b>12</b> is calculated and constructed by extending the minimum bounding box of the query <b>14</b> or object <b>12</b> along the x-dimension <b>38</b> and the y-dimension <b>40</b>, or the x-, y- and z-dimensions for a three-dimensional bounding box, by a factor equal to a multiple of the component of the velocity <b>16</b> of the query <b>14</b> or object <b>12</b> in each component dimension. The minimum bounding box is the smallest shape that will completely enclose the moving object <b>12</b> or the spatial region <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the a first bounding box <b>36</b> for a moving object <b>12</b> is calculated as a rectangle with width <b>42</b> equal to the component of its velocity in the x-direction <b>44</b> multiplied by a factor α (o.vel.x*α) and a height <b>46</b> equal to the component its velocity in the y-direction <b>48</b> multiplied by a factor α (o.vel.y*α). The bounding box <b>36</b> for a moving query <b>14</b> having a circular spatial range <b>20</b> is calculated as a rectangle with a width <b>42</b> equal to the sum of the diameter <b>50</b> of the circular spatial range <b>20</b> and the product of the x-component of its velocity <b>44</b> multiplied by a factor β ((q.vel.x)+d) and a length <b>46</b> equal to the sum of the diameter <b>50</b> of the circular spatial range <b>20</b> and the product of the y-component of its velocity <b>48</b> multiplied by a factor β ((q.vel.y)+d). The use of rectangular bounding boxes <b>36</b> provides a more efficient indexing method during data updates. Other approaches can also be used to construct suitable motion-sensitive bounding boxes <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The values for α and β may be selected depending on the speed of a moving object <b>12</b> or moving focal object <b>18</b> and how often the object changes its moving direction. For example, at relatively high speeds α and β are relatively small to prevent excessively large bounding boxes <b>36</b>. The values for α and β can be calculated based on an analytical model or on simulations. A table of suitable values for α and β can be computed in advance for various speeds and mean times between changes in direction. Any suitable analytical method or simulation known and available to one of skill in the art can be used to determine α and β. As a result, the configuration of the motion-sensitive bounding box <b>36</b> varies with or adapts to the moving object's behavior, and the indexing approach is called motion-adaptive indexing. With bounding boxes <b>36</b> in the index, computations are needed to check whether or not the moving objects <b>12</b> are inside the moving queries <b>14</b>. Motion functions are needed in such computations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, predictive query results are used to increase the speed and efficiency of each query evaluation. Although predictive query results can be used separately, preferably these results are used in conjunction with motion-adaptive query and object indexes. Predictive query results also use bounding boxes <b>36</b> associated with each moving object <b>12</b> and moving query <b>14</b>. Suitable types of bounding boxes <b>36</b> are the same as for the motion-adaptive query and object indexes. In order to generate predictive query results, the motion of each individual moving object <b>12</b>, including the focal objects <b>18</b> of each individual moving query <b>14</b>, is modeled as a motion function of its location at a particular instant in time, a velocity vector and time. This modeling creates a motion function that, in combination with the bounding box <b>36</b>, is used to determine the location of moving objects <b>12</b> and moving queries <b>14</b> in the future and to compute or predict future query results. Since the motion functions of the moving objects can change over time, the predictive results are valid only for a defined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An example of the actual path traversed by a moving object <b>12</b> and the path predicted by the motion function is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A plurality of discrete predicted positions <b>52</b>-<b>56</b> are illustrated along an initial predicted path <b>58</b>. In addition, a corresponding plurality of discrete actual positions <b>60</b>-<b>65</b> are shown along the actual path <b>66</b>. A motion or velocity vector <b>16</b>, represented by an arrow, is associated with each position <b>60</b>-<b>65</b> on the actual path <b>66</b>. The motion vector <b>16</b> represents the actual velocity of the moving object <b>12</b> at that position. Initially, the first predictive position <b>52</b> is set to coincide with the first actual position <b>60</b> of the moving object <b>12</b>. The initial velocity vector <b>68</b> for the predicted path <b>58</b> is equivalent to the actual velocity vector <b>68</b> associated with the moving object <b>12</b> at the first actual position <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Because the velocity vector <b>16</b> of the moving object <b>12</b> may change over time due to changes in speed or direction, the actual path <b>66</b> and predicted path <b>58</b> can diverge. Divergence between these paths is acceptable and tolerated when the distance between the actual and the predicted position is within a pre-determined threshold (Δ) <b>70</b>. For a given evaluation, if the distance between the actual position and the predicted position is less than or equal to the threshold, the velocity vector used for the predicted path is maintained. When this distance is greater than the threshold, the moving object <b>12</b> reports an updated actual position and a current velocity vector to the monitoring system <b>22</b>. The motion function for the moving object <b>12</b> is updated accordingly and used for subsequent predicted path locations. Preferably, a moving object <b>12</b> does not report its position, velocity function and time until its predicted position varies from its actual position by more than the threshold value Δ. The threshold value Δ represents an application specific tolerance. Typically, this figure is as small as possible. In one embodiment, the threshold value Δ is set to a tolerance of less than about 2%.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The temporal interval used to calculate the query results is set to a time interval in which the moving object <b>12</b> is expected to be valid. As long as moving objects do not change their velocity vectors, this information will remain valid. When they do, additional processing and updates to the query results are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated, for example, predicted positions <b>53</b>,<b>54</b>,<b>55</b> have a distance from actual positions <b>61</b>,<b>62</b>,<b>63</b> of less than the pre-determined threshold Δ <b>70</b>. The predicted positions <b>53</b>,<b>54</b>,<b>55</b> are within the threshold even though the velocity vectors <b>16</b> for the actual positions <b>62</b>,<b>63</b> differ from the initial velocity vector <b>68</b> used to calculate the predicted path <b>58</b>. Therefore, the predictive motion function used to calculate the predictive path <b>58</b> is not changed. The fifth predicted position <b>56</b>, however, has a distance from the fifth actual position <b>64</b> that exceeds the pre-determined threshold Δ. Therefore, the fifth predicted position <b>56</b> is moved to an adjusted fifth predicted position <b>72</b> that corresponds to the fifth actual position <b>64</b>. In addition, a new motion function is established using the velocity vector <b>74</b> associated with the fifth actual position <b>64</b>. The updated motion information is used to calculate a new predicted path <b>76</b> and the sixth predicted position <b>78</b> of the moving object. Using predicted query results decreases the amount of information sent to and recorded by the monitoring systems <b>22</b>, saving time, computational resources, and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates three different cases that arise when computing predicted query results. Case I <b>80</b> is the case of a static query <b>82</b> and a moving object <b>12</b>. Using the motion function of moving object at time t<b>0</b>, the query result for the interval between time t<b>0</b>+a and time t<b>0</b>+b can be predicted. An example of a system having moving objects and static queries is illustrated in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/671,932, filed on Sept. 29, 2003, by Chen et al., and titled “Method and Structure for Monitoring Moving Objects”. The entire disclosure of that application is incorporated herein by reference. Case II <b>84</b> involves a static object <b>86</b> and a moving query <b>14</b>. The motion function of the moving query <b>14</b> can be used to predict the query result and the interval over which this result will remain valid. Case III <b>88</b> involves a moving object <b>12</b> and a moving query <b>14</b>. The motion functions of both the moving object <b>12</b> and the moving query <b>14</b> are used to find out the time interval when the moving object <b>12</b> will be inside the spatial range <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to create the most accurate and comprehensive prediction for a given moving query <b>14</b>, the moving objects <b>12</b> that are most likely to be in the query results are chosen for analysis. Objects <b>12</b> that are too far away from the moving query <b>14</b> are not selected, because the predicted query results are less likely to remain valid. In other words, the farther away a moving object <b>12</b> is from the moving query <b>14</b>, the longer the period of time before the moving object <b>12</b> enters the spatial range <b>20</b> of the query <b>14</b>. The longer the time period is before the moving object <b>12</b> enters the spatial range <b>20</b> of the query <b>14</b>, the greater the likelihood that the moving functions associated with either the moving object <b>12</b> or the focal object <b>18</b> of the query <b>14</b> will have changed, invalidating the predicted query results.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, the bounding boxes <b>36</b> associated with the moving objects <b>12</b> and the moving queries <b>14</b> are used to decide which objects <b>12</b> should be considered in performing predictive query results. For a given moving query <b>14</b> and bounding box <b>36</b>, those objects <b>12</b> having bounding boxes intersecting the query's bounding box <b>36</b> are considered as potential candidates for predictive query results.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An example of a predictive query result for a given moving query <b>14</b> over a plurality of moving objects <b>12</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The moving query <b>14</b> is disposed within an associated moving query bounding box <b>90</b>. In addition, first, second and third moving objects <b>94</b>-<b>96</b> are disposed within respective bounding boxes <b>98</b>-<b>100</b>. At time t<sub>a </sub><b>92</b>, the moving query bounding box <b>90</b> intersects with the bounding boxes <b>98</b>,<b>99</b> of the first and second moving objects <b>94</b>,<b>95</b>. Therefore, the first and third moving objects <b>94</b>,<b>95</b> are considered in the predictive query analysis, and the motion functions associated with these two moving objects <b>12</b> are used to calculate the time intervals when the objects <b>12</b> will be inside the spatial range <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b>. However, since the second moving object <b>95</b>, as indicated by its motion vector <b>16</b>, is moving away from the spatial range <b>20</b> of the moving query <b>14</b>, the predictive query result contains only the first moving object <b>94</b> and its interval. At the next time interval t<sub>b </sub><b>102</b>, the bounding box <b>100</b> associated with the third moving object <b>96</b> also intersects with the moving query bounding box <b>90</b>. As a result, the predictive query result also contains both the first and third objects <b>94</b>,<b>96</b> and the intervals associated with these moving objects.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to use the system <b>10</b> of the present invention to evaluate moving queries <b>14</b> over moving objects <b>12</b>, each monitoring system <b>22</b> periodically determines the results, for example a set of moving objects <b>12</b>, of all moving queries <b>14</b> within its respective monitoring regions <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, the monitoring systems <b>22</b> use a motion-adaptive indexing process in accordance with the present invention to evaluate the moving queries <b>14</b>. The results of these processes are maintained in a motion-adaptive object index and a motion-adaptive query index. In addition to maintaining a motion-adaptive object index and a motion-adaptive query index for each moving object <b>12</b> and moving query <b>14</b>, each monitoring system <b>22</b> maintains a moving object table (MOT) and a moving query table (MQT) for the moving objects <b>12</b> and moving queries <b>14</b> within its monitoring range <b>24</b>. The MOT maintains information regarding the moving objects <b>12</b>, including the object ID, the query ID (if the object is the focal object of a moving query), the position, the velocity vector, the timestamp of the last change in motion function, the bounding box, the estimated time before the object changes its motion function and a flag indicating whether or not the motion function has been changed since the last evaluation. Similarly, the MQT maintains information regarding the moving queries <b>14</b>, including the query ID, the position, the velocity vector, the timestamp of the last change in motion function, the radius of the spatial query range, the bounding box, the estimated time before the query will change its motion function, and the flag indicating whether or not the motion function has been changed since the last re-evaluation. All of this information can be supplied to the monitoring systems by the moving objects.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although these tables could be maintained in a centralized database that is accessible by the each monitoring system, preferably these tables are maintained in the storage systems <b>37</b> disposed in each monitoring system <b>22</b>. Periodic evaluations of moving queries <b>14</b> are performed by scanning these two tables and performing updates searches on the motion-adaptive indexes as needed in order to maintain up-to-date query results. Since changes in query results due to object movements only occur during an evaluation, the period of time between subsequent evaluations is made as short as possible to ensure that the query results are as up-to-date as possible. Making each evaluation itself as efficient as possible contributes to shorter cycle times between subsequent evaluations. In addition, there are costs associated with updating the indexes every time a new position is received.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The entries in the MOT and MQT are updated whenever new motion updates are received from the moving objects. However, these motion updates are not reflected in the query results until the next periodic query evaluation is performed. At every query evaluation, two scans are performed. The first scan covers the MOT, and the second scan covers the MQT. The MOT scan is used to update the motion-adaptive object index and to differentially update some of the query results by searching the motion-adaptive query index. The MQT scan is used to update the motion-adaptive query index and to re-calculate some of the query results by performing searches on the motion-adaptive object index. The two scans can be performed in any order. For example, the MQT scan can be performed first followed by the MOT scan.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a single MOT scan <b>102</b> for a given monitoring system <b>22</b>. First the monitoring system <b>22</b> checks to see if every entry in the MOT has been examined <b>104</b>. If every entry has been examined during the present scan, then the MOT scan stops. If entries remain to be scanned, the monitoring system <b>22</b> obtains a new entry from the MOT <b>106</b>. The monitoring system then evaluates whether or not the selected entry has been invalidated, or exceeded the limits of its bounding box <b>108</b>. If the bounding box is still valid, then the monitoring system <b>22</b> returns to see if every entry in the MOT has been examined <b>104</b>. If the bounding box is no longer valid, the monitoring system <b>22</b> calculates a new bounding box and updates the motion-adaptive object index accordingly <b>110</b>. The multiplying factor α used for calculating this new bounding box is selected adaptively based on the selected object's speed and the mean time before the selected object is expected to change its motion function. The monitoring system then checks if the motion function associated with the selected entry has changed <b>112</b>. If the motion function has not changed, then the monitoring system returns to see if every entry in the MOT has been examined <b>104</b>. If the motion function has changed, the data associated with the object's bounding box in the motion-adaptive object index including the motion function are updated <b>114</b>. Once the bounding box data are updated, the monitoring system <b>22</b> performs two searches on the motion-adaptive query index. In the first search, the monitoring system <b>22</b> searches the motion-adaptive query index to locate all the queries <b>14</b> whose bounding boxes <b>36</b> intersect with the old bounding box of the selected object <b>116</b>. The monitoring system <b>22</b> then removes the selected object <b>12</b> from the results of these moving queries <b>14</b>. In the second search, the monitoring system <b>22</b> searches the motion-adaptive query index again to identify all the queries <b>14</b> whose bounding boxes <b>36</b> intersect with the new bounding box of the selected object <b>118</b>. For these queries <b>14</b>, the monitoring system <b>22</b> uses the selected object to perform result prediction and to calculate the intervals when the predicted query results will be valid. The monitoring system <b>22</b> then adds the selected object and the predicted interval to the proper query results and returns to see if every entry in the MOT has been examined <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a single MQT scan <b>120</b> for a given monitoring system <b>22</b>. The single MQT scan is very similar to the MOT scan described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. First, the monitoring system <b>22</b> checks to see if every entry in the MQT has been examined <b>122</b>. If yes, then the monitoring system <b>22</b> stops the scan. If not, then the monitoring system <b>22</b> obtains a new entry from the MQT <b>124</b>. The monitoring system <b>22</b> then determines whether or not the selected moving query <b>14</b> has invalidated its bounding box <b>125</b>. If not, then the monitoring system <b>22</b> checks to see if every entry in the MQT has been examined <b>122</b>. If the bounding box <b>36</b> has been invalidated, the monitoring system <b>22</b> calculates the new bounding box <b>36</b> and updates the motion-adaptive query index <b>126</b>. Next, the monitoring system <b>22</b> determines if the motion function has changed <b>128</b>. If not, then the monitoring system <b>22</b> checks to see if every entry in the MQT has been examined <b>122</b>. If the motion function has changed, then the monitoring system <b>22</b> updates the motion functions associated with the selected query in the motion-adaptive index <b>130</b>. Once the motion-adaptive query index is updated <b>130</b>, the monitoring system <b>22</b> retrieves all of the moving objects <b>12</b> whose bounding boxes <b>36</b> intersect with the new bounding box of the selected query <b>132</b>. Unlike the MOT scan, however, only one search operation against the motion-adaptive object index is performed after the query index is updated <b>132</b>. For the retrieved objects, the monitoring system <b>22</b> performs result prediction against the query. The monitoring system then returns to see if every entry in the MQT has been examined <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Following the MOT scan, all the existing results are correct for the queries that have not invalidated their bounding boxes <b>36</b> or changed their motion functions. For queries that have invalidated their bounding boxes <b>36</b> or whose focal objects <b>18</b> have changed their motion functions, the query results are re-calculated during the MQT scan. As a result, all the query results are up to date after the MQT scan.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another embodiment of the present invention, the system and method of the present invention for processing continually moving range queries <b>14</b> can be used to evaluate continually moving k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) queries. In order to support kNN queries, three modifications are made. Instead of storing time intervals in query results, the distance of the objects <b>12</b> from the focal object <b>18</b> of the query <b>14</b> as a function of time is stored. During the MQT scan, when a query <b>14</b> has invalidated its bounding box <b>36</b> or changed its motion function, the monitoring system <b>22</b> determines a safe radius that is guaranteed to contain at least k moving objects until the next time such safe radius is calculated. The kNN query is installed as a standard moving query with its range equal to the safe radius. At the end of each query evaluation, the results are sorted based on their distances to their associated focal objects <b>18</b> by using the distance functions stored within the query results. The top k results are then marked as the current results.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The safe radius ensures that there will be at least k objects contained in the radius during the next t time units. In one embodiment, the safe radius is calculated by retrieving the current k-nearest neighbors and calculating the maximum possible distance of the each one of the current k-nearest neighbors from the focal object <b>18</b> of the query <b>14</b> at the end of the t time units. The maximum distance can be calculated using the focal object's motion function and the upper limits on the maximum speeds of the current k-nearest neighbors.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition to being suitable for use in evaluating moving queries over moving objects, the method of the present invention is also suitable for use in other query and object systems. For example, the target objects can be stationary, and the queries can be moving. An example of such a moving query is: “Give me the locations of the wireless towers within 1 mile of my car during the next half an hour,” posted by a driver of a moving car, where the focal object of the query is the car on the move. Alternatively, the queries can be associated with stationary focal objects, and the objects can be moving. An example of such a query is: “Give me the list of AAA vehicles that are currently on service call in the downtown area of Atlanta during the next hour.”</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While it is apparent that the illustrative embodiments of the invention disclosed herein fulfill the objectives of the present invention, it is appreciated that numerous modifications and other embodiments may be devised by those skilled in the art. Additionally, feature(s) and/or element(s) from any embodiment may be used singly or in combination with other embodiment(s). Therefore, it will be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and embodiments, which would come within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
