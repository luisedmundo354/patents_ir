<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Fluorinated sulfonyl fluoride compounds are compounds useful as materials for ion-exchange resins. As a process for producing such compounds, the following processes have been known.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">(1) A process of reacting a cyclic compound obtained by a reaction of tetrafluoroethylene with sulfur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>) with a perfluoroalkylene oxide such as hexafluoropropylene oxide (for example, a process represented by the following scheme and WO02/44138):</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0005">(2) A process of converting a hydrocarbon sulfonic acid derivative having a hydroxyl group as a starting material into an ester with a fluorinated carboxylic acid, which is directly fluorinated and then pyrolized (WO02/44138).</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0008">However, the process (1) is a disadvantageous process for practical industrial application, since due care is required for handling SO<sub>3</sub>. Further, this process is economically disadvantageous because the difficulty in synthesis is high. In addition, the product is limited to a compound having a side chain (such as a —CF<sub>3</sub>), whereby there is a problem from the viewpoint of the performance and the membrane characteristics of an ion-exchange membrane to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The process (2) is a process to solve the drawback of the process (1), but availability of the compound having a fluorosulfonyl group as a starting material is limited, whereby the compound to be produced is limited in some cases. Further, the product is a compound having only one fluorosulfonyl group.</p>
