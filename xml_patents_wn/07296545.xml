<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an intake valve for an internal combustion engine. More specifically, the invention relates to a coaxial or two piece poppet valve that includes an inner and an outer valve for increasing the efficiency and performance of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Internal combustion engines are well known in the art and used in a variety of different applications. A typical internal combustion engine employs valves to control the flow of atmosphere to and from the combustion chamber. The majority of known prior art valves are a single piece, having one spring retainer and various spring control arrangements to connect the valve to the rocker arm of an engine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has long been recognized that the efficiency of this valve arrangement is a major factor in the performance of the entire engine. As a result, several attempts have been made to maximize the potential flow dimensions of these valves. Since a homogenous air fuel mixture is also an important factor in the performance of internal combustion engines, many attempts to use the one-piece valve arrangement have sought to create a swirl affect in addition to increasing the over flow of the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Increasing the flow dimension allowed by the intake valve automatically increases the power of the engine. Similarly, creating a more homogenous air fuel mixture also increases the power of the engine by breaking down the fuel into smaller particles that can be more easily combusted. The resulting effect of an increase in flow dimension or the homogeneity of the mixture, additionally increases fuel efficiency and reduces the environmentally damaging emissions of internal combustion engine. In a time of ever rising oil and gasoline costs, there is a real premium on fuel efficiency for engines. The value of reducing the harmful effects of pollution on the environment has also long been recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The timing and control of the valve arrangement is also a major factor in the performance of the entire engine. As a result, numerous attempts to maximize valve timing over a broad range of constantly variable conditions such as load, speed, and atmosphere have also been explored. Additionally, the size of the valve is a major factor in the performance of the engine. The sizing of the valve is critical, and depends on the bore stroke ratio plus the combustion chamber shape. In many cases, combustion chamber shape dictates that the valve be shrouded on part of its open area creating an impediment to maximum atmospheric flow. The height of the valve lift is also critical in this aspect. Both increasing the lift of the valve and the unshielded area of the valve can allow more fuel inlet volume. This results in improved performance. In addition to these features, the weight of the valve as well as the weight of the springs that hold the valve in place have to resist the inertia forces on the valve such as a revolutions per minute (R.P.M.) increase. As the inertia forces go up, the valve springs require much more strength.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other attempts have been made to create a valve with superior flow characteristics, or adding additional area into the valve. These prior art mechanisms are often complicated resulting in costly manufacturing and performance problems. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,237,549 and 5,357,914 to Huff the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference, illustrate attempts to provide a more efficient valve assembly by providing a vented valve. Huff's valve, however, exhibits numerous deficiencies. For example, Huff's valve includes a spring-loaded inner valve that may or may not close or seal. Huff's valve allows the inner valve to float with the spring behind it, therefore inertia forces, bounce, etc. can all effect the timing. Huff's patents specifically note that the inertia forces and the intake gas pressure differentials cause this inner valve to open and close. Therefore, there is no specific timing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In contrast, the particular invention herein disclosed uses a main valve with an additional auxiliary valve that is easily manufactured and will fit in standard engines without additional modifications. In some embodiments, the springs in this particular assembly may or may not be used depending on the application of the particular unit. The springs are used to further isolate the outer valve from the inner valve and restrain it from erratic motions, soften the closure, etc. Preferably, there are only two spring seats and the seats are concentric on the outer valve. These seats are standard in configuration with no unusual or complicated areas.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosed valve arrangement also allows the valves to rotate and keep the seats in good working condition for a much longer service life. There is no hindrance to any motion due to the additional valve outer valve. The control of the outer valve, as far as the ratio of the inner opening to the outer opening, is controlled by the fuel flow through the engine. In prior art valves, the larger the valve the more difficult it is for fuel to make that 90 degree turn at the valve and then exit through the small opening. The disclosed central opening relieves the pressure congestion at the middle of the intake port allowing the flow between the two openings to be dictated by the shielding of the outer valve and the size of the inner opening. Both openings are automatically adjusted, while open, not by any mechanical means, but by the pressure differential and the two springs of the assembly. When the valve is closed and sealed, the sealing is specifically tight and there is no ambiguity on the sealing surfaces as is in Huff's. Using the disclosed coaxial valve, the outer valve moves only to adjust the opening between the outer diameter and the inner diameter valve openings. This maximizes the flow through the valve reducing the shielded area on the large valve and also opening the center valve to reduce the pressure of the hard right angle turn on the normal large size intake valve.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As may be seen from the foregoing analysis, there have been some attempts to provide an intake valve that allows for increased power and fuel efficiency. These valves have not addressed several of the deficiencies in the art. Most of these prior art devices include complex mechanisms, cannot be easily retrofitted, and require considerable effort to install. Many of the devices are not robust enough to meet the demands of most high-powered engines.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">What is therefore needed in light of the above is a valve assembly that exhibits enhanced robustness, increased power and efficiency. There is a further need for a valve assembly that can be easily used with existing internal combustion engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the foregoing, it is one object of the present invention to provide a valve assembly with increased, fuel efficiency, power and performance. It is another object of the present invention to provide a valve assembly that exhibits improved flow, dimension (volume), homogenous air/fuel charge conditioning and multidimensional constant variable valve timing. It is still another object to provide a valve that unshields certain aspects of the valve lift. It is further object of the disclosed invention to address other important factors concerning the manufacture and implementation of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Consistent with the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a coaxial poppet valve, a method of increasing flow dimension in an internal combustion engine, and a two-piece intake valve assembly are disclosed in suitable detail to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, the above and other objects are achieved by providing a coaxial poppet valve that includes a main poppet valve having a valve stem and a disc and an auxiliary poppet valve having a disc configured to fit around the main poppet valve. The auxiliary valve forms a seal between a port tube and a combustion chamber and is slidably attached to the main poppet valve stem. The coaxial poppet valve may include at least one spring between the auxiliary poppet valve and the main poppet valve. In one embodiment, an upper spring is located between an auxiliary poppet valve guiding element and the disc portion of the main poppet valve. A lower spring is located between the guiding element and a valve guide. In another embodiment, the auxiliary poppet valve includes an annular support connected to the auxiliary poppet valve disc portion and configured to slidably receive the main poppet valve.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The auxiliary poppet valve may include a plurality of spaced disc supports extending between the auxiliary disc and the annular support. In one embodiment, the disc of the main poppet valve has a side wall with an outer surface configured to fit within an inner surface of the auxiliary poppet valve disc and form a seal between the main poppet valve and the auxiliary poppet valve. The auxiliary poppet valve disc may also include an outer wall configured to mate with a valve seat and form a seal therebetween. When the coaxial poppet valve is displaced during an induction cycle, a first opening is defined between the main poppet valve and the auxiliary poppet valve and a second opening is defined between the auxiliary poppet valve and the valve seat. The first opening is preferably formed by the displacement of the main poppet valve by a rocker arm and the second opening is formed by the pressure differential between the combustion chamber and the intake port.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a method of increasing flow dimension in an internal combustion engine includes the steps of securing an auxiliary poppet valve to a main poppet valve stem such that the disc of the main poppet valve forms an air tight seal with the disc portion of the auxiliary poppet valve, and placing the attached auxiliary poppet valve and main poppet valve between the intake port and the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. The auxiliary valve is slidably received on the main poppet valve stem. The method may also include the step of placing at least one spring between the auxiliary poppet and the main poppet. In one embodiment, the method includes placing an upper spring on a spring seat on an upper surface of an auxiliary poppet guiding member and placing a lower spring on a spring seat of a lower surface of the auxiliary poppet guiding member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a final aspect of the invention a two-piece intake valve assembly includes an inner valve having a stem attached to a head and an outer valve movable on the inner valve and having a guiding element configured to receive the inner valve stem. The guiding element is connected to an outer valve head configured to mate with the inner valve head and form a seal. The two-piece intake valve assembly may include at least one control spring configured to isolate the inner valve from the outer valve. In one embodiment the two-piece intake valve assembly includes a first spring located between the outer valve guiding element and the head of the inner valve and a second spring located between the guiding element and a valve guide.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inner valve is configured to selectively open and close a first vent opening between the inner valve head and outer valve head and the outer valve is configured to selectively open and close a second vent opening between the outer valve head and a valve seat. In one embodiment, a plurality of spaced disc supports extend between the guiding element and the outer valve head. In another embodiment, the first vent opening is formed by the action of a rocker arm on the inner valve stem and the second opening is formed by the pressure differential between the combustion chamber and the intake port. The head of the inner valve has a side wall with an outer surface configured to fit within an inner surface of an auxiliary poppet valve head and form a seal between the inner valve and the outer valve and the outer valve head has an outer wall configured to mate with a valve seat and form a seal therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">These, and other, aspects and objects of the present invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">2. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment of a two-piece intake valve assembly such as a coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> of the present invention. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, two-piece intake valve assembly or coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> is configured to seal between an intake port tube <b>22</b> and a combustion chamber <b>24</b> of an internal combustion engine <b>25</b>. Internal combustion engines are well known in the art and as such, the details of such engines need not be described in detail herein. It is recognized that the disclosed coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> can be utilized with a wide variety of known engines, for example, an automobile engine. Coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> is configured to regulate the flow of an air-fuel mixture between the intake port tube <b>22</b> and the combustion chamber <b>24</b> by opening and closing at times corresponding with various engine cycles. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, a valve seat <b>26</b> is fitted at the end of intake port tube <b>22</b> to regulate the opening into combustion chamber <b>24</b> through which the air-fuel mixture passes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with the invention, there is a coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> for alternately opening and blocking the passage of an air-fuel mixture between intake port tube <b>22</b> and combustion chamber <b>24</b>. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> includes an inner valve, preferably a main poppet valve <b>28</b> and an outer, preferably an auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> slidably received on the main poppet valve <b>28</b>. Main poppet valve <b>28</b> is comprised of a valve stem <b>41</b> that includes disc portion, disc or valve head <b>32</b> at a first end and a standard valve stem end <b>34</b> at the opposed end. Valve stem end <b>34</b> may include machined grooves <b>46</b> to accept spring retainer locks (not shown) to lock an annular spring retainer (not shown) at the valve stem end <b>34</b> as is known in the art. The spring retainer preferably retains coil spring <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>) in a predetermined preload position and maintain constant pressure against the main poppet valve <b>28</b> in the direction of the fully closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Main poppet valve disc portion <b>32</b> is configured to fit within the inner annular wall <b>36</b> of the disc, disc portion or head <b>31</b> of the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> and maintain an airtight seal <b>91</b> between intake port tube <b>22</b> and combustion tube <b>24</b> when the coaxial poppet valve <b>22</b> in its fully closed position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Disc portion <b>32</b> includes a flat outer surface <b>38</b> and an angled or curved annular side wall <b>40</b>. The angle of the side wall <b>40</b> corresponds to the angle cut into the inner annular wall <b>36</b> of the disc portion <b>44</b> of auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> so as to form a complete seal <b>91</b> when mated in the closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, main poppet valve <b>28</b> is configured to slidably fit within the pathway defined by a standard valve guide <b>39</b>. Valve guide <b>39</b> is formed as part of the overall head of an engine as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> is configured to slidably fit over the valve stem <b>41</b> of main poppet valve <b>28</b>. Auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> is comprised of a guiding element, such as an annular support, or annular base sleeve <b>50</b> configured to slidably fit over main poppet valve stem <b>41</b>. Annular base sleeve <b>50</b> preferably has a diameter that is slightly greater main poppet valve stem <b>41</b> to enable a smooth sliding action. Three disc supports <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>extend from the annular base sleeve <b>50</b> to the disc portion or head <b>31</b> of the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b>. Auxiliary poppet valve disc portion <b>31</b> has a hole in the center configured to receive main poppet valve <b>32</b>. As illustrated by the drawings, disc portion <b>31</b> of auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> includes a flat upper surface <b>54</b> and an angled annular wall <b>36</b>. The annular wall <b>36</b> may be designed to incorporate many different traditional internal combustion engine valve designs. The outer surface or outer wall <b>37</b> of the angled annular wall <b>36</b> preferably corresponds to the angle, curvature or surface features of the annular valve seat <b>26</b> so as to form a complete seal <b>93</b> with the valve seat <b>26</b> when the valve is in the closed position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The angle of the inner surface or inner wall <b>39</b> of the annular side wall <b>36</b> corresponds to the angle, curvature or surface features cut into the annular side wall <b>40</b> of the main poppet valve <b>28</b> so as to form an airtight seal <b>91</b> between the main poppet valve <b>28</b> and auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Located on the lower and upper edges of the annular base sleeve <b>50</b> are spring seats <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b </i>configured to receive a first or lower spring <b>58</b><i>a </i>and a second or upper spring <b>58</b><i>b </i>respectively. Spring <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>serves to bias and isolate the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> and main poppet valve <b>28</b> in a predetermined position when both valves are in the open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The springs are used to further isolate the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> and restrain it from erratic motions, soften the closure, etc. It should be understood that springs <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>in this particular assembly may or may not be used depending on the application of the particular unit. It should be understood that in the manufacture and sale of the coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b>, the main poppet valve <b>28</b>, auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> and springs <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>may preassembled as a unit. Although not shown, the main poppet valve stem <b>41</b> may further include annular oil seals. The components described are preferably constructed from iron, or steel, preferably stainless steel.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">3. In Use and Operation</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate the coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> in its resting state. During the resting state, coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> and exhaust valve mechanism (not shown) are in the resting and fully closed positions such that the intake port tube <b>22</b> and an exhaust port (not shown), are blocked from communication with the combustion chamber <b>24</b> and a complete seal from combustion pressures created by the combustion process is facilitated. In the resting state, spring <b>48</b> biases main poppet valve <b>28</b> in the closed position against the angled inner annular wall <b>36</b> of auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b>. The force of the spring <b>48</b> acting on the main poppet valve <b>28</b> further serves to maintain the entire coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> in the fully closed position such that the intake port tube <b>22</b> is blocked from fluid communication with the combustion chamber <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate the coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b> during the during the induction cycle of a typical internal combustion engine. After the exhaust gases have been scavenged from the combustion chamber and the induction process begins, a piston (not shown), begins to move rapidly down the cylinder (not shown) and is sealed against the cylinder by means of multiple rings. This creates a rapid pressure drop in the combustion chamber <b>24</b> which at a certain point becomes lower than the pressure in the intake port <b>22</b>. This pressure differential applies force against the port side of the coaxial poppet valve <b>20</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, main poppet valve <b>28</b> is displaced via a rocker arm (not shown) connected to the valve stem <b>24</b> in the direction of the open position in a predetermined timed sequence as is known in the art. As main poppet valve <b>28</b> is displaced independent of the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b>, the atmosphere mixture flows from the port <b>22</b> through a first opening or first vent opening <b>70</b> between main poppet valve <b>28</b> and auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b>, into the combustion chamber <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As the main poppet valve <b>28</b> is displaced, it no longer retains the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> in the closed position. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pressure differential applies force against the port side <b>71</b> of the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> causing the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> to be displaced from the valve seat <b>26</b> allowing the flow of atmosphere mixture from the port <b>22</b> through the first vent opening <b>70</b> between main poppet valve <b>28</b> and auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b>, as well as a second opening or second vent opening <b>72</b> between the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> and the valve seat <b>22</b>. Springs <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>maintain bias and isolate the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> and main poppet <b>28</b> thereby maintaining second vent opening <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The aforementioned pressure differential, which is responsible for the auxiliary poppet valve's cumulative actuation and displacement, changes its timing in relation to crank angle throughout the R.P.M. (revolutions per minute) range. It also changes in response to throttle position. Since the main poppet valve <b>28</b> actuation is independent of the auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> actuation, the auxiliary poppet valve automatically responds to these changes with varied timing, duration and displacement once the main poppet valve <b>28</b> has been displaced. This broadens the torque and useful output range as well as improves the throttle response of a typical internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when both main <b>28</b> and auxiliary <b>30</b> poppet valves are displaced open at the same time, open valve area is increased, which in turn improves flow dimension, increases velocity of the air/fuel atmosphere, and increases turbulence in the combustion chamber, which creates a more homogeneous a air/fuel charge. This significantly improves the performance, fuel efficiency, and emission quality of a typical internal combustion engine. Once the induction cycle completes, the rocker arm relieves the main poppet valve <b>28</b> and spring <b>48</b> returns the main poppet valve and underlying auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> to their fully closed positions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out the present invention is disclosed above, practice of the present invention is not limited thereto. It will be manifest that various additions, modifications and rearrangements of the features of the present invention may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the underlying inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the invention discloses in one embodiment an auxiliary poppet valve <b>30</b> comprised of a guiding element and plurality of separately formed disc supports <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. However, it should be recognized that the entire auxiliary poppet valve may include a variety of alternative configurations such as a single integrally formed disc support.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Moreover, as noted throughout the application the individual components need not be formed in the disclosed shapes, or assembled in the disclosed configuration, but could be provided in virtually any shape, and assembled in virtually any configuration, so as to provide for a coaxial poppet valve that includes an inner and outer valve.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, all the disclosed features of each disclosed embodiment can be combined with, or substituted for, the disclosed features of every other disclosed embodiment except where such features are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is intended that the appended claims cover all such additions, modifications and rearrangements. Expedient embodiments of the present invention are differentiated by the appended claims.</p>
