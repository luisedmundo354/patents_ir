<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to various power supply apparatuses used in automobiles, electric vehicles, construction machinery, various public welfare devices (such as video devices, television sets, and audio devices), various industrial devices (such as personal computers, communication devices, and FA control devices), and so on. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a power supply circuit and a large current load control apparatus of switching power supply using GaN-FETs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, power semiconductor devices such as diodes, thyristors, triacs, GTO (Gate Turn Off) thyristors, bipolar transistors, MOS-FETs, and IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) are used in various power supply apparatuses. In these power semiconductor devices, a main current that flows through the power semiconductor device is controlled by switching control or analog control. These power semiconductor devices are devices serving as nuclei for implementing stabilized power supply apparatuses, such as switching regulators and linear regulators, and inverters for performing conversion to power having an arbitrary frequency and an arbitrary output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In these power semiconductor devices, there are switching loss caused by superposition of transient voltage and current at the time of switching and conduction loss caused at the time of conduction. These losses are converted mainly to heat. By the way, the conduction loss has such a characteristic as to become small as the on-resistance is decreased. This on-resistance corresponds to composite resistance of the channel resistance, bulk resistance, and so on existing within the semiconductor except contact resistance between electrodes and semiconductor layer interfaces in the power semiconductor device. Heat generated by the power semiconductor device causes a temperature rise of the power semiconductor device itself. Due to this temperature rise, the power semiconductor device operates at high temperature. Due to this high temperature operation, heat generation of the power semiconductor device is promoted. Such positive feedback is caused. As a result, thermal destruction of the power semiconductor device is caused by thermal runaway.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Usually in the power supply apparatus, therefore, the power semiconductor device itself is provided with a radiation mechanism and in addition, with a radiator such as radiation fins for radiating heat generated by the power semiconductor device. Furthermore, a radiation fan is provided in order to improve the radiation effect in some cases. Furthermore, there is provided a fail safe mechanism that senses the temperature of the power semiconductor device and stops operation of the power semiconductor device when the temperature rises to such a value as to cause thermal runaway.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the radiator is formed of a good thermal conductive material, such as aluminum, in order to provide the radiator with a function of heat sink as well. This results in a problem that the whole power supply apparatus becomes large in weight and capacity. Especially as for mobile power supply apparatuses for vehicles or portable power supply apparatuses, emergence of power supply apparatuses reduced in size and weight is demanded strongly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, in a conventional power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a radiator <b>302</b> having a large weight and a large capacity is needed. The power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a DC-DC converter power supply apparatus of a vehicle. A MOS-FET using a Si semiconductor material is incorporated in the power supply apparatus as a switching element. The apparatus main body <b>301</b> encloses all the elements forming the power supply apparatus. On the top of the apparatus main body <b>301</b>, a radiator <b>302</b> formed of aluminum is provided. On a junction interface between the radiator <b>302</b> and the apparatus main body <b>301</b>, a MOS-FET, which is not illustrated, stick to the radiator <b>302</b>. Heat generated by the MOS-FET is absorbed by the radiator <b>302</b>, and radiated by fins disposed on the top of the radiator <b>302</b>. Because of installation of the radiator <b>302</b>, the weight and volume of the whole power supply apparatus become excessively large.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the radiator needs to stick to the power semiconductor device in order to favorably transfer the heat from the power semiconductor device. This brings about limitation on design that the radiator needs to be disposed with due regard to the outer periphery of the casing of the power supply apparatus and the radiation path. This results in a problem that the degree of freedom of the power supply apparatus is reduced. In addition, as for devices such as vehicles using the power supply apparatus, design of the whole device must be changed according to the disposition position of the power supply apparatus. Thus, there is also a problem that the design of the whole device is largely affected.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, in designing the radiator, it is necessary to conduct sufficient radiation design with due regard to the ambient environment of the power supply apparatus. In addition, it is necessary to prevent the power semiconductor device, which is a heat source, from affecting other circuit elements having low heat-resisting property. This results in a problem that much time and labor are required for radiation design and arrangement design of other circuit elements included in the power supply apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, a heat protection circuit for preventing thermal runaway of the power supply apparatus is needed. This heat protection circuit monitors the temperature changes of important components, such as the power semiconductor device, included in the power supply apparatus. When the temperature has risen to a predetermined value, the heat protection circuit conducts fail safe control, such as stopping the power supply apparatus and causing shift to a low dissipation mode. This heat protection circuit is a complicated circuit that senses the temperature, output current, and so on and conducts a shift to fail safe control by using a logic processing circuit. Thus, there is a problem that the power supply apparatus must have a heat protection circuit having such a complicated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Recently as semiconductor devices having high heat-resisting property, high breakdown voltage, high operation rate and low conduction loss, GaN (gallium nitride) FETs (Field Effect Transistors) have been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Heretofore, such power supply circuits have been applied to, for example, automobiles, various public welfare devices (such as video, television and audio devices), and industrial devices (such as personal computers, communication devices, and FA control devices).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above described power supply circuit includes a transformer. A transistor made of, for example, a power MOS element turns on and off according to a gate signal. As a result, an output voltage is generated on a secondary winding side.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the above described power supply circuit, however, the power MOS element used as the transistor, such as a power MOS-FET (2SK2313) generates much heat. Therefore, it is necessary to perform the radiation design accurately. A channel temperature Tch-max of the power MOS-FET itself at an ambient temperature of 85° C. is calculated as</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">θ<sub>c</sub>+θ<sub>s</sub>: thermal resistance between case and radiator From the foregoing description, it is necessary to select a radiator having a thermal resistance of 5.9° C./W or less. For example, therefore, a radiation plate made of an aluminum plate of 100 cm<sup>2 </sup>having a thickness of 1 mm becomes necessary. As a result, the conventional power supply circuit has a problem that the circuit configuration becomes large and heavy because of the radiation plate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, heretofore, such a large current load control apparatus is applied to, for example, lighting control of head lamps of automobiles.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above described large current load control apparatus, lighting control of a head lamp is conducted by turning on and off a power MOS-FET formed of, for example, an on/off control switching element provided on a power supply line, which connects a battery to the lamp, under the control of a microcomputer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this control apparatus, however, the power MOS-FET used as the switching element of on/off control generates much heat.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Embodiments of the power supply apparatus, power supply circuit, and the large current load control apparatus according to the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic circuit configuration of the power supply apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. This power supply apparatus is a linear regulator. This power supply apparatus is a stabilized power supply apparatus for converting an input voltage V<sub>in </sub>of 12 VDC to 5VDC of maximum 10 A and outputting the 5VDC as an output voltage V<sub>out</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a GaN-FET <b>10</b> is connected between an input terminal <b>11</b> of an input voltage V<sub>in </sub>side and an output terminal <b>12</b> of an output voltage V<sub>out </sub>side. Drain D and source S of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> are connected to the input terminal <b>11</b> side and the output terminal <b>12</b> side, respectively. Gate G of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> is connected to a Zener diode ZD. In other words, the GaN-FET <b>10</b> controls the main current, which flows from the input voltage V<sub>in </sub>side to the output terminal V<sub>out </sub>side.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An electrolytic capacitor C<b>1</b> is a capacitor for smoothing a voltage waveform in the case where the input voltage V<sub>in </sub>is full-wave rectified by a bridge diode and so on. The Zener diode ZD and a resistor R form a shunt regulator, and conducts voltage setting so as to convert the input voltage of 12 V to the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>of 5 V. Assuming now that the terminal voltage of the Zener diode ZD is a voltage V<sub>z </sub>and the gate-source voltage of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> is a voltage V<sub>gs</sub>, the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>is represented by the following equation (1).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other words, it follows that
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>V<sub>out</sub>=V<sub>z</sub>−V<sub>gs</sub>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where the voltage V<sub>z </sub>of the Zener diode ZD is concretely set to 5.6 V and the voltage V<sub>gs </sub>is 0.3 V. Therefore, the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>is output as 5.6 V−0.3 V=5.3 V. A ceramic capacitor C<b>2</b> is a capacitor for preventing oscillation of the GaN-FET <b>10</b>. Further more, an electrolytic capacitor C<b>3</b> is a capacitor for smoothing an instantaneous variation of a load, which is not illustrated, connected to the output voltage V<sub>out</sub>. As a result, the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> supplies a stabilized power supply voltage having an output voltage of 5.3 V to the load.
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As a general FET, a Si semiconductor, which can be easily subjected to fine processing, is used. In the case of an FET that makes fast operation possible, a GaAs compound semiconductor is used. The GaN-FET <b>10</b> is an FET that uses a GaN compound semiconductor and that has high heat-resisting property, high breakdown voltage, high operation rate and low conduction loss. The GaN-FET <b>10</b> has, for example, a HEMT type or an MES (Metal-semiconductor) type FET structure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the GaN-FET <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a GaN buffer layer <b>2</b> is formed on a semi-insulating sapphire substrate <b>1</b>. On the GaN buffer layer <b>2</b>, a semi-insulating GaN layer <b>3</b> is formed. On the semi-insulating GaN layer <b>3</b>, an n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> is formed. In addition, on a part of a central portion of a surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, a diffusion layer <b>4</b><i>a </i>with In and C or Mg doped is formed. On the diffusion layer <b>4</b><i>a</i>, an electrode of the gate G is loaded. On the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, an n-type GaN layer <b>5</b> is formed. Over one of the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, an electrode of the source S is loaded. Over the other of the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, an electrode of the drain D is loaded. Portions other than the electrodes are covered by an insulating film <b>6</b> of SiO.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each of the semiconductor layers of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed of a GaN compound semiconductor, and formed by using an epitaxial crystal growth method such as the MOCVD method or the MBE method. The term GaN compound semiconductor is a general term of GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, InAlGaN, InGaNAs, InGaNP and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the GaN-FET <b>10</b>, the on-resistance per unit area becomes nearly 1/100 or less that of the FET of the Si semiconductor, and the conduction loss is small. Therefore, the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET <b>10</b> becomes extremely small. Furthermore, the operation temperature of the Si semiconductor is in the range of approximately 125° C. to 150° C. at most, whereas the GaN-FET <b>10</b> can operate stably even at 500° C. A current of 10 A at most flows through the GaN-FET <b>10</b>. Therefore, channel (junction) generated heat maximum temperature T<b>1</b>chmax of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> will now be compared with channel generated heat maximum temperature T<b>2</b>chmax of the FET of the Si semiconductor through which a maximum current of 10 A flows, and studied.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When a maximum current of 10 A flows, therefore, the temperature rises to 150° C. in the FET of the Si semiconductor. In the GaN-FET <b>10</b>, however, the temperature is nearly the same as the ambient temperature T<sub>a</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>max</sub>, and there is little temperature rise. Therefore, a radiator for cooling the GaN-FET <b>10</b> of the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> becomes unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing differences in structure between the power supply apparatus using the FET of the Si semiconductor and the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) is a sectional of a power supply apparatus corresponding to the conventional power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), a FET <b>20</b> of a Si semiconductor is used. The FET <b>20</b> generates much heat. Accordingly, a radiator <b>22</b> made of aluminum having high conductivity is provided on the top of an apparatus main body <b>21</b>. One end surface of the radiator <b>22</b> is opposed to the apparatus main body <b>21</b>, and it serves as a lid of the apparatus main body <b>21</b>. On the other end surface of the radiator <b>22</b>, radiation fins are provided to radiate heat generated by the FET <b>20</b> to the environment. Most of the heat generated by the conventional power supply apparatus is occupied by heat generated by the FET <b>20</b>. Therefore, the FET <b>20</b> is joined to the one end surface of the radiator <b>22</b> so as to make the contact area large.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) is a sectional view of the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET <b>10</b>. The power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) differs from the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) in that the radiator <b>22</b> is not provided. As described above this is because the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) uses the GaN-FET <b>10</b>, which generates less heat. In the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET <b>10</b>, therefore, the radiator <b>22</b>, which is large in weight and volume, can be eliminated. As a result, reduction of the size and weight of the power supply apparatus can be realized, and it becomes unnecessary to conduct the radiation design calculation for design of the radiator <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, since the GaN-FET <b>10</b> itself does not generate heat, the GaN-FET <b>10</b> can be disposed in an arbitrary position of the apparatus main body <b>23</b>. Therefore, arrangement of components included in the power supply apparatus, i.e., layout design can be conduct flexibly.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, since heat generation of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> need not be considered, the radiation design of the whole power supply apparatus is facilitated. In addition, since the layout design can be conducted flexibly, it becomes possible to integrate the layout of components included in the power supply apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>). As a result, it becomes possible to obtain a power supply apparatus <b>24</b> contracted as compared with the power supply apparatus main body <b>23</b>. Accordingly, further reduction of the size and weight of the power supply apparatus is realized. Furthermore, because of reduced size and weight of the power supply apparatus and less heat generated by the power supply apparatus, this power supply apparatus can be disposed in an arbitrary position of a device such as a vehicle using the power supply apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The reason why the size of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) is reduced as compared with the size of the FET <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) is that the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET <b>10</b> is small and consequently the radiation structure of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> itself becomes unnecessary and the size and weight of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> itself become small.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of the simplest linear regulator. In addition, a circuit for stabilizing the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>under the load variation may be provided. For example, the voltage V<sub>z </sub>of the Zener diode ZD may be adjusted by using resistors connected in series across the output voltage V<sub>out</sub>, thereby conducting voltage division, using semifixed resistors as respective resistors, and adjusting the semifixed resistors finely.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, there may be provided a protection circuit that uses a differential amplifier for comparing a voltage divided by resistors connected in series with a reference voltage and thereby conducts protection against overcurrent and load shortcircuit. Since the temperature of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> itself is hardly raised even by an overcurrent, however, the thermal protection circuit may be simplified or eliminated. In this case, other components can be prevented from being destroyed by providing a fuse or the like on the input voltage V<sub>in </sub>side. As a result, in the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET <b>10</b>, the thermal protection circuit can be simplified or eliminated. Therefore, reduction in size and weight of the power supply apparatus is further promoted, and the time and labor required for the design of the power supply apparatus can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to the first embodiment, the GaN-FET <b>10</b> having a low on-resistance is used, and consequently the radiator <b>22</b> of the power supply apparatus is not needed, and the GaN-FET <b>10</b> can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus. Therefore, the power supply apparatus can be remarkably reduced in size and weight. Furthermore, the time and labor required for the radiation design including the radiator and the design of the thermal protection circuit can be reduced. In addition, the time and labor required for the radiation design including the radiator and the design of thermal protection circuit can be reduced, and the GaN-FET <b>10</b> can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus, therefore the time and labor required for the layout design of the whole power supply apparatus can also be reduced. In addition, since the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET <b>10</b> itself is small and the GaN-FET <b>10</b> has a heat-resisting property of 500° C. or more, it becomes possible to use the power supply apparatus for a long time and the maintenance required for the power supply apparatus is also reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described. In a power supply apparatus according to the second embodiment, the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> are connected in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic circuit configuration of a power supply apparatus that is an embodiment of the present invention. In the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a GaN-FET <b>30</b> having the same configuration as that of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> is connected in parallel with the GaN-FET <b>10</b>. The parallel connection of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> and the GaN-FET <b>30</b> unit connecting sources S, drains D and gates G of each of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> and together. Remaining configuration is the same as that of the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The same components are denoted by like characters.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, each of the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> themselves has an extremely small on-resistance. Therefore, the conduction loss is low and the amount of generated heat is small. Therefore, adjacent arrangement of a plurality of GaN-FETs becomes possible. Parallel connection of GaN-FETs that does not cause a large weight change and a large volume change as compared with the case of the GaN-FET <b>10</b> alone becomes possible. As a result, the maximum current value of the power supply apparatus can be doubled. In other words, each of the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can flow a maximum current of 10 A. By connecting them in parallel, however, a maximum current of 20 A can be flown. As a result, the current supply capability of the whole power supply apparatus can be doubled.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing differences in structure between the power supply apparatus using the FET of the Si semiconductor and the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> connected in parallel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) is a sectional of the conventional power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) is a sectional view of the power supply apparatus having the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> connected in parallel and arranged so as to be adjacent to each other. In the case where a power supply apparatus that flows a current of 20 A in the same way as the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> connected in parallel is implemented by using the FET <b>20</b> of the Si semiconductor, the amount of heat generated by the FET <b>20</b> becomes further large. Therefore, the radiator <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) must be made further larger.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the other hand, although the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) has a capability that is twice the amount of power supplied by the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the radiator <b>22</b> is not needed and consequently remarkable reduction in size and weight is realized. Furthermore, since the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> can be arranged so as to be adjacent to each other, design of the power supply apparatus is also facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), a power supply apparatus further reduced in size and weight is implemented by conducting the layout design of respective components included in the power supply apparatus in the same way as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">By the way, the configuration having two GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> connected in parallel is shown In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, the configuration is not limited thereto, but a configuration having three or more GaN-FETs are connected in parallel may be used. In this case, the current supply capability can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition to the operation effects of the first embodiment, according to the second embodiment, the power supply capability of the power supply apparatus itself can be doubled with the same weight, volume, and scale as those when one GaN-FET is used by only connecting the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> in parallel. Furthermore, in view of the current situation that the development of a GaN-FET capable of flowing a large current therethrough is under progress, the parallel connection of GaN-FETs becomes effective unit which easily realizes the reduction of size and weight in large-power supply apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A third embodiment of the present invention will now be described. In both the first and second embodiments, the power supply apparatus serves as a linear regulator. In the third embodiment, however, the above described GaN-FET is used in a power supply apparatus serving as a switching regulator.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic circuit configuration of a power supply apparatus that is a third embodiment of the present invention. The power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a switching regulator. In other words, in the power supply apparatuses shown in the first and second embodiments the current value is controlled linearly by using the GaN-FETs <b>10</b> and <b>30</b>, whereas in this power supply apparatus the current value is controlled by switching control.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The switching regulator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a switching regulator of forward type. In this switching regulator, a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal output by a pulse width control circuit <b>41</b> is applied to a GaN-FET <b>40</b> at its gate, and the GaN-FET <b>40</b> is switched. When the GaN-FET <b>40</b> is on, energy of an input voltage V<sub>in </sub>stored across an electrolytic capacitor C<b>41</b> is transferred to an electrolytic capacitor C<b>42</b> via a transformer T<b>1</b>, a diode D<b>1</b> and an inductor L<b>1</b>. When the GaN-FET <b>40</b> is off, energy left in the inductor L<b>1</b> is transferred to the electrolytic capacitor C<b>42</b> via a diode D<b>2</b>. The electrolytic capacitor C<b>42</b> outputs it as an output voltage V<sub>out</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A differential amplifier <b>42</b> compares a voltage obtained by voltage division using resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> connected in series across the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>with a reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>, and notifies the pulse width control circuit <b>41</b> of the control value caused by a load variation, via a photocoupler PC. The pulse width control circuit <b>41</b> applies a PWM signal corresponding to the control value input from the photocoupler PC to the GaN-FET <b>40</b> at its gate, controls the current value of the GaN-FET <b>40</b>, and thereby conducts power control of the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>side (secondary side).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In this switching regulator, GaN-FET <b>40</b> is used as a switching element of a primary side. In the same way as the GaN-FET <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> in the first and second embodiments, however, the GaN-FET <b>40</b> is smaller in on-resistance than the conventional FET of the Si semiconductor. Therefore, the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET <b>40</b> itself is little and the radiator for radiation becomes unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Furthermore, since the heat generated by the GaN-FET <b>40</b> itself is little and the radiator is unnecessary, the GaN-FET <b>40</b> can be disposed arbitrarily in the switching regulator. As a result, reduction of the size and weight of the switching regulator can be realized, and in addition the time and labor required for the design including the radiation design can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic circuit configuration of another power supply apparatus that is the third embodiment of the present invention. Although the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a switching regulator of forward type, the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a switching regulator of flyback type. In other words, in the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, power energy of the primary side is transferred to the secondary side when the GaN-FET <b>40</b> is on. In the power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, power energy of the primary side is transferred to the secondary side when a GaN-FET <b>50</b> is off.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in this switching regulator, a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal output by a pulse width control circuit <b>51</b> is applied to the GaN-FET <b>50</b> at its gate, and the GaN-FET <b>50</b> is switched. A winding direction of a transformer T<b>2</b> is different from a winding direction of a transformer T<b>1</b>. When the GaN-FET <b>50</b> is on, energy of an input voltage V<sub>in </sub>is stored in the transformer T<b>1</b>. When the GaN-FET <b>50</b> is off, energy stored in the transformer T<b>2</b> is transferred to an electrolytic capacitor C<b>52</b> via a diode D<b>3</b> and the electrolytic capacitor C<b>52</b> outputs an output voltage V<sub>out</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A differential amplifier <b>52</b> compares a voltage obtained by voltage division using resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> connected in series across the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>with a reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>, and notifies the pulse width control circuit <b>51</b> of the control value caused by a load variation, via a photocoupler PC. The pulse width control circuit <b>51</b> applies a PWM signal corresponding to the control value input from the photocoupler PC to the GaN-FET <b>50</b> at its gate, controls the current value of the GaN-FET <b>50</b>, and thereby conducts power control of the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>side.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Since the switching regulator of flyback type also uses the GaN-FET <b>50</b>, the radiator becomes unnecessary, reduction of the size and weight of the whole switching regulator is realized, and design including the radiation design can be conducted flexibly.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the same way, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of another switching regulator using a GaN-FET. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) shows an example of a switching regulator of push-pull type (center tap type). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) shows an example of a switching regulator of half bridge type. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>c</i>) shows an example of a switching regulator of full bridge type. In switching regulators shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>8</b>(<i>c</i>), GaN-FETs <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>81</b> to <b>84</b> are used.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Since each of the switching regulators shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>8</b>(<i>c</i>) also uses the GaN-FETs <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>81</b> to <b>84</b>, the radiator becomes unnecessary, reduction of the size and weight of the whole switching regulator is realized, and design including the radiation design can be conducted flexibly. In particular, since a plurality of switching elements are used and a plurality of GaN-FETs <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>81</b> to <b>84</b> are used as each of the switching elements, adjacent arrangement of GaN-FETs becomes possible and reduction of size and weight of the switching regulator is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In other switching regulators as well, the above described operational effect can be achieved by using GaN-FETs as the switching elements of the switching regulator in the same way. For example, the switching regulator may be a self-excited switching regulator using a RCC (ringing choke coil) scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">All of the above described switching regulators use the pulse width control. However, switching regulators are not limited thereto. The current value of each GaN-FET may be controlled by the frequency of pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the same way as the first and second embodiments, according to the third embodiment, the radiator of the power supply apparatus is not required and GaN-FETs can be disposed in arbitrary positions in the power supply apparatus even in the case where the power supply apparatus is a switching regulator, by using GaN-FETs, which are small in on-resistance, as the switching elements. Therefore, the power supply apparatus can be remarkably reduced in size and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Furthermore, the time and labor required for the radiation design including the radiator can be reduced. In addition, since the GaN-FETs can be disposed in arbitrary positions in the power supply apparatus, the time and labor required for the layout design of the whole power supply apparatus can be reduced. In addition, since the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FETs themselves is small and the GaN-FETs have a heat-resisting property, it becomes possible to use the power supply apparatus for a long time and the maintenance required for the power supply apparatus is also reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be described. All of the power supply apparatuses of the first to third embodiments are DC-DC converters. In the fourth embodiment, however, GaN-FETs are used as switching elements used in a DC-AC inverter.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic circuit configuration of a power supply apparatus that is a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The power supply apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> rectifies an AC current supplied from a commercial three-phase AC power source <b>90</b>, by using a diode group included in a rectifying circuit <b>91</b>, and smooths the rectified current by using an electrolytic capacitor C<b>91</b>. The smoothed current is converted to an AC current having a desired frequency and a desired output voltage by an inverter circuit <b>92</b>. The AC current is output to an induction motor (IM) <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The inverter circuit <b>92</b> includes GaN-FET pairs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, and <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> serving as switching element pairs respectively corresponding to the U phase, V phase and W phase. A drive control section <b>93</b> sends PWM signals corresponding to respective phases to the GaN-FET pairs <b>101</b> to <b>106</b>, and conducts switching control on each of each of the GaN-FET pairs <b>101</b> to <b>106</b>, and three-phase AC power having a desired frequency and out put voltage is supplied. Gates of the GaN-FETs <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are supplied with inverted signals of PWM signals supplied to each of the GaN-FETs <b>101</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Since the power supply apparatus serving as an inverter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> uses the GaN-FETs <b>101</b> to <b>106</b>, the radiator becomes unnecessary, reduction of the size and weight of the whole switching regulator is realized, and design including the radiation design can be conducted flexibly.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Even in the case of other power supply apparatuses serving as inverters, such as an inverter that is used in a rice cooking jar using induction heating and that converts a DC current to a desired AC current by using one switching element, a similar operational effect can be obtained by using a GaN-FET as a switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the same way as the first to third embodiments, according to the fourth embodiment, the radiator of the power supply apparatus is not required and GaN-FETs can be disposed in arbitrary positions in the power supply apparatus, by using GaN-FETs, which are small in on-resistance, as the switching elements used in an inverter. Therefore, the power supply apparatus can be remarkably reduced in size and weight. Furthermore, the time and labor required for the radiation design for designing the radiator can be reduced.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the foregoing description of the first to fourth embodiments, FETs of MSE type are used as GaN-FETs. However, GaN-FETs are not limited thereto, but they may be FETs of HEMT type or MOS type. Furthermore, various semiconductor elements such as thyristors, triacs, GTO thyristors, bipolar transistors, MOS-FETs, and IGBTs may also be semiconductor elements using GaN compound semiconductors.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, in all of the first to fourth embodiments, there has been explained the case where semiconductor elements using GaN compound semiconductors have been applied to the power supply apparatuses. However, the semiconductor elements are not limited thereto, but any semiconductor elements using a semiconductor material capable of making the on-resistance small may be used. For example, semiconductor elements using a SiC compound semiconductor material or semiconductor elements using an AlN compound semiconductor material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">An embodiment of a power supply circuit according to the present invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a power supply circuit is, for example, a switching power supply circuit (one-transistor forward type). It includes a transformer T<b>1</b> supplied with an input voltage E<sub>in</sub>, a GaN-FET <b>200</b> connected to a primary winding of the transformer T<b>1</b>, an electrolytic capacitor C<b>1</b> connected in parallel with the primary winding of the transformer T<b>1</b>, a diode D<b>1</b> and a coil L<b>1</b> connected to a secondary winding of the transformer T<b>1</b>, and a diode D<b>2</b> and an electrolytic capacitor C<b>2</b> connected in parallel with the secondary winding of the transformer T<b>1</b>. On the secondary winding side, a voltage E<b>2</b> is generated according to a winding ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the GaN-FET <b>200</b>, for example, a GaN buffer layer <b>2</b> is formed on a semi-insulating sapphire substrate <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. On the GaN buffer layer <b>2</b>, a semi-insulating GaN layer <b>3</b> and an n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> are sequentially formed. In addition, on a part of a central portion of a surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>41</b><i>d</i>, a diffusion layer <b>4</b><i>a </i>with In and C or Mg doped is formed. On the diffusion layer <b>4</b><i>a</i>, an electrode of the gate G is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Furthermore, on the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, an n-type GaN layer <b>5</b> is formed. Over the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> and on one n-type GaN layer <b>5</b>, an electrode of the source S is loaded. Over the other of the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> and on the other n-type GaN layer <b>5</b>, an electrode of the drain D is loaded. Portions other than the electrodes of the gate G, the source S and the drain D are covered by an insulating film <b>6</b> of SiO.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Each of the semiconductor layers of the GaN-FET <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed of a GaN compound semiconductor, and formed by using an epitaxial crystal growth method such as the MOCVD method or the MBE method. The term GaN compound semiconductor is a general term of GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, InAlGaN, InGaNAs, InGaNP and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If a gate signal (for example, 100 kHz) is input to the gate of the GaN-FET <b>200</b>, then the GaN-FET <b>200</b> turns on and off according to the gate signal. At this time, an input voltage E<sub>in </sub>is supplied to a primary winding of the transformer T<b>1</b>, and a voltage E<b>2</b> is generated according to the winding ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Assuming now that the ratio between the primary winding and the secondary winding is N<b>1</b>:N<b>2</b>, the voltage E<b>2</b> becomes

<br/>
At this time, a voltage of a positive direction is supplied to the diode D<b>1</b>, and consequently a current Is flows through the diode D<b>1</b>. Since this current Is charges the electrolytic capacitor C<b>2</b> through the coil L<b>1</b>, E<b>0</b> is output as an output voltage. At the same time, energy is stored within the coil L<b>1</b> by the current flown through the coil L<b>1</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If the GaN-FET <b>200</b> passes through an ON period and turns off, then transmission of power from the primary winding side through the transformer T<b>1</b> disappears, and a voltage of an opposite polarity is generated in the coil L<b>1</b>. It is counter electromotive force caused by the energy stored in the coil L<b>1</b> until then. By this counter electromotive force, such a current as to charge the electrolytic capacitor C<b>2</b> is flown through the diode D<b>2</b>. By the way, the electrolytic capacitor C<b>1</b> is a smoothing capacitor and functions so as to always input a flat voltage waveform to the transformer T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this way, in the power supply circuit, the current that charges the capacitor C<b>2</b> over the whole period continues to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The gate of the GaN-FET <b>200</b> may be controlled by using an stabilizing circuit that monitors the load current, alters the on/off control time of the GaN-FET <b>200</b> according to the load variation, and obtains a stabilized output.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Design of a circuit using the GaN-FET <b>200</b> will now be described. When conducting such a circuit design, it has heretofore been necessary to conduct the radiation design of the FET accurately. Therefore, the design time becomes long, and it is necessary to consider the layout of the print board and the like. The degree of freedom of the layout is limited. In recent years, therefore, simplification and shortening of the radiation design of the FET have been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">On the other hand, in the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an output current of up to 30 A is obtained. Therefore, a current I<sub>t</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>max </sub>that flows the transformer T<b>1</b> is obtained by the following equation.

<br/>
Assuming now that the ratio of the transformer T<b>1</b> is N<b>1</b>:N<b>2</b>=<b>3</b>:<b>1</b> and the ripple current is 30% of the output current I<sub>0</sub>, the current I<sub>s</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>max </sub>is

Even if a power supply circuit for outputting 30 A is to be constituted, it becomes possible to realize sufficient derating for the channel temperature without a radiation plate, because a GaN-FET, which generates less heat and which is capable of operating at high temperature (stable operation at 500° C. or higher), is used as the FET.
</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0147">Thus, in the present embodiment, a GaN-FET, which is small in on-resistance Ron max and which is capable of operating at high temperature as compared with the conventional power MOS element, is used. As a result, the transistor does not generate heat, and the same operation as that of the conventional transistor can be conducted. In addition, the radiation plate becomes unnecessary. Accordingly, it becomes possible to reduce the manufacturing cost, reduce the work cost of the radiation plate, and reduce the size of the ECU.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0148">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the radiation design of the power supply circuit can be simplified and the circuit pattern design becomes easy. As a result, the design time of the ECU can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0149">The present invention is not limited to these embodiments. Without departing from the spirit of the present invention, various modifications can be carried out. In the present embodiment, one-transistor forward type has been described as an example of a switching power supply circuit. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, but the present invention can also be applied to power supply circuits of, for example, the chopper scheme, RCC scheme, and flyback scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0150">An embodiment of a large current load control apparatus according to the present invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a circuit block of a large current load control apparatus used in head lamp control in an automobile. In the present invention, the circuit is formed by using a GaN-FET <b>211</b> instead of a power MOS-FET as an on/off control element of head lamps <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0152">In the GaN-FET <b>211</b>, for example, a GaN buffer layer <b>2</b> is formed on a semi-insulating sapphire substrate <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. On the GaN buffer layer <b>2</b>, a semi-insulating GaN layer <b>3</b> and an n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> are sequentially formed. In addition, on a part of a central portion of a surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, a diffusion layer <b>4</b><i>a </i>with In and C or Mg doped is formed. On the diffusion layer <b>4</b><i>a</i>, an electrode of the gate G is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0153">Furthermore, on the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b>, an n-type GaN layer <b>5</b> is formed. Over the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> and on one n-type GaN layer <b>5</b>, an electrode of the source S is loaded. Over the other of the remaining portions of the surface layer portion of the n-type AlGaN layer <b>4</b> and on the other n-type GaN layer <b>5</b>, an electrode of the drain D is loaded. Portions other than each of the electrodes of the gate G, the source S and the drain D are covered by an insulating film <b>6</b> of SiO.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0154">Each of the semiconductor layers of the GaN-FET <b>211</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed of a GaN compound semiconductor, and formed by using an epitaxial crystal growth method such as the MOCVD method or the MBE method. The term GaN compound semiconductor is a general term of GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, InAlGaN, InGaNAs, InGaNP and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0155">In the present embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a high-side drive circuit formed by connecting the GaN-FET <b>211</b> to a power source line <b>201</b> between a battery serving as an internal power source and the head lamps <b>210</b> serving as electric loads. The drain of the GaN-FET <b>211</b> is connected to the battery. The source is connected to two head lamps <b>210</b>. A resistor R<b>1</b> and a capacitor C<b>1</b> are connected to the gate of the GaN-FET <b>211</b>. In addition, a microcomputer <b>214</b> serving as a control circuit is also connected to the gate of the GaN-FET <b>211</b> via a FET <b>212</b> and a FET <b>213</b>. Under the control of the microcomputer <b>214</b>, the GaN-FET <b>211</b> conducts on/off operation. Furthermore, between the gate and the source, a diode D<b>1</b>, a Zener diode D<b>2</b> and a resistor R<b>2</b> are connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0156">A charge pump circuit <b>215</b> is connected to the FET <b>212</b> at its source. Between the source and gate of the FET <b>212</b>, a resistor R<b>3</b> is connected to raise the voltage supplied to the FET <b>212</b>. A resistor R<b>4</b> is connected to the gate of the FET <b>212</b>. Resistors R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b> and a capacitor C<b>2</b> are connected to the gate of the FET <b>212</b>. In addition, the microcomputer <b>214</b> is also connected to the gate of the FET <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0157">The microcomputer <b>214</b> is connected to the battery via a power supply circuit <b>216</b>. The power supply circuit <b>216</b> performs conversion on the power supply voltage supplied from the battery, and supplies a resultant voltage to the microcomputer <b>214</b>. A switch <b>217</b> for conducting on/off switchover of the head lamps <b>210</b> is connected to the microcomputer <b>214</b>. In the present embodiment, the switch <b>217</b> for on/off switchover is used. However, on/off control may be conducted by using a CAN (control area network), which is an intra-vehicle LAN (local area network), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0158">If the switch <b>217</b> assumes the on-state in the above described large current load control apparatus, then the microcomputer <b>214</b> senses the on-state from an input port connected to the switch <b>217</b>, and outputs a signal of a high level (5 V) to an output port for controlling the head lamps <b>210</b>. By this output, the FETs <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> are turned on. The GaN-FET <b>211</b> is controlled so as to turn on, and the head lamps <b>210</b> are lit. In the present embodiment, the GaN-FET <b>211</b> is located on the upstream side (battery side) of the head lamps <b>210</b>. Because of such high side drive, there is the charge pump circuit <b>215</b> on the source side of the FET <b>212</b>. This charge pump circuit <b>215</b> is set so as to input a voltage that is equal to at least the sum of the battery voltage and the gate-source voltage of the GaN-FET <b>211</b> to the gate of the GaN-FET <b>211</b> in order to turn on the GaN-FET <b>211</b>. The charge pump circuit <b>215</b> of the present embodiment is set so as to, for example, convert the battery voltage to 21 V and supply the 21 V to the gate of the GaN-FET <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0159">Furthermore, if the switch <b>217</b> turns off, the microcomputer <b>214</b> senses the off-state, and outputs a low level (0 V) to the output port for controlling the head lamps <b>210</b>. By this output, the FETs <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> are turned off. The GaN-FET <b>211</b> is controlled so as to turn off, and the head lamps <b>210</b> are put out.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0160">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a shunt resistor R<b>7</b> is connected between the GaN-FET <b>211</b> and the battery, and an overcurrent detection circuit <b>218</b> is connected across the shunt resistor R<b>7</b> to detect an overcurrent that flows through the GaN-FET <b>211</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the overcurrent detection circuit <b>218</b> includes two operational amplifiers <b>219</b> and <b>220</b>. The overcurrent detection circuit <b>218</b> amplifies and detects a current that flows through the shunt resistor R<b>7</b>, and outputs a result of detection to the microcomputer <b>214</b>. If an excessive current continuously flows, then the wire harness is heated and there is a possibility of degradation and smoke emitting. On the basis of a result of the detection, the microcomputer <b>214</b> exercises control so as to turn off the GaN-FET <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0161">Design of a circuit using the GaN-FET <b>211</b> will now be described. When conducting such a circuit design, it has heretofore been necessary to conduct the radiation design of the FET accurately. Therefore, the design time becomes long, and it is necessary to consider the layout of the print board and the like. The degree of freedom of the layout is limited. In recent years, therefore, simplification and shortening of the radiation design of the FET have been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0162">On the other hand, in the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, power of 60 W×2=120 W is required to turn on two head lamps <b>210</b>. In a steady state, a maximum current of approximately 10 A flows. From equation (10), therefore, the channel temperature of the GaN-FETs <b>211</b> at an ambient temperature of 85° C. is calculated as</p>

Even if a current of 10 A is always flown, heat is generated at all. Accordingly, the radiation plate required when the power MOS-FETs are used becomes unnecessary.
</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0164">Furthermore, in the case where a large current load control apparatus is used in a severe temperature environment such as an engine room, the use temperature range of the apparatus is required to be at least 125°. By using GaN-FETs capable of operating at high temperature (operating stably even at 500°) different from the conventional MOS-FETs, it is possible to set sufficient derating (at least 500°) with respect to the channel temperature, and design of a highly reliable, small-sized ECU is facilitated.</p>

This brings about an effect that reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight can be realized and the time and labor required for radiation design can be remarkably reduced. Furthermore, it becomes unnecessary to make the semiconductor element stick to a radiator. The semiconductor element can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus. This brings about an effect that the degree of freedom in the design of the power supply apparatus is increased in addition to easiness of the radiation design, eventually making possible integration of elements arranged in the power supply apparatus, and reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight is further promoted.

<p id="p-0169" num="0177">The diodes in the circuits as shown in figures may be made from GaN compound semiconductor. A diode made from a GaN compound semiconductor (hereinafter, “GaN-diode”) has an on-resistance per unit area and a conduction loss which are smaller than those of a Si semiconductor diode, like the GaN-FET. The GaN-diode is more stable under high temperatures than that of a Si semiconductor diode. Therefore, it is effective to use the GaN-diode to bring advantages of the GaN-FET with a low conduction loss and high temperature operation. In paticulat, it is preferable to use the GaN-diodes in place of the diodes disposed in the path of a main current. Such replaceable diodes are for example the diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the diode D<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the diodes used in the secondary winding side of the switching regulator circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the diodes used in the rectifier circuit of the power supply apparatus, and the diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>

The GaN-diodes allow adjacent arrangement because of their low heating value, and thus parallel connection thereof. As a result, the maximum current value of the power supply apparatus can be doubled.</p>

The second anode electrode <b>109</b> acts after the forward voltage increases up to a predetermined level. Thus, the rising of the forward current becomes quick, so that the on-resistance becomes zero and the on-voltage becomes approximately zero. When a voltage is applied to the anode electrode <b>110</b> in the reverse direction, a depletion layer widens in semiconductor layer right under the second anode electrode <b>109</b>, so that the current path is pinched off, stopping the current flow. In other words, the GaN-diode provides the diode characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0183">In the GaN-diode according to the embodiment, the III-V nitride semiconductor layer <b>103</b> has a heterostructure <b>106</b> that includes a pair of a low bandgap layer <b>104</b> and a high bandgap layer <b>105</b>. The heterostructure <b>106</b> exhibits the piezoelectric effect at the interface between the layers <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> with different bandgap. This piezoelectric effect causes a two-dimensional electron gas layer <b>107</b> in the low bandgap layer <b>104</b> near the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0184">When the anode electrode <b>110</b> is forward biased, a current flows through the anode electrode <b>110</b>, the high bandgap layer <b>105</b>, and the two-dimensional electron gas layer <b>107</b> in the low bandgap layer <b>104</b>, in order.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0185">Since the two-dimensional electron gas layer <b>107</b> has a high electron mobility, a resistance to the flow of the current in this layer is very low. Therefore, the on-resistance becomes more lower by the two-dimensional electron gas layer <b>107</b> in the path of a current flowing from a cathode electrode <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0186">The cathode electrode <b>112</b> of the GaN-diode forms an ohmic contact with a contact layer <b>111</b>. The contact layer <b>111</b> is in contact with the low bandgap layer <b>104</b>, and thus the two-dimensional electron gas layer <b>107</b> is electrically connected to the contact layer <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows another example of the GaN-diode. A GaN Schottky diode <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> includes an insulating or semi-insulating sapphire substrate <b>113</b>, a GaN buffer layer <b>114</b> having a thickness of 50 nm and formed on the substrate <b>113</b>, and n<sup>+</sup>-GaN layer <b>116</b> having a thickness of 2000 nm and formed on the buffer layer <b>114</b>. An n-GaN layer <b>118</b> is formed on the n<sup>+</sup>-GaN layer <b>116</b>. The n-GaN layer <b>118</b> includes a plane portion <b>118</b><i>a </i>having a thickness of 500 nm and a convex portion <b>118</b><i>b </i>protruded from the central of the surface of the plane portion <b>118</b><i>a</i>. The convex portion <b>118</b><i>b </i>has a width of 2000 nm and a height of 2000 nm. The impurity concentration of the n-GaN layer <b>118</b> is as low as preferably not more than 2×10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>(for example, approximately 2×10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>). This is because although a reverse bias to the GaN Schottky diode <b>100</b> widens a depletion layer in the n-GaN layer <b>118</b>, an excessive impurity concentration does not widen the depletion layer, thereby causing no pinch off state, as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0188">The GaN Schottky diode <b>100</b> also includes an undoped Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer <b>122</b>, a Ti (titanium) electrode <b>126</b>, and a Pt (platinum) electrode <b>128</b>. The Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer <b>122</b> has a thickness of 30 nm and a bandgap higher than that of the n-GaN layer <b>118</b>, and covers the surface of the plane portion <b>118</b><i>a </i>and the side of the convex portion <b>118</b><i>b</i>. The Ti electrode <b>126</b> forms a Schottky junction on the top of the convex portion <b>118</b><i>b</i>, and serves as a first anode electrode. The Pt electrode <b>128</b> is formed on the Ti electrode <b>126</b> and the Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer <b>122</b>, and serves as a second anode electrode. The Pt electrode <b>128</b>, concretely, is electrically connected to the Ti electrode <b>126</b>, and forms a Schottky junction via the Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer <b>122</b> to connect with the side of the convex portion <b>118</b><i>b</i>. The Ti electrode <b>126</b> and the Pt electrode <b>128</b> constitute a composite anode electrode <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0189">An SiO<sub>2 </sub>film <b>132</b> covers the sides of the Pt electrode <b>128</b>, the Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer <b>122</b>, and the plane portion <b>118</b><i>a </i>and a part of the surface of the n<sup>+</sup>-GaN layer <b>116</b>. A cathode electrode <b>134</b> is made from a TaSi layer, and forms an ohmic contact with the n<sup>+</sup>-GaN layer <b>116</b> (outer of the part of the surface).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0190">A heterojunction is formed between the n-GaN layer <b>118</b> and the Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N layer <b>122</b>. A two-dimensional electron gas layer occurs near the interface of the heterojunction as indicated by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. A Schottky barrier with a height of 0.3 eV is formed at a contact surface between the Ti electrode <b>126</b> and the n-GaN layer <b>118</b>. According to this embodiment, the Schottky junction is not formed at the interface between the Pt electrode <b>128</b> and the n-GaN layer <b>118</b>. If the Schottky junction is formed at the interface, a Schottky barrier with a height of 1.0 eV is formed at the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0191">The first anode electrode may be made of metal which forms a Schottky barrier with a height lower than the n-GaN layer <b>118</b> by less than 0.8 eV, such as W (tungsten) and Ag (silver), instead of Ti. The second anode electrode may be made of metal which forms a Schottky barrier with a height higher than the n-GaN layer <b>118</b> by more than 0.8 eV, such as Ni (nickel), Pd (palladium), and Au (gold), instead of Pt.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0192">The first anode electrode and the second electrode with a Schottky barrier higher than that of the first anode electrode to a GaN semiconductor layer makes the diode with a low on-resistance and a low reverse current leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0193">As heretofore described, according to a power supply apparatus according to the present invention, a semiconductor element formed by using a GaN-diode is disposed in the path of a main current that is a subject of power control. Since the semiconductor element is small in resistance at the time of conduction, and little heat is generated, the semiconductor element can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus. This brings about an effect that the degree of freedom in the design of the power supply apparatus is increased in addition to easiness of the radiation design. In addition, there is brought about effects that reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight is further promoted, and the time and labor required for radiation design can be remarkably reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0194">As heretofore described, the power supply apparatus, the power supply circuit, and the large current load control apparatus are useful for automobiles, electric vehicles, construction machinery, various public welfare devices (such as video devices, television sets, and audio devices), various industrial devices (such as personal computers, communication devices, and FA control devices), and so on. They are suitable for realizing reduction in size and weight of an apparatus or circuit.</p>
