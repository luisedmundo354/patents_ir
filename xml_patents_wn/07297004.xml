<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electrical conductors such as those used to connect a semiconductor package to a load board for electrical testing. Specifically, the invention relates to electrical conductors including a compressive member and a sleeve, the sleeve including deformations to retain the compressive member.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor chip manufacturers often perform electrical testing of the semiconductor chips at various stages of production, including final testing prior to shipment. This electrical testing may consist of testing chips in package form, in wafer form, or in individual die form. In package form, the semiconductor chips may be encapsulated in an encapsulating resin, with only conductive balls, pads, or leads exposed outside of the package for electrical contact. In wafer and individual die form, the semiconductor chips may have conductive balls or pads available for electrical contact. Typically, the electrical contacts are arranged into an array. Two common types of contact arrays are land grid array and ball grid array. The electrical testing may consist of electrical functionality tests lasting several minutes or it may consist of burn-in or reliability tests lasting many hours. To maximize the efficiency of the testing process, numerous semiconductor chips may be loaded onto a load board and multiple load boards may be rotated through a single piece of test equipment. This allows some load boards to be populated/de-populated with semiconductor chips while other load boards are in the testing area of the test equipment. The semiconductor chips need to be non-permanently affixed to the load board in such a way that the chips can be easily loaded and unloaded from the board while still ensuring good electrical contact to the load board throughout the potentially lengthy testing process. Typically, an interconnect assembly is used to interface the semiconductor chips to the load board. The actual electrical connections between the semiconductor chip and the load board are usually accomplished by compressible pin-type structures within the interconnect assembly. The compressible pins allow for small variations in the structure of the semiconductor chips while still ensuring good electrical contact between the contact arrays on the chip and the load board. The compressible pin structures, sometimes referred to as ‘spring pins’ or ‘pogo pins’ can be quite complicated and expensive, consisting of several discrete components, due to the tight tolerances associated with the interconnect assembly and the high reliability demands of the testing process. As an example, a single compressible pin failure can cause many semiconductor chips to be identified as non-functional before the pin failure is identified. Consequently, an interconnect assembly that includes simpler, more reliable, and less expensive electrical contact components is desired. The invention addresses these and other disadvantages of the conventional art.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention is best understood from the following detailed description when read in connection with the accompanying drawing. It is emphasized that, according to common practice, the various features of the drawing are not to scale. On the contrary, the dimensions of the various features are arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. In the description, relative terms such as “horizontal,” “vertical,” “up,” “down,” “top,” and “bottom” as well as derivatives thereof (for example, “horizontally,” “downwardly,” “upwardly,” etc.) should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing figure under discussion unless otherwise specifically described. These relative terms are for convenience of description and normally are not intended to require a particular orientation. Terms “inwardly,” “outwardly,” “longitudinal” versus “lateral” and the like are to be interpreted relative to one another or relative to an axis of elongation, or an axis or center of rotation, as appropriate. Terms such as “connected” and “interconnected” refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or indirectly through intervening structures, as well as both movable or rigid attachments or relationships, unless expressly described otherwise. The term “operatively connected” is such an attachment, coupling or connection that allows the pertinent structures to operate as intended by virtue of that relationship.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the term “semiconductor package” refers to an assembly including at least one semiconductor device (for example, a chip, a die, etc.) supported on a substrate (e.g., a circuit board, a leadframe, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the terms “lattice” or “lattice-like” as applied to a conductor refers to a construction of elongated members (for example, wires) that are arranged to cross each other such that a plurality of openings are defined between the elongated members. The terms “lattice” and “lattice-like”, however, are not meant to require any bonding or mechanical coupling between the elongated members at the locations where the elongated members cross each other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term “sleeve” is as understood in the relevant industry and further may be any structure defining an aperture capable of receiving at least a portion of a compressible conductive member.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein the term “deformation” is as understood in the relevant industry and further may refer to (1) an internal shape or structure of a sleeve, (2) an alteration or modification to an interior surface of a sleeve, or any other deformation or modification adapted to assist in retaining at least a portion of a compressible conductive member within an aperture defined by the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein the term “crimp” is as understood in the relevant industry and further may refer to a physical alteration of a sleeve causing a hampering or obstructive effect upon a compressible conductive member within an aperture defined by the sleeve that assists in retaining at least a portion of the compressible conductive member.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Certain integrated circuit (IC) packages or modules include semiconductor devices, such as chips or dies, contained in an encapsulating material or housing. The IC package or module may include an exterior array of contacts, or input/output pads, for electrically connecting the package or module to another electronic component, such as a load board adapted for use with a package testing system. The contacts of an IC package typically are not connected directly to the load board. Typically, an interconnect assembly (e.g., a test socket) may be interposed between the IC package and the load board to provide electrical connection between the contact array of the IC package and a contact array of the load board.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring again to the drawings where like numerals refer to like elements, there is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, interconnect assembly <b>100</b> located between IC package <b>102</b> and load board <b>104</b> adapted for use with a package testing system. IC package <b>102</b> may include an array of electrical contacts <b>108</b> located on an exterior surface of package <b>102</b>. The exemplary array of contacts <b>108</b> is of a type known as a “land grid array” in which contacts <b>108</b> have substantially planar contact surfaces. Load board <b>104</b> also may include an array of electrical contacts <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Interconnect assembly <b>100</b> may include a plurality of conductors <b>112</b> received in openings <b>116</b> defined by support frame or carrier <b>114</b>. As shown, openings <b>116</b> of carrier <b>114</b> may be spaced to provide for substantial alignment between conductors <b>112</b> and contacts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> of package <b>102</b> and load board <b>104</b>, respectively. Each conductor <b>112</b> may be compressible to provide a variable length for conductor <b>112</b>. Such adjustable conductor length allows interconnect assembly <b>100</b> to accommodate dimensional variations, for example amongst contacts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. Such dimensional variation may result in variation in the separating distance between pairs of contacts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> when package <b>102</b> and load board <b>104</b> are brought into contact with interconnect assembly <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The adjustable length for conductors <b>112</b> may ensure that each conductor <b>112</b> of interconnect assembly <b>100</b> will contact package <b>102</b> and load board <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each conductor <b>112</b> of interconnect assembly <b>100</b> may include plunger members <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> defining opposite ends of conductor <b>112</b>, and cylindrical barrel <b>122</b> located between plunger members <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. A coil spring or other resilient member (not shown) may be coupled between plunger members <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and contained within barrel <b>122</b>. Compression of the coil spring under loading placed on plunger members <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> may result in the desired shortening of the distance between opposite ends of conductor <b>112</b>. This type of conductor having elongated plungers, a barrel and a coil spring is sometimes referred to as a “spring pin” or “pogo pin.”</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Carrier <b>114</b> of interconnect assembly <b>100</b> may include socket portion <b>124</b> and retainer portion <b>126</b> secured together by fasteners at locations <b>128</b>. Carrier <b>114</b> of interconnect assembly <b>100</b> may be secured to load board <b>104</b> by fasteners at locations <b>130</b>. Each carrier portion <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> may define respective annular shoulders <b>132</b> adjacent openings <b>116</b> for retaining barrels <b>122</b> of conductors <b>112</b> within openings <b>116</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, barrel <b>122</b> of each conductor <b>112</b> may be dimensioned to define a gap between conductor <b>112</b> and annular shoulders <b>132</b>. This gap may provide vertical play between carrier <b>114</b> and barrel <b>122</b> of each conductor <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, interconnect assembly <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be located between load board <b>104</b> and IC package <b>134</b>. Instead of including a land grid array of contacts like package <b>102</b>, package <b>134</b> may include an array of contacts <b>138</b> having a rounded configuration. This type of contact array is sometimes referred to as a “ball grid array.”</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, there is shown compressible electrical conductor <b>300</b> for electrically connecting circuit members (for example, a semiconductor package and a load board). Depicted compressible conductor <b>300</b> may include eight discrete wires <b>302</b> interlaced with each other, such as by braiding the wires, to form a substantially tubular structure. The interlacing of wires <b>302</b> may result in a lattice-like construction in which wires <b>302</b> cross each other to define a plurality of openings between the wires. Each interlaced wire <b>302</b> of depicted compressible conductor <b>300</b> may be deformed during fabrication of the conductor to extend along a helical path. Wires <b>302</b>, however, may undergo only substantially elastic deformation during manufacture such that plastic deformation may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Interlaced wires <b>302</b> may then be annealed during manufacture of compressible conductor <b>300</b> to provide stress relief, particularly at the locations where adjacent wires <b>302</b> overlap each other. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there may be no bonding or other mechanical interconnection between wires <b>302</b>, however, such that the wires remain free to move (e.g., slide) with respect to each other when conductor <b>300</b> may be compressed under an applied load. The stress relief provided by the annealing may remove associated elastic strain within wires <b>302</b>, such that the wires will tend to remain together in the unitary, tubular, construction shown rather than springing apart when a length of the interlaced-wire construction may be cut to provide individual conductors, such as conductor <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, of desired length.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The tubular construction of depicted compressible conductor <b>300</b> desirably may provide a simplified construction compared to the spring pin or pogo pin having opposite plunger members, an intermediate barrel and a coil spring coupled between the plunger members and contained within the barrel. Also, the tubular construction of depicted compressible conductor <b>300</b> may provide a universal construction in which compression can occur along the entire length of the conductor. This differs from the pogo pin construction having substantially rigid plunger members in which compression may be concentrated to the intermediately located spring member contained within the barrel. The construction and properties of electrical conductor <b>300</b> is described in greater detail in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/736,280, filed Dec. 15, 2003, which claims priority of U.S. provisional applications No. 60/457,076, filed Mar. 24, 2003, No. 60/457,258, filed Mar. 25, 2003, and No. 60/462,143, filed Apr. 8, 2003, each incorporated by reference in its entirety. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to depicted compressible conductor <b>300</b>. Alternative constructions are conceived, such as interlaced-wire tubes including more, or fewer, than eight wires <b>302</b> and conductors made from flat meshes of interlaced wire that may be rolled into a tubular form. Further, the teachings of the present invention are applicable to other types of compressible conductors such as conductive springs or the like.</p>
