<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A laser printer is configured to move a pinch roller, provided to a main body casing and operating in a position in which the pinch roller obstructs attachment/detachment of a process cartridge, to a position in which the pinch roller does not obstruct attachment/detachment of the process cartridge. Such a configuration can reduce the number of components of the process cartridge compared with the case of incorporating the pinch roller in the process cartridge. In addition, the configuration can reduce the size of the laser printer since it is unnecessary to attach/detach the process cartridge so as to avoid the pinch roller.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-171382 filed Jun. 9, 2004 in the Japanese Patent Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus provided with an attachable/detachable cartridge and to the attachable/detachable cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a conventional image forming apparatus in which an image is formed by supplying toner to an electrostatic latent image formed on a photoconductor drum to form a visual image, and by transferring and fixing the visual image on a sheet of paper, an attachable/detachable cartridge is provided so as to facilitate operations such as replacing consumable components.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the Publication of Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-267547, for example, a process cartridge (a process unit), including a photoconductor drum, a charger, a developing unit, a transfer roller, an upper roller of a set of resist rollers (i.e., a pinch roller arranged so as to face a resist roller), is designed to be attachable/detachable from a front side of a main body casing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Using a large number of components for an attachable/detachable cartridge will lead to increased prices of consumables. It is, therefore, preferable that the number of components of the cartridge is reduced as much as possible. Especially, it is preferable to provide components other than consumable components to a main body. However, if a pinch roller is designed to be held by a main body in a configuration described in the Publication of Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-267647, for example, the pinch roller will obstruct attachment/detachment of a process cartridge. If, on the other hand, the process cartridge is designed to be detached so as to avoid the pinch roller, an extra space is necessary, which will result in a disadvantage in terms of reducing the size of an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention, which has been made in view of these problems, has an object to reduce the number of components of a cartridge and also reduce the size of an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus which comprises an attachable/detachable cartridge, such as a process cartridge, a developing cartridge and a photoconductor cartridge. The image forming apparatus further comprises a roller and a holding device. The roller provided to a main body of the image forming apparatus operates in a first position in which the roller obstructs attachment/detachment of the cartridge. The holding device holds the roller such that the roller is movable from the first position to a second position in which the roller does not obstruct attachment/detachment of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the image forming apparatus configured as above, it is possible to provide the roller to the main body of the image forming apparatus, although the roller operates in a position in which the roller obstructs attachment/detachment of the cartridge. This may reduce the number of components of the cartridge. Furthermore, downsizing of the image forming apparatus can be achieved since it is unnecessary to attach/detach the cartridge so as to avoid the roller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cartridge provided to an image forming apparatus in an attachable/detachable manner. The cartridge comprises a roller retraction device that abuts a roller thereby to move the roller from a first position to a second position during a detaching operation of the cartridge. In this case, the roller is provided to a main body of the image forming apparatus, operates in the first position in which the roller obstructs attachment/detachment of the cartridge, and is held such that the roller is movable from the first position to the second position in which the roller does not obstruct attachment/detachment of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present cartridge, therefore, an operation of moving the roller from the first position to the second position is not required other than the operation of attaching/detaching the cartridge. Thus, attachment/detachment of the cartridge can be easily performed. Furthermore, this can be realized by a simple configuration as described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a laser printer <b>1</b> is provided with a main body casing <b>10</b>; and with a paper feed tray <b>20</b>, a paper feed roller <b>21</b>, a set of conveyor rollers <b>30</b>, a process cartridge <b>40</b>, a scanner unit <b>70</b>, a transfer roller <b>80</b>, a fixing unit <b>90</b> and others, all being housed in the main body casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The paper feed tray <b>20</b>, adapted to store a stacked plurality of sheets of paper as a recording medium, is disposed at the bottom of the main body casing <b>10</b> so as to be attachable/detachable to/from the main body casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The paper feed roller <b>21</b> is disposed in an upper side of the paper feed tray <b>20</b> and in a front side of the laser printer <b>1</b> (on the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The paper feed roller <b>21</b> rotatingly driven by a not-shown motor draws the paper stored in the paper feed tray <b>20</b> sheet by sheet, and conveys the paper to the set of conveyor rollers <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The set of conveyer rollers <b>30</b>, including a resist roller <b>31</b> and a pinch roller (with a metal shaft) <b>32</b>, convey the paper in a pinched manner in a conveying path of the paper (a path indicated by an arrow in a chain double-dashed line; indicated in the same manner in other figures). The resist roller <b>31</b> and the pinch roller <b>32</b> are arranged so as to be pressed against each other. When the resist roller <b>31</b> is rotatingly driven by a not-shown motor, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is followingly rotated by the resist roller <b>31</b>. By the driving of the set of conveyor rollers <b>30</b>, a front end of the paper conveyed from the paper feed roller <b>21</b> is properly positioned. And then, the paper is conveyed toward a transfer position (i.e., a contact area between an after-mentioned photoconductor drum <b>51</b> and the transfer roller <b>80</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The process cartridge <b>40</b> is attachable/detachable to/from the main body casing <b>10</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b> can be performed when an openable/closable cover <b>11</b>, provided to a front side (a right side in the figure) of the main body casing <b>10</b>, is opened. The process cartridge <b>40</b>, used in the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, includes a photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b> and a development cartridge <b>60</b> attachable/detachable to/from the photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b> includes a photoconductor drum <b>51</b>, a scorotron charger <b>52</b>, and a paper-powder removing brush <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The photoconductor drum <b>51</b> includes a drum body made of a metal blank tube (including, for example, aluminum) and having a surface covered with a positively chargeable photoconductive layer, including an organic photoconductor containing polycarbonate as a main component. The drum body its grounded. The photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is rotatably held by a housing of the photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b>. The photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is rotatingly driven by a not-shown motor in a direction such that the paper conveyed from the set of conveyor rollers <b>30</b> is conveyed toward the fixing unit <b>90</b> (i.e., the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is rotated in a clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The scorotron charger <b>52</b> is located upstream of an after-mentioned developing roller <b>62</b> with respect to the rotating direction of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. The scorotron charger <b>52</b> is disposed a predetermined distance apart from the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> so as not to contact a surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. The scorotron charger <b>52</b>, which is a charger for positive charging that generates corona discharge from a charging wire of tungsten or the like, positively charges the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> evenly.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The paper-powder removing brush <b>53</b> is disposed so as to contact the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> downstream of the transfer roller <b>80</b> and upstream of the scorotron charger <b>52</b> with respect to the rotating direction of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. Paper powder attached to the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is removed by the paper-powder removing brush <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The development cartridge <b>60</b> includes a case <b>61</b> attachably/detachably attached to the photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b>; and a developing roller <b>62</b>, a supply roller <b>63</b>, a layer thickness regulating blade <b>64</b> and an agitator <b>65</b> within the case <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The case <b>61</b> contains toner as a developing agent. Specifically, a positively chargeable nonmagnetic monocomponent polymerized toner is employed in the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment. The toner is prepared by mixing spherical styrene acrylic resin particles formed by means of a known polymerization method such as a suspension polymerization method, a coloring agent, a charge control agent, a wax and others to form toner base particles, and by adding an additive.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The developing roller <b>62</b>, including a metal roller shaft covered with a roller of an electrically conductive elastic material such as rubber, is arranged in facing contact with the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> through an opening formed in the case <b>61</b>. The developing roller <b>62</b>, rotatably held by the case <b>61</b>, is rotatingly driven by a not-shown motor so as to move in a same direction as the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> in a nip point in facing contact with the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. That is, the developing roller <b>62</b> is rotated in a direction opposite to a rotating direction of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. A developing bias is applied to the developing roller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The supply roller <b>63</b>, including a metal roller shaft covered with a roller of an electrically conductive sponge material, is arranged in pressure contact with the developing roller <b>62</b> within the case <b>61</b>. The supply roller <b>63</b>, rotatably held by the case <b>61</b>, is rotatingly driven by a not-shown motor so as to move in a direction opposite to the developing roller <b>62</b> in a nip point in facing contact with the developing roller <b>62</b>.

The transfer roller <b>80</b> is rotatingly driven by a not-shown motor so as to move in a same direction as the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> in a nip point in facing contact with the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. That is, the transfer roller <b>80</b> is rotated in a direction opposite to a rotating direction of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. A transfer bias is applied to the transfer roller <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fixing unit <b>90</b> includes a heating roller <b>91</b> and a pressure roller <b>92</b>. The heating roller <b>91</b>, formed of a metal such as aluminum into a cylindrical shape, is rotatingly driven so as to move in a sane direction as the paper in a contact portion with the pressure roller <b>92</b> (i.e., in a clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The heating roller <b>91</b>, including a heater (e.g. a halogen lamp) therein, is hoatod to a predetermined heating temperature with the heater. The pressure roller <b>92</b>, including a metal roller shaft covered with a roller of a heat-resistant elastic material such as rubber, is arranged under and in pressure contact with the heating roller <b>91</b>.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The printing operation of the present laser printer <b>1</b> as an image forming operation will next be described.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the printing operation, the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is rotatingly driven. As a result of the rotation, the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is positively charged evenly by the scorotron charger <b>52</b>. When the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is then exposed by rapid scanning with the laser beam from the scanner unit <b>70</b>, an electrostatic latent image based on the image data is formed on the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the other hand, when the toner is supplied to the developing roller <b>62</b> by a rotation of the supply roller <b>63</b>, the toner is positively charged due to friction between the supply roller <b>63</b> and the developing roller <b>62</b>. In accordance with the rotation of the developing roller <b>62</b>, the toner on the developing roller <b>62</b> enters into a gap between the pressing portion of the layer thickness regulating blade <b>64</b> and the developing roller <b>62</b>. The toner is further frictionally charged in the gap, and is carried on the developing roller <b>62</b> as a thin layer having a uniform thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Subsequently, the toner on the developing roller <b>62</b> is supplied to the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>, that is, a portion having a lower electric potential due to the exposure with the laser beam within the evenly positively charged surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>. By selectively carrying the toner as above, the electrostatic latent image is visualized. Thus, a toner image is formed on the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, after the front end of the paper conveyed from the paper supply tray <b>20</b> is properly positioned by the set of conveyor rollers <b>30</b>, the paper is conveyed toward the transfer position (the contact area between the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> and the transfer roller <b>80</b>), and contacts a surface of the photoconductor drum <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Then, the toner image on the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> is transferred to the paper by the transfer roller <b>80</b> to which the transfer bias is applied. The toner image transferred to the paper is thermally fixed to the paper by the fixing unit <b>90</b> while the paper passes between the heating roller <b>91</b> and the pressure roller <b>92</b>. Thus, an image is printed on the paper. The paper carrying the printed image is discharged on a paper exit tray <b>12</b> provided in all upper part of the main body casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, while the process cartridge <b>40</b> is attached, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is located in a position where the pinch roller <b>32</b> obstructs attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b> (i.e., in a path along which the photoconductor drum <b>51</b> passes). Specifically, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is provided to the main body casing <b>10</b> (the main body of the image forming apparatus), i.e., on a same side as the process cartridge <b>40</b> with respect to the conveying path of the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the process cartridge <b>40</b> is designed to be attached/detached in a direction perpendicular to the rotating shaft of the pinch roller <b>32</b>, that is, in a direction approximately parallel with the conveying direction of the paper in the conveying path. In other words, the process cartridge <b>40</b> is attached/detached not from the above or the side but from the front of the image forming apparatus. Accordingly, the pinch roller <b>32</b> obstructs attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. If the process cartridge <b>40</b> is designed to be attached/detached along a path so as to avoid the pinch roller <b>32</b>, e.g., the process cartridge <b>40</b> is designed to be attached/detached by once lifting the process cartridge <b>40</b> upward, and then drawing forward of the image forming apparatus, an extra space is necessary. This leads to a disadvantage in reduction of the size of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, therefore, the pinch roller <b>32</b> operates in a normal position (a first position indicated by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) during the printing operation, while being moved to a retracted position (a second position indicated by a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) during attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b> so as not to obstruct the attachment/detachment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present embodiment, “the retracted position during attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b> so as not to obstruct the attachment/detachment” means a position that allows an abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> (after-mentioned) to abut the pinch roller <b>32</b>, but may prevent abutment of the remaining portions of the process cartridge <b>40</b> against the pinch roller <b>32</b> during the attachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is held by grooves <b>13</b> formed in the main body casing <b>10</b> in the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment. Each of the grooves <b>13</b> is provided on each side of the pinch roller <b>32</b> in a direction of a rotation axis so as to extend downward toward a direction of removing the process cartridge <b>40</b> (in a right direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C). The pinch roller <b>32</b>, having each end in the direction of the rotation axis inserted into the groove <b>13</b>, is held so as to be movable between the normal position at an upper end portion of the groove <b>13</b> and the retracted position at an lower end portion of the groove <b>13</b>, i.e., within a specified limited range defined by the groove <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The process cartridge <b>40</b> is provided with an abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> and an abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> in a lower end portion thereof (in a lower end portion of the photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b> in the present embodiment). The abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> is used for moving the pinch roller <b>32</b> from the normal position to the retracted position in accordance with a detaching operation of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. The abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> is used for moving the pinch roller <b>32</b> from the retracted position to the normal position in accordance with an attaching operation of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. The abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> and the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b>, which are constituted by opposing sides of a recess having an approximately U-shaped configuration, are designed to abut each end of the pinch roller <b>32</b> in the direction of the rotation axis, and thereby to directly push and move the pinch roller <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The process cartridge <b>40</b> (the photoconductor cartridge <b>50</b>) is also provided with a spring <b>56</b> that presses the each end of the pinch roller <b>32</b> in the direction of the rotation axis toward the resist roller <b>31</b> when the pinch roller <b>32</b> is in the normal position, such that the pinch roller <b>32</b> is pressed against the resist roller <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the above-described configuration, when the process cartridge <b>40</b> is detached from the main body casing <b>10</b>, a movement of the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> to abut the pinch roller <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). A further movement of the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the pinch roller <b>32</b> to be pushed by the abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> and move toward the retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). This prevents the pinch roller <b>32</b> from obstructing the detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. Once the process cartridge <b>40</b> is detached from the main body casing <b>10</b>, the pinch roller <b>32</b> remains in the retracted position (a lower end portion of the groove <b>13</b>) due to its self weight.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The groove <b>13</b> is designed such that the distance between the rotation axis of the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the rotation axis of the resist roller <b>31</b> is larger in the retracted position than in the normal position (i.e., when the pinch roller <b>32</b> is in the retracted position, the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the resist roller <b>31</b> do not contact with each other in the present embodiment). It is, therefore, possible to release a nip between the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the resist roller <b>31</b> by detaching the process cartridge <b>40</b>, thereby to easily remove paper even if a paper jam occurs between the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the resist roller <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the groove <b>13</b> is designed to define the retracted position of the pinch roller <b>32</b> as a position which will not cause deformation of paper present in the conveying path. In the present embodiment, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is retracted along the conveying path. Accordingly, even when the process cartridge <b>40</b> is detached while paper is present in the conveying path, it is possible to prevent the paper from being spoiled by a movement of the pinch roller <b>32</b> from the normal position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the process cartridge <b>40</b> is attached to the main body casing <b>10</b>, a movement of the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> to abut the pinch roller <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). A further movement of the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the pinch roller <b>32</b> to be pushed by the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> and move toward the normal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Once the process cartridge <b>40</b> is attached to the main body casing <b>10</b>, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is retained in the normal position such that the pinch roller <b>32</b> is held by the groove <b>13</b> and the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b>, and also is pressed against the resist roller <b>31</b> by the spring <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, as described above, the pinch roller <b>32</b>, which is provided to the main body casing <b>10</b> and operates in a position where the pinch roller <b>32</b> obstructs attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>, can be moved to a position where the pinch roller <b>32</b> does not obstruct attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. According to the laser printer <b>1</b>, therefore, the number of components of the process cartridge <b>40</b> can be reduced compared with a case of incorporating the pinch roller <b>32</b> in the process cartridge <b>40</b>. In addition, the size of the image forming apparatus can be reduced since it is unnecessary to attach/detach the process cartridge so as to avoid the pinch roller <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, in the laser printer <b>1</b>, an operation of attaching/detaching the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> and the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b>, provided to the process cartridge <b>40</b>, to directly push and move the pinch roller <b>32</b>. Therefore, any operation of moving the pinch roller <b>32</b> other than the operation of attaching/detaching the process cartridge <b>40</b> is not required, and attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b> can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, such a simple configuration as described above can be realized at a lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, since the pinch roller <b>32</b> remains in the retracted position due to its self weight once the process cartridge <b>40</b> is detached, it is unnecessary to move the pinch roller <b>32</b> to the second position, i.e., the retracted position, in preparation for attachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although one embodiment of the present invention has been described as above, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, while the spring <b>56</b> for pressing the pinch roller <b>32</b> toward the resist roller <b>31</b> is provided to the process cartridge <b>40</b> in the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the spring <b>56</b> may be provided to the main body casing <b>10</b>. In this case, while the process cartridge <b>40</b> is attached to the main body casing <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is pressed toward the resist roller <b>31</b> by the spring <b>56</b> provided to the main body casing <b>10</b>. When the process cartridge <b>40</b> is detached from the main body casing <b>10</b>, a movement of the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> to abut the pinch roller <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), and a further movement of the process cartridge <b>40</b> causes the abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> to push and move the pinch roller <b>32</b> toward the retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). As described above, a configuration including the spring <b>56</b> provided to the main body casing <b>10</b> achieves the same operation as a configuration including the spring <b>56</b> provided to the process cartridge <b>40</b>. The configuration including the spring <b>56</b> provided to the main body casing <b>10</b> may further reduce the number of components of the process cartridge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">While the pinch roller <b>32</b> in the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is configured to be retained in the normal position such that the pinch roller <b>32</b> is held by the groove <b>13</b> and the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b>, there is no limitation to the configuration of the pinch roller <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, the pinch roller <b>32</b> may be configured to be retained (i.e., located) in the normal position without contact with the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, an upper end portion of the groove <b>18</b> slightly declines such that the groove <b>13</b> forms a slight reverse V shape. The spring <b>56</b> is provided so as to push the pinch roller <b>32</b> in a direction of an end of the upper end portion of the groove <b>13</b>, i.e., so as to prevent the pinch roller <b>32</b> from coming off the upper end portion. In this case, when the process cartridge <b>40</b> is attached to the main body casing <b>10</b>, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is pushed by the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> and is moved toward the normal position (toward the end of the upper end portion of the groove <b>13</b>). In this configuration, even when the process cartridge <b>40</b> is moved to be completely attached to the main body casing <b>10</b>, the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> pushes the pinch roller <b>32</b> to a point slightly short of the normal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). The pinch roller <b>32</b> is pushed by the spring <b>56</b> from the point so as to be retained in the normal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). According to the configuration in which the pinch roller <b>32</b> is held by the spring <b>56</b> without contact with the process cartridge <b>40</b>, it is possible to prevent oscillation of the pinch roller <b>32</b> from being transmitted to the process cartridge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the groove <b>13</b> is provided so as to guide each end of the pinch roller <b>32</b> in the rotating direction in a movable manner, in the laser printer <b>1</b> of the above-described embodiment, the groove <b>13</b> may have other configurations such as a rail, as long as the configurations have the same function of guiding in a movable manner as the groove <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the above-described embodiment, the process cartridge <b>40</b> is provided with the abutting portion for retraction <b>54</b> and the abutting portion for restoration <b>55</b> in a lower end portion thereof to move the pinch roller <b>32</b> between the normal position and the retracted position in accordance with an attaching/detaching operation of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. However, a configuration without these abutting portions <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> may be employed. In this case, an operation of moving the pinch roller <b>32</b> between the normal position and the retracted position is required in addition to an attaching/detaching operation of the process cartridge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the laser printer <b>1</b> of above-described embodiment, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is configured to remain in the retracted position duo to its self weight. However, other configurations, such as pressing the pinch roller <b>32</b> toward the retracted position due to an elastic force of a spring or the like, may be employed so as to retain the pinch roller <b>32</b> in a retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above-described embodiment, the pinch roller <b>32</b> is movable between the normal position and the retracted position so as not to obstruct attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>. However, a roller other than the pinch roller <b>32</b> may be configured to be movable. For example, any roller among rollers used in the conveying path of the paper, such as the roller constituting the set of rollers for holding and conveying the paper, may be configured to be movable as above if the roller is likely to obstruct attachment/detachment of the process cartridge <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While the spring <b>56</b> is provided to press the pinch roller <b>32</b> in the normal position against the resist roller <b>81</b>, other elastic bodies such as rubber may be employed instead of the spring <b>56</b>, as long as the elastic bodies have the same function as the spring <b>56</b>.</p>
