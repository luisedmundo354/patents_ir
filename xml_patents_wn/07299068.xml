<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to devices for monitoring environmental characteristics, and in particular, to a network of devices for monitoring and reporting on environmental characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As various forms of sensors have been developed to become smaller, more efficient and less expensive, it has become increasingly practical to develop and deploy systems for monitoring and reporting on various environmental conditions or characteristics. Such conditions or characteristics include, among others and without limitation, humidity, pressure, electromagnetic radiation, light, acceleration, various chemical concentrations, and temperature. Indeed, the range or types of conditions or characteristics that can be monitored are limited only by the sensors used to provide sufficient and suitable signals for the circuitry needed for processing the data represented by such signals.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, many products, particularly food products, require a controlled environment during some or all stages of production, shipping and handling, and sales. Particularly for food products, temperature is often the most critical environmental characteristic to be maintained. Food products must often be shipped for long distances to their final destination, with trips often taking several days, thereby requiring that the food be frozen or refrigerated during such trips. The freshness and safety of the food product depends upon proper maintenance of the temperature. This is particularly true for foods such as meat, fish and poultry, where even relatively small temperature excursions outside the desired range, for even only short durations, can be dangerous due to spoilage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is well known in the art for distributors of frozen and refrigerated foods to place temperature-sensitive elements (e.g., on adhesive strips) in or on the containers in which the food products are shipped. Such devices will indicate whether the shipping container has been allowed to rise above a threshold temperature at any point during the trip. However, nearly indicating whether such temperature threshold has been crossed, without any further information about the duration or timing of such temperature change is generally not sufficient to fully assess the effects of such temperature changes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a system for monitoring and reporting on one or more characteristics, such as temperature, within a defined environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A wireless sensor network for monitoring one or more selected environmental characteristics. Multiple wireless signal transceivers, disposed in respective portions of a selected environment, respond to one or more wireless beacon signals by selectively collecting, processing and storing data corresponding to one or more characteristics of such portions of the selected environment, and by selectively transmitting respective wireless response signals containing selected portions of such data. Alternatively, multiple wireless signal transceivers, disposed in respective sub-networks in portions of a selected environment, collect and convey data corresponding to one or more characteristics of such selected environment portions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one embodiment of the presently claimed invention, a wireless sensor network for monitoring one or more selected environmental characteristics includes a plurality of wireless signal transceivers, each of which is disposed within a respective portion of a selected environment, and responsive to one or more wireless beacon signals at least in part by selectively transmitting one or more respective wireless response signals. Each wireless signal transceiver includes at least one signal transducer, processing and control circuitry, memory circuitry and data collection circuitry. The at least one signal transducer is to convert the one or more wireless beacon signals at least in part to one or more corresponding incoming electrical signals, and to convert one or more outgoing electrical signals at least in part to the one or more wireless response signals. The processing and control circuitry is coupled to the at least one signal transducer and responsive to the one or more incoming electrical signals by selectively processing at least a portion of the one or more incoming electrical signals and at least a selected portion of a plurality of data, providing a plurality of control signals, and providing the one or more outgoing electrical signals. The memory circuitry is coupled to at least the processing and control circuitry and responsive to at least a first portion of the plurality of control signals by storing at least a first portion of the plurality of data and providing at least a second portion of the plurality of data. The data collection circuitry is coupled to at least the processing and control circuitry and responsive to at least a second portion of the plurality of control signals and at least one sensor signal corresponding to one or more characteristics of the respective portion of the selected environment by providing the first portion of the plurality of data. The one or more outgoing electrical signals selectively correspond to at least one of the one or more characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment of the presently claimed invention, an ad hoc wireless sensor data network for monitoring one or more selected environmental characteristics includes one or more master wireless signal transceivers and a plurality of ad hoc wireless signal transceivers. The one or more master wireless signal transceivers communicate via a plurality of wireless signals. The plurality of ad hoc wireless signal transceivers, each of which is disposed within a respective portion of a selected environment, communicates with the one or more master wireless signal transceivers via the plurality of wireless signals. The plurality of ad hoc wireless signal transceivers, in at least partial response to a plurality of respective sensor signals, transmits a plurality of respective ad hoc wireless signals as at least a portion of the plurality of wireless signals and selectively corresponding to at least one of one or more characteristics of the selected environment. The one or more master wireless signal transceivers, responsive to reception of the plurality of respective ad hoc wireless signals, determine a location of at least one of the plurality of ad hoc wireless signal transceivers in a respective spatial relation to at least one of the one or more master wireless signal transceivers.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following detailed description is of example embodiments of the presently claimed invention with references to the accompanying drawings. Such description is intended to be illustrative and not limiting with respect to the scope of the present invention. Such embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the subject invention, and it will be understood that other embodiments may be practiced with some variations without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Throughout the present disclosure, absent a clear indication to the contrary from the context, it will be understood that individual circuit elements as described may be singular or plural in number. For example, the terms “circuit” and “circuitry” may include either a single component or a plurality of components, which are either active and/or passive and are connected or otherwise coupled together (e.g., as one or more integrated circuit chips) to provide the described function. Additionally, the term “signal” may refer to one or more currents, one or more voltages, or a data signal. Within the drawings, like or related elements will have like or related alpha, numeric or alphanumeric designators. Further, while the present invention has been discussed in the context of implementations using discrete electronic circuitry (preferably in the form of one or more integrated circuit chips), the functions of any part of such circuitry may alternatively be implemented using one or more appropriately programmed processors, depending upon the signal frequencies or data rates to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment of the presently acclaimed invention, a sensor network is established within a predetermined environment <b>1</b> for monitoring one or more environmental characteristics (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, etc., as discussed above). Within this environment <b>1</b>, a number of remote sensor assemblies <b>12</b> are disposed for sensing respective portions of the environment <b>1</b>. For example, one of the remote sensor assemblies <b>12</b><i>a </i>can be used to sense, and ultimately report on, an environmental characteristic within its immediate vicinity, such as temperature. Remote from the sensor network is a master terminal or controller <b>10</b> that sends out one or more wireless signals <b>11</b> for interacting, e.g., controlling or triggering, one or more of the sensor assemblies <b>12</b> within the sensor network. For example, the master <b>10</b> can send out one or more wireless signals <b>11</b> (e.g., radio frequency (RF), microwave, infrared or optical) which serves as a beacon or triggering signal in response to which the remote sensor assemblies <b>12</b> transmit respective wireless signals <b>13</b> containing information about the environmental characteristics being sensed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As should be readily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the sensor network and master terminal which interacts or otherwise controls the sensor network can be implemented in many of a number of well known ways. As noted above, the wireless signal transmitted and received by the master and remote sensors are preferably, though not necessarily limited to, wireless signals which are not line-of-sight, such as RF or microwave signals. Further, such a network can be in the form of a master-slave network in which the master originates and controls all communication with the respective remote sensor assemblies, or alternatively, can be what is sometimes referred to as a mesh network in which the remote sensor assemblies may communicate with each other independently from or under the supervision of the master.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a remote sensor assembly <b>12</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the presently claimed invention includes a signal transducer <b>22</b>. This signal transducer <b>22</b> preferably includes one or more signal transducing elements appropriate for converting the incoming wireless signal <b>11</b> to an incoming electrical signal and to convert an outgoing electrical signal to the outgoing wireless signal <b>13</b>. For example, for RF signals communications, such a signal transducer <b>22</b> would include one or more antenna elements which are well known in the art and can be implemented in many well known ways. In the case of optical signal communications, such signal transducer <b>22</b> would include an optical sensor for sensing and converting the incoming optical signal <b>11</b> to an incoming electrical signal, and an optical signal emitter for converting the outgoing electrical signal to the outgoing optical signal <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sensor assembly <b>12</b> also includes a power source <b>24</b>, processing and control circuitry <b>26</b>, memory circuitry <b>28</b> and sensor interface circuitry <b>30</b>, all interconnected substantially as shown. Additionally, a sensor <b>32</b> may also be included. Typically, all such elements are integrated or otherwise packaged in some form of unitary design in accordance with well known electronic circuit packaging techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As noted above, the incoming wireless signal <b>11</b>, e.g., a beacon signal, is received by the signal transducer <b>22</b> and converted to appropriate baseband control or data signals for communication via a signal interface <b>23</b> to the processing and control circuitry <b>26</b> (e.g., a microprocessor or microcontroller). For example, in the case of RF communications, the incoming RF signal <b>11</b> is initially converted to an RF signal which is then processed in accordance with well known RF signal processing techniques to produce the corresponding baseband control or data signals. Such signal transducer circuitry is well known in the art and can be implemented in many forms in accordance with well known design techniques. In response to these received signals, the processing and control circuitry <b>26</b>, via an interface bus <b>27</b>, sends control signals to and accesses data from the memory <b>28</b> and sensor interface <b>30</b> (discussed in more detail below). The processing and control circuitry <b>26</b> processes the data it receives from the memory <b>28</b> or interface <b>30</b> and provides the appropriate response signals via the interface <b>23</b> to the signal transducer <b>22</b> for transmission as the wireless response signal <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The power source <b>24</b> provides power to the signal transducer circuitry <b>22</b>, as well as to the processing and control circuitry <b>26</b>, memory <b>28</b> and sensor interface <b>30</b> (e.g., via a power bus <b>25</b>) during operation of the sensor assembly <b>12</b>. Preferably, the memory <b>28</b> is nonvolatile, thereby avoiding need for electrical power when the sensor assembly <b>12</b> is not responding to an incoming control or query signal <b>11</b> from the master <b>10</b>. The power source <b>24</b> can be either a battery or some form of power conversion circuitry, many types of which are well known in the art. For example, if the sensor assembly <b>12</b> is an “active” assembly, the power source <b>24</b> can be a battery, thereby making power available at all times as needed. However, if the sensor assembly <b>12</b> is “passive”, the power source <b>24</b> can be a power conversion circuit which converts (or “harvests”) at least a portion of the incoming signal <b>11</b> energy to DC power for use by the signal transducer circuitry <b>22</b>, processing and control circuitry <b>26</b>, memory <b>28</b> and interface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be noted that the sensor network of the presently claimed invention can be operated or controlled in a number of ways. For example, as noted above, the control or query signal <b>11</b> from the master <b>10</b> can be a beacon signal which is intended for reception by all of the remote sensor assemblies <b>12</b>. Following receipt of such a beacon signal <b>11</b>, each remote sensor assembly <b>12</b> can respond in one or more of a number of ways. For example, responsive to the control or query signal <b>11</b>, a remote sensor assembly <b>12</b> can prompt its associated sensor <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) via a control signal <b>31</b> to retrieve sensor data <b>33</b>, which is then selectively stored in the memory <b>28</b> or immediately provided to the processing and control circuitry <b>26</b>. The processing and control circuitry <b>26</b> can then process such sensor data, either immediately, or later after its retrieval from the memory <b>28</b>, and provide it for transmission via the signal transducer circuitry <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the sensor assembly <b>12</b> can respond to successive query or control signals <b>11</b> by accessing and storing successive values of sensor data within the memory <b>28</b> for later retrieval and processing following reception of a later query or control signal <b>11</b> specifically requesting such data.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As another alternative, following reception of one or more control or query signals <b>11</b>, and collection, storage and processing of sensor data, each sensor assembly <b>12</b> can then begin reporting back to the master <b>10</b> by transmitting its respective wireless response signal <b>13</b>. Such responsive signal transmissions can be initiated in a predetermined sequence according to a hierarchy or prioritization of the various sensor assemblies <b>12</b> so as to avoid signal “collisions”. Further alternatively, each respective sensor assembly <b>12</b> can transmit its wireless response signal <b>13</b> at a different frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a method of operating a sensor assembly <b>12</b>, such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment of the presently claimed invention includes the following. Initially, the device is in an idle or off state <b>100</b>. At some point <b>102</b> in time, the query or control signal <b>111</b> is received, following which activation <b>104</b> of the sensor assembly <b>12</b> occurs. It is during this activation stage <b>104</b> that the signal transducer <b>22</b> converts the incoming signal <b>11</b> to appropriate baseband control or data signals for controlling or further processing within the sensor assembly <b>12</b>. Additionally, for a passive sensor assembly <b>12</b>, it is during this activation stage <b>104</b> that at least a portion of the incoming signal <b>111</b> is used for generating DC power for the various stages of the sensor assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At the next stage <b>106</b>, the sensor data (e.g., retrieved by the processing and control circuitry <b>26</b> via the interface <b>30</b> and signal/data bus <b>27</b>) is tested or compared against a threshold value or range of values for compliance. For example, in the case of temperature, the current temperature, as determined by a temperature sensor, would be compared to a range of values as defined by minimum and maximum temperature values for compliance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the measured parameter is compliant (e.g., within the desired range of values, or not of a value which transcends a threshold value), a table or log of parameter values is updated (e.g., within the memory <b>28</b>) at stage <b>108</b>. If the measured parameter is not compliant, it is then compared or tested at stage <b>110</b> against the table or log of parameter values (e.g., stored within the memory <b>28</b>). At stage <b>112</b>, it is determined whether the present parameter value differs by an excessive amount from one or more of the values stored within the data log. If such difference is excessive, a notice or alarm signal is generated at stage <b>114</b> for transmission back to the master <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Following stages <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> (if the difference is not excessive) and <b>114</b>, operation returns to the idle or off state <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in accordance with another embodiment of the presently claimed invention, multiple remote sensor assemblies can be deployed in the form of multiple sub-networks <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b</i>, <b>200</b><i>c </i>which are associated with respective portions <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b</i>, <b>201</b><i>c </i>of the selected environment. In this example, one environment portion <b>201</b><i>a </i>has a sub-network <b>200</b><i>a </i>of N remote sensor assemblies <b>212</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>212</b><i>n</i>, while two additional environment portions <b>201</b><i>b</i>, <b>201</b><i>c </i>have sub-networks <b>200</b><i>b</i>, <b>200</b><i>c </i>with each having two remote sensor assemblies <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>232</b><i>a</i>, <b>232</b><i>b</i>. In the first sub-network <b>200</b><i>a</i>, one or more master signal transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, transmit their wireless signals <b>211</b><i>aa</i>, <b>211</b><i>ba </i>intended for reception by the remote sensor assemblies <b>212</b><i>a </i>. . . , <b>212</b><i>n</i>. In turn, the remote sensor assemblies <b>212</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>212</b><i>n </i>transmit their respective response signals <b>213</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>213</b><i>n </i>for reception by the master transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The other sub-networks <b>200</b><i>b</i>, <b>200</b><i>c </i>operate in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In turn, these sub-networks <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b</i>, <b>200</b><i>c </i>can together form a larger sub-network for which their respective master signal transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> now serve as “remote transceivers” with respect to a set of higher level transceivers <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the lower level master transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> transmit signals <b>211</b><i>ab</i>, <b>211</b><i>bb</i>, <b>221</b><i>b</i>, <b>231</b><i>b </i>for reception by the higher level transceivers <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>. These transceivers <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, in turn communicate with the lower level transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> with their own signals <b>303</b><i>aa</i>, <b>303</b><i>ba</i>. At this level, either the higher level transceivers <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b </i>or the lower level transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> can initiate communications or act in a responsive manner. Of course, the higher level transceivers <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b </i>can also communicate further via additional transmission signals <b>303</b><i>ab</i>, <b>303</b><i>bb </i>with other devices or systems. Accordingly, multiple sub-networks can be nested as part of ever larger networks, depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One example of such a networked system can be where each of the lowest sub-networks <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b</i>, <b>200</b><i>c </i>corresponds to a container in which the remote sensor assemblies <b>212</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>212</b><i>n</i>, <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>232</b><i>a</i>, <b>232</b><i>b </i>are disposed or otherwise contained within their respective environments <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b</i>, <b>201</b><i>c</i>. As discussed above, these remote sensor assemblies <b>212</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>212</b><i>n</i>, <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>232</b><i>a</i>, <b>232</b><i>b </i>monitor their respective portions of these environments <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b</i>, <b>201</b><i>c</i>, and convey data corresponding to the one or more characteristics for which they are responsible for monitoring. For example, the remote sensor assemblies <b>212</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>212</b><i>n</i>, <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>232</b><i>a</i>, <b>232</b><i>b </i>might collect visual image data which, after all sensor data has been combined and properly processed, provides visual profiles of the various environment portions <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b</i>, <b>201</b><i>c</i>. In turn, these profiles can be further combined to form a larger, or composite, profile for the overall environment. Alternatively, each of the remote sensor assemblies can monitor its ambient temperature such that when all such temperature data is collected and processed, e.g., via the master signal transceivers <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, temperature gradients can be determined for the various environment portions <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b</i>, <b>201</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, such sensor networks are often in the from of ad hoc networks, meaning that deployment or activation of the various remote sensor assemblies may take place at any time and under various, and even variable, conditions. As a result, errors or other forms of discrepancies may arise in the sensor data or the manner in which the sensor data is initially transmitted or later conveyed. For example, particularly in the case of remote sensor assemblies responsible for collecting image data, the actual spatial location of each remote sensor assemble can be critical so as to ensure that the overall image profile can be properly reconstructed based on the transmitted image data. As shown, a portion <b>201</b><i>d </i>of the environment for which remote sensor assemblies are responsible for collecting data may be subdivided into multiple cells <b>201</b><i>da</i>. In one of these cells, the remote sensor assembly may be disposed in such a way or may be transmitting its signals in a way that its apparent spatial location <b>203</b>, e.g., relative to the master signal transceivers <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b</i>, may be shifted from or appear to be in a location other than the expected spatial location <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Accordingly, it may be important that the data processing by the master transceivers <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b </i>be able to account for this. This is often a simple matter when multiple master signal transceivers <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b </i>are involved, since they can take advantage of signal triangulation whereby the signal transmitted by the remote sensor assembly, which travels over two distinct signal paths <b>241</b><i>a</i>, <b>241</b><i>b </i>to reach the master transceivers <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b</i>, can be analyzed or processed, with the respective results being compared to determine the spatial location of the remote sensor assembly, or the location within the environment (e.g., the specific cell <b>201</b><i>da</i>) which the responsible remote sensor assembly is monitoring. For example, one common technique involves analysis of the phases of the remote sensor assembly signal being received at each of the master signal transceivers <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b </i>to determine the lengths or difference in the lengths of the signal paths <b>241</b><i>a</i>, <b>241</b><i>b</i>, following which the location of the remote sensor assembly from which the signal originates can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, one technique for improving signal reception and differentiation involves the use of space diversity with respect to the antennas. For example, a set of N antennas <b>310</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>310</b><i>n </i>can be used to convert the incoming wireless signals to electrical signals <b>311</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>311</b><i>n </i>which are processed (e.g., amplified and filtered) in downstream circuitry <b>312</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>312</b><i>n</i>, with the resulting signals <b>313</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>313</b><i>n </i>being added in a signal combiner <b>314</b> (e.g., a signal summer) to produce the final receive signal <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, an alternative technique is the use of both spatial and frequency diversity. With this technique, the processed incoming signals <b>313</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>313</b><i>n </i>are further processed in circuitry <b>316</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>316</b><i>n </i>operating over multiple frequency ranges f<b>1</b>, f<b>2</b>, . . . , fn, with the resulting processed signals being combined in signal combiners <b>318</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>318</b><i>n </i>to produce intermediate signals <b>319</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>319</b><i>n </i>which are further combined in another signal combiner <b>314</b> to produce the final receive signal <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">More detailed discussions of wireless signal transceivers using signal diversity combining techniques can be found in: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/818,061, filed Apr. 5, 2004, for an “Apparatus For Pre-Scaling Data Packets With Multiple Signal Gain Coefficients In A SIMO/MISO Transceiver For Communication With A SISO Transceiver”; U.S. patent application Ser.

The disclosure of each of these documents is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, a further alternative diversity signal combining technique involves the use of an adaptive antenna array. In this technique, the processed received signals <b>313</b><i>a</i>, <b>313</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>313</b><i>n </i>are processed according to well-known techniques in an adaptive combiner <b>320</b>, whereby the various signals <b>313</b><i>a</i>, <b>313</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>313</b><i>n </i>are selectively weighted (e.g., selectively amplified, attenuated or filtered) and combined to produce the final receive signal <b>321</b> for further downstream processing.</p>
