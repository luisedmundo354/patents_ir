<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to welding-type systems and welding-type power sources and, more particularly, to a controller for such systems configured to control a welding-type power source to deliver a variable maximum output according to operating conditions of the welding-type system.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many welding-type apparatus, for example portable welding-type apparatus, include engine driven generators. In traditional welding generators, the generator is designed to have a rated maximum output that assumes a 100% duty cycle at a given temperature. That is, the engine and generator are designed to operate at the maximum duty cycle at some maximum temperature. As a result, under some operating conditions, the output of the generator may be limited by a maximum operating rating when, in fact, it may not be operating at the maximum duty cycle or the maximum temperature. That is, due to the relationship between operational temperature constraints and high duty cycles, the engine and generator combination is rated at an output that, under nearly all operational conditions, is a worse case scenario and therefore needlessly links output when not operating at those extremes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, the welding-type apparatus incorporating the engine and generator is designed to operate according to the limitations of the engine and generator assuming a 100% duty cycle. Similarly, the welding-type apparatus incorporating the engine and generator is restricted such that under all operational conditions, the engine or generator is not caused to operate above the maximum temperature constraint. Specifically, a maximum rated output is selected such that under a 100% duty cycle in the most stringent operational temperatures, the maximum temperature constraint, or other maximum operational thresholds, is not surpassed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, by qualifying such a unit at a maximum rated output of a 100% duty cycle and a stringent operating temperature, the engine and generator, and thereby the welding-type apparatus, are limited from operating above the maximum rated output even when the duty cycle and/or operating temperature are lower than the maximum ratings. That is, under some operating conditions, such as when the duty cycle is less than 100% or the temperature is below the maximum, the engine and generator may be capable of operating above the rated output, but is needlessly restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a given generator may have rated maximum output of 280 Amperes (A) at a 100% duty cycle and at 50 degrees Celsius (C). However, under a lower duty cycle or a lower operational temperature, for example a 50% duty cycle at 30 degrees C., the given generator may be capable of sustaining an output of 325 A. Therefore, while the generator may have a rated maximum output and be configured to operate below that maximum rated output, under some conditions the engine driven generator may actually be capable of an output significantly in excess of the maximum rated output to which it is limited. Accordingly, while under some conditions the engine driven generator may be capable of delivering an output above the maximum rated output, the engine and generator are limited from doing so by the maximum rated output.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would therefore be desirable to design a welding-type power source incorporating an engine and generator that may be controlled to operate above a maximum rated output dependant as actual operational conditions permit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a welding-type apparatus that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. Specifically, the present invention includes a controller configured to operate a welding-type power source in excess of a rated maximum output. That is, the present invention includes a controller configured to control a welding-type power source to have a variable maximum output determined from actual operating conditions of the welding-type power source.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, the present invention includes a welding-type power source controller is disclosed that includes a processor configured to control a welding-type power source to produce a variable maximum output that can exceed a rated maximum output.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of operating a welding-type power source is disclosed that includes determining at least one operating condition of a welding-type power source and comparing the at least one operating condition to a desired operating range. The method includes delivering an output of the welding-type power source above a rated output if the at least one operating condition is within the desired operating range.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present invention, a welding-type power source is disclosed that includes an engine, a generator configured to be driven by the engine, and a controller configured to monitor operating conditions of the welding-type power source. The controller is configured to control the engine and the generator to deliver an output above a rated output if at least one of the operating conditions is under a rated maximum parameter threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a welding-type apparatus is disclosed that includes means for generating operational power and means for controlling the means for generating operational power according to operating conditions of the welding-type apparatus. The controlling means is also configured to control the means for generating operational power to deliver operational power above a rated maximum power if the operating conditions of the welding-type apparatus are below a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a welding-type power source controller is disclosed including a processor configured to receive operating condition parameter signals and control a welding-type power source to deliver an output that can exceed a maximum rated output of the welding-type power source based on operating condition parameter signals.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention is directed to a welding-type apparatus and, more specifically, to a welding-type power source that includes an engine driven generator and controller configured to control the welding-type power source to operate according to a variable maximum output.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As one skilled in the art will fully appreciate, the hereinafter description of welding devices not only includes welders but also includes any system that requires high power outputs, such as heating and cutting systems. Therefore, the present invention is equivalently applicable with any device requiring high power output, including welders, plasma cutters, induction heaters, and the like. Reference to welding power, welding-type power, or welders generally, includes welding, cutting, or heating power. Description of a welding apparatus illustrates just one embodiment in which the present invention may be implemented. The present invention is equivalently applicable with systems such as cutting and induction heating systems.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a welding-type device <b>10</b>. The welding-type device <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>12</b> which encloses the internal components of the welding device. Optionally, the welding-type device <b>10</b> includes a loading eyehook <b>14</b> and/or fork recesses <b>16</b>. The loading eyehook <b>14</b> and the fork recesses <b>16</b> facilitate the portability of the welding-type device <b>10</b>. Optionally, the welding-type device <b>10</b> could include a handle and/or wheels as a means of device mobility. The housing <b>12</b> also includes a plurality of access panels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Access panel <b>18</b> provides access to a top panel <b>22</b> of housing <b>12</b> while access panel <b>20</b> provides access to a side panel <b>24</b> of housing <b>12</b>. A similar access panel is available on an opposite side. These access panels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, provide access to the internal components of the welding-type device <b>10</b>. An end panel <b>26</b> includes a louvered opening <b>28</b> to allow for air flow through the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The housing <b>12</b> of the welding-type device <b>10</b> houses an internal combustion engine. The engine is evidenced by an exhaust port <b>30</b> and a fuel port <b>32</b> that protrude through the housing <b>12</b>. The exhaust port <b>30</b> extends above the top panel <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b> and directs exhaust emissions away from the welding-type device <b>10</b>. The fuel port <b>32</b> preferably does not extend beyond the top panel <b>22</b> or side panel <b>24</b>. Such a construction protects the fuel port <b>32</b> from damage during transportation and operation of the welding-type device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of some of the components of the welding-type device <b>10</b> is shown. Specifically, the welding-type device <b>10</b> includes an engine <b>34</b> configured to drive a generator <b>36</b>. A first set of sensors, including an ambient temperature sensor <b>37</b>, an oil temperature sensor <b>38</b>, and a revolution per minute (RPM) sensor <b>40</b>, for example, is included to monitor a variety of operating conditions of the engine <b>34</b>. A second set of sensor, including an inverter temperature sensor <b>42</b>, a rectifier temperature sensor <b>44</b>, and a duty cycle sensor <b>46</b>, for example, is included to monitor the operating conditions of a variety of operating conditions of the generator <b>36</b>. The welding-type device may monitor a wide variety of conditions and can therefore include additional sensors <b>48</b> and additional sensors <b>50</b>, which may be configured to monitor the engine <b>34</b> and generator <b>36</b> respectively. The sensors <b>37</b>-<b>50</b> are connected via feedback cables <b>52</b>-<b>66</b> to a processor <b>68</b>, which, as will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, interprets the feedback from the sensors <b>37</b>-<b>50</b> and controls the operation of a power control circuit <b>70</b>. The processor <b>68</b> and the power control circuit <b>70</b> together create a power source controller <b>72</b>, which as will be described in detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, controls the welding-type device <b>10</b> to deliver a variable maximum output, dependent upon operating conditions, that can exceed a rated maximum output.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The power source controller <b>72</b> is configured to control the operation of the engine <b>34</b> and the generator <b>36</b> and condition the power delivered to a torch <b>72</b> to effectuate a welding-type process upon a workpiece <b>74</b>. Specifically, as will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the power source controller <b>72</b> receives feedback from the sensors <b>37</b>-<b>50</b>, whereby the processor <b>68</b> processes the feedback and controls the power control circuit <b>70</b> to control the operation of the engine <b>34</b> and generator <b>36</b> to deliver a variable maximum output that may exceed a rated maximum output.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flow chart setting forth the steps of a technique implemented by way of the power source controller <b>72</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for controlling the output of a welding-type power source is shown. Upon starting or powering up the power source <b>100</b>, the power source controller sets an initial output <b>102</b> based on default maximum rated output parameters and operator input. Once the output is set <b>102</b>, feedback begins being generated by the aforementioned plurality of sensors disposed within the welding-type power source such that ambient temperature feedback <b>104</b>, oil temperature feedback <b>106</b>, rectifier temperature feedback <b>108</b>, inverter temperature feedback <b>110</b>, duty cycle feedback <b>112</b>, and RPM feedback, for example, are received <b>114</b>. Again, feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> is for exemplary purposes only and additional and varied feedback regarding the welding-type power source is contemplated and within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Upon receipt of the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b>, each feedback type is compared to a respective threshold <b>116</b>-<b>126</b>. Should the feedback be less than the threshold <b>128</b>-<b>138</b>, the power source controller determines that the welding-type power source is operating within a desired operating range, and therefore, an output increase is permissible should the desired operator output benefit from additional power output <b>140</b>. That is, if the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> is less than the thresholds <b>128</b>-<b>138</b>, then the operating conditions of the power source are such that additional power output may be achievable from the engine and generator even though the engine and generator may be operating at a rated maximum output. Specifically, upon interpreting the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> with respect to the thresholds <b>116</b>-<b>126</b>, if the feedback is less than the thresholds <b>128</b>-<b>138</b>, the operating conditions of the engine and generator are such that a variable maximum output may be set above the traditional or rated maximum output. Therefore, the output of the welding-type power source is allowed to be increased <b>140</b> regardless of the rated maximum output.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be recognize that the permissibility of increased output <b>140</b> may not be dependent upon a determination that all feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> is less than a respective threshold <b>128</b>-<b>138</b>. That is, it is contemplated that a determination of the permissibility of an output increase may be determined based on finding that a predefined percentage or number of feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> is less that a respective threshold <b>128</b>-<b>138</b>. Furthermore, it is contemplated that feedback sources may be hierarchically ranked such that determining that a high ranking feedback is below a respective threshold may lead to a determination that an output increase is allowable <b>140</b> even though other, lower-ranking, feedback may be above a respective threshold. Therefore, it is recognized that the processing of the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> and whether the feedback is below a threshold <b>116</b>-<b>126</b> may be utilized in a wide variety of ways and through a wide variety of schemes in order to determine whether, under the current operating conditions, the engine and generator may be driven to produce an increased output.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">On the other hand, should the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b>, or a combination of feedback, be above a respective feedback threshold <b>142</b>-<b>152</b>, the engine and generator are operating at maximum output for the current operating conditions and the operator is notified <b>154</b>. Simultaneously, or substantially simultaneously, with the notification of the operator <b>154</b>, engine and generator operation are decreased or shut off <b>156</b>. Specifically, if the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> indicates that the power source is operating within operating conditions where the engine and generator are at a maximum output, the operation of the engine and generator is decreased or shut off, thereby decreasing or ceasing the output <b>156</b>. That is, in accordance with one embodiment, the engine and generator output is decreased such that the power delivered to the weld is decreased. However, in accordance with another embodiment, the engine and generator are shut off so that the weld quality is unaffected and potential re-work is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Again, it is contemplated that the feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> may be reviewed independently or in combination. That is, determination that the feedback is not below the thresholds <b>128</b>-<b>138</b> may be collectively determined, hierarchically ranked, or independently reviewed. For example, a determination that the duty cycle feedback <b>112</b> or the oil temperature feedback <b>106</b> is not below the respective thresholds <b>136</b>, <b>130</b>, may cause the power source control to determine that the power source is operating at a maximum under the present operating conditions regardless of whether the remaining feedback <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> is below the thresholds <b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the output is incrementally decreased <b>156</b> upon each reiteration of determining that the feedback is not less than the threshold. In accordance with another embodiment, the output decrease <b>156</b> is reduced below the rated maximum output of the welding-type power source. Furthermore, it is contemplated that the power source controller may include a map including a plurality of threshold results and corresponding outputs. That is, for a given combination of feedback <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> of which some feedback may be below a respective threshold and some may be above a respective threshold, the power source controller may utilize a map to determine whether an output increase is permissible <b>140</b> or whether a decrease is dictated <b>156</b>. Additionally, it is contemplated that the thresholds <b>116</b>-<b>126</b> may include ranges that correspond to desired operating ranges dictated by operator input and the particular welding-type operation being performed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In either case, whether an increase in output is permissible under the current operating conditions or whether a decrease is necessary, once an output is set <b>102</b>, feedback is again derived <b>104</b>-<b>114</b> and compared to a respective threshold <b>116</b>-<b>126</b> to determine whether an augmentation of power source operation is necessary or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore, the above-described system enables a welding-type power source to implement a variable maximum output that is tailored to the current operating conditions of the welding-type power source. Accordingly, the maximum power output of the welding-type power source is determined independent of the rated maximum output or rated maximum parameter threshold and, as such, may exceed a rated maximum output should operational conditions permit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is contemplated that the present invention may be utilized with a plurality of welding-type process. For example, the welding-type apparatus may operate according to a Gas Metal Arc Welding-type (GMAW) welding-type process, formerly known as Metal Inert Gas (MIG) process, a Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding-type process, a Shielded Metal Arc Welding-type (SMAW) process, an induction heating process, a plasma-cutting process or other welding-type processes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, a given welding-type device having a rated maximum output of 280 A based upon a 100% duty cycle and at 50° C. is controlled to have an output above the rated 280 A. That is, the welding-type device is controlled to have a 325 A output at a 50% duty cycle at 30° C. Therefore, while the welding-type device has a rated maximum output, under certain operating parameters, the welding-type device is controlled to provide an output significantly in excess of the maximum rated output.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a welding-type power source controller includes a processor configured to control a welding-type power source according to a variable maximum output that can exceed a rated maximum output.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method of operating a welding-type power source includes determining at least one operating condition of a welding-type power source and comparing the at least one operating condition to a desired operating range. The method includes delivering an output of the welding-type power source above a rated output if the at least one operating condition is within the desired operating range.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to yet a further embodiment of the present invention, a welding-type power source includes an engine, a generator configured to be driven by the engine, and a controller configured to monitor operating conditions of the welding-type power source. The controller is configured to control the engine and the generator to deliver an output above a rated output if the operating conditions under a rated maximum parameter threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a welding-type apparatus includes means for generating operational power and means for controlling the means for generating operational power according to operating conditions of the welding-type apparatus. The means for controlling is also configured to control the means for generating operational power to deliver operational power above a rated maximum power if the operating conditions of the welding-type apparatus are below a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a further embodiment of the present invention, a welding-type power source controller includes a processor configured to receive operating condition parameter signals and control a welding-type power source to deliver an output that can exceed a maximum rated output of the welding-type power source.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention has been described in terms of the preferred embodiment, and it is recognized that equivalents, alternatives, and modifications, aside from those expressly stated, are possible and within the scope of the appending claims.</p>
