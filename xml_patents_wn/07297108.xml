<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method for allowing a patient to access an automated process for managing a specified health problem called a disease. The system performs disease management in a fully automated manner, using periodic interactive dialogs with the patient to obtain health state measurements from the patient, to evaluate and assess the progress of the patient's disease, to review and adjust therapy to optimal levels, and to give the patient medical advice for administering treatment and handling symptom flare-ups and acute episodes of the disease. The medical records are updated, the progression of the disease is stored and tracked, and the patient's preferences for treatment are stored and then used to offer medical advice based on the current state of the disease. A prestored general disease trend curve is compared against a patient specific disease trend curve, and the system makes an automated response such as adjusting therapy.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to medical knowledge systems, and more specifically, to systems for computerized long-term management of patient diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Health is the ground upon which we lead our lives. Medicine is composed of diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis means finding the cause of the patient's problem; treating is the application of the best therapy available. However, not all diseases can be completely cured by a treatment regime.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Diseases such as asthma and diabetes may require a regular schedule of treatment, termed therapy, for the duration of a patient's life. In this case, the disease is managed rather than cured. Disease management may be defined as managing a patient with a known diagnosis with the intention of providing patient education and monitoring to prevent symptom flare ups and acute episodes of the disease in order to eliminate costly medical intervention and promote patient well being. The therapy portion of disease management must be custom-tailored to the response of a particular patient since diseased patients may respond differently to the same treatment, e.g., a prescribed dosage and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since disease management creates reoccurring expenses to society, there is a tremendous desire to reduce costs. One must understand a capitated healthcare system in the extreme to see why the goal is worth achieving. Advocates of a fully capitated system say that everyone will win. Taken to the extreme no one will ever get sick, and doctors will be paid for never seeing patients because there wouldn't be any patients. In a fully capitated system, every person in the world pays a predetermined amount per person per month to health maintenance organizations whose sole purpose is to keep you healthy. This is an admirable goal, but impossible to achieve. However, a realizable goal is to automate the way diseases are managed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The entire concept of disease management, carried to the extreme, is to visualize a doctor following a patient around for 24 hours a day. Of course, this is an unobtainable solution for the vast majority of the population. To reduce costs, the doctor's knowledge must be disseminated to the general public and one approach might be to not require the physical presence of the doctor at the site of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Much of medicine is algorithmic. That is, the diagnosis follows a sequence of steps to isolate the cause of the problem. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and advanced trauma life support (ATLS) have shown how much care can be improved by setting standards. Some standards may be translated into medicinal algorithms, which can help set the standard of care for physicians. The concept of telephone medical advice has been proven by nationwide poison control centers, and physicians, particularly pediatricians, have practiced medicine over the telephone since it was invented. In fact, the very first words uttered over the telephone were an appeal for help, for Alexander Graham Bell had just spilled battery acid (for the batteries for the telephone) and said, “Come here, Mr. Watson, I need you” on Mar. 7th of 1876. Today's so-called telemedicine remains a one-to-one relationship. The phenomenon of telemedicine depends, in part, on best-practice guidelines helping make the practice of medicine consistent.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disease management is nothing less than the redesign of the practice of medicine. The problem with medicine was mostly one of information and arrangement of that information. Because of the development of the personal computer and standards, advances can now be made in disease management. In the past, doctors have been the repository of medical information and the ones to “arrange” it so that it had clinical meaning. But these functions can now be performed in an automated way using the “lever” of telecommunication and computer technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Disease management can involve coordinating care for patients across the entire health care continuum from birth to death. Disease management has a program available for every part of everyone's life, including prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. The process involves managing not only the patient with a particular disease, but also the healthy patient. Too often, providers focuses on providing intensive and costly services to patients with acute episodes of disease. Disease management advocates seek a greater focus on preventive, comprehensive care to improve the health of the entire population. In a sense, disease management attempts to take the practice of medicine out of the hands of physicians and puts it into the hands of patients.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Almost all “knowledge based” clinical reasoning could be performed better and more reliability by computers. Technology will drive the democratization of medicine. A system that can automate the practice of medicine, especially in disease management, and which encourages and trains patients to play a major beneficial role in their medical health care is highly desired. Such a system should give a sustainable, substantive, and significant competitive advantage in a capitated health care marketplace. Such a system should be able to automatically identify very critical points in any disease process so that intervention is clinically, economically and humanistically maximized.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">System Overview</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a computerized knowledge-based medical management system <b>100</b> will be described. A disease management module (DMM) <b>80</b> and several other high-level service modules <b>82</b> perform automated medical services for the users of the medical management system <b>100</b>. The service modules <b>82</b> may include Diagnosis, Treatment Table, Automated Demand Management, Audio/Visual/Image Library, and Author Access. The DMM <b>80</b> handles tasks associated with Disease Management (DM); its major goals are to promote patient well-being, to educate patients, and to reduce costly medical intervention. The user may be a patient <b>114</b> or an assistant for a patient. Throughout this document, the words user and patient are used interchangeably. However, it will be understood that the user may be acting as a proxy for the patient. If this is the case, the user is registered as an assistant for the patient. Appropriate registration and login processes, described herein below, are utilized by the system <b>100</b> for either the patient or the assistant.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The modules <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are supported by an Operating System and support software <b>88</b>, by a number of databases <b>84</b>, and by a computing environment <b>90</b> of an embedding computer hardware platform <b>110</b>. The entire computer hardware-software-communications complex is operated and maintained by a support staff. All application tasks of the DMM <b>80</b> are fully automated. External contact of the DMM with patients, physicians, clinics, pharmacies, laboratories, and so on (collectively <b>92</b>) are handled by automated communications systems using appropriate media and methods of the computing environment <b>90</b>, such as interactive voice response (IVR), direct modem-to-modem access, or access via the Internet <b>102</b>. The patient <b>114</b> utilizes a computer <b>116</b> and monitor <b>118</b>, a telephone <b>124</b>, or other components, some of which are described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>below, to communicate with the system computer platform <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, a block diagram of one embodiment of the medical management system <b>100</b> will be described. The system <b>100</b> includes a network “cloud” <b>102</b>, which may represent a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or another connection service.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The system programs and databases may reside on a group of servers <b>108</b> that are preferably interconnected by a LAN <b>106</b> and a gateway <b>104</b> to the network <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the system programs and databases may reside on a single server <b>110</b> that utilizes network interface hardware and software <b>112</b>. The system servers <b>108</b>/<b>110</b> store the modules <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The network <b>102</b> may connect to a user computer <b>116</b>, for example, by use of a modem or by use of a network interface card. The user <b>114</b> at the computer <b>116</b> may utilize a browser <b>120</b> to remotely access the system programs using a keyboard and/or pointing device and a visual display, such as the monitor <b>118</b>. Alternatively, the browser <b>120</b> is not utilized when the system programs are executed in a local mode on the computer <b>116</b>. A video camera <b>122</b> may be optionally connected to the computer <b>116</b> to provide visual input, such as visual symptoms or signs. Furthermore, clinical sounds could be picked up by the video camera or separate microphone (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Various other devices may be used to communicate with the system servers <b>108</b>/<b>110</b>. If the servers are equipped with voice recognition or DTMF hardware, the user can communicate with the system program by use of the telephone <b>124</b>. A telephonic embodiment is described in Applicant's application entitled “Computerized Medical Diagnostic and Treatment Advice System,” U.S. application Ser. No. 08/176,041, filed Dec. 29, 1993, which has issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,176, and is hereby incorporated by reference. Other connection devices for communicating with the system servers <b>108</b>/<b>110</b> include a portable personal computer <b>126</b> with a modem or wireless connection interface, a cable interface device <b>128</b> connected to a visual display <b>130</b>, or a satellite dish <b>132</b> connected to a satellite receiver <b>134</b> and a television <b>136</b>. Other ways of allowing communication between the user <b>114</b> and the system servers <b>108</b>/<b>110</b> are envisioned.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, a diagram of one embodiment of a server computer <b>110</b> shows several possible interconnections to the network. To “play” a script, a special program called a Script Engine is used, which reads a medical diagnostic script file and uses its codes to perform interview actions, such as outputting a question to a patient and inputting an answer. The scripts may also collect the answers from the patient, evaluate the answers, issue a diagnosis, and update the patient's medical record. The script engine may also reside in the user computer <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>). The script engine may be stored on the hard drive or a CD-ROM, and is loaded into the main memory or a cache for execution.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The components of a presently preferred server computer <b>110</b> of the computerized medical system <b>100</b> of the present invention, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. The server computer <b>110</b> includes a plurality of components within an enclosure. A telephone line <b>156</b> interfaces the public telephone network <b>158</b> to the computer <b>110</b> via a modem <b>160</b>. The telephone network <b>158</b> may connect to the network <b>102</b>, which has connections with the system server(s) <b>108</b>/<b>110</b>. Alternatively, the computer <b>110</b> may connect to the network <b>102</b> by use of a network interface card <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The hardware and system software are assembled with two basic concepts in mind: portability to other operating systems and the use of industry standard components. In this way, the system can be more flexible and will allow free market competition to continually improve the product, while, at the same time, decreasing costs. While specific hardware and software may be referenced, it will be understood that a panoply of different components could be used in the present system.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The computer <b>110</b> preferably is a personal computer with an Intel Pentium microprocessor <b>170</b>. Other computers, such as an Apple Macintosh, an Amiga, a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, or an IBM mainframe, could also be utilized. The modem <b>160</b> or the network interface card <b>164</b> connects to an industry standard architecture (ISA) or a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus <b>162</b>. The bus <b>162</b> interconnects the microprocessor <b>170</b> with a plurality of peripherals through controller circuits (chips or boards).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The computer bus <b>162</b> has a plurality of peripherals connected to it through adapters or controllers. A video adapter board <b>172</b>, preferably at SVGA or better resolution, interconnects to a video monitor <b>118</b>. A serial communication circuit <b>176</b> interfaces with a pointing device, such as a mouse <b>178</b>. A parallel communication circuit may be used in place of circuit <b>176</b> in another embodiment. A keyboard controller circuit <b>180</b> interfaces with a keyboard <b>182</b>. A 500 Mb or greater hard disk drive <b>184</b> and an optional CD-ROM drive <b>186</b> are preferably attached to the bus <b>162</b>. The hard disk <b>184</b> stores database files such as the patient files, DM files, other system files, and binary support files. The CD-ROM drive <b>186</b> also stores database files and binary support files.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A main memory <b>190</b> connects to the microprocessor <b>170</b>. In one embodiment, the computer <b>110</b> may operate under the Windows 95 operating system <b>192</b>. The memory <b>190</b> executes a diagnostic script engine (not shown) and a disease management module (DMM) process <b>220</b>. Portions of the disease management module process software may be written in Borland Delphi Pascal, version %I, and other portions may be written in Microsoft ‘C’, version 7.0. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the database is implemented with Microsoft Foxpro or another database program such as a SQL-compatible relational database program.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">System Processes and Databases</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a portion of the processes, files, and databases utilized by the medical management system <b>100</b> will be described. Except for the DMM process, a Permissions database, an Imaging Modality database, a Laboratory Test database, a Diseases database, and other DM specific databases which are described herein below, these processes, files, and databases were described in Applicant's patent entitled “Computerized Medical Diagnostic and Treatment Advice System,” U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,176.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The medical management system <b>100</b> utilizes several principal processes and related databases. A set of patient/assistant login processes <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> is used by the system <b>100</b> to identify a patient who has previously registered into the system in one of three ways: 1) by prompting for a patient identification number (PIN) in process <b>200</b>; 2) identify an assistant who has previously registered into the system by prompting for an assistant identification number (AIN) in process <b>210</b>; or 3) identify a patient, having an assistant, who has previously registered into the system by prompting for the patient identification number in process <b>212</b>. One of a set of processes <b>202</b>, <b>214</b> or <b>216</b> is used to register a patient or assistant. If the user is the patient, a patient registration process is used by the system to register new or first-time patients in process <b>200</b>. If the user is not the patient, an assistant registration process is used by the system to register new or first-time assistants in process <b>214</b>. Then, if the patient is not already registered, an assisted patient registration process is used by the system to register the patient in process <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Once a user has logged in or registered, the system provides a choice of processes. The primary process of concern in the current embodiment is the DMM process <b>220</b> that manages a disease or condition of the patient. The DMM process <b>220</b> may access the laboratory test of choice database <b>260</b> or imaging modality of choice database <b>258</b> in the course of disease management and a treatment table <b>250</b> to obtain current treatment information for a particular disease or diagnosis. Associated with these processes are a patient and assistant enrollment database <b>240</b>, a consultation history database <b>242</b>, a patient response database <b>244</b>, a medical history objects database <b>246</b>, a patient medication database <b>248</b>, a pending database <b>252</b>, and a patient medical history database <b>254</b>. These databases include an electronic medical record for each patient that is registered with the medical system <b>100</b>. The electronic medical record contains all the information about each patient. A permissions database <b>256</b>, a diseases database <b>262</b> and other DM specific databases <b>264</b> will be described herein below. In another embodiment, other choices are added to access other medical information processes.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Top-Level System Process Flow</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d</i>, the top level flow <b>300</b> of the medical management system software will be described. A telephone number used to access the system <b>100</b> via the telephone may vary in various embodiments of the system. If the sponsoring agency or hospital wishes to provide access to the medical management system <b>100</b> at no cost to the caller, then a toll-free (e.g., 800, 888 or other number) service number can be used. If the sponsoring agency or hospital wishes to recover the costs of running the system <b>100</b> from the caller, it may use a pay-per-call or premium charge number (e.g., 900 service). “Current Procedural Terminology” (CPT-4) codes are available to describe and bill third party payers for telephone consultations. They are a listing of the descriptive terms and identifying codes for reporting medical services and procedures. CPT-4 codes are the most widely accepted nomenclature for reporting physician services to insurance companies. If access is provided to the system <b>100</b> via the Internet or other network, an appropriate web address (or addresses) is provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Beginning at a start state <b>302</b>, the user <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) desiring medical advice dials the telephone number for the system <b>100</b> on the telephone <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>). The user may be the patient or may be an “assistant”, e.g., parent, relative, or friend, that is helping the patient. Alternatively, the user may access the system <b>100</b> though the user computer <b>116</b>, such as through the Internet as previously described. Moving to state <b>304</b>, the system <b>100</b> answers the call automatically and greets the caller <b>114</b> with an introductory greeting message by playing back a speech file stored on the system hard drive by use of a voice processing board, such as a D/41D available from Dialogic. Alternatively, if the user is using the browser <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) or other user interface on the Internet <b>102</b>, a greeting message is displayed to the user on the visual display <b>118</b>. Thus the system <b>100</b> communicates with the user <b>114</b> either by the telephone or by messages displayed on the visual display. Subsequent steps in the process or function flowcharts will only describe one form of user communication for brevity purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Proceeding at state <b>306</b>, the system <b>100</b> asks each patient who calls the system a series of “initial screening questions.” These questions are designed to identify patients who are critically ill; they are not designed to identify the patient's problem. The initial screening questions enable the system to filter out patients who require immediate medical attention.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Moving to decision state <b>308</b>, any patient found to be critically ill is instructed to dial the emergency response telephone number “911” at state <b>309</b> or will be automatically connected to the nearest emergency medical services system in the patient's area. The session is terminated by process <b>300</b> at state <b>310</b>. The following are examples of initial screening questions:</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">? IS THIS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY?</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">? ARE YOU HAVING DIFFICULTY BREATHING?</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">? ARE YOU EXPERIENCING SEVERE PAIN OR PRESSURE IN YOUR CHEST?</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If the system determines that the patient is experiencing a medical emergency, it may provide the patient with a menu of emergency medical procedures at state <b>311</b>. In situations where the patient or the caller for the patient is far from the nearest emergency help, e.g., a rural setting, the user may need to initiate emergency procedures immediately. The menu of emergency medical procedures provides several choices to the user. If the user presses touch tone key “1” or speaks the word “one” into the telephone mouthpiece, process <b>300</b> branches to state <b>312</b> wherein well known CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) information is recited. If the user has a speakerphone capability associated with the telephone <b>124</b> being used, the user may be able to listen to and perform the instructions given by the system <b>100</b> in a hands-free manner away from the telephone. If the caller presses touch tone key “2” or speaks the word “two” into the telephone mouthpiece, process <b>300</b> branches to state <b>313</b> wherein well known Heimlich Hug information for choking is recited. At the completion of either state <b>312</b> or state <b>313</b>, the session ends at state <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">If the patient is determined at state <b>308</b> not to have a medical emergency, i.e., the system <b>100</b> is satisfied that no immediately life threatening condition is present, process <b>300</b> moves to a decision state <b>315</b> to determine if the user is the actual patient. If so, process <b>300</b> proceeds to a decision state <b>316</b> to determine if the patient has previously registered or ever consulted with the system <b>100</b>, i.e., is not a new or first-time caller. If so, the system <b>100</b> verifies the patient's identification and retrieves their medical record at the patient login process <b>200</b>. At the completion of process <b>200</b>, process <b>300</b> proceeds through off-page connector C <b>317</b> to state <b>344</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>). If the patient is not registered, as determined at decision state <b>316</b>, the system <b>100</b> proceeds to the patient registration process <b>202</b> for a new patient. At the completion of process <b>202</b>, process <b>300</b> proceeds through off-page connector C <b>317</b> to state <b>344</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If the user is not the patient, as determined at state <b>315</b>, process <b>300</b> proceeds through off-page connector A <b>318</b> to a decision state <b>320</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>. There will be times when the patient may not be able to use the system <b>100</b> directly, e.g., due to injury, weakness or altered level of consciousness. In these cases, an “assistant” may interact with the system on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">An assistant registers with the system through the assistant registration process <b>214</b>. The assistant registration record is identical to the patient registration record in structure, but three fields have special significance for an assistant: ASST_PERM, ASST_EXP, and RELATIONS. The ASST_PERM field is a Boolean flag that can only be set true off-line by the system administrator who has verified, through separate means, that a relationship exists between a patient and an assistant. The relationships are one-to-many, i.e., a patient may have one or more assistants, and an assistant may be related to more than one patient. The ASST_PERM flag may also be constrained by the ASST_EXP field, which contains a timestamp for the expiration of the ASST_PERM attribute. If the ASST_PERM flag is true, then the RELATIONS pointers will point to one or more patient records for whom this assistant is a “permanent assistant;” otherwise the RELATIONS field will be empty.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The medical information gathered during an assisted consultation is written to the patient's medical record if the following three conditions are met:</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">(a) the assistant's ASST_PERM flag is True</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">(b) the ASST_EXP timestamp has not been reached</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">(c) the assistant has a relationship pointer to the patient record</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">If any of these conditions are not met, then any new medical information gathered on this patient will be saved to the Pending file <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for off-line verification by the system administrator.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The system <b>100</b> establishes at state <b>315</b> whether the user is the patient, or an assistant. If the user is not the patient, then the system asserts that the user is an assistant and, at decision state <b>320</b>, determines if the assistant is registered. If the assistant is not already registered with the system, the system enrolls the new assistant at the assistant registration process <b>214</b>. If the assistant is already registered with the system <b>100</b>, process <b>300</b> performs the assistant login process <b>210</b>. At the completion of either process <b>214</b> or process <b>210</b>, process <b>300</b> advances to a decision state <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If the patient is not already registered with the system <b>100</b>, as determined at decision state <b>321</b>, then the system allows the assistant to register a new patient at the assisted patient registration process <b>216</b>. However, if the patient is already registered with the system <b>100</b>, as determined at state <b>321</b>, process <b>300</b> performs the assisted patient login process <b>212</b>. At the completion of process <b>216</b> or process <b>212</b>, process <b>300</b> proceeds through off-page connector B <b>327</b> to a decision state <b>334</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">At decision state <b>334</b>, process <b>300</b> determines if the patient's date of birth is in the patient's medical record. If so, process <b>300</b> proceeds through off-page connector C <b>317</b> to state <b>344</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>. If not, the system <b>100</b> attempts to get the patient's date of birth. Moving to state <b>335</b>, the system <b>100</b> asks the assistant if the patient's date of birth is known. If so, process <b>300</b> advances to state <b>336</b> to request the patient's date of birth. At state <b>337</b>, the system <b>100</b> recites the patient's date of birth obtained at state <b>336</b>. At a decision state <b>338</b>, the assistant determines if the date of birth is correct as recited by the system <b>100</b>. If not, process <b>300</b> loops back to state <b>336</b> to request the patient's date of birth again. If the patient's date of birth is correct, as determined at state <b>338</b>, process <b>300</b> flags the date of birth for saving in the patient's medical record at state <b>339</b>, and proceeds to state <b>344</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If the patient's date of birth is not known, as determined at state <b>335</b>, process <b>300</b> proceeds to state <b>340</b> wherein the system requests the assistant to provide an approximate age of the patient. The age is an important parameter used by the DMM process <b>220</b>, the diagnostic module and the treatment table <b>250</b>. At state <b>341</b>, the system <b>100</b> recites the patient's approximate age obtained at state <b>340</b>. At a decision state <b>342</b>, the assistant determines if the age is correct as recited by the system <b>100</b>. If not, process <b>300</b> loops back to state <b>340</b> to request the patient's approximate age again. If the patient's approximate age is correct, as determined at state <b>342</b>, the system <b>100</b> advises the assistant at state <b>343</b> to get the patient's actual date of birth before the next consultation, and proceeds to state <b>344</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>. The system <b>100</b> uses the approximate age in the session during the diagnostic module and the treatment table <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">At state <b>344</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>, the system <b>100</b> presents the user with a system selection menu. Here, the caller is asked to select from among six choices: diagnostic system, treatment table, disease management, audio/visual/image library, automated demand management, or end session as described below:</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A. Diagnostic System: The system starts an evaluation process <b>280</b> at a menu, where it asks the patient to begin identification of the complaint.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">B. Treatment Table: The system takes the patient to the treatment table process <b>250</b> at a menu, where it asks the patient to select a treatment selection method.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">C. Disease Management: The system starts the DMM process <b>220</b> where it first determines if the patient has previously used the Disease Management Module. This process is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">D. Audio/Visual/Image Library: The system starts a Audio/Visual/Image Library process <b>282</b> which lets a patient hear medical sounds, see medical videos, or see medical photographs or other images.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">E. Automated Demand Management: The system starts an Automated Demand Management process <b>284</b> to help the patient determine if a physician should be seen, and if so, who should be seen and when they should be visited.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">F. End Session: The system performs several steps and then terminates the session.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">At the exit point of the evaluation process <b>280</b>, the system <b>100</b> gives the patient the option of selecting another complaint.

At the end of the audio/visual/image library process <b>282</b>, the system <b>100</b> gives the patient the option of selecting another audio clip, video, or image. At the end of the automated demand process <b>284</b>, the system <b>100</b> gives the patient the option of receiving advice for another problem.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">At the completion of the evaluation process <b>280</b>, the treatment table process <b>250</b>, the disease management module process <b>220</b>, the audio/visual/image library process <b>282</b>, or the automated demand management process <b>284</b>, the system <b>100</b> loops back to state <b>344</b> and again provides the system selection menu for the user. If the user chooses the End Session selection at state <b>344</b>, the system <b>100</b> moves to a decision state <b>345</b>. At decision state <b>345</b>, the system <b>100</b> determines if process <b>280</b>, process <b>250</b>, process <b>220</b>, or process <b>284</b> did not occur in information mode, i.e., did occur in either Real mode or Pending Mode, and examines a symbol table associated for the current patient to determine if any of the configured memory variables are past medical history conditions that need to be saved to the patient's medical history file. If both conditions are true at state <b>345</b>, the system <b>100</b> advances to a decision state <b>346</b> to determine if the consultation is being performed in Real mode. If not, the consultation is being performed in Pending mode, and the system <b>100</b> then writes any new patient information obtained during the consultation to the Pending file <b>252</b> at state <b>347</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">If decision state <b>346</b> proves to be true, i.e., Real mode, for each past medical condition that needs to be saved, the system <b>100</b> asks the patient at state <b>348</b> to grant permission to save the datum to the patient's medical history file and to confirm that the datum is correct. For example, during a consultation for cough, the system <b>100</b> may have learned that the patient has been diagnosed as being HIV positive. The system <b>100</b> will ask, “May I record the information about your HIV diagnosis in your medical record?” If the patient responds “yes”, then the system <b>100</b> will ask, “Please verify that your diagnosis for HIV was positive, is this correct?” If the patient responds “yes”, then the system <b>100</b> writes the diagnosis, and a score indicative of system accuracy to the patient's medical history file. After confirmation, each data item is stored in the patient's file in the patient medical history database <b>254</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">At the completion of either updating the patient medical history database <b>254</b> at state <b>348</b>, or state <b>345</b> proves to be false, or at the completion of state <b>347</b>, the process <b>300</b> moves to a decision state <b>349</b>. Before the system <b>100</b> ends the consultation with the patient, it presents a summary of all the advice it has given. In a telephonic session, the patient is asked to write down and repeat back the key points. The system <b>100</b> then gives the patient the option of receiving a summary of the consultation session and specific recommendations provided by the system via facsimile, electronic mail (E-mail) or a mail service, such as first-class mail. If a fax or E-mail is desired, process <b>300</b> moves to a decision state <b>350</b> to determine if information to send the summary and recommendations is available in the system. If not, process <b>300</b> asks the patient for the information, e.g., a fax number, E-mail address or mail address, at state <b>352</b>. The patient also has the option to send a summary of the consultation to his or her health care provider or specialist. Proceeding to state <b>351</b>, process <b>300</b> adds the transcript of the current telephone session to a fax queue or an E-mail queue, as desired, for subsequent transmission.

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Disease Management Overview</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The present invention includes a computer program called a Disease Management Module (DMM). The disease management module is one of several high-level service modules that perform automated medical services for the users of the medical management system <b>100</b>. In this context, disease management (DM) means the continuing medical care of a patient who has been diagnosed with a specified health problem called a disease. The DDM may continue care throughout a patient's lifetime. The DMM performs disease management in a fully automated manner, using periodic interactive dialogs with the patient to obtain health state measurements from the patient, to evaluate and assess the progress of the patient's disease, to review and adjust therapy to optimal levels, and to give the patient medical advice for administering treatment and handling symptom flare-ups and acute episodes of the disease. The goal of the disease management module is to promote patient health in an automated manner that reduces costly medical intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Various features of the DMM software are specifically designed to accumulate and use patient-specific information, so that disease management can be tailored more to each individual case. As the module manages a given patient over time, it builds a profile of the case, in the form of the frequency and reasons for the patient's contacts with the DMM, the patient's subjective understanding of the disease, the patient's objective response to various medical treatments, and the patient's preferences in treatment. The module then uses that knowledge to adjust its internal procedures, so that they adapt more to the specific patient.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">When a patient is first admitted to DM, the DMM runs a registration procedure that verifies the patient's medical history, initializes the initial therapy for the patient's disease, and sets up a schedule for patient contacts. For every registered DM patient, the DMM conducts periodic automated sessions with the patient. During each session, the DMM obtains and updates the patient's medical history with the latest health measurements, analyzes and assesses patient health as needed, adjusts therapy as needed, and gives the patient appropriate medical advice. At the end of each session, the DMM schedules the next session. Ultimately, the DMM discharges patients by moving them from the disease management state to another state such as to the medical care of a human physician, to the care of the diagnostic module of the medical system, or to a normal health state with the appropriate follow-up health checkups.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The DMM module is now summarized here in terms of its overall features, so as to put the features into the overall context. Each feature will be further described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In all of its contacts with patients, the DMM must insure that it complies with a large number of permissions, consents, and authorizations granted by various agents and agencies. The DMM uses the Permissions database to manage these control data.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">To conduct online interactive dialogs with patients (or their agents), the DMM uses scripts. Scripts are special computer programs capable of outputting text and questions to a patient, waiting for a response from the patient, recording the response, and taking further action based on the response. The development and use of scripts has been described in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/893,402, filed Jul. 11, 1997, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,935,060, entitled “Computerized Medical Diagnostic and Treatment Advice System including List Based Processing”, and in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/893,912, filed Jul. 11, 1997, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,315, entitled “Computerized Medical Diagnostic and Treatment Advice System including Network Access”, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">A normal online dialog with a patient takes the general form of a sequence of questions asked by a script, and answers provided by the patient. As the script runs, it considers the patient's current status, selects a question, and presents the question to the patient. The patient responds, the script analyzes the response, selects another question, and so on until the session is normally terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A script Preview Mode for the DMM allows the patient to answer a question in a “look ahead” mode, to see what the consequences of a given response would be, without formally selecting the response. Abnormal script terminations can be handled by the DMM in an intelligent, proactive manner using a No-Response function. If a patient suddenly fails to respond in the middle of a dialog, this function can use all that is known about the patient, the patient's location, and the disease being managed to respond proactively, including—if necessary—the ability to contact the patient's nearest emergency assistance facility or to call 911 for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The DMM performs all of its contact with patients in the form of Disease Management sessions, which are regularly scheduled, online dialogs with the patient. A DM session can be initiated by either the patient calling the medical system (inbound), or by the system calling the patient (outbound). Every DM session consists of four major tasks performed in the following sequence: Open Session, Health Assessment, Therapy Optimization, and Close Session.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The Open Session task initializes data and registers patients. The task uses the patient's health history and the disease being managed to establish the assessment health parameters that are to be measured and tracked, including relevant thresholds, limits, ranges, and critical values. It also gives patients instructions on how to observe symptoms, perform health measurements, assess their health, and prospectively trend their disease.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The Health Assessment task obtains health measurements from the patient for the interval since the last session, encodes symptom descriptions using a PQRST Array, and calculates various relevant health counts, patterns, and trends. It analyzes health state using a Correlation Assessment function and a Critical Curve Assessment function. The Correlation Assessment function uses a Subjective-Objective Correlation Factor (SOCF), a statistical measure of how well a given patient can assess his/her own disease state and progress, to assess the patient's health based on subjective data. The PQRST Array is an encoding scheme used to convert subjective descriptions of pain symptoms into a DMM-wide digitized pain code. The Critical Curve is a time-plot of specified health parameters that the DMM can compare to standard critical curves to detect or predict rapid deterioration of patient health.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Finally, the Health Assessment task decides what action to take for the patient, such as referring the patient out of the system, to seek human medical attention; or referring the patient to the diagnostic module process for diagnosis of a new symptom; or proceeding to the next task to determine the next therapy step for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The third task of the DM session is Therapy Optimization, whose express goal is to adjust therapy step by step in a manner that balances the risks and benefits, maximizes efficacy and minimizes adverse side effects, and converges to an optimum therapy for this patient over the long term. The task selects one of several possible therapies from a treatment table, adjusts dosages in small steps as controlled by a Patient Consent Level function, presents the risks and benefits to the patient, and lets the patient accept or reject the recommendation. If the patient rejects, the task computes the next best therapy, and the next, until it reaches a limit that is stored in the Permissions database. In all of its work, the task consults a Therapeutic Alteration Permission Level (TAPL) to determine how much authority it has to modify therapy automatically. If the task has too little authority to recommend a therapy, or if the patient rejects all therapy suggestions, the task refers the patient to a human physician.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The final task of the DM session, Close Session, stores all of the assessment measurements, parameters, and decision factors in the patient's medical history database. The task also processes the therapy changes that the patient accepted, issues relevant instructions to the patient, and finally reschedules the patient for the next session. Then the task initiates processes to output various session logs and reports requested during the session, and finally, the DMM saves the relevant data and terminates the current DM session. The DMM is now done with this patient until the next session repeats the process.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Disease Management Module</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the process <b>220</b> will be described. Process <b>220</b> comprises the executable portion of the Disease Management Module (DMM), which conducts an on-line, interactive dialog with a patient for the purpose of managing a known disease of the patient. Process <b>220</b> consists of four processes <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, and <b>410</b>. A DM session starts when control is passed to program <b>220</b> at the start node <b>402</b>. From the start node <b>402</b>, process <b>220</b> invokes process <b>404</b>, which performs initialization, file opening, and registration functions as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> below. When process <b>404</b> returns control to process <b>220</b>, process <b>220</b> next invokes process <b>406</b>, which inputs health measurements from the patient, analyzes them, and assesses the patient's current health state. When process <b>406</b> returns control to process <b>220</b>, process <b>220</b> next invokes process <b>408</b>, which computes an optimum next therapy step that is accepted by the patient. When process <b>408</b> returns control to process <b>220</b>, process <b>220</b> next invokes process <b>410</b>, which outputs various reports, saves session data, and closes working files. When process <b>410</b> returns control to process <b>220</b>, process <b>220</b> passes control to step <b>412</b>. Step <b>412</b> returns control to the process that invoked process <b>220</b> at node <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Open Session</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the process <b>404</b> will be described. Process <b>404</b> establishes the data needed to conduct a DM session. It registers patients that are new to the DMM and loads existing data for patients that have previously conducted DM sessions. Finally, process <b>404</b> creates a Disease Management Order (DMO) record, in which the cumulative decisions made by the DMM during this DM session are stored. The DMO is further described in section Disease Management Order. Process <b>404</b> receives control at the start node <b>430</b>. Next, process <b>220</b> passes control to decision <b>432</b>, which looks up the patient's identification in the DM register to see whether the patient is a registered, i.e. has conducted previous DM sessions. If the patient is not registered, process <b>404</b> passes control to step <b>434</b>, otherwise to step <b>452</b>, which will be described later in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Step <b>434</b> is the first of seven successive steps <b>434</b>, <b>436</b>, <b>438</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>446</b> that register a patient for Disease Management. Step <b>434</b> outputs messages to greet and inform the patient that s/he is about to begin registration for DM. Next, step <b>436</b> inputs the name of the disease to be managed. Next, step <b>438</b> interviews the patient to input data required to conduct Disease Management, including the name of a representative that can speak for the patient, the name and location of the patient's physician, names and telephones emergency facilities near the patient, and so on. Next, step <b>440</b> creates a record for the new patient in the DM registry. Next, step <b>442</b> establishes the patient as a registered DM patient. Next, step <b>444</b> creates a new data record for use by the DMM in the patient's database. Next, step <b>446</b> creates a new data record for session data in the session database. Step <b>446</b> completes the registration of the patient as a new DM patient. After step <b>446</b>, control goes to step <b>448</b>, which creates a new creates a Disease Management Order (DMO) record, in which the cumulative decisions made by the DMM during this DM session are stored. Step <b>448</b> initializes the DMO to indicate that this patient is a newly registered DM patient and needs an initial health assessment. After step <b>448</b>, process <b>404</b> passes control to step <b>450</b>, which returns control to the process that called process <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Continuing now to describe process <b>404</b> at step <b>452</b>. Step <b>452</b> retrieves the patient's medical record from the patient database. After step <b>452</b>, control passes to step <b>454</b>, which loads the last DM session data for this patient from the session database. After step <b>454</b>, control passes to step <b>456</b>, which confirms that the last session terminated normally and sets appropriate control data if it did not. After step <b>456</b>, control passes to step <b>458</b>, which initializes the DMO to indicate that this patient needs a current health assessment in subsequent processing. After step <b>458</b>, control passes to step <b>450</b>, which returns control to the process that called process <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Health Assessment</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the process <b>406</b> will be described. Process <b>406</b> performs the health assessment for the DM session. It is basically a staging process that invokes other processes that perform health assessment of the patient. Process <b>406</b> receives control at start node <b>480</b>. After node <b>480</b>, process <b>406</b> invokes process <b>482</b>, which is named the Significant Symptom Filter and will be described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. When process <b>482</b> returns control, process <b>406</b> passes control to the test <b>484</b>, which tests the DMO record code to determine whether this patient is a new DM registrant or a returning DM patient. For new patients, process <b>406</b> invokes node <b>488</b>, which assesses the health of newly registered patients and will be described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. For current patients, process <b>406</b> invokes node <b>490</b>, which performs the health assessment for returning DM patients and will be described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. After health assessment for new or returning patients is completed, process <b>406</b> returns control at node <b>492</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Significant Symptom Filter</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the process <b>482</b> will be described. Process <b>482</b> applies several tests to the patients current symptoms to classify the patient's current health state, decide on specific assessment needs and their reasons, and forward this assessment to subsequent DM processes. These needs are saved in the patient's DMO, which is then processed by subsequent DMM routines. The DMO record is described later in section Disease Management Order.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Process <b>482</b> receives control at start node <b>510</b>. From there, it passes control to test node <b>512</b>, which represents the first filter by asking the patient whether s/he is having any significant symptoms at present. If the patient is not having significant symptoms, s/he can be assessed by automated means, and therefore process <b>482</b> passes control to step <b>544</b>. Step <b>544</b> which sets the DMO record code to indicate that this patient's health needs to be further assessed by subsequent routines. The control returns via node <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">If, at node <b>512</b>, the patient is currently having significant symptoms, then process <b>482</b> needs to determine whether or not the patient has a symptom related to the disease being managed. To do this, process <b>482</b> passes control first to step <b>514</b>, which inputs the symptom from the patient and looks it up in a table of related symptoms, and next to test <b>516</b>, which branches to node <b>520</b> if the symptom is related to the disease being managed, and branches to node <b>530</b> otherwise. This completes the second filter, which has now identified patients with and without significant related symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">If, at node <b>516</b>, the patient does have a related symptom, process <b>482</b> invokes the Severity Assessment function <b>520</b> to further classify the related symptom as mild or severe. For patients with severe related symptoms, process <b>482</b> passes control to step <b>522</b>, which sets the DMO record to indicate the findings so far. From step <b>522</b>, control returns via node <b>526</b>. But if at test <b>520</b>, the symptom is judged to be mild, then process <b>482</b> passes control to node <b>524</b>, which sets the DMO record to indicate need for normal health assessment. From node <b>524</b>, process <b>482</b> returns control via node <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">If, at node <b>516</b>, the patient does not have a related symptom, process <b>482</b> needs to determine whether or not the patient has a side effect related to the current therapy of the patient. To do this, process <b>482</b> passes control first to step <b>530</b>, which looks up the patient's symptom in a table of side effects of the current therapy. Process <b>482</b> next passes control to test <b>532</b>, which is a filter that determines side effect symptoms. If the patient's symptom is a side effect, process <b>482</b> invokes the Severity Assessment function <b>520</b> to classify the side effect as mild or severe. For mild side effects, process <b>482</b> passes control to node <b>536</b>, which sets the DMO record to be assessed by subsequent processing. For severe side effects, process <b>482</b> passes control first to step <b>534</b>, which marks the DMO record to refer the patient out of the system to a human physician, and then returns to the calling process via node <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">If, at test <b>532</b>, the patient's symptom is not a side effect, the symptom is a significant symptom unrelated to either the disease being managed or to the therapy being applied. Process <b>482</b> invokes the Severity Assessment function <b>520</b> to classify the symptom as mild or severe. For mild symptoms, process <b>482</b> passes control to node <b>542</b>, which sets the DMO record flag to force a special discussion with the patient after all DM processing is performed, and notes the reasons for the discussion. Then process <b>482</b> passes control first to node <b>544</b> which sets the DMO record to force subsequent health assessment and next to node <b>526</b>, which returns to the process that called process <b>482</b>. For severe unrelated symptoms, process <b>482</b> passes control first to step <b>540</b>, which marks the DMO record to refer the patient out of the system to a human physician, and then returns to the calling process via node <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Severity Assessment</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the Severity Assessment function <b>520</b> will be described. This function uses a number of criteria to decide whether a given symptom is to be considered mild or severe for the DM assessment purposes. Function <b>520</b> receives control at start node <b>560</b>, where it begins a sequence of 6 consecutive steps and then returns the computed result. First, function <b>520</b> passes control to node <b>562</b>, which asks the patient to rank the symptom's severity on a scale of 0 to 10. Next, function <b>520</b> passes control to node <b>564</b>, which obtains the absolute severity scale of the symptom itself from the symptoms database. Different symptoms have different severity scales, and the patient's ranking is now matched to that of the symptom. Therefor, next, function <b>520</b> passes control to node <b>566</b>, which normalizes the patient's ranking, so that it is expressed in terms of the symptom's severity scale. Next, function <b>520</b> passes control to node <b>568</b>, which uses the Sensitivity Factor Set to adjust the normalized severity ranking up or down, depending on the current sensitivity setting of the DMM. Thus, the higher the Sensitivity, the more conservative the system is in its assessments. At the lowest Sensitivity setting, all symptoms severity ratings will be considered mild. Next, function <b>520</b> passes control to node <b>570</b>, which converts the final adjusted ranking into 2 classifications, mild or severe. It is important to note that this final step can, in other contexts, classify the final ranking into any number of gradations; but for the current assessment purpose, the symptom must be classified as mild or severe. Next, function <b>520</b> passes control to node <b>572</b>, which returns a code for either “mild” or “severe” to the calling process.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Initial Health Assessment</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the process <b>488</b> will be described. This process performs a health assessment for patients who are having their first Disease Management session. Process <b>488</b> receives control at node <b>600</b>. Process <b>488</b> then passes control to node <b>602</b>, which loads the health assessment specifications for the disease being managed from the disease database. These specifications include various parameters to be used in Disease Management sessions, such as patient instructions, choices of therapies, permissions required, and so on. After these values are obtained, process <b>488</b> passes control to node <b>604</b>, which initializes a DM session segment in the patient's medical history and the sessions database. Then, process <b>488</b> passes control to node <b>606</b>, which conducts an initial health interview to ask the patient for a subjective assessment of current health, for any objective health measurements the patient may have available, any pre-existing therapy or side effects, and so on. Then process <b>488</b> passes control to node <b>608</b>, which returns control to the calling process.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Current Health Assessment</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the process <b>490</b> will be described. This process obtains current health data from the patient in three forms: subjective (i.e. as perceived or felt by the patient), objective (i.e. as measured by the patient, typically with an instrument), and side effects noted by the patient. These health measurements are then used to analyze the current health state. Process <b>490</b> receives control at node <b>620</b>. From node <b>620</b>, process <b>490</b> passes control to test <b>622</b>, which examines the current DMO record of the patient to determine what processing has been done and what needs to be done. If the DMO record code does not indicate that a health assessment is required, process <b>490</b> passes control to node <b>634</b>, which returns control to the calling process. If a health assessment is required, process <b>490</b> passes control to a sequence of 5 steps that obtain various health assessments. First, process <b>490</b> passes control to step <b>624</b>, which asks the patient for a subjective assessment of the patient's current health state.

<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Critical Curve Assessment</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Critical Curve Assessment is a DMM process for monitoring patient health for significant deterioration. A critical curve is defined as a plot of a health measurement against time that is used to identify significant changes in health state. The Critical Curve Assessment process selects a disease- and patient-specific health parameter, plots it as a critical curve, updates the critical curve as a normal part of continuing DM sessions, and takes specific action if the patient's critical curve exhibits specific critical points, slopes, and slope trends. The process is based on comparing the patient's critical curve to standard, disease-specific critical curves. A constant, high ordinate value indicates good health; a declining curve indicates declining health; a sharp drop in the curve indicates a health crisis. The “critical point” on the curve is a point that predicts a significant decline in health.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">An example of a generic critical curve is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, which contains a point circled as the “critical point”. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, it will be noted that, at the critical point, the slope of the curve (i.e. the line tangent to the curve at the critical point) is sharply negative, which predicts that the next health measurement will be lower than the critical point. Moreover, at the critical point, the rate of slope change may also be negative, indicating that the slope of the curve is decreasing even more, predicts a rapidly deteriorating health state. For brevity, these three critical test items are typically referred to in the DMM processes as the critical point, slope, and trend. They are calculated using the last three health measurement points. For critical curves with sufficient data points, curve fitting techniques can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The DMM has a database of diseases <b>262</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that contain standard critical curves for various diseases, patient populations, and health parameters. The Critical Curve Assessment process extracts the appropriate disease data set, selects an appropriate health parameter to be used, adapts it for the current patient, and saves it as the standard curve for the current patient in the patient's medical history <b>254</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As the DMM periodically dialogs with the patient, the Critical Curve Assessment process obtains current data from the patient, plots them on the patient's critical curve, and uses curve-fitting and pattern matching techniques to compare the patient's actual CC to the patient's standard CC. This comparison enables the DMM to detect key points and trends on the patient's curve, such as the “critical point” that predicts a significant impending health decline. When the curve approaches this critical point, the Critical Curve Assessment method orders alterations in therapy that will prevent the predicted deterioration, or sets a flag to refer the patient to a health care provider. Both objective and subjective health data are used to plot the CC, especially if the Subjective-Objective Correlation Factor (SOCF) is high (which means that the patient knows his/her disease process well and the DMM can rely on the patient's responses more and more).</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Homeostasis</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The concept of homeostasis, as described by Claude Bernard, is helpful in understanding the concepts behind the Critical Curve and its analysis. Briefly, homeostasis is a state of dynamic equilibrium of the body. This equilibrium is maintained by various internal control mechanisms that force certain system parameters to remain within a desired range. Using these homeostatic mechanisms, the body is able to tolerate disease up to a certain point, at which time progression of the disease begins to accelerate. Good examples of this are:</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">the bicarbonate buffering system for maintenance of blood pH,</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">the oxyhemoglobin disassociation curve, and</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">the deterioration of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">The Critical Curve</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The Critical Curve (CC) describes the patient's health state during a bout with disease. The curve plots the patient's health state against time, starting initially at a (high) normal state of health and descending—as the disease progresses—to a lower state of health.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A normal, disease-free patient will have a fairly steady plot at a high level of health. The initial part of the curve is asymptotic to normal health because the healthy body can often resist disease for some time by using reserve capacities and internal defense mechanisms. After the initial phase, the health curve begins to descend at a steeper and steeper angle, as reserves are used up and the disease is established and produces secondary effects. At some critical point, the curve steepens so dramatically that the patient's condition may deteriorate quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Many physiologic parameters have a characteristic response to change, being able to compensate up to a point, and then responding with very large changes in signal findings to small changes in the progression of the disease. It is very important to know where the patient is on the Critical Curve, because if the expression of the disease in this patient is about to accelerate significant intervention is required. When there is an indication or even a suspicion that the patient's condition is approaching the steep area of the health curve, the DMM can recommend a change in therapy or consultation with the patient's health caregiver. If confirmation of the change of the health state is required, the DMM reenter feature allows the DMM system to confirm its hypothesis before making recommendations.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Critical Curve Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">For a patient with a known disease, who is managing the disease at home with suitable maintenance therapy, the DMM monitors the patient's periodic contacts and health state reports. When the trend line indicates that the patient's health curve is reaching the critical point, the DMM can change the therapy and/or notify the patient's physician. Since patients can go for months successfully managing their disease, this Curve analysis approach can save a significant number of unnecessary physician visits, yet inform the physician and the patient at once when a change in health state indicates that the critical point is being approached.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Obviously, it is best to use an easily quantifiable parameter as a marker for the progression of the disease in question to embody this curve, but if the subjective-objective correlation is high in a given patient, their subjective evaluation can accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The system measures the tidal volume and peak flow rates over time. If it is found that small changes in tidal volume make large differences in the patient's impression of the severity of their disease (compared to the changes made previously in this patient), the patient is on the steep part of the curve. A flag is set and significant intervention is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">If the therapeutic alteration permission level is set low, then the patient is referred to his physician, and the patient's doctor receives a report, frequently a fax, email or downloads about the new developments. If the therapeutic alteration level is set high, then therapeutic optimization may occur before the patient sees his physician. A report is sent to the physician and the patient may or may not have to be seen. It is this analysis and the recognition of this relationship that constitutes the “curve” analysis of the health state.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">We will discuss chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as an example. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease slowly destroys lung tissue. As mentioned, many physiologic parameters have the same response to changes, being able to compensate up to a point, and then, after that reserve capacity is gone, very small changes in the disease state produce very large changes in the expression of the progression of the disease in the patient its early phase, the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease loses only reserve lung capacity, so there is no significant change in the resting health state. After the reserve tissue has been destroyed, a threshold is reached beyond which smaller and smaller time increments (and progression of the disease process) will produce more and more profound deterioration in the patient's ability to blow off carbon dioxide and oxygenate the blood. Ultimately, even a very small change in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease results in respiratory failure.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">When we start to see larger and larger decrements to pulmonary function plotted against time, the patient is reaching the critical part of the curve. Significant intervention is necessary and should be started as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The Critical Curve Assessment process is especially effective in the DMM setting because the DMM:

The first phase (starting at node <b>702</b>) updates the patient's critical curve with health measurements added to the patient's medical history since the last critical curve assessment. The second phase (starting at node <b>712</b>) compares the patient's actual critical curve to the standard critical curve used for this patient. If a patient is at (or is approaching) a critical part of the curve, this suggests the possibility of rapid deterioration of the disease being managed, and the patient is referred to a human physician for consultation.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0178">Process <b>640</b> receives control at start node <b>700</b>.

Next process <b>640</b> passes control to step <b>706</b>, which saves the patient's critical curve data in the patient medical history. Next, process <b>640</b> passes control to test <b>708</b>, which examines the DMO record code to see whether the patient's critical points should be assessed. If the patient's critical points should not be assessed, process <b>640</b> passes control to terminal node <b>710</b>, which returns control to the calling process.

<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Therapy Optimization</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0182">Therapy Optimization consists of a set of processes that review and adjust patient therapy from session to session, with a long-term goal of maximizing efficacy, minimizing adverse side effects, and maintain patient cooperation and acceptance of the recommended therapy. The Therapy Optimization processes select therapy parameters from medical treatment tables and track patient-specific efficacy by reviewing subjective and objective patient health data from session to session. The Therapy Optimization process selects from multiple therapies. It seeks to minimize side effects by offering the patient the choice of alternate therapies, and by adjusting therapy dosage levels until the patient finds the appropriate comfort level. Disagreements between the DMM and the patient are resolved by referring the patient to a human physician for face-to-face consultation and advice. Therapy Optimization is guided and controlled by the Therapy Optimization Permission Level (TAPL), a DMM-global variable that specifies the amount of autonomy that the DMM has to alter therapy. The TAPL is described in a separate section below.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0183">After the patient health state has been assessed, the Therapy Optimization process reviews and adjusts (to the extent the TAPL allows it) the patient's treatment to achieve the best combination of several subgoals of the overall goal of restoring normal health. The Therapy Optimization process also seeks to minimize treatment side effects. To the extent allowed by the current TAPL setting, the DMM will gradually titrate the dose of a medication until the benefit/side effect ratio is maximized. The overall idea is to achieve the desired physiological changes with the fewest side effects. Initial treatment is selected from a treatment table based on disease, age, and sex. Due to the wide range of responses to treatments by different patients, once a drug has been selected as the therapy for a given disease, the different formulation, dosing, administering methods and timing are, in effect, a matter of trial and error for a specific patient. To review therapy, the Therapy Optimization task compares the patient's current therapy to the treatment table to detect and analyze differences. If a new treatment is available, the patient and the healthcare giver are notified, and the therapy may be altered, depending on the TAPL. To maximize the therapeutic result and minimize side effects, the Function can select the initial therapy, review the patient's current therapy, adjust various parameters of the therapy, and monitor the effect of these changes. Therapy parameters that can be changed include drug class, type, brand, dose, route, mode of drug administration, formulation, timing, and frequency. As each of these is modified, the patient's health data and side effects are checked to see if the current modification of therapy makes the patient better, and so on. Each therapy parameter is sequentially altered on a trial and error basis to find the overall best combination of therapy parameters. When the DMM adjusts a patient's therapy, it adjusts the DM session schedule appropriately, typically instructing the patient to re-enter the system within a few iterations of therapy or dosage.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0184">Side effect minimization is a special goal of the Therapy Optimization process, which seeks to reduce the undesirable side effects of therapy. This task illustrates the complex, trial-and-error methods used by the DMM to Therapy Optimization feature. Example 1: In cancer patients there is a point at which patients receiving chemotherapy decide that the side effects are not worth the slowing of the progression of the disease. At that point, one “backs off” (decreases the dosage), knowing that any further increase will be futile. The process becomes more complicated if multiple drugs are involved, but the same relationships hold. Example 2: Albuterol-metered dose inhalers help the wheezing of asthma patients, but at a certain patient-specific dose, the side effects get so bad, that the patient cannot tolerate them. At that point, the dosage is backed off in small steps to get the best ratio of efficacy to side effects.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0185">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the Therapy Optimization process <b>408</b> will be described. Process <b>408</b> performs the therapy phase of the DM session. This phase computes the next best therapy step that is accepted by the patient, using two major subordinate processes and a loop that tries various therapies until the patient accepts one. The general goal of process <b>408</b> is to select therapy steps in a manner that optimizes therapy over the long term, by maximizing efficacy, minimizing side effects, and adjusting therapy types and modalities to meet the patient's comfort level. Process <b>408</b> receives control at start node <b>760</b>. Then, process <b>408</b> passes control to test <b>762</b>, which tests whether the patient provided current objective health measurements during the earlier part of this DM session. If test <b>762</b> finds that the patient did not provide current objective health data, process <b>408</b> passes control to test <b>782</b>, which tests whether the patient entered a subjective assessment of his/her health during the earlier part of the DM session. If test <b>782</b> finds that the patient provided a subjective health assessment, process <b>408</b> invokes process <b>790</b>. Process <b>790</b> adjusts the therapy based on current subjective health data. Process <b>790</b> is detailed below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.

Then, process <b>408</b> passes control to terminal node <b>786</b>, which returns control to the calling process.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0186">If test <b>762</b> finds that the patient did provide current objective health data, process <b>408</b> passes control to step <b>764</b>, which initializes a loop that will try various therapies until the patient accepts one or until the number of retries is exhausted, whichever occurs first. Step <b>764</b> obtains the maximum number of therapy permitted from the permissions database for this patient. Then, process <b>408</b> invokes process <b>770</b>. Process <b>770</b> selects the next best therapy from the treatment table for this patient and offers it to the patient who can accept or modify or reject it.

Step <b>776</b> reduces the loop retry count by 1 and then process <b>408</b> invokes process <b>770</b> again for another iteration of the loop. If test <b>774</b> determines that the retry count is 1, then process <b>408</b> passes control to step <b>778</b>. Step <b>778</b> sets the DMO record to refer the patient to a human physician for consultation.

<p id="h-0029" num="0000">Close Session</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0206">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the Close Session process <b>410</b> will be described. Process <b>410</b> is the last process executed for every DM session. It is specifically responsible for processing the Disease Management Order (DMO), which contains the complete set of tests made and reasons therefore, the next therapy step recommended, consent given by the patient, and various associated orders, such as to fax a prescription to the patient's pharmacy, to order a test from a laboratory, to prepare a report for the patient's physician, to send printed instructions to the patient, and so on. Aside from implementing the DMO details, process <b>410</b> is also generally responsible for logging all events that occurred during the DM session, storing all relevant data, closing all applicable files, scheduling the next DM session, and finally bidding the patient farewell to indicate that the current DM session is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0207">Process <b>410</b> receives control at start node <b>950</b>. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to test <b>952</b>, which logs the therapy ordered by the DMO in the patient's medical history. Then process <b>410</b> passes control to test <b>954</b>, which determines whether the DMO contains special orders to be processed. If test <b>954</b> determines that the DMO has no special therapy orders, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>972</b>, which schedules the next DM session as specified in the current therapy schedule of the patient. Then, process <b>410</b> passes control to node <b>962</b>. Processing from node <b>962</b> is described below for process <b>410</b>. If test <b>954</b> determines that the DMO has special orders, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>956</b>, which schedules the next DM session as ordered by the DMO. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>958</b>, which prepares and sends various notices and reports to various contacts. These notifications and the contacts that receive them are controlled by the Regulatory, Sharing, and other authorization fields that are maintained in the Permissions database. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>960</b>, which informs the patient about the next therapy step and gives the patient instructions as ordered by the DMO and as permitted by the Permissions database. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>962</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0208">Step <b>962</b> informs the patient's physician about the DM session and about the therapy ordered by the DMM. While the patient's physician is always entitled to all information generated for the patient, the physician may specify the notices sent and the detail reported. The physician's current requirements and limitations for notification are stored in the permissions database, and may be modified by the physician using processes outside of the DMM. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>964</b>, which informs the patient about the actions taken by the DMM software, to the extent permitted in the Permissions database. This step allows the system to tell the patient what it is doing and why, which can gain the patient's confidence and help the patient to make better decisions in future sessions. This feedback is an important element of the long-term therapy optimization that is one of the hallmarks of this invention. Step <b>964</b> also reviews all special flags set to discuss new symptoms with the patient. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>966</b>, which saves all relevant data in various suitable main and backup storage locations. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to step <b>968</b>, which closes all applicable data files and releases all temporary computing system resources allocated to the DM session. Next, process <b>410</b> passes control to terminal node <b>970</b>, which returns control to the calling process.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Question Versions</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0209">The Question Versions feature of the DMM allows several different versions of the same question to be written into a script, and defers the decision which version to use until run-time. The feature uses a global data item called the Question Version Index (QVI) to select the desired version of the question from the script at run time.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0210">The Question Version feature can be visualized as a “Question Roller”: a multifaceted cylinder with one different version of the question written on each face. To ask a question, the cylinder is rolled to display the face that contains the desired question text. If each question of a set is written on a separate cylinder, and all cylinders are rolled in unison to display the same face, as specified by a global control element, the entire question set of the script can be adjusted or “rolled” as one unit, so that the script as a whole can be adjusted or fine-tuned to ask different versions of the question at different levels.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0211">One use of the Question Versions feature is to be able to globally adjust the sensitivity and selectivity of the language used by the entire DMM, using a DMM-global QVI that controls the linguistic sensitivity. Thus, when the sensitivity or selectivity of questions needs to be altered, the Question Roller is turned or ratcheted one way to increase the sensitivity and the opposite way to increase the selectivity. For this use, each question version differs only slightly in wording and sensitivity. In some cases, the only difference is a comma (a pause) or an intonation of the voice, such as:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0212">Is this absolutely the worst headache that you can imagine anyone having?</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0213">Is this the worst headache that you can imagine anyone having?</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0214">Is this the worst headache you have ever had?</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0215">Is this one of your worst headaches?</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0216">Another use of the Question Version feature is to write script questions aimed at different levels of patient education, intelligence, disease understanding, or medical expertise. For example, the DMM can ask the same question in various forms written for a 3rd grader, for a high school student, for a college graduate, or for a health care provider. Thus, the DMM can adapt output to the patient's communication needs, which may involve a range of decisions based on what is currently known about the patient, such as what natural language to use, what the level of understanding is, what grammar to use (e.g., are we addressing the patient, the patient's relative, or the patient's doctor?), and what medical details to disclose. The DMM can consult the patient's medical history to determine the level of the language, education, and intelligence that the patient can understand. If no indicator is present, a mini language IQ test can be given as part of the Initial Health Assessment task to establish the QVI to use with the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0217">Yet another use of the Question Version feature is to allow the DMM to adjust the question level dynamically, based on the patient responses or requests. Thus, a patient who is getting confused or lost may ask the DMM to give more detailed instructions on how to respond to questions. The DMM can react by altering the QVI to select more appropriate question versions. On the other hand, as the patient learns during a session, s/he may later request fewer instructions and a faster communications mode. Again, the DMM can respond by adjusting the QVI. In this manner, the DMM learns about the patient's current and past use of the DMM and can modify itself to adapt to the patient's natural language, education, medical knowledge, and medical sensitivity required.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0218">The Question Version feature is implemented in software by allowing script authors to collect different versions of a question into a “version group,” in which each version of the question is associated with a different QVI. At run-time, the DMM uses the Sensitivity Factor Set to establish a global QVI to specify the current question version to be used with the current patient by all scripts. When a DMM process (such as the script engine) needs to output a question, it uses the global QVI to find and retrieve the desired question from the script's question group. Questions that do not require different versions are written as a version group with only one question, which acts as the default question. This default question is also used when there is no question in the version group for the current global QVI.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0219">This Question Version design allows questions versions to be written for a wide range of QVIs, without having to write a version for each QVI. A simple script can just have one question version; as the script improves, additional question versions are added. For example, the first script might be written in English, and later upgraded to add Spanish versions of each question.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0220">The Question Version feature is implemented in the form of a Question Version Index and two separate functions Set QVI and Select Question. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b</i>, these elements are shown as follows:

<p id="p-0212" num="0225">Process <b>1000</b> is a DMM-global system service routine that sets and updates data element <b>1020</b> periodically.

<p id="h-0031" num="0000">Preview Mode</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0227">Preview Mode is a DMM script run-time mode that allows the patient to “look ahead,” that is to examine the consequences of a response before “officially” giving the response. In effect, the patient can say—at any point in a script—“let me see what this answer would do”. One use of Preview Mode is to let the patient suspend an ongoing dialog to see what a pending question means. Knowing the consequences of a response is helpful in clarifying the impact or focus of a question. Thus, in a printed flowchart or procedure, one good way to find the best path is to look ahead to see what the consequences (or recommendations) would be of answering a question a certain way. Another uses of Preview Mode is to let the script explicitly warn the patient that a particular question involves serious consequences, and to use Preview Mode so that the patient can consider the effect of each response. For example, one response may begin action to contact the patient's physician, or to transfer the patient to an emergency facility. If the script can warn the patient about this consequence, the patient can preview these responses without activating them, and can alter the direction of the script dialog.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0228">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the process <b>1060</b> will be described. This process shows only those steps of a DM session that handle the Preview Mode feature, which is involved in the steps that ask the patient a question and process the response. Other steps of a DM session that are not concerned with the Preview Mode are omitted for clarity. Process <b>1060</b> receives control at start node <b>1062</b>. Then process <b>1060</b> passes control to test <b>1064</b>. If test <b>1064</b> determines that there are no further questions to be asked, process <b>1060</b> passes control to terminal node <b>1066</b>, which terminates the Preview Mode. If test <b>1064</b> determines that is a question to be asked, process <b>1060</b> passes control to step <b>1068</b>, which outputs the question to the patient. Then process <b>1060</b> passes control to step <b>1070</b>, which outputs the set of responses to the patient. Then process <b>1060</b> passes control to step <b>1072</b>, which inputs a response from the patient, together with an indicator that the patient does or does not want to preview the script's actions for this response. Then process <b>1060</b> passes control to test <b>1074</b>. If test <b>1074</b> determines that the patient has responded with the preview indicator set, process <b>1060</b> passes control to step <b>1076</b>. Step <b>1076</b> retrieves the preview information that is coded into the script (as part of the normal question and response texts) and outputs it to the patient, so that the patient sees or hears a description of what the selected response would do in “real” mode. For example, a preview text might tell the patient that “A YES response will increase your daily medication dose for the next 2 weeks”. After the preview text is output to the patient, process <b>1060</b> passes control to step <b>1068</b>, which asks the same question again, as described above for step <b>1068</b>. But if test <b>1074</b> determines that the patient has responded without the preview indicator, process <b>1060</b> passes control to step <b>1078</b>. Step <b>1078</b> performs the actions normally scripted for the response given. Then process <b>1060</b> passes control to test <b>1064</b>, which determines whether there is a next question to be asked, as described above for test <b>1064</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">No-Response Feature</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0229">Every DMM dialog with a patient is controlled by a script. During a normal session, the script selects a question and outputs it to the patient, and the patient inputs a response. The script analyzes the response, selects another question, and outputs it to the patient. This question-response-question-response dialog continues until the session is terminated normally. However, when a patient unexpectedly fails to respond in the middle of the dialog, all scripts are designed to invoke the No-Response (NR) feature, which is responsible for taking appropriate continuation action for the script. The NR feature is a DMM software mechanism that is triggered when a timeout condition is signaled by the operating system. The NR mechanism can take any number of actions that have been pre-arranged by the script and can be changed as the script runs. The NR actions can range from a silent entry in the DM sessions log all the way to using health data from the patient medical history and medication and symptom data from the disease database to contact a responsible neighbor of the patient, or a nearby emergency response facility.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0230">One use of the NR feature is to perform a medical disease- and patient-specific evaluation of the failure of the patient to respond. Obviously, in certain patients with certain diseases (e.g. heart problems, head injury, diabetes) the patient's sudden failure to respond in the middle of a normal dialog may indicate any number of possibilities. The NR feature is of special value in the context of the DMM, which has detailed medical information about a patient from previous sessions, and in the context of the First Opinion Support System, which has extensive relevant databases indexed by geographic location around the world (e.g., emergency rooms, 911 agencies, paramedics). Because of what the system knows about a patient, the NR feature can take very situation-specific actions. A very simple example would be a 60-year old man consulting for chest pain: sudden failure to respond to a question would suggest a cardiac arrest and could initiate emergency actions, including calling the patient's local 911 agency.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0231">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the process <b>1100</b> is described. Note that process <b>1100</b> shows only those portions of a script's steps that are relevant to the No-Response Feature. Other steps of the scripts are omitted for clarity. Process <b>1100</b> receives control at start node <b>1102</b>, which represents the generic start node of any script. Then process <b>1100</b> passes control to step group <b>1104</b>. Step group <b>1104</b> represents all of the script's actions that do not involve the NR Feature. If the script terminates as part of one of these steps, process <b>1100</b> passes control to terminating node <b>1106</b>, which terminates the script. When one of the steps in step group <b>1104</b> wants to ask a question of the patient, process <b>1100</b> passes control to step <b>1108</b>. Step <b>1108</b> sets up the NR parameters needed later, if the patient should fail to respond. The source of these parameters is the patient's medical history <b>254</b>, which contains the relevant information to be used if the patient fails to respond, such as the patient's disease, health state, medications being taken, physician, nearest emergency facility, and so on. Step <b>1108</b> stores the NR parameters as a data set <b>264</b>. Then process <b>1100</b> passes control to step <b>1112</b>, which outputs the actual question to the patient. Then process <b>1100</b> passes control to test <b>1114</b>. Details of step <b>1114</b> vary with operating system and hardware platform, but the typical action is to set a timeout flag for a specified wait time, yield control to the operating system, and regain control when the operating system returns a response or the wait time has expired. If test <b>1114</b> receives a response, process <b>1100</b> passes control to step group <b>1104</b>, where the normal script's actions continue. If test <b>1114</b> receives a timeout, process <b>1100</b> passes control to step <b>1116</b>. Step <b>1116</b> retrieves the patient-, disease-, and location-specific NR data from the data sets <b>264</b> and <b>254</b> and performs the NR actions requested. When step <b>1116</b> has performed the NR actions, process <b>1100</b> passes control to terminal node <b>1116</b>, which represents the generic termination of a script due to a timeout.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">PQRST Array</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0232">Sir Thomas Lewis said that pain is “known to us by experience and described by illustration”. The ability to encode the subjective experience of pain into a standard and repeatable format is an essential asset to any system of automated medicine. Many diagnostic sessions begin with a patient reporting some type of pain to a physician in the form of a chief complaint; a thorough description of pain can quickly suggest as well as eliminate many diagnoses, using a table lookup or database access mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0233">The PQRST Array feature describes a set of software processes and data that work together to encode a patient's description of pain into a “pain code”, which is a specially formatted array of integers. Encoding is done in a manner that preserves the subjective information, so that it is possible to decode a pain code by using the array integers to recover the original words used to describe the pain.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0234">A pain code is composed of subcodes; each subcode identifies one well-defined detail aspect of the experience of pain such as location, sensation, frequency, etc. The pain subcodes are arranged into a specific sequence or format that is known to all software processes that manipulate the pain code. The sequence used to encode the aspects is itself prefixed as a number to the sequence, so that so that the first aspect of the array always identifies the coding scheme that is used for the array. This makes the PQRST Array flexible and extensible, since various encoding schemes can be used to meet various needs. Any software process that needs to decode a PQRST in the future simply examines the first aspect code and knows from its value which decoding scheme to use for the rest of the aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0235">The PQRST Array feature permits encoding of a patient's report of pain into digital form that is suitable for software processes. For example, a patient's complaint that “when I bend my right arm or rotate my wrist, even slightly, the elbow area hurts really bad, with a sort of gritty or grinding sound, but there is no bleeding” may be encoded by letting the patient select from standard descriptor words (e.g. gritty, tight, numb) and converting the selected words into an integer array something like (7,2,3,8,5,970612,2,13). This array represents the numeric value of various aspects of pain such as location, repeatability, quality, or a date such as 970612. For any given aspect, the number represents some degree or description of the pain. Thus, if the fourth aspect number represents Sounds-Associated-With-Movement, the subcode value 8 may represent “gritty/grinding noise associated with joint movement”.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0236">The “PQRST” label is adapted from the classic mnemonic used by medical students for the basic aspects of pain, which are: P=Provocative/Palliative (what brings it on, makes it worse, or makes it better); Q=Quality (sharp or dull); R=Region (head or chest, etc.); S=Severity (mild to agonizing); and T=Timing (when the pain started). These aspects represent a starting point for the PQRST Array, which is extensible to include other useful subjective descriptors of illness, with many additional aspects associated with the pain such as Cause (infection, trauma), Mass (mole, lump), Size (fingertip, golf ball), Sensation (tickling, pulsing) and objective associations (color, smell, discharge).</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0253">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref><i>a</i>, the process <b>1140</b> will be described. Process <b>1140</b> comprises the steps required to create a PQRST Array that represents the digitized form of a patient's subjective description of pain. Process <b>1140</b> is described here assuming that the patient is on-line and can interactively enter subjective pain description details when prompted by process <b>1140</b>. Process <b>1140</b> receives control from a calling process at start step <b>1142</b>. Step <b>1142</b> is the beginning of a loop that encodes pain aspects entered by the patient into a matching set of pain subcodes. Step <b>1142</b> allocates space for a PQRST Array that will contain the subcodes. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1144</b>, which establishes the next pain aspect to be encoded. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1146</b>, which retrieve a list of standard aspect words from database <b>1150</b> and outputs them to the patient in a format of a pick list, i.e. a list that the patient can examine and from which the patient can pick one of the aspect words. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1152</b>, which asks the patient to select the aspect word from the pick list that best matches the patient's subjective description of the pain aspect being encoded. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1154</b>, which converts the aspect word selected by the patient into an integer that identifies that aspect word. This integer is the subcode for the current aspect. It can be simply the index position of the selected aspect word in the pick list. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1156</b>, which inserts the subcode integer into the PQRST Array, at the index position that represents the aspect being encoded. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to test <b>1158</b>, which determines whether more aspects are to be encoded. If test <b>1158</b> finds that there are more aspects to be encoded, then process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1144</b> to begin another iteration of the loop just described. If test <b>1158</b> finds that there are no more aspects to be encoded, then process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1160</b>, which stores or copies the PQRST Array into the appropriate data set, such as the patient's medical history <b>254</b>. Next, process <b>1140</b> passes control to step <b>1162</b>. Step <b>1162</b> returns control to the calling process.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0254">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref><i>b</i>, the process <b>1170</b> will be described. Process <b>1170</b> is an example of the steps required to use a PQRST Array as an index to retrieve a specific diagnosis from a table of diseases. This example assumes that a list of diseases (or disease sets, where there is more than one disease for a given pain code) has been indexed by pain code and stored into a database of diseases <b>262</b>. This example also assumes that there is a software process for accessing the database that can retrieve elements of the database when given an access key. One obvious example of such a database access mechanism is a suitably formatted Structured Query Language (SQL) statement; another example is a simple array of disease names or pointer that is accessed using the index position of each element. Process <b>1170</b> receives control at start node <b>1172</b>. Then process <b>1170</b> passes control to step <b>1174</b>, which loads a copy of the PQRST Array to be used to select the diagnosis from database <b>262</b>. Next, process <b>1170</b> passes control to step <b>1176</b>, which converts the DMM pain code into an access key that is formatted as required by the process that accesses database <b>262</b>. Next, process <b>1170</b> passes control to step <b>1178</b>, which uses the access key to retrieve the record matching the pain code from database <b>262</b>. Next, process <b>1170</b> passes control to terminal node <b>1180</b>, which returns control to the calling process.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Disease Management Order (DMO)</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0255">The Disease Management Order is a data record that is attached to the patient at the beginning of a DM session, travels with the patient from process to process, and is used at the end of the session (by the Close Sessions process) to implement the decisions and orders issued by the various processes during the session. The DMO record contains numerous fields and is stored in the sessions area of the DM-specific databases <b>264</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). One key field of the DMO, named Code, typically contains the next processing to be performed for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0256">One use for the DMO is to signal special processing required for a patient. For example, to flag a new patient for a one-time requirement to conduct an initial interview, the Open Session process sets the DMO Code field to “assess initial health” (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, node <b>448</b>). The DM session process then continues into Health Assessment, which examines the DMO Code and shunts the patient into the Initial Health Assessment process <b>488</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0257">Another use for the DMO is to repeat processes as needed. For example, if the Correlation Assessment process requires additional health data for the interval between session, it can invoke Health Assessment again to obtain missing data (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, node <b>660</b>). When the process has enough data, it sets the DMO Code to “optimize therapy” and the patient is shunted out of the assessment cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0258">Another use of the DMO is to track various reasons for decisions made, which can be used by the Close Sessions process to issue detailed reports of what the DM processes learned about the patient. For example, the Therapy Adjustment processes can refer the patient to a physician for different reasons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, nodes <b>778</b> and <b>784</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, nodes <b>832</b>,<b>854</b>). In each case, the DMO code is set to “refer to MD”, but the DMO Reason field is set to indicate a different reason.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0259">Finally, the key use of the DMO is to represent “doctor's orders”, i.e. to accumulate all of the orders issued during the session, so that they can be implemented when the session is terminated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, node <b>956</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">Permissions Database</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0260">The Permissions Database <b>256</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is a collection of all of the software elements that control access to DMM data and actions taken by DMM processes. This database supports the DMM safety, security, reliability, control, and management features in the form of passwords, access rights, need-to-know and right-to-know clearances, disclosure authorizations, consents, constraints, limits, thresholds, and so on. The Permissions Database is the interface through which a human staff of medical and software experts can specify and control what automatic actions the DMM can and cannot perform. Since permissions govern the actions of all DMM processes, the Permissions Database can be used to dynamically configure the system to run in various modes, ranging from fully automatic to totally non-automatic, where the DMM has to ask permission for every detail step to be taken. The latter mode is especially useful for experimental, test, problem tracking, or system auditing uses.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0261">Three tables of the Permissions Database are relevant to the operation of the DMM processes described above; they are described under their respective section headings below: Regulatory Permissions, Sharing Permissions, and Therapy Alteration Permission Level (TAPL).</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Regulatory Permissions</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0262">Regulatory Permissions are data sets that insure compliance of the DMM with all applicable regulatory, licensing, and legal requirements and restrictions of the many jurisdictions in which it operates. The Regulatory Permission data sets are organized by jurisdiction, and specify for each jurisdiction which data fields can be disclosed to what agency. The Regulatory Permissions feature addresses a very complex issue that is typically ignored by other automated medical systems, namely that such systems may be deemed to be practicing medicine in and across controlling jurisdictions, even across international borders, and must therefore meet a large number of various medical practice constrains and licensing regulations. This feature allows the DMM to comply with the law in its actions and in its contacts with patients, physicians, health care management organizations, government agencies, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0263">Regulatory Permissions are DMM-global, and can be used wherever they are applicable. One example is in the Close Session process (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, nodes <b>958</b>-<b>964</b>) which must consider the legal requirements and prohibitions regarding disclosure of confidential medical data before distributing notices, instructions, and reports about the DM session or the patient.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">Sharing Permissions</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0264">Sharing Permissions are used to manage disclosure of individual medical data items. Every data field in the patient medical history is associated with an access control field that specifies whether or not the medical data item can be disclosed to the patient, to various agents or agencies, and to other software objects with specific access authorizations. Sharing Permissions are used by the DMM Close Session process (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, nodes <b>958</b>, <b>960</b>) to decide what medical data items can be disclosed (i.e. “shared”). in its messages and reports to patients, patient agents, physicians, laboratories, pharmacies, health care management organizations, or government agencies.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0265">Another use of Sharing Permissions is to prevent a diagnosis from being disclosed to the patient under circumstances when it would be inappropriate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, node <b>964</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Therapy Alteration Permission Level (TAPL)</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0266">The Therapy Alteration Permission Level (TAPL) is a data set that specifies the various levels of authority the DMM has to change patient therapy. The TAPL defines the degree of autonomy that the DMM has to manage a patient's disease without prior human approval. Whenever a patient medical history data item is requested by (say) a government agency or an insurance company, the DMM consults the access control field of that data item to see which sharing permission level is required for it. Then the DMM consults the Permissions database to verify that the requesting agency has access permission at the specified level.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0267">At its most restrictive level, the TAPL requires DMM to notify a physician whenever the DMM determines that the patient could benefit from a change in therapy, and to obtain permission before adjusting therapy in any way. The least restrictive TAPL setting allows the DMM to automatically change a patient's treatment without human intervention. TAPL settings between these extremes require various degrees of prior notification and approval for different therapeutic interventions. The TAPL is used by all DMM functions that change patient therapy or give advice to that effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, node <b>830</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, node <b>896</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">Meta Structures</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">Meta Data Array</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0268">For the purpose of discussing the medical management system meta functions, a system data structure used to record, track, analyze, and report medical problems can best be visualized as a two-dimensional grid or array called the Meta Data Array. This array lists the causes of disease (e.g., trauma, infection, allergy) along one dimension (the abscissa or x-axis) labeled as CAUSE and lists the anatomic systems or organs affected by disease (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous) along a second dimension (the ordinate or y-axis) labeled as ANATOMY. A given disease can then be seen as the cell in the Meta Data Array that is at the intersection of the applicable Cause and Anatomy dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0269">In implementation, both the Cause and Anatomy axes are, of course, extensively subdivided. Thus, for example, the infection cause is subdivided into bacterial and viral; bacterial is broken down into gram positive and gram negative; gram positive is further broken down into streptococcus, and so on, to the point where the system can identify ultimate causes such as “meningococcal gram negative bacterial infection.”</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0270">The Anatomy dimension can obviously also be subdivided into organ structures, organs, tissues, cells, and so forth.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Meta Data Cube</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0271">As the medical management system has more contacts with a given patient, the additional patient data extends the Meta Data Array along a time dimension to form a Meta Data Cube. The time axis is also referred to as the “Z” axis.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0272">The Meta Data Cube is an internal data structure that supports various meta functions. The details vary, depending on which medical system module is performing which type of meta analysis, but all of the following examples apply:

Meta Functions

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0279">Meta Functions are medically-oriented software objects that operate at a global level of the entire medical management system and its various modules. They observe, record, track, and analyze patient interactions with the system to:</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0280">evaluate a patient's use of the system,</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0281">look for patterns or relationships that may signify a problem,</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0282">“step back” to look at the patient's overall interaction with the system,</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0283">analyze a patient's current session in the context of past sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0284">Meta Functions automate that aspect of the human physician that sees a patient as a total, complex bio-mechanism that is malfunctioning and requires corrective measures over a time span. They give the DMM the powerful ability to analyze patient health as a whole, to develop long-term medical diagnoses, therapies, advice, and management strategies.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0285">The Frequency Meta Function uses the Sequential Summing Meta Function to analyze the frequency of consultations regarding the same disease. The Anatomic Meta Function analyzes patient complaints based on the anatomic organ system involved. The Cause-Effect Chaining Meta Function traces a disease back to its cause(s) and then forward to other disease(s). The Area Meta Function and the Volumetric Meta Function analyze changes in disease parameters over time. The Critical Curve Meta Function monitors patient health for significant deterioration by comparing it to a standard curve for the disease being managed. The Interval Meta evaluates the time intervals between consultations for the same disease. The Reliability Meta assesses the probability of data reliability and integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0286">The Meta Functions described for disease management use the same “Meta Data Cube” data structure described in Applicant's patent entitled “Computerized Medical Diagnostic and Treatment Advice System,” U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,176. However, since DM has different objectives, it examines different data elements of the cube along different axes.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0287">The word “meta” refers to the overall nature of these functions, which focus on manipulating health data not at a detailed level but at a level of long-term time trends, global patterns, statistical distributions, and other summary relationships. The word “function” here refers to the various computational and analytical techniques used, which employ classic and fuzzy logic, arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, analytical geometry, calculus, statistics, probability, domain mappings, transforms (Laplace, Fourier), heuristics, recursion, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0288">Meta functions are implemented and embodied in the form of suitable data and process structures such as databases, tables, arrays, modules, objects, scripts, lists, subroutines, procedures, functions, and so on.</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">A. Sequential Summing Meta</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0289">The Sequential Summing (SS) Meta function detects and integrates the effect of one patient accessing separate modules of the entire medical management system, such as the diagnostic module and the DMM, because separate sessions—when combined—may represent a significant change or deterioration in the patient. The SS Meta function analyzes the combined effect of the separate modules, and may make a recommendation based on this global analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0290">The SS Meta uses pre-set thresholds for different combinations of the system modules being summed. The thresholds are contained in an internal table that lists all of the module combinations such as medical diagnosis+disease management, medical diagnosis+medical audio/video/image library, medical diagnosis+treatment table consultation, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0291">For example, if the Medical Diagnosis module was consulted for wheezing and diagnosed as Asthma, and the DM module was later used for Asthma management, and the Medical Audio/Video/Image library module was consulted several times for prerecorded messages on Asthma, the SS Meta function would use the proper values from the table at medical diagnosis+disease management+medical audio/video/image library for Asthma to calculate a threshold to trigger special recommendations. Thus, even though threshold was not reached in any one module, when the consultations for asthma in the diagnostic, disease management and audio/video/image library consultations are combined and considered together, threshold is reached.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">B. Frequency Meta</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0292">The Frequency Meta function reviews the number of times that a patient has consulted the system and makes recommendations based on that consultation frequency. The function calculates how many times the patient has interacted with the system for the same complaint or disease, medical audio text consultation or treatment table consultation, uses the Sequential Summing Meta function to analyze the combined effect of the consultations, and may make a recommendation based on this global analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0293">When a patient is admitted to the medical management system, for each disease being managed, a threshold is established for the number of consultations (inbound as well as outbound) per unit of time. The threshold is different for each disease and is modified by the sensitivity factor set. If this threshold is reached, the Frequency Meta function makes a recommendation. That is, the fact alone that the patient has had a certain number of symptom occurrences of a given type may trigger a recommendation from the Frequency Meta functions.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">C. Interval Meta</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0294">The Interval Meta function analyzes the time intervals between each interaction for the same disease to detect trends that may signify a problem. For example, if the function were to discover that the patient's interactions with the system are occurring closer and closer together, the function could make a recommendation based on this fact alone.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0295">The sequential summing series method is used. The interval between consultations is plotted and a meta recommendation is made if the intervals are getting shorter</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">D. Cause Meta</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0296">The Cause Meta function is a DM background task that looks for disease or cause patterns that may help to identify root causes. The function monitors and analyzes the patient's use of various system modules.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0297">The Cause Meta function identifies a sequential summing series in decreasing intervals of time between medical diagnosis, disease management, medical audio text library, treatment table consultation and all their combinations. For example, assume that a patient has consulted the system on several occasions with complaints manifesting in different parts of the body, and that during each session, the medical diagnosis module has (properly) attributed each separate problem to being caused by infection. The Cause Meta function detects such a series of consultations, and—if they reach a preset threshold per unit time—alerts the system that the root cause may lie in the patient's immune system. If the system is caring for a patient with multiple episodes of trauma, the Cause Meta function will help the system to consider the possibility that the patient is abusing drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p id="h-0046" num="0000">E. Anatomic Meta</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0298">The Anatomic Meta function analyzes patient contacts with the medical system from a viewpoint of a single organ or anatomic system of the body. The function looks for different diseases being managed that may impact the same anatomic system. The function automates the aspect of DM that—when different diseases all affect the same organ—it is often essential to monitor and frequently measure the functioning of that organ.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0299">For example, if a patient consults the medical diagnostic module on three different occasions for abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, the Anatomic Meta function recognizes that these problems all involve the gastrointestinal tract, and may cause the system to adjust its recommendations based on that additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0300">For example, diabetes mellitus and hypertension both cause slow and progressive deterioration of kidney function. The Anatomic Meta function detects the need for such special monitoring. Based on some internal, preset thresholds, the Anatomic Meta analysis may cause disease management system to recommend an evaluation of the impacted organ functions. In the example above, for a patient being managed for diabetes and hypertension, the Anatomic Meta analysis could cause the medical management system to recommend a serum creatinine, a test of kidney function, at appropriate intervals.</p>
<p id="h-0047" num="0000">F. Cause vs. Anatomic Meta</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0301">The Cause vs. Anatomic Meta function coordinates an interaction between the Cause Meta and Anatomic Meta functions. As the Cause Meta and Anatomy Meta functions interact more closely, their interaction is described here.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0302">As the patient uses the medical management system over time, the Cause/Anatomy cells are stacked along the time or Z-axis, which tracks the moment in time when intersection of the cause and anatomic system, i.e., making the diagnosis actually occurred in the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0303">The Meta Data Cube represents a summation of the patient's interaction with the system over time. Although much of the patient's past history is stored using ICD-9-CM codes, as well as conventional text strings in the fields of the patient's medical record, this technique allows very useful analyses to be done.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0304">It is important to note that the system may be able to assign a cause to a problem without knowing the anatomic system involved, and that the system may indicate what organ or organ system is involved without knowing the cause of the patient's problem.</p>
<p id="h-0048" num="0000">For example, a six-year-old child who complains of muscle aches, headache, runny nose, and joint aching most likely has a viral infection, but it is hard to ascribe a specific organ system in which it is being manifested.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0305">Interestingly, while in the diagnostic module, and while finding multiple problems occurring in the same module, a different pattern is produced in disease management. For example, diabetes can be represented by or at the intersection of an endocrine and the vascular system. But another way to visualize the disease process in diabetes is to go one step further as follows. Whenever the medical management system realizes that another disease process (like diabetes) affects the vascular system, then “vascular” as a CAUSE of further disease is searched.</p>
<p id="h-0049" num="0000">G. Causal Chaining Meta</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0306">The Chaining Meta function automates the analysis of the medical fact that certain diseases produce pathologic changes in other organs of the body, meaning that a disease can cause and be caused by other diseases. For example, the Chaining Meta function looks at a given disease as both cause and effect, and performs three analyses for a given disease D:</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0307">1. Find the root cause of D.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0308">2. Find other diseases caused by D.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0309">3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 recursively to find other root causes and other diseases caused by D.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0310">Thus, the Chaining Meta analysis traces the total impact of disease on the body. It uses the Cause Meta function (which is used to detect the immediate singe cause of a complaint or disease) to recursively find remote causes and diseases. Given a starting disease, the Chaining Meta analysis uses the Meta Data Cube to detect patterns that let the analysis go backward in the cause chain to detect other possible problems in a patient. In this way, it does the analysis needed to detect related problems that have so far been masked or have not yet surfaced.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0311">An internal Cause-Effect table used by the Cause-Effect Meta function contains fundamental medical knowledge of anatomic systems, their relationships, their diseases, and disease causality chains. This table identifies patterns that need to be explored for root causes and secondary disease. A second table, used in controlling the processing of the causality chains, contains other data such as probability of occurrence, seriousness of the secondary diseases, and possible therapeutic windows.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0312">The result of the Chaining Meta computation is a list of diseases to check for and monitor in the current patient. These results are useful in:
<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0313">insuring that side effects of disease are not missed,</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0314">not overlooking disease management therapy needed to stabilize a patient,</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0315">confirming a cause by verifying other effects (headache is consistent with Appendicitis),</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0316">negating a cause by not finding required effects (lack of Plasmodia in blood denies Malaria).
<br/>
Area Meta
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0317">An example of area meta can be described as plotting pain or discomfort against time and then integrating the area under the curve to look at the total amount of suffering or discomfort. This is important because many patients, particularly with incurable illness, such as terminal cancer patients, are in continuous pain but they are isolated, do not see their doctor regularly, or their physician does not appreciate how much the patient is suffering. They tend to “chase the pain,” and never catch up. Here, once a threshold of suffering as been met, the patient could get narcotic analgesics or have their dose increased.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">Volumetric Meta</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0318">The Volumetric Meta function performs analysis based on the (3-dimensional) product of Disease×Anatomy×Time and makes recommendations based on pre-set thresholds. The word “volumetric” refers to the Meta Data Cube analysis method used, in which a smoking history appears as the volume enclosed by the three axes P (Poison), R (Respiratory System), and Z (Time). For example, a patient who has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years is deemed to have a history of 60 pack-years impacting the respiratory system.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0319">Volumetric analysis is significant in many disease processes. Thus, the patient with a smoking volume of 60 pack-years has accumulated significant damage to the respiratory system. The longer this has been going on, the larger the volume, the more poison has impacted the functioning of the respiratory system, and the more likely certain diagnoses or therapies will be.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0320">Another example of volumetric analysis is the long-term damage that diabetes causes in the microvascular circulation.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0321">The software implementation of the Volumetric Meta function involves various internal disease management tables that list volumetric products for various diseases as well as their threshold parameters. These thresholds (as modified dynamically by the sensitivity factor set) control special actions and analyses of the system. When an applicable threshold is reached, the system performs special analyses and then issues internal alerts to look for possible evidence of damage being done to the applicable organ system(s) and to make special recommendations for the patient.</p>
<p id="h-0051" num="0000">Reliability Meta</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0322">The Reliability Meta function looks at the reliability of all of a patient's data items to see if the patient's care is inadequate. The function can recommend the reevaluation of a patient if it finds that the (separate or combined) probabilities of a diagnosis are below a reliability threshold (modified by the sensitivity factor set).</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0323">The function uses internal Reliability Indicators, associated with every data item, that track the probability that the data item reflects the actual health of the patient at the time for which it was recorded. These Reliability Indicators are established for every data item in the medical management system when it is first established, and remain associated with it throughout its life in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0324">For example, if a patient tells the system that he has a history of migraine headaches, the system may ask the patient:
<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0325">Who made the diagnosis of migraine (patient, friend, nurse, physician, or neurologist)?</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0326">What tests were run, by whom, on what tissue, with what results?</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0003" num="0327">Who confirmed the tests, how, in what context?
<br/>
The idea, of course, is that if a headache specialist made the diagnosis after a full and complete workup including imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, EEG, etc., the probability that the diagnosis is correct is very high. This will be recorded in the Reliability Indicators and associated with the diagnosis data item. If the reliability is too low, the patient will be scheduled for re-evaluation at a higher level or standard of care, which will invoke more precise and more thorough questioning.
