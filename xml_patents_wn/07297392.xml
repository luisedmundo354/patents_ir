<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to multi-sided bellows covers of the type which extend between relatively movable parts of a machine to which the bellows is mounted.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bellows are well known in industrial and other applications to enclose the space between two relatively movable parts of a machine. One such application is a lift table of the type that has a scissors or other lift mechanism to lift a table relative to a base. One end of the bellows is connected to one of the relatively movable parts of the machine, for example in a lift table to the table, and the other end of the bellows is connected to the other relatively movable portion, for example the base in a lift table, and the bellows encloses the machine between the two portions, i.e. between the base and the table in a lift table, typically where the mechanism resides. The bellows encloses this to protect it from dirt, coolants, cutting fluids, light, humidity and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bellows have typically been made by providing accordion folded sewn panels, made of for example rubberized or vinyl coated canvas or other fabric strips joined edge to edge to form the pleats of the panel, and connecting adjacent panels at the corners with flexible or foldable fabric which encloses the corners. As such, the bellows has a typically four-sided pleated construction. While a bellows must be expandable and contractible to enclose an axially variable space, a bellows must also provide resistance to lateral forces which may be exerted against the sides of the bellows to protect the enclosed space. The bellows must do this when it is both extended and retracted, and at all the positions in between.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The individual slats which make up the pleats of a bellows have typically been joined at their longitudinal edges either by bonding to a continuous sheet of flexible material and folding, by sewing or by a similar operation. The material of the bellows at the edges of the individual slats, i.e., at the apexes of the pleats, must be sufficiently flexible to permit expansion and contraction of the pleats as the bellows expands and contracts. However, the slats must also be rigid enough to support the weight of the bellows without sagging and to resist lateral forces which tend to deflect the bellows in the lateral direction perpendicular to the axial direction, which is the direction of expansion and contraction. The result in many of the prior art bellows has been to make the bellows of multi-layer constructions, including flexible layers and rigid layers, or to re-enforce the bellows with wires or rigid panel components, resulting in expensive fabrication operations and considerable weight of the bellows.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a multi-sided bellows cover of the above-described type in which each panel includes a number of panel sections, and the panel sections are connected to one another along their longitudinal edges by bead-in-slot connections. Therefore, the bead-in-slot connections provide a joint that is easy to assemble and disassemble, and also that adds rigidity without adding excessive weight. In addition, the panel sections may be made by a low cost plastic molding process such as extrusion, injection molding, vacuum forming, press molding, blow molding or any other molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a preferred aspect, the panel sections are extruded profiles, meaning that they can be made by an extrusion process that results in them being longitudinally continuous for the length of the sections.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, the panel sections can include rigid wall sections that provide rigidity and flexible web sections that provide living hinges. Alternatively, the bead in slot connections can be made to pivot so as to provide a hinge joint and in such embodiments the panel sections can be made either with or without flexible web sections. In addition, the panel sections can include more than one wall section and/or more than one web section in each panel member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bellows of the invention have their adjacent panels connected by corner sections, which can be a flexible piece of sheet material folded so as to provide the corner. The corner may be either a square corner or a chamfered corner, as is ordinary in other types of bellows. Bellows of the invention may also have a strap connected from peak to peak of the pleats to limit the extension of the bellows.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a bellows cover <b>10</b> of the invention has four sides <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> which define an open-ended box like structure with accordion folded, or pleated, sides. The adjacent sides, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are connected to one another at their ends, i.e., at the corners of the bellows <b>10</b>, by strips of folded fabric or other flexible sheet material <b>20</b>. The sheet material <b>20</b> may be provided both on the inside and on the outside surfaces of the sides <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. In addition, the apexes of the pleats may be connected by limiting straps <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), as required (for example, two) on each side, on the inside of the bellows <b>10</b>. The limiting strips <b>22</b> may be adhered to the peaks, or maybe affixed by stitching, stapling, rivets or other mechanical fasteners. In this context, mechanical fasteners should be interpreted to include adhesives, as well as other types of mechanical fasteners such as stitching, staples, rivets, bolts, screws, heat sealing or other means by which two components are secured.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates one possible end mounting configuration for the bellows <b>10</b>. The top slat <b>23</b> is axially directed and affixed by bolts, rivets, adhesive or other fasteners to the table <b>25</b> or other relatively movable component of the machine to which the bellows is assembled, and the bottom slat <b>27</b> is laterally directed and affixed by bolts, rivets, adhesive or other fasteners to the base <b>29</b> or other relatively movable component of the machine to which the bellows is assembled. Alternatively, both top and bottom slats may be axially directed or laterally directed, or any combination. Any suitable mounting configuration may be used with the invention, and it need not necessarily be a molded slat which is attached directly to the movable component. For example, an end slat of the bellows could be affixed to an adaptor array, such as loops of material supported on a bar, which is attached to the movable component.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate a square corner construction and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate a chamfered corner construction. Both of these corner constructions have been applied to bellows in the prior art, and can also be applied to a bellows of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, sides <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are shown laid flat, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates one of the corner pieces <b>20</b> below the sides <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, in position for fixation to the sides <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. End <b>26</b> of panel <b>18</b> is cut straight and end <b>28</b> of panel <b>16</b> is cut in zig zag fashion with the peaks and valleys of the zig zag corresponding to fold lines of the panel <b>16</b>, which fold lines line up with fold lines of the panel <b>18</b>. A small minimum spacing, for example one-quarter inch, is provided between the end <b>26</b> and the end <b>28</b>. Fabric panel <b>20</b>, for example vinyl coated canvas or other fabric, is stitched, heat sealed, adhered, RF sealed, sonic welded, clipped or otherwise secured to the facing sides of the panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, and a panel <b>20</b> may be provided on each side of the panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The assembly is then folded so as to form the pleats, and how it is folded determines whether the corner is square as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> or chamfered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if the peaks on one side are made to correspond with the peaks on the other side, then the corner appears square in top view. However, if the valleys on one side are made to correspond to the peaks on the other side, then the corner appears chamfered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in top view. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the straight side <b>26</b> could have also been cut in zig zag fashion so as to fill in the v-shaped gaps between the straight side <b>26</b> and the valleys at the end of side <b>28</b>. In addition, both sides <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> could have been cut straight as well, in which case the panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> would be spaced further apart than as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, a section of a panel <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> or <b>18</b> is shown. Each panel <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> includes a number of edge to edge connected panel sections <b>30</b>, each of which has a relatively rigid wall section <b>32</b> integrally connected along one edge to a relatively flexible web section <b>34</b>. The web sections <b>34</b> form the folds which are the peaks and valleys of the accordion folded panel. The wall sections and web sections are integrally molded so that at least one web section is integral along a longitudinal edge of at least one web section. The plastic of the wall sections <b>32</b> is harder and more rigid than the plastic of the web sections <b>34</b>. For example, the wall sections <b>32</b> may be molded by extrusion of rigid PVC and the web sections <b>34</b> may be similarly and simultaneously molded by extrusion of flexible PVC, in one piece with the rigid PVC wall sections <b>32</b>. Other materials may also be used for molding the panel such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene or other plastic materials. In some cases, the softer web sections are made softer either with an additive or by making them thinner, or making them of a different material than the wall section, for example, urethane. In any event, each panel section will typically be an extruded section, since it is longitudinally consistent, i.e., its lateral cross section is the same for the entire length of the section. As such, the panel sections can be made quite long, using the same extrusion dies.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a longitudinally extending bead <b>36</b> is provided at the free longitudinal edge of the web <b>34</b>. The bead <b>36</b> is received in a longitudinally extending slot <b>38</b> at the free longitudinal edge of the wall section <b>32</b> of the adjacent panel section <b>30</b>, the slot <b>38</b> being open on its side opposite from the main portion of the wall section <b>32</b> of the adjacent panel section <b>30</b>. Thus, the web <b>34</b> can be slipped into the opening of the slot <b>38</b>, with the bead <b>36</b> captured within the slot <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Molded wall and web sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are known and heretofore have been used for making accordion-folded folding doors. Such materials are available in many hardware or home improvement stores.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> illustrate an alternative construction of the panel sections <b>30</b>. The construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> is essentially the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, except the panel sections <b>39</b> have multiple rigid wall sections <b>32</b> that are integrally connected with multiple flexible web sections <b>34</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, four wall sections <b>32</b> are integrally connected by four web sections <b>34</b> in each panel section <b>39</b>. It is noted that in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, each fold of the pleated panel section is supported by two enlarged sections, one being the enlarged section which defines the slot <b>38</b> and another being an enlarged section <b>40</b> which is solid and integrally molded with the adjacent wall section <b>32</b> and web sections <b>34</b>. These sections provide stiffening at the folds. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, only one enlarged section, either the enlarged section which defines the slot <b>38</b>, or the enlarged solid section <b>40</b>, is provided adjacent to each fold of the pleated panel section <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates another alternative panel section <b>50</b> that comprises rigid wall sections <b>32</b> connected to one another by a flexible web section <b>34</b> (denoted by section lines), with a bead <b>36</b> formed at the end of a curved projection <b>52</b> that extends at approximately a right angle to the plane of the wall section <b>32</b>. The bead <b>36</b> is received in a tear-drop-shaped slot <b>38</b> of the next adjacent panel section <b>50</b>, which is provided in a slot forming tube <b>39</b> (relatively rigid material) that is integrally molded at the end of the panel section <b>50</b> that is opposite from the bead <b>36</b>. The slot <b>38</b> is formed at the end of the wall section <b>32</b> that is opposite from the bead <b>36</b>, and is sized and shaped so as to capture the bead <b>36</b> in the slot <b>38</b> while permitting pivoting of the two wall sections <b>32</b> that are connected by the bead-in-slot connection. This is facilitated by the free edge <b>47</b> of tube <b>39</b> fitting into the concavity <b>53</b> of the extension <b>52</b> in one extreme position of pivoting (the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) and the bead <b>36</b> having a flattened outer surface <b>43</b> that abuts the inner surface <b>55</b> of rib <b>41</b> molded at the base of the tube <b>39</b>, where it joins with the wall section <b>32</b>. In the opposite extreme position, the bead <b>36</b> and extension <b>52</b> can enter the slot <b>38</b> so that the bellows will fold up flat or nearly flat.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, a tie strap could be integrally molded with the bellows, with sections of the tie strap extending from one peak on the inside of the bellows at which the strap section is integrally molded to another peak, where a free end of the strap could be connected to the peak, for example with a releasable connection, for example a snap connection, connecting free ends of the strap sections to the next adjacent peaks. Alternatively, male or female snap connections could be molded integral with the internal peaks and a separate strap having mating connectors could be connected to the peak connections.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates another alternative embodiment <b>80</b> of a panel section in which there are no flexible web sections <b>34</b>, it being made of rigid plastic material with hinge joints at both ends. Parts of the panel sections <b>80</b> that correspond to previously described parts are identified with the same reference number, as in the previously described embodiments. Thus, the panel section <b>80</b> includes a rigid wall section <b>32</b> with a slot <b>38</b> at one end and a bead <b>36</b> at the other end, all of which are longitudinally continuous so that it can be made by extrusion, that when put together form a hinge joint to permit pivoting of one panel section <b>80</b> relative to the adjacent panel sections <b>80</b>. Since these hinge joints are self-limiting, no tie straps may be needed in some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferred embodiments of the invention have been described in considerable detail. Many modifications and variations to the preferred embodiments described will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, any number of rigid wall sections <b>32</b> and flexible web sections <b>34</b> could be co-extruded in one piece. Therefore, the invention should not be limited to the embodiments described, but should be defined by the claims which follow.</p>
