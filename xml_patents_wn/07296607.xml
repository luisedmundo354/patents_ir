<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In the art of upward acting doors, it is conventional practice to provide a counterbalance or door lifting assist system comprising an elongated shaft mounted generally above and adjacent to the door, the shaft including spaced apart cable drums for counterbalance cables which are connected to the opposite lower edges of the door. Counterbalance forces are typically provided by one or more torsion coil springs sleeved over the shaft between the cable drums and connected at one end to an anchor bracket and at an opposite end to the counterbalance shaft or directly to one of the cable drums. Conventional counterbalance systems also require manual winding of the torsion springs, a longstanding, nettlesome and somewhat hazardous operation. Spring replacement is also difficult and normally requires disassembly of the counterbalance system or at least major portions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Certain improvements in torsion spring type counterbalance systems for upward acting doors have been provided, such as disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,835, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. However, additional improvements have been sought in counterbalance systems for upward acting doors and it is to these ends that the present invention has been developed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides an improved counterbalance system for upward acting doors, in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a counterbalance system for an upward acting door is provided which includes one or more torsion coil springs which are disposed in a spring drive mechanism which may be mounted adjacent to an upward acting door and connected directly to one end of a counterbalance cable drum shaft. Accordingly, the spring drive mechanism is a separate device which does not require installation on or around the cable drum shaft and may be easily serviced or replaced, including replacement of the torsion spring, without disassembly of or removal of the cable drum shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an improved counterbalance system for an upward acting door is provided wherein a counterbalance spring drive mechanism includes a torsion coil spring which may be easily replaced or the entire drive mechanism itself may be interchanged at a door installation. Spring drive mechanisms may be provided for various specific door weights or sizes and may be conveniently installed and connected to the door counterbalance or cable drum shaft with a mechanically uncomplicated coupling. The spring drive mechanism also includes a housing or frame adapted to be mounted to a wall or door jamb directly adjacent the door or attached to a door header bracket which supports the counterbalance cable drums and/or door guide tracks. A right angle drive gear arrangement provides for a compact mechanism which requires minimal space adjacent one or both ends of the cable drum counterbalance shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with yet a further aspect of the invention, an improved upward acting door counterbalance system is provided which may be easily installed and counterbalance forces adjusted by a torsion spring adjustment mechanism mounted on a spring drive mechanism and which is easily accessible for adjusting spring torque. The amount of counterbalance force being provided may be monitored during the installation process by an improved indicator arrangement which indicates the number of turns of the torsion spring. Still further, the torsion spring is provided with gaps or clearances between the spring coils when the spring is in a relaxed state to avoid spring “growth” as spring torque is applied to match the counterbalance requirements of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The advantages and superior features of the invention mentioned herein, together with other important aspects of the invention, will be further appreciated upon reading the detailed description which follows in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the description which follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures may not be to scale and certain features may be shown in somewhat generalized or schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated an upward acting door of generally conventional construction and generally designated by the numeral <b>10</b>. The door <b>10</b> is illustrated as a multi-panel or multi-section type door including plural interconnected door sections <b>12</b> which are hingedly connected to each other and are disposed between opposed guide tracks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The door panels <b>12</b> are provided with opposed sets of guide rollers <b>18</b>, shown only for the right side of the door viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for guiding the door for movement between a closed position shown and an open position, also in a generally conventional manner. A multi-section door is illustrated although a single panel door may also be operated by the counterbalance system of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an improved counterbalance system of the invention is illustrated and generally designated by the numeral <b>20</b>. The counterbalance system <b>20</b> is characterized by an elongated rotatable shaft <b>22</b> supported by and between opposed wall or so-called header brackets <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> which include suitable bearings, not shown, for supporting the shaft <b>22</b>. Spaced apart cable drums <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are mounted on the shaft <b>22</b> and are rotatable with the shaft. Cable drums <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are, respectively, connected to depending counterbalance cables <b>32</b>, which cables are connected at their lower ends to opposed lower edges of the bottommost door panel in a conventional manner. The header brackets <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are also adapted to partially support the track assemblies <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As will be noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rotatable counterbalance shaft <b>22</b> is devoid of any counterbalance springs sleeved thereover. However, counterbalance forces or torque may be imposed on the shaft <b>22</b> and the drums <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> to counterbalance the weight of the door <b>10</b> by the provision of one or more counterbalance spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b>. Two counterbalance spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b> are shown in the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and are drivably connected to opposite ends of the shaft <b>22</b>. Depending on the size and weight of the door to be counterbalanced, only a single spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, one of the torsion spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b> is illustrated in exploded perspective view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and in a central section view with the parts assembled (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The drive mechanism <b>34</b> is characterized by a generally rectangular boxlike frame or housing <b>36</b> having a bottom wall <b>38</b>, a top wall <b>40</b>, and opposed side walls <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. A transverse intermediate wall <b>46</b> extends between side walls <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> as illustrated. Respective bearing receiving bores <b>39</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> and <b>47</b> are formed in frame walls <b>38</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> for receiving respective shaft support bearings <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, spaced apart mounting flanges <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> are formed integral with or firmly attached to walls <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>44</b> for mounting the mechanism <b>34</b> against a wall <b>11</b>, for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at which door <b>10</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> is also characterized by an elongated drive shaft <b>58</b> supported for rotation by bearings <b>48</b> and <b>54</b> on frame <b>36</b>. Spaced apart torsion spring support plugs or cones <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are sleeved over the shaft <b>58</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Spring support plug <b>62</b> is suitably connected to shaft <b>58</b> for rotation therewith while spring plug or cone <b>60</b> is mounted on a bearing <b>49</b> which journals shaft <b>58</b> and allows rotation of shaft <b>58</b> with respect to plug <b>60</b>. Plug or cone <b>60</b> is operably connected to a spring winder device <b>64</b> which will be described in further detail herein. Bearings <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> may all be of a sealed rolling element type, commercially available, while bearing <b>49</b> may be of a molded self-lubricating plastic, such as nylon, for example. Bearings <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are each, preferably snap or press fitted into the bearing bores on frame <b>36</b> associated with these bearings, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring still further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an elongated torsion coil spring <b>66</b> is sleeved over shaft <b>58</b> and is secured at its opposite ends to the spring plugs <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> in a conventional manner wherein the spring does not rotate relative to the spring plugs at respective ends <b>66</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when spring <b>66</b> is in a relaxed condition, the coils <b>66</b><i>c </i>are partially separated and are provided with suitable indicia comprising a contrasting set of marks which are aligned to provide a substantially continuous straight indicia line <b>67</b> which extends axially with respect to the spring <b>66</b> and the shaft <b>58</b>, and the purpose of which will be explained further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring still further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, shaft <b>58</b> supports a bevel gear <b>70</b> on one end thereof and is drivably connected thereto. Bevel gear <b>70</b> is meshed with a bevel gear <b>72</b> which is mounted on and drivably connected to an output shaft <b>74</b> for the drive mechanism <b>34</b>. Output shaft <b>74</b> is journaled in bearings <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> and includes opposed ends <b>74</b><i>a </i>and <b>74</b><i>b </i>which extend beyond the frame sidewalls <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, respectively, and beyond the bearings in which the shaft <b>74</b> is supported. Shaft <b>74</b> extends at substantially a right angle to shaft <b>58</b> and this arrangement, including bevel gears <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, provides reduced space requirements for mechanism <b>34</b>. As shown by way of example, shaft end <b>74</b><i>b </i>is connected to a suitable coupling <b>76</b> comprising a generally tubular member with opposed, coaxial shaft receiving bores <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>formed therein. Coupling <b>76</b> is adapted to be connected to one end of shaft <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, and coupling <b>76</b> is operable to be secured to both shafts <b>74</b> and <b>22</b> by respective spaced apart setscrews <b>79</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Other means of securing the coupling <b>76</b> to the shafts <b>74</b> and <b>22</b> may be provided. Moreover, coupling <b>76</b> may be connected to either end of shaft <b>74</b>, depending on the location of drive mechanism <b>34</b> with respect to a counterbalance shaft to which the drive mechanism is to be connected.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, further details of the spring winder mechanism <b>64</b> will be explained. The spring winder mechanism <b>64</b> is characterized by a frame plate member <b>80</b> which may be secured to the bottom wall <b>38</b> by suitable fasteners <b>81</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, between the sidewalls <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. The frame plate <b>80</b> supports a generally cylindrical housing <b>82</b>, which journals a ring gear <b>84</b> and a worm gear <b>86</b>. Worm gear <b>86</b> is meshed with ring gear <b>84</b> in a conventional manner and worm gear <b>86</b> includes a polygonal shaped drive socket <b>88</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for drivably rotating worm gear <b>86</b> to effect rotation of ring gear <b>84</b>. A suitable power tool with a hex shaped rotatable output drive shaft, not shown, may be connected to worm gear <b>86</b> at socket <b>88</b> to effect driving action in opposite directions of rotation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, housing <b>82</b> includes a radially projecting part <b>83</b> provided with opposed end walls <b>83</b><i>a </i>and <b>83</b><i>b </i>with suitable recesses formed therein for journaling the worm gear <b>86</b> between housing <b>82</b> and plate <b>80</b> for rotation with respect to housing <b>82</b>. Housing <b>82</b> is suitably anchored to the frame plate <b>80</b> by circumferentially spaced flanges and projections <b>82</b><i>a </i>and <b>82</b><i>b</i>, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Ring gear <b>84</b> includes radially inwardly projecting key portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, circumferentially spaced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and fitted in cooperating grooves formed in a hub part <b>61</b> of plug <b>60</b>. Hub part <b>61</b> includes a cylindrical bore <b>61</b><i>a </i>for receiving bearing <b>49</b>. Accordingly, ring gear <b>84</b> is drivably connected to plug member <b>60</b> for rotating same in response to rotation of the worm gear <b>86</b>. In this way the torsion spring <b>66</b> may be wound or unwound as required for adjusting the counterbalance torque imposed on shaft <b>22</b> by way of shaft <b>58</b>, bevel gears <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, shaft <b>74</b> and coupling <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> is shown in a front side elevation view with a removable platelike cover member <b>90</b> suitably secured to frame <b>36</b> to at least partially enclose the drive mechanism including the spring <b>66</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an elongated slot <b>92</b> is formed in cover member <b>90</b> comprising a window centrally located between the sidewalls <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> of the frame <b>36</b> for viewing the coils <b>66</b><i>c </i>of spring <b>66</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with spring <b>66</b> wound by the winder mechanism <b>64</b> by way of drive socket <b>88</b> of worm gear <b>86</b>, the indicia line <b>67</b> formed on the respective coils assumes the configuration of spaced apart bands of indicia <b>67</b><i>a</i>, <b>67</b><i>b </i>and <b>67</b><i>c </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The number of bands of indicia viewable through the slot <b>92</b> indicates the number of turns or revolutions that have been imposed on the spring <b>66</b> by the winder mechanism <b>64</b>, which number of turns may be correlated with the amount of counterbalance torque to be imposed on a particular door.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The construction and operation of the counterbalance system <b>20</b>, including the spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b>, is believed to be understandable to those of skill in the art based on the foregoing description. The counterbalance spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> may be preassembled at its source of manufacture. Accordingly, the particular spring characteristics of the torsion spring <b>66</b> may be selected in accordance with the size and weight of the door to be counterbalanced by the system <b>20</b>. The counterbalance spring <b>66</b>, as mentioned, is preferably preformed with gaps or clearances between the coils <b>66</b><i>c </i>so that the spring will not grow in length as torque is applied to the spring. The coupling <b>76</b> may be formed to be somewhat tamper resistant if desired. Adjustment of torque imposed on the shaft <b>22</b> by the spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> may be easily carried out by winding or unwinding spring <b>66</b> by way of the winder mechanism <b>64</b>. The direction of rotation of shaft <b>74</b> with respect to the shaft <b>22</b> is such that the spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> may be mounted for connection to either end of shaft <b>22</b> without affecting direction of rotation of shaft <b>22</b>. In this way dual spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b> may be connected to a single shaft <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or a single drive mechanism <b>34</b> may be used if the power requirements are such as to require only one drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, a preassembled spring drive mechanism or mechanisms <b>34</b> may be mounted on wall <b>11</b> and coupled to shaft <b>22</b> at either end or both ends thereof. The spring or springs <b>66</b> may then be easily wound to the requisite torque by applying a suitable power tool to the drive socket <b>88</b> of worm <b>86</b> which rotates ring gear <b>84</b>, plug <b>60</b> and end <b>66</b><i>a </i>of spring <b>66</b>. If any part of mechanism <b>34</b> should fail, including the spring <b>66</b>, the mechanism may be easily replaced without disconnecting the counterbalance cables from the door and removing shaft <b>22</b>, as required by conventional counterbalance mechanisms with torsion springs sleeved over the shaft which drives the counterbalance cable drums. Moreover, adjustment of the torque imposed by the spring <b>66</b> may be easily carried out when required. Alternatively, each of the spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b> may be connected directly to respective ones of cable drums <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and thereby eliminating shaft <b>22</b> extending between the drums. However, balancing of torques imposed on drums <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> and movement of door <b>10</b> is easier to accomplish with a common drive shaft, such as the shaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an alternate embodiment of a spring drive mechanism is illustrated and generally designated by the numeral <b>34</b><i>a</i>. The spring drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>is substantially like the spring drive mechanism <b>34</b> except the mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>includes a frame or housing <b>36</b><i>a </i>having an overall length greater than the housing <b>36</b> and a drive shaft <b>58</b><i>a </i>also of a length greater than the drive shaft <b>58</b>. The spring drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>is suited for utilizing springs, such as the spring <b>66</b>, which may be of various lengths as required by the counterbalance requirements of a door connected to the mechanism <b>34</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the housing <b>36</b><i>a </i>and drive shaft <b>58</b><i>a </i>are able to accommodate a wide variety of torsion coil springs operably connected to the plug <b>62</b> and the winder mechanism <b>64</b> in place of the spring <b>66</b> illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another difference between the drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>and the drive mechanism <b>34</b> is provided wherein the housing <b>36</b><i>a </i>includes an elongated flange <b>57</b><i>a </i>on one side thereof adapted to be connected to a somewhat L-shaped bracket <b>27</b> which includes a first flange <b>27</b><i>a </i>connected to flange <b>57</b><i>a </i>by a suitable fastener <b>29</b> and a second flange <b>27</b><i>b </i>connected to the guide track <b>14</b> by suitable fasteners, not shown. Spring drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>is thus supported with respect to the counterbalance shaft <b>22</b> by the coupling <b>76</b> and the bracket <b>27</b>. Frame <b>36</b><i>a </i>may or may not be disposed contiguous with wall <b>11</b> in the same manner as housing or frame <b>36</b>. However, the spring drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>may not be required to be secured directly to the wall <b>11</b> but the wall may react any forces on the drive mechanism which are not adequately counteracted by the bracket <b>27</b> and the connection of the drive mechanism to the shaft <b>22</b> via coupling <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a </i>may also be modified to be connected by a suitable bracket, not shown, to the so-called header bracket <b>24</b>, if desired. In drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cover similar to cover <b>90</b> has been removed to allow viewing the internal components of the drive mechanism <b>34</b><i>a</i>. The housing or frame <b>36</b><i>a </i>is essentially like the housing or frame <b>36</b> except for the length of sidewalls <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the elimination of unneeded mounting flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Conventional engineering materials and practices may be used to fabricate the counterbalance system <b>20</b> including the spring drive mechanisms <b>34</b> and <b>34</b><i>a</i>. Although preferred embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein, those skilled in the art will recognize that various substitutions and modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims.</p>
