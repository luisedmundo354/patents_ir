<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to check valves, and relates more specifically to a check valve for needleless medical usage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Presently, there are many types of check valves which are designed to control the one-way flow of a fluid therethrough. One common type of check valve comprises a valve element, such as a ball or spring biased valve stem, reciprocatingly positioned within a valve body providing a fluid passageway. The flow of fluid in one direction through the valve body is permitted upon displacement of the stem as it flows around the valve stem to exit the valve body. In the opposite direction, however, the fluid pressure along with the spring forces the valve stem against a valve seat, thereby inhibiting, or checking the flow of fluid therethrough. In this manner, this type of check valve effectively provides that fluid can flow only in one direction through the check valve. An example of this type of valve is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,984, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Check valves employing an elastomeric stem without the use of a spring are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,831,629, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Other check valves employing umbrella or disk-like elastomeric elements are described in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,992,462; 4,499,916 and 4,369,812, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Some check valves employ elastically deformable diaphragm-like elements as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,390,120, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Another check valve employing conical or hollow elastomeric elements where fluid flow is arranged to pass through the element itself is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,573,516 and 5,746,414, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Some of the designs described above allow for bi-directional fluid flow if accessed by the appropriate connector such as a luer fitting commonly used in the medical fluid delivery field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need in the industry to provide a reliable and economical check valve providing a reliable seal when checked by very low back pressures such as low fractions of pounds per square inch (PSI) while sealing at high back pressures, preferably in the range of 10-100 PSI. There is also a need for check valves that allow for an economical way to accommodate various preset opening or cracking pressure conditions. Most prior art valves of this nature employ springs that have varying spring properties, resulting in a check valve that provides different opening pressures without any component change.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">More particularly, current pressure relief valves employ metal springs for accurate opening pressure settings. The presence of metal in an I.V. line presents possible contamination dangers from corrosion or metallic particles. Elimination of metal springs is therefore highly desirable. Check valves equipped with non-metal resilient sealing elements are designed for a specific opening pressure. The variability of this valve characteristic is therefore not easily achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Most valves that are designed to seal at low pressures, such as disc valves, do not normally allow for high flow or bi-directional flow. Therefore, there exists a need in the industry to provide a check valve that accommodates relatively high fluid flow when unchecked.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, some valves with elastomeric elements where fluid flow is arranged to pass through the element itself have a possibility of particulate contamination. Molding of small check valve elastomeric components commonly include small openings for fluid to pass through. Such openings are created by cores of very small dimensions. These core features could be relatively easily damaged and could therefore cause flash and result in small particles of flash potentially breaking off and contaminating the fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide an improvement which overcomes the aforementioned inadequacies of the prior art devices and provides an improvement which is a significant contribution to the advancement of the check valve art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of this invention is to provide a check valve employing an elastomeric valve element that is economical to manufacture and assemble to achieve valves with different possible cracking pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of this invention is to provide a check valve that allows bi-directional high fluid flow when cracked.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of this invention is to provide a check valve that maintains a seal when checked even at very low back pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of this invention is to provide a check valve that maintains a seal when checked even at high back pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing has outlined some of the pertinent objects of the invention. These objects should be construed to be merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the intended invention. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed invention in a different manner or modifying the invention within the scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, other objects and a fuller understanding of the invention may be had by referring to the summary of the invention and the detailed description of the preferred embodiment in addition to the scope of the invention defined by the claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For the purpose of summarizing the invention, this invention comprises a valve that seals itself to restrict fluid flow at very low back pressure. The valve element is made from an elastomeric material which is deflected after the line pressure reaches a predetermined level thus allowing flow in one direction and occluding the line in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The hemispherical dome-like shaped elastomeric valve element is constructed in such a way to be deflectable, such as being activated by the external device such as a male luer, whereupon the valve then becomes a two-way valve allowing flow in both directions. The valve element is self-aligning by the valve seat geometry complementing valve element tapered seat features. The valve element is designed in such a way that various opening pressures are achievable by a simple modification of a mold tool, for example by changing a core pin.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The valve element of the valve is self-supporting and when assembled in the valve, exerts a predetermined pressure against the valve seat thus sealing the valve. The element deflects at the center after pressure rises over the predetermined cracking pressure thus opening the flow path. The element deflection is directed by a concentric groove or grooves positioned on the inside of the element dome area. The dimensions of the groove(s) determine the valve opening pressure. The simple variation of groove dimensions thus achieves the goal of providing an economical way for valves to be manufactured at various preset cracking pressure conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The valve element positioned in the housing incorporates a set of ribs that allow high, unobstructed fluid flow. The valve element has no openings for fluid flow; instead the fluid flow is directed outside the valve element.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The valve has a relatively low, predetermined opening pressure one way and withstands relatively high back pressure in the opposite direction. Moreover, the valve housing is manufactured in a modular fashion, allowing the assembly of the same stem element into various housings having different connecting arrangements, such as ML, MLL, tubing fitment or barbed connector. The components of the envisioned new valve are producible reliably by high cavitation molds and are suitable for high speed assembly process, thereby resulting in a highly economical valve. None of the valve components require registration radially during assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>, the valve <b>10</b> of the invention comprises inlet housing <b>25</b> and an outlet housing <b>13</b> and an elastomeric valve element or stem <b>15</b>. Housings <b>25</b> and <b>13</b> are permanently fastened together at joint <b>14</b> such as by welding or bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the inlet housing <b>25</b> comprises a generally tubular configuration having a luer fitting <b>35</b> at its inlet <b>11</b> and a generally dome-shaped, larger diameter configuration <b>31</b> at its opposite end. Similarly, outlet housing <b>13</b> comprises a generally tubular configuration having a luer fitting <b>35</b> at its outlet <b>12</b> and a generally dome-shaped larger diameter configuration <b>32</b> at its opposite end which assembles with the dome-shaped end <b>31</b> of the inlet housing <b>25</b> at joint <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The inlet and outlet housings <b>25</b> and <b>13</b> may be provided with many types of fittings such as, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, dual inlet and outlet barbed hose fittings <b>34</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, inlet luer <b>35</b> and outlet hose barb fittings <b>34</b> (or vice versa), in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, inlet luer fitting <b>35</b> and outlet locking luer fitting <b>36</b> (or vice versa) and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, inlet luer fitting <b>35</b> and outlet luer fitting <b>35</b> (or vice versa).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B and <b>6</b>, the valve element <b>15</b> comprises a generally dome-shaped configuration <b>33</b> with a central integral stem <b>42</b> positioned concentrically therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, in a first embodiment of the valve element <b>15</b>, a plurality of ribs <b>45</b> may be positioned longitudinally along the length of the stem <b>42</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in a second embodiment of the valve element <b>15</b>, the outer surface of the stem <b>42</b> may comprise a smooth cylindrical configuration <b>37</b>. A stem slot <b>16</b> may be provided diametrically in the end of the stem <b>42</b> to allow fluid flow therethrough in the event the stem <b>42</b> is engaged by the tip of a luer fitting, syringe, or other device that might otherwise form a seal therewith. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a third embodiment of the valve element <b>15</b>, a plurality of notches <b>38</b> may be positioned longitudinally along the length of the stem <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The notches <b>38</b> preferably comprise a larger width toward the inlet <b>11</b> and a smaller width toward the dome-shaped configuration <b>33</b>, and a depth radially inward to define a castellated configuration in the end of the stem <b>42</b> (as viewed axially). The depth of the notches <b>38</b> is sufficient to eliminate the need for the stem slot <b>16</b> since fluid may flow within channels formed by the notches <b>38</b> when the tip of luer fitting engages the end of the stem <b>42</b> without blockage as might otherwise occur without the stem slot <b>16</b> or the notches <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The valve element <b>15</b> further includes a plurality of longitudinal ribs <b>41</b> formed along the outer annular periphery of the lower end of the dome-shaped portion <b>33</b> of the valve element <b>15</b>. The ribs <b>41</b> define flow channels that allow fluid flow from across the upper surface of the dome-shaped configuration <b>33</b> through the flow channels. Viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B and <b>6</b> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> and <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B, it is seen that the outlet housing <b>13</b> correspondingly includes a plurality of castellations <b>22</b> formed along the inner annular periphery of the dome-shaped portion <b>32</b> of the outlet housing <b>13</b> to define flow channels. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the lower edge of the dome-shaped portion <b>33</b> of the valve element <b>15</b> is juxtapositioned against the upper surfaces of the castellations <b>22</b> when the valve <b>10</b> is assembled. Preferably, the relative annular spacing and size of the castellations <b>22</b> is different from the annular spacing and size of the ribs <b>41</b> such that no blocking occurs and fluid flow is allowed through the flow channels defined by the ribs <b>41</b> and the flow channels defined by the castellations <b>22</b> from the inlet <b>11</b> to the outlet <b>12</b> of the valve <b>10</b>. Specifically, the ribs <b>41</b> and the castellations <b>22</b> may be configured differently, such as being odd or even in number, staggered, or positioned asymmetrical, such that they are not allowed to fit into each other and otherwise restrict the fluid flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B and <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, the valve element <b>15</b> further comprises one or more annular reliefs <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> formed concentrically in the underside or upper surface of the dome-shaped portion <b>33</b> of the valve element <b>15</b>. The reliefs <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> may each comprise a continuous groove, a series of indentations aligned annularly, or other continuous or intermittent arrangement of reliefs <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> that allow easier flexing, similar in function to a living hinge, when the valve element <b>15</b> is forced to its cracked or opened position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>). The number and dimensions of the reliefs <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, together with the elastomeric properties of the valve element <b>15</b>, define the cracking pressure necessary to crack or open the valve element <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">More particularly, the upper portion of the dome shape configuration <b>33</b> of the valve element <b>15</b> comprises a generally frustro-conical neck <b>17</b> that is in alignment with an annular valve seat <b>18</b> to form a fluid-tight annular seal therewith by virtue of the resiliency of the valve element <b>15</b> pushing its frustro-conical neck <b>17</b> into sealing engagement with the valve seat <b>18</b>. It should be appreciated that valve elements <b>15</b> of different elastomeric properties and/or reliefs <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> of different dimensions and/or different number of reliefs <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, could easily be manufactured and assembled with the valve housings <b>25</b> and <b>13</b> to thereby produce valves <b>10</b> having different cracking pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, fluid flow through the housing outlet <b>12</b> is blocked by virtue of the frustro-conical neck <b>17</b> being resiliently urged in sealing engagement with the valve seat <b>18</b>. Due to the dome-shaped configuration <b>33</b> of the valve element <b>15</b>, the greater the pressure of the fluid flow in the outlet <b>12</b>, the greater the sealing force between the neck area <b>17</b> and the valve seat <b>18</b>. The valve <b>10</b> may be opened or “cracked” either by fluid pressure in its inlet <b>11</b> or by a physical object such as the tip of a syringe that exerts a force on the stem <b>42</b> of the valve element <b>15</b> against the resilient force inherent in the valve element <b>15</b> and as defined by the grooves <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, once the valve element is opened or cracked, fluid flow from the inlet <b>11</b> flows around the stem <b>42</b> or through notches <b>38</b> radially across the outer surface of the dome-shaped configuration <b>33</b> of the valve element <b>15</b>, through the flow channels defined by ribs <b>41</b>, through the flow channels defined by the castellations <b>22</b> and then out via outlet <b>12</b>. Importantly, a substantial flow of fluid is allowed to pass through the valve once the valve element <b>15</b> is cracked. Once the cracking pressure is removed, either by the lack of sufficient pressure of the incoming fluid in inlet <b>11</b> or by removal of the object that cracked the valve, the inherent resiliency of the valve element <b>15</b> urges the neck <b>17</b> back into sealing engagement with the valve seat <b>18</b>. Significantly, the sealing force caused therebetween is sufficient to assure an adequate seal even when the outlet fluid pressure is very small.</p>
