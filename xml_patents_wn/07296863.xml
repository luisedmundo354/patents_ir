<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the sliding guide rails for pull-out drawers and/or equipment from their cabinets/chassis.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Guide rails are components in common every day use, such as for drawers in desks or cabinets, and for industrial use such as pull-out storage shelves at the warehouse, cash registers at the supermarket, automated teller machines at the banking kiosks, electronic equipment at the telephone switching stations and so on. These guide rails provide frictionless rolling means and they enable us, for example, to pull out our drawers with little effort, and to reduce the pulling force required for operating the cash registers or shelves at the warehouses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Guide rails are provided for drawers to be either partially or fully opened. For other applications, such as the automated teller machines, they may have to be fully pulled out from their chassis for purposes of regular maintenance. In the latter case, over travel is typically provided by the guide rails.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In most applications, these guide rails are preferred to be compact and allow maximum use of the available space. The primary requirements are their strength and rigidity. In most cases, these guides are thin and wide, and are usually installed vertically because of their greater rigidity in this position. However, when installed in the horizontal position, the strength and rigidity are very much reduced. Other requirements may be the ease of installation and/or alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The cost of a guide rail is also an important consideration. This depends on the construction of the rail such as on the number of components, manufacturing costs and/or installation costs.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a slide rail assembly <b>20</b> according to the first embodiment is installed at each of the two sides of a drawer or slidable storage compartment/equipment <b>10</b>. The sectional view of the drawer assembly, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shows each slide rail comprising of a fixed support member <b>30</b>; a roller housing <b>40</b>; and a pull-out guide <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a perspective view of the slide rail assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The fixed support member <b>30</b> is formed from a sheet metal into a substantially U-shaped section. The longer flange <b>31</b> of the U has a multitude of holes <b>32</b> for mounting this support member <b>30</b> onto the inner side of a cabinet, for example, where a drawer or piece of equipment is to be slidably installed into. The other flange <b>33</b> is shorter and substantially parallel to flange <b>31</b>. The long edge of flange <b>33</b> is formed into a T-shaped rail <b>33</b><i>a</i>, with the horizontal legs <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> of the T being substantially equal in width from either side of the vertical leg or web <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The centre part of the U-section is perpendicular to both flanges <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>. In order to give these bent edges rigidity, notches <b>37</b> are formed at regular intervals along the bent edges.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">To increase the rigidity of flange <b>31</b>, stepped edges <b>38</b>, with heights of substantially half the thickness of the sheet metal, are formed on it. The stepped edges <b>38</b> may simply be a pair of parallel edges formed along the long side or depressed areas of a few cm<sup>2 </sup>of any shape formed at regular spaced intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Below the T-shaped rail of flange <b>33</b> and towards each of the two ends is a cut <b>39</b> in the shape of a U. The tongues of the U are bent inwardly and these serve as the limit stoppers <b>39</b> for the roller housing <b>40</b>. The distance L<sub>1 </sub>between the stoppers determines the opening or pull-out travel of the drawer/equipment mounted on these slide rails <b>20</b>. The tongues of <b>39</b> are preferably bent inward. This is to prevent the hands of the persons installing these slides or using the drawer or machine employing such slides from accidental cuts. However, these tongues can be bent outward without affecting their function as stoppers.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The roller housing <b>40</b> is a long member of length L<sub>2 </sub>and is substantially of rectangular cross-section. The centre is substantially hollow and is in the form of an open T. Rollers <b>41</b> are provided at-the upper part of the T, whilst rollers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are provided parallel to rollers <b>41</b> but at both sides of the T. These rollers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are relatively displaced in the vertical direction by substantially the thickness of flange <b>33</b>. Depending on the loading capacity for which the slide is designed for, there may be a plurality of rollers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>) or at least one of each type of rollers at each end of the housing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On each side of the roller housing <b>40</b> are at least two further side rollers <b>44</b> spaced apart as far as possible without interfering with the rollers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>. A similar arrangement is provided at the opposite side of housing <b>40</b>. These side rollers <b>44</b> provide lateral guidance for the drawer/equipment. When these rollers <b>44</b> are spaced as far apart as possible, they provide greater lateral stability.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment, the slides provide only partial opening of a drawer and therefore the primary load is on rollers <b>41</b>. This means that more rollers <b>41</b> may be provided than rollers <b>42</b> or <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">These rollers and the support parts of the housing are sized to withstand their designed loads. Rollers of appropriate size bigger than the supporting parts are selected so that the rolling planes of the rollers have sufficient clearance from the body of housing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The open T-recess at the centre of housing <b>40</b> fits onto the T-shaped rail <b>33</b><i>a </i>formed on flange <b>33</b>. Rollers <b>41</b> inside the housing run on the upper, horizontal flange <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> of the T-rail, whilst rollers <b>42</b> run on the lower surfaces of flange <b>34</b> and rollers <b>43</b> on the lower surface of flange <b>35</b>. Of course, some clearances are provided between rollers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> and the lower surfaces of flanges <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> for ease of alignment and/or assembly. Similarly, some clearances are provided between rollers <b>44</b> and the surfaces of the vertical web <b>36</b>. Obviously, if the T-rail <b>33</b><i>a </i>is formed with the folded edge at the right hand side of flange <b>33</b> (as opposed to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>), then the roller housing <b>40</b> would have to be turned around.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Pull-out guide <b>50</b> is formed from a sheet metal into an open C-section having unequal sides. Guide <b>50</b> encloses roller housing <b>40</b> and slides smoothly on rollers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>. On either side of guide <b>50</b> are two U cuts, one towards each of the ends, with the tongues bent inwardly to form stoppers <b>51</b>. The distance L<sub>3 </sub>between these stoppers <b>51</b> determines the travel of the slide rail <b>20</b>. On the upper surface at the rear end of <b>50</b> is cut and formed an L-shape extension <b>52</b>. This extension <b>52</b> engages with an attachment (not shown) on the sideboard of drawer <b>10</b> for fixing this guide <b>50</b> to the drawer. At the outer end of guide <b>50</b> is punched an aperture <b>53</b> for engagement with a catch <b>54</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) mounted at the forward sideboard of this drawer. In this way, the drawer can be easily and removably attached to the pull-out guide <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A variation of a T-rail having flange <b>35</b><i>a </i>(not shown) folded may be provided. In this case, the T-recess of roller housing is symmetrical and the axes of rollers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are in line with each other. It follows that the C-section of the pull-out guide has also symmetrical sides.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With a pair of guide rails <b>20</b> installed at the sides of drawer <b>10</b>, the drawer is then fully supported and can be slidably opened and closed with little effort. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>c </i>illustrate the closed, intermediate and fully opened positions of a drawer. The travel of the drawer is determined by L<sub>1</sub>+L<sub>3</sub>−2L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a second embodiment of a sliding guide <b>20</b><i>a</i>. This sliding guide <b>20</b><i>a </i>comprises of a fixed support bracket <b>110</b>; a fixed sliding guide <b>120</b>; a lower roller housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>; a pull-out slide rail <b>140</b>; an upper roller housing <b>40</b><i>b</i>; and a pull-out guide <b>150</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a sectional view of this embodiment, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a perspective view of an assembled slide rail <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, the fixed support bracket <b>110</b> is formed from a sheet metal into a substantially L-section. The vertical flange <b>111</b> has a multitude of holes <b>112</b> for fixing to the side of a cabinet or chassis into which a drawer or equipment is to be installed in. As described earlier for flange <b>31</b>, stepped edges <b>113</b> are formed on flange <b>111</b> for increasing its rigidity. Similarly, notches <b>114</b> are formed at the bent edge for increasing the rigidity and load capacity of this bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">On the horizontal flange <b>115</b> of bracket <b>110</b> is attached a fixed guide <b>120</b>. This guide <b>120</b> is formed from a sheet metal into an open C-section similar to the pull-out guide <b>50</b> described earlier. Stoppers <b>121</b> are punched and formed at either or opposite sides proximate the ends of guide <b>120</b>. The distance L<sub>4 </sub>apart between these stoppers <b>121</b> determines the travel provided by this slide <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Fitted inside guide <b>120</b> is a lower roller housing <b>40</b><i>a </i>similar to the roller housing <b>40</b> described in the first embodiment. This housing <b>40</b><i>a </i>runs smoothly on its rollers <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> inside guide <b>120</b> between the limit stoppers <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>d </i>shows the pull-out slide rail <b>140</b>. This is formed from a sheet metal into a substantially I-section or a composite of two Ts. Each part of the T is similar to the T-rail <b>33</b><i>a </i>on flange <b>33</b> as described in the first embodiment. Of course, the bent edges <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> of the T-flanges may be on the same side as each other or at opposite sides. On the vertical web <b>143</b>, adjacent to the T-rails, are formed two sets of stoppers <b>144</b>, <b>145</b> spaced apart by distance L<sub>5</sub>. At the centre of the vertical flange <b>143</b>, a roller <b>147</b> is mounted on a bracket <b>148</b> through a pin or shaft <b>149</b>. This rail <b>140</b> can be installed with no distinction as to which end is forward. Of course, one type of rail <b>140</b> can be provided with the tongues of stoppers <b>144</b>, <b>145</b> without being bent yet. These tongues of <b>144</b>, <b>145</b> can then be bent in the required direction during assembly or installation. In this way, further flexibility in installation is provided. This also reduces the number of parts required for stocking.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>e </i>shows the upper roller housing <b>40</b><i>b</i>, which is similar to housing <b>40</b> or <b>40</b><i>a</i>. Housing <b>40</b><i>b </i>fits and slides on the upper T-flange of rail <b>140</b>, whilst housing <b>40</b><i>a </i>fits and slides on the lower T-flange.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>f </i>shows the pull-out guide <b>150</b>, which is similar to guide <b>50</b> as described in the first embodiment. Guide <b>150</b> fits over and slides on the rollers of housing <b>40</b><i>b</i>. Stoppers <b>151</b> at both ends determine the travel L<sub>6 </sub>of this sliding guide. Extended bracket <b>152</b> at the rear end and an aperture <b>153</b> at the front end provide means for attaching this guide <b>150</b> to the side of a drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As a variation of the T-rail as in the first embodiment, the flanges on both sides of the central web <b>143</b> of pull-out rail <b>140</b> may be folded. This follows that the T-recess of roller housing <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>are symmetrical, so are the C-section of guides <b>120</b>, <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once both sides of a drawer, for example, are mounted and fully supported by the sliding guides <b>20</b><i>a</i>, the drawer can be safely drawn in or out. The opening of the drawer is determined by the distances between the limit stoppers on the various components of this slide and is given by L<sub>4</sub>+L<sub>5</sub>+L<sub>6</sub>−3L<sub>2</sub>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a drawer at an intermediate open position. With this embodiment, it is possible to provide even some over-travel with two stages of telescopic extension of the sliding guide. It is possible to provide further over-travel with more stages of extension, depending on the loading capacity and rigidity required for a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a third embodiment of a sliding rail <b>20</b><i>b </i>in which the rail is mounted below the drawer rather than at the sides. With this arrangement, the vertical height of the slide assembly <b>20</b><i>b </i>is preferably kept low, so that the available height in the drawer is not sacrificed. This assembly <b>20</b><i>b </i>comprises a fixed support bracket <b>30</b><i>a</i>; roller housing <b>40</b><i>c</i>; intermediate pull-out guide <b>160</b>; roller housing <b>170</b>; and pull-out guide <b>180</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view of this embodiment, whilst <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective view of slide assembly <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>, support bracket <b>30</b><i>a </i>is similar in construction with bracket <b>30</b>. However, the heights of vertical flanges <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b </i>are shorter and are kept to the minimum possible and is formed from a sheet metal. The T-rail <b>33</b><i>a </i>is also similar to that described for the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>shows the roller housing <b>40</b><i>c </i>which is similar to the roller housing <b>40</b>, <b>40</b><i>a </i>or <b>40</b><i>b </i>described above. With similar function, housing <b>40</b><i>c </i>fits onto the T-rail <b>33</b><i>a </i>of bracket <b>30</b><i>a </i>and slides smoothly thereon between stoppers <b>39</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>c</i>, pull-out guide <b>160</b> is similar in construction with previous guides <b>50</b>, <b>120</b> or <b>150</b>. On the side flanges are two stoppers <b>161</b>, one towards each end. The tongues of these stoppers <b>161</b> are bent inward. On the upper horizontal flange are two further stoppers <b>162</b>, also one towards each end. However, the tongues of <b>162</b> are bent outward.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Roller housing <b>170</b> is a long and hollow member with a cross-section of a C with only one lip (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>d</i>). There are rollers <b>171</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>173</b> on the top surface, sides and lip respectively. Depending on the design load, length of housing <b>170</b> and over-travel, at least one type of each roller <b>171</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>173</b> is provided at each of these surfaces. The rollers are sized bigger than the support parts of housing <b>170</b> such that housing <b>170</b> fits onto pull-out guide <b>160</b> and runs smoothly on these rollers <b>171</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>e </i>shows another pull-out guide <b>180</b>. This is also formed from a sheet metal and has a C-section with only one lip. On the top surface and at the rear end is punched and formed an L-bracket <b>181</b> for fixing with an attachment on the drawer. At the forward end but on the side flange is punched and formed a bracket <b>182</b> for fixing to the front part of the drawer. On each or both the sides are formed a pair of typical stoppers <b>183</b>. This guide <b>180</b> fits over roller housing <b>170</b> and allows <b>170</b> to move smoothly therein between stoppers <b>183</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Once the drawer/equipment <b>10</b> is attached to guide <b>180</b> and supported by slide <b>20</b><i>b</i>, the drawer/equipment can be drawn in or out with little effort as the component parts of slide <b>20</b><i>b </i>run smoothly on rollers between their respective limit stoppers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates such a drawer at an intermediate open position.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">While only a few embodiments and variations of a sliding guide have been described and illustrated, it is to be understood that many changes and modifications could be made to the present invention without departing from the scope of the present invention. A modification such as the T-rail oriented in the lateral direction is possible. Also instead of rollers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, which are not subjected to heavy loads, plain sliding strips made of low friction materials may be used.</p>
