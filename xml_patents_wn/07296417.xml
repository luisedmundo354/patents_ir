<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/020,355, entitled “COUNTERFLOW THERMOELECTRIC CONFIGURATION EMPLOYING LIQUID METAL AS THERMAL TRANSFER FLUID,” and naming Uttam Ghoshal as inventor, filed on even date herewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to thermal transfer systems, and more particularly, to thermoelectric configurations in which thermal transfer fluid flows recuperate thermal energy from a generally-hotter flow path to a generally-cooler flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electronic devices such as central processing units, graphic-processing units and laser diodes can generate substantial heat during operation. If such heat is not dissipated properly, temperature buildup may occur and such buildup can adversely affect the performance of these devices. For example, excessive temperature buildup may lead to malfunctioning or breakdown of the devices. Alternatively, stability or performance characteristics may be adversely affected. Accordingly, it is important to remove the generated heat in order to maintain desired operating temperatures of these devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In many challenging scientific and commercial cooling applications, particularly microelectronics, cooling of high power dissipation densities (e.g., densities &gt;100 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) may be required. Worse still, these densities are projected to increase in the future. In general, such applications require cooling beyond what can be offered by conventional finned heat sink structures and forced air cooling. Consequently, alternatives such as single- and two-phase fluid cooling systems are being implemented more widely.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Characteristics such as low vapor pressure and high thermal conductivity make liquid metals attractive for high temperature cooling applications. Commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,658,861, entitled “Cooling of High Power Density Devices by Electrically Conducting Fluids” describes various exemplary liquid metal cooling configurations. In certain configurations, heat is transferred from a high power density device to the liquid metal, the liquid metal is transported away from the high power density device and heat is distributed and/or dissipated at a convenient distance (e.g., using a heat sink).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to providing excellent heat transfer characteristics, the high electrical conductivity typical in this class of fluids offers the potential of efficient, compact pumping. Accordingly, liquid metals offer an attractive solution for current and future high power density cooling challenges. However, even with all the advantages of efficient forced flow liquid metal cooling, some cooling applications may require greater cooling power than can be achieved simply through simple rejection of heat from the liquid metal to an ambient environment. While ever larger heat sinks and forced air techniques can be employed to improve dissipation to the ambient environment, form factor or other constraints may limit these solutions. For these and other applications, improved techniques are desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Active cooling technologies such as thermoelectrics can be used to introduce thermal “gain” into a cooling system and, when employed in combination with forced flow liquid metal cooling loops, can provide an attractive solution for cooling high heat flux density devices and/or components. In such configurations, it can be advantageous to configure fluid flows to provide heat transfer between hot-side and cold-side flows. For example, it can be desirable to substantially equilibrate temperature of liquid metal flows entering hot-side and cold-side paths. In this way, thermal differential (ΔT) across individual thermoelectric elements can be reduced, thereby improving efficiency of the thermoelectric. Various suitable recuperator designs are described including designs that provide heat exchange with and without mixture of respective flows.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While exploitations of the present invention include both open and closed loop configurations, aspects of the inventive concepts and techniques described herein will be understood in the context of certain illustrative closed-cycle fluid loop configurations. In some configurations, hot-side and cold-side flows are part of respective and distinct closed loops and recuperation typically involves heat transfer between the distinct loops using a heat exchanger. In some configurations, hot-side and cold-side flows are parts of a same or unified closed loop. In such configurations, recuperation may be achieved using a heat exchanger. In some configurations, hot-side and cold-side closed loop flows at least partially overlap and recuperation may be achieved by commingling hot-side and cold-side fluid flows in a pool recuperator, in a commingled flow portion of the fluid path, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">While suitable configurations include those with a single thermoelectric module (typically including both p-type and n-type thermoelectric material) or substantially isothermal groups thereof, total cooling power can be increased by employing multiple thermoelectric modules. Indeed, by employing modern semiconductor technologies, including e.g., thin-film technologies, thermoelectric elements may be cost-effectively employed and configured in large arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some such configurations, it has been discovered that it is advantageous to configure closed loop fluid flows such that hot-side and cold-side flows provide substantially uniform thermal differentials across respective thermoelectric modules (or substantially isothermal groups thereof) during operation. A variety of suitable flow topologies are described.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Certain fluid loops described herein may include (or be charged with) liquid metal (or an alternative thermal transfer fluid) or may simply be adapted for its use in a closed cycle system. In addition, while embodiments of the present invention are described primarily with respect to cooling configurations, based on the description herein, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the described techniques and configurations may be employed or adapted for use in other heat transfer applications including heating and temperature regulation. These and other embodiments and exploitations will be understood with reference to the specification and claims that follow.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the description that follows, we detail systems that employ thermoelectric modules in conjunction with one or more closed fluid cycle loops in which a forced flow of thermal transfer fluid (e.g., a liquid metal thermal transfer fluid) is used to transfer thermal energy to or from the thermoelectric modules. Systems are also described in which some fluid flows do not constitute a closed-cycle. Recuperation techniques are employed to transfer thermal energy from hot-side flows to cold-side flows. In general, recuperator configurations are designed to substantially equilibrate temperatures of thermal transfer fluid flows entering respective portions of the fluid flows, which are thermally coupled to respective hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric modules.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In many of the illustrated configurations, arrays of thermoelectric modules are employed and counterflow topologies are employed to further provide substantially uniform thermal differentials across respective ones of the thermoelectric modules. While the inventive concepts and techniques described herein are general to both array and non-array configurations, for array configurations, such topologies (when employed in conjunction with the recuperator techniques described herein) provide substantially uniform (and low) thermal differentials across thermoelectric modules of an array and allow each of the thermoelectric modules to operate in the desired efficiency regime, while accumulating in the thermal transfer fluid flow the heat transfer contributed by each of the thermoelectric modules.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Thermoelectric devices and materials are well-known in the art and a wide variety of configurations, systems and exploitations thereof will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In general, exploitations include those in which a thermal potential is developed as a consequence of an electromotive force (typically voltage) across an appropriate material, material interface or quantum structure, as well as those in which an electromotive force (typically voltage) results from a thermal potential across an appropriate material, material interface or quantum structure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Often, exploitations of the first type operate based on the Peltier effect, while exploitations of the second type often operate based on the Seebeck effect. Peltier effects arise at interfaces between dissimilar conductive (or semiconductive) materials, while Seebeck effects arise in materials where a temperature gradient gives rise to current flow. However, more generally, other effects or actions may be similarly exploited, including related or similar effects (e.g., Thomson, magneto caloric, quantum, tunneling and thermoionic effects) in materials, at material interfaces or as a result of quantum scale confinement. Accordingly, for purposes of the present description, the term “thermoelectric” (e.g., thermoelectric module, couple, element, device, material etc.) is meant in the broadest sense of the term in which thermal potential is traded for electromagnetic potential (or vice versa), and therefore includes those thermoelectric configurations which exploit Peltier or Seebeck effects, as well as those that operate based upon Thomson, quantum tunneling, thermoionic, magneto caloric or other similar effect or combination of effects. That said, for clarity of description, we focus on particular Peltier-type thermoelectric systems; however, based on such description, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate applications of the described inventive concepts to configurations in which other thermoelectric-type effects are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to the range of variation on suitable thermoelectric-type effects, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate (based on the description herein), that various of the techniques and configurations described herein may be employed to provide cooling, heating, heating and cooling and/or thermal regulation. While these and other exploitations may fall within the scope of claims that follow, we believe it is useful to focus on certain illustrative embodiments to provide a clear description. Therefore, we focus our description on exemplary cooling configurations in which the Peltier effect is exploited to provide cooling power. For concreteness, we describe systems in which thermal energy is transported away from a high power density device, such as an operating microprocessor, integrated circuit, laser, etc. using one or more liquid metal thermal transfer fluid loops. Other fluids may be employed and the techniques and configurations described herein may be employed in cooling, heating and/or thermal regulation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, in view of the above and without limitation, we now describe operation of typical Peltier-type devices, analyze efficiency factors for refrigerators and detail techniques and configurations whereby various counterflow configurations may be employed in a system configured to cool a high-power density device. Based on the exemplary configurations, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate suitable adaptations for other cooling applications as well as for heating and/or thermal regulation exploitations.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thermal contacts <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> should be designed or configured to couple thermal energy to/from respective ends of TE couples <b>200</b> without shunting electrical current that would otherwise traverse the TE elements.

In general, appropriate materials, layers and/or coating selections are application dependent and persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize suitable selections for a given application.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the preceding description has assumed general p-type and n-type semiconductor or semimetal materials, particular materials or material systems are typically employed in configurations that exploit particular thermoelectric-type effects. In general, appropriate material selections are based on the particular thermoelectric-type effects exploited and may be optimized for operating temperatures, compatibility with other materials and other factors. Focusing illustratively on Peltier-type thermoelectrics, devices are commonly fabricated at bulk material scale for use at near room temperatures using semiconductors such as bismuth telluride (BiTe), indium antimony (InSb) and related material systems plated with metal (e.g., Cu) to define the appropriate material interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, both p-type and n-type materials are employed in practical configurations. A class of materials commonly employed in Peltier-type thermoelectrics is that known as the bismuth chalcogenides. For example, Bi<sub>0.5</sub>Sb<sub>1.5</sub>Te<sub>3 </sub>can be employed as a p-type material and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3-x</sub>Se<sub>x </sub>as n-type material. Other materials and material systems may be employed depending on design goals, desired operating temperatures and material compatibility issues particular to a given application. In general, the configurations and techniques described herein may be employed with thermoelectric modules of any suitable design and based on any suitable materials or material systems.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While operation of suitable Peltier-type thermoelectric elements, couples and modules will be understood based on the preceding discussion, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many practical implementations may correspond to the illustrated structures. Neither rectilinear structures nor linear configurations thereof are required. Indeed, many practical configurations include patterned thin or thick film structures fabricated using modern semiconductor processes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Based on the description herein, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a variety of suitable integrated circuit realizations that generally correspond to the configurations illustrated.

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Efficiency Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The efficiency of all refrigerators, including Peltier-type thermoelectric coolers, is limited by the second law of thermodynamics which states that it is not possible for the entropy of a system as a whole to decrease as the result of any process. For refrigerators this means that, while one can cool one part of a system and thereby reduce the entropy of that subsystem, the entropy of another part of the system must increase. Practically speaking, it takes energy to cool things below their equilibrium temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a very simple cooling system. From the first law of thermodynamics, the energy of the entire system must remain constant. Therefore, the heat, Q<sub>h</sub>, dissipated by the system at the hot side of the cooling system at temperature T<sub>h </sub>is equal to the sum of the heat, Q<sub>c</sub>, removed from the cold side at temperature T<sub>c </sub>and the energy, Q<sub>ext</sub>, added by an external power source. We can state this alternatively as in Equation 1.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">All real cooling systems are, of course, less efficient than this, but two important points become clear by examining the results for an ideal refrigerator. The first is that as the temperature of the cold side, T<sub>c</sub>, is reduced the efficiency also drops. The second point is that as the temperature difference between the two sides, ΔT, goes to zero the efficiency of the cooler tends toward infinity. (Of course, as the temperature difference goes to zero no cooling can be accomplished.) In other words, cooling is most efficient when the temperature differential remains small. For both these reasons, refrigerators work less efficiently, that is, they require more energy to operate, as the temperature of the cold side diverges from that of the hot side.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Peltier-type thermoelectric coolers have no moving parts and so are quiet and reliable, requiring little maintenance. They also are small and lightweight, and can be controlled electronically to maintain a precise temperature. Because of these advantages, they are useful in a wide variety of niche applications, especially electronics applications, such as cooling laser diodes and computer electronics. Unfortunately, even with the best materials available today, Peltier coolers have far lower efficiencies than do traditional cooling devices, such as the compressor in a household refrigerator. Therefore, modifying the operation of thermoelectric (TE) coolers to improve their efficiency would be of great benefit and would allow the use of TE coolers and cooling systems in additional applications, including those requiring higher cooling power.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Three processes contribute to the heat flow through a thermoelectric element. First, at each junction heat is generated when a current flows from one material to a dissimilar one. The magnitude of this Peltier effect is proportional to the current, the absolute temperature of the junction, and material-dependent properties. Equations 4 and 5 describe this contribution mathematically.

and Z <o ostyle="single">T</o> is a dimensionless figure of merit for thermoelectric materials, with higher values of Z <o ostyle="single">T</o> yielding higher efficiency coolers.
</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">From Equation 14 it is clear that efficiency can be improved by increasing Z <o ostyle="single">T</o> and reducing ΔT, the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the TE element. Near room temperature, where Peltier coolers are often operated, and for values of Z <o ostyle="single">T</o> typical of TE cooler materials, a reduction in ΔT increases the efficiency more rapidly than an increase in Z <o ostyle="single">T</o> of the same magnitude. Furthermore, materials used in thermoelectric coolers have a fairly narrow range of Z <o ostyle="single">T</o> over their effective operating range and, while the search for better materials continues, it is currently more practical to adjust the temperature difference to improve efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While low ΔT across an individual thermoelectric element or modules is a figure of merit for cooling (or heating) applications, to provide appropriate magnitudes of cooling power, it can be desirable to configure large arrays coolers (e.g., thermoelectric elements, typically as arrays of thermoelectric modules) in a way that accumulates the cooling power contributions of the individual elements (or modules). In doing so, it becomes important to design a system in which each of the thermoelectric elements (or modules) operates in a desired efficiency regime. Below, we describe a variety of counterflow loop configurations in which we can achieve uniformly low ΔT across each of the thermoelectric elements (or modules) of an array.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While the preceding discussion of efficiency has focused on refrigerators, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the desirability of maintaining a low and generally uniform ΔT across each of the elements or modules of an array applies similarly to heat pumps. Accordingly, while we focus illustratively of arrays of thermoelectric coolers and recuperated, counterflow closed-cycle fluid loop configurations, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate applications and exploitations to heating, heating/cooling and/or temperature regulation applications. In view of the above, and without limitation, we now describe certain exemplary configurations.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Recuperated Loop Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">We now describe a variety of configurations in which arrays of thermoelectric modules are employed in conjunction with one or more closed cycle fluid loops. In the illustrated configurations, closed cycle fluid paths are illustrated. However, more generally in some of the illustrated configurations, at least one fluid path may be configured as an open loop. In general, forced flow of thermal transfer fluid is used to transfer thermal energy to or from the thermoelectric modules. In some configurations, the thermal transfer fluid is a liquid metal or other conductive fluid or slurry and flow is motivated using a magnetofluiddynamic (MFD) pump.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In cooling (or heating) configurations, a recuperator is employed to limit the magnitude of thermal differential (ΔT) across any given thermoelectric module and thereby improve efficiency. In some configurations, arrays of thermoelectric modules are provided and topologies of the thermal transfer fluid flows are designed to provide substantially uniform and low thermal differentials across respective ones of the thermoelectric modules. In cooling or heating array configurations, such topologies provide allow each of the thermoelectric modules to operate in a desired efficiency regime, while accumulating in the thermal transfer fluid flow the heat transfer contributed by each of the thermoelectric modules. Of course, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in thermoelectric configurations that employ a single thermoelectric element or module (or in those realizations which the uniform ΔT benefits of a counterflow topology maybe forgone), flows topologies need not constitute counterflows.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For clarity of illustration, the thermoelectric array configurations and loop topologies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b> and <b>11</b> are presented in a linear form which will facilitate understanding of the counterflows. However, based on the description herein, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that more complex topologies, including serpentine topologies and crossflows in multidimensional arrays, are also contemplated. Such topological generalizations will be better understood based on description that follows; however, we begin our description with simpler linear presentations as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> depicts an exemplary counterflow thermoelectric cooler configuration <b>601</b> in which two distinct thermal transfer fluid loops are provided. A first loop <b>651</b> includes respective portions <b>651</b>A, <b>651</b>B, <b>651</b>C and <b>651</b>D in thermal communication with hot ends of respective thermoelectric modules <b>611</b>A, <b>611</b>B, <b>611</b>C and <b>611</b>D. Flow of thermal transfer fluid through loop <b>651</b> is motivated by pump <b>621</b>. Similarly, a second loop <b>652</b> includes respective portions <b>652</b>D, <b>652</b>C, <b>652</b>B and <b>652</b>A in thermal communication with cold ends of respective thermoelectric modules <b>611</b>D, <b>611</b>C, <b>611</b>B and <b>611</b>A. Flow of thermal transfer fluid through loop <b>652</b> is motivated by pump <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For purposes of illustration, we assume that thermal transfer fluid(s) in either or both of loops <b>651</b> and <b>652</b> is (are) a liquid metal or other conductive fluid or slurry and that pumps <b>621</b> and/or <b>622</b> include(s) electromagnetic pumps, such as a magnetofluiddynamic pump described elsewhere herein. In some realizations, the thermal transfer fluid is an alloy of gallium and indium. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other thermal transfer fluids and/or pump configurations may be employed in other realizations.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the illustrated cooling configuration, heat is transferred from hot ends of respective thermoelectric modules to the liquid metal thermal transfer fluid flow in loop <b>651</b>. Liquid metal thermal transfer fluid enters portion <b>651</b>A of the closed cycle fluid loop <b>651</b> at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>. As the fluid flows through portions <b>651</b>A, <b>651</b>B, <b>651</b>C and <b>651</b>D of loop <b>651</b>, heat is transferred from hot end ends of respective thermoelectric modules and the fluid exits portion <b>651</b>D at a temperature T<sub>H</sub>. From there, the liquid metal thermal transfer fluid flows past or through heat exchanger <b>631</b>, giving up thermal energy and returning to reenter portion <b>651</b>A of loop <b>651</b>, completing the closed cycle fluid loop. Operation of recuperator <b>640</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates a variation <b>601</b>B in which fluid path <b>651</b>B is instead configured as an open cycle pathway. Flow in fluid path <b>651</b>B is from a source <b>698</b> to a sink <b>697</b>. In some configurations, e.g., those in which source and sink draw from and return to a body <b>699</b> of sufficient thermal mass, source <b>698</b> and sink <b>697</b> may originate from and terminate in a same pool of thermal transfer fluid. However, more generally, there need not be any common body relationship between source <b>698</b> and sink <b>697</b>. Configurations in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> typically employ a thermal transfer fluid other than a liquid metal and suitable pump <b>621</b>B configurations will, in general, depend on characteristics of the thermal transfer fluid employed in fluid path <b>651</b>B. Since fluid path <b>651</b>B no longer constitutes a closed-loop, heat exchanger <b>631</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and turning now to the cold-side flow of thermoelectric cooler configuration <b>601</b>, liquid metal thermal transfer fluid exits portion <b>652</b>A of closed cycle fluid loop <b>652</b> at a temperature T<sub>C</sub>, flowing past or through heat exchanger <b>632</b> and picking up thermal energy from the cooled workpiece <b>650</b>, typically a microprocessor, communications integrated circuit, optoelectronic device or array, laser or high power density device. Flow continues through recuperator <b>640</b>, which will be described below, and back to thermoelectric array <b>610</b>. Liquid metal thermal transfer fluid enters portion <b>652</b>D of the closed cycle fluid loop <b>652</b> at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>. As the fluid flows through portions <b>651</b>A, <b>651</b>B, <b>651</b>C and <b>651</b>D of loop <b>651</b>, heat is transferred from the fluid to cold ends of respective thermoelectric modules and the fluid eventually exits portion <b>651</b>D at a temperature T<sub>H</sub>, completing the closed cycle fluid loop.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In general, heat exchangers <b>631</b> and <b>632</b> are any form of heat exchanger appropriate for a particular exploitation of the described counterflow thermoelectric cooler configuration. For example, in some realizations, heat exchanger <b>631</b> is an ambient air heat exchanger (e.g., including a finned heat sink and optionally a forced blower or fan) at some distance from the thermoelectric modules. In some realizations, heat exchanger <b>632</b> is a solid-fluid heat exchanger including a thermally conductive surface in close thermal communication with cooled workpiece <b>650</b> together with a housing through which the liquid metal thermal transfer fluid may flow. For processor chip cooling applications, the thermally conductive surface may be a thin-film tungsten, nickel layer on the backside of the processor or a discrete surface of tungsten, nickel, anodized aluminum or nickel-coated aluminum soldered to the backside of the chip. Suitable housing materials generally include inert polymers (Teflon, polyurethane, etc.), glass or thermally conductive material such as tungsten, nickel, nickel-coated aluminum, anodized aluminum, nickel-coated copper etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Recuperator <b>640</b> includes a fluid-fluid heat exchanger that substantially equilibrates temperatures (at T<sub>R</sub>) of thermal transfer fluid flows entering respective portions <b>651</b>A and <b>652</b>D of loops <b>651</b> and <b>652</b>. In general, any of a variety of thermally conductive surfaces such as such as tungsten, nickel, nickel-coated aluminum, anodized aluminum, nickel-coated copper, etc. may be employed. By employing recuperator <b>640</b>, the illustrated thermoelectric cooler configuration <b>601</b>, ensures a relatively low thermal differential (ΔT ) across any given thermoelectric module.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above with reference to efficiency analysis, reduction of ΔT can allow individual Peltier-type thermoelectric elements of the illustrated TE modules to operate (when employed in a thermoelectric cooling or heating configuration) at efficiencies approaching ideal efficiencies for the particular material systems and devices employed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Similarly, while high power density devices (HPDDs) may constitute the substantial source of thermal differential between hot-side and cold-side flows in certain of the illustrated configurations, in other exploitations, a cooling or heating target need not include a HPDD. Indeed, heat-pump and refrigeration configurations are contemplated in which a thermal source need not constitute an HPDD.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is a simplified dimensionless depiction of the effect of the illustrated recuperated counterflows on temperature of the thermal transfer fluid flows and thermal differential (ΔT) across any given thermoelectric module or element. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> tends to ignore generally isothermal hot- and cold-end temperatures of a multi-element thermoelectric module configured as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> provides a more detailed illustration in relation to thermal differentials across thermoelectric modules <b>611</b>D, <b>611</b>C, <b>611</b>B and <b>611</b>A. In each case, the use of counterflows provides a generally uniform thermal differential (ΔT) across the thermoelectric modules and inclusion of recuperator <b>640</b> tends to minimize magnitude of that generally uniform ΔT.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As previously discussed, any of a variety of thermal transfer fluids and/or pump configurations may be employed in other realizations of the closed-cycle counterflows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. However, electrically conductive thermal transfer fluids are attractive in that they allow the direct use of magnetofluiddynamic-(MFD-) type electromagnetic pumps. MFD pumps are often more reliable than other kinds of pumps since MFD pumps typically do not have moving parts (except, of course, the conductive fluid itself) and may offer certain system advantages since typical MFD pump configurations are orientation-independent and vibration insensitive.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In general, suitable designs for pumps <b>621</b> and <b>622</b> include MFD pump designs that include a chamber or path through which a conductive fluid may flow, a fluid inlet, and a fluid outlet. Operation of such an MFD pump will be understood as follows. A magnetic field is created within at least a portion of the chamber path, oriented in a direction generally perpendicular to the desired direction of fluid flow. Respective electrodes are disposed on generally opposing sides of the chamber or path such that a current flowing through the conductive fluid between the electrodes flows in a direction that is generally perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the desired direction of fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">While any of a variety of MFD pump designs may be employed and particular MFD pump configurations will, in general, be selected based on application specific factors, details of several suitable designs are described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 11/020,530, filed on Dec. 23, 2004, entitled “Integrated Electromagnetic Pump and Power Supply Module” and naming Uttam Ghoshal, Key Kolle, and Andrew Carl Miner as inventors, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference rety.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Turning now to thermal transfer fluid formulations, any of a variety of formulations may be employed in realizations of the closed-cycle flows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>. Nonetheless, certain liquid metal formulations are attractive for realizations such as described herein. In particular, alloys of gallium and indium can be employed. Compositions ranging from 65 to 75% (by mass) gallium and 20 to 25% (by mass) indium are generally suitable and materials such as tin, copper, zinc and bismuth may also be present in small percentages. One such composition for a suitable liquid metal thermal transfer fluid is 66% gallium, 20% indium, 11% tin, 1% copper, 1% zinc and 1% bismuth.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">While an appropriate thermal transfer fluid selection will, in general, vary from application to application, GaIn alloys are often suitable for configurations such as described herein, in part because, such alloys tend to perform well over a wide range of temperatures with high thermal and electrical conductivities. Melting points ranging from −15° C. to 30° C. can often be achieved and typical GaIn alloys do not form vapor even at temperatures up to 2000° C. Such alloys are typically non-toxic, are relatively cheap and are inert to polyimides, polycarbonates, glass, alumina, Teflon, and conducting metals such as tungsten, molybdenum, and nickel. As a result, such materials can be used in forming the closed-cycle fluid loops <b>651</b> and <b>652</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that a number of other thermal transfer fluids, including other liquid metals may be employed. For example, liquid metals having high thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity and high volumetric heat capacity can be used. Some examples of liquid metals that can be used in an embodiment of the invention include mercury, gallium, sodium potassium eutectic alloy (78% sodium, 22% potassium by mass), bismuth tin alloy (58% bismuth, 42% tin by mass), bismuth lead alloy (55% bismuth, 45% lead) etc. Bismuth based alloys are generally used at high temperatures (40 to 140° C.). Pure indium can be used at temperatures above 156° C. (i.e., the melting point of indium).</p>

In general, any of a variety of placements may be suitable. Typically, form factor, power supply proximity, EMI, thermal compatibility and other factors specific to a particular design will suggest an appropriate placement.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> depicts a counterflow thermoelectric cooler configuration <b>701</b> in which a single closed-cycle thermal transfer fluid loop traverses both hot- and cold-sides of a thermoelectric array. For economy of description, structures and configurations that are identical, common with or generally similar to those described with reference to a previously described configuration (or suitable for inclusion therein) are not again described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Instead, we highlight the major structural and/or operational changes.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the illustrated configuration, a single closed-cycle thermal transfer fluid loop traverses both hot- and cold-sides of a thermoelectric array. As a result, the configuration allows thermal transfer fluid motivation using a single pump, such as pump <b>720</b>. As before, we assume that the thermal transfer fluid in loop <b>751</b> is a liquid metal or other conductive fluid or slurry and that pump <b>720</b> includes an electromagnetic pump, such as a magnetofluiddynamic pump described elsewhere herein. In some realizations, the thermal transfer fluid is an alloy of gallium and indium. However, as before, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other thermal transfer fluids and/or pump configurations may be employed in other realizations.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a closed-cycle fluid loop <b>751</b> includes portions <b>751</b>A, <b>751</b>B, <b>751</b>C and <b>751</b>D in thermal communication with hot ends and portions <b>751</b>E, <b>751</b>F, <b>751</b>G and <b>751</b>H in thermal communication with cold ends of respective thermoelectric modules <b>711</b>A, <b>711</b>B, <b>711</b>C and <b>711</b>D. In the illustrated cooling configuration, heat is transferred from hot ends of respective thermoelectric modules to the liquid metal thermal transfer fluid flow in the closed-cycle fluid loop. Liquid metal thermal transfer fluid enters portion <b>751</b>A of the closed cycle fluid loop <b>751</b> at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>. As the fluid flows through portions <b>751</b>A, <b>751</b>B, <b>751</b>C and <b>751</b>D, heat is transferred from hot end ends of respective thermoelectric modules and the fluid exits portion <b>751</b>D at a temperature T<sub>H</sub>. From there, the liquid metal thermal transfer fluid flows past or through heat exchanger <b>731</b>, giving up thermal energy and eventually arriving at the cold-side portion of closed-cycle loop <b>751</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">After passing through recuperator <b>740</b>, liquid metal thermal transfer fluid enters portion <b>751</b>E at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>. As the fluid flows through portions <b>751</b>E, <b>751</b>F, <b>751</b>G and <b>751</b>H of loop <b>751</b>, heat is transferred from the fluid to cold ends of respective thermoelectric modules <b>711</b>D, <b>711</b>C, <b>711</b>B and <b>711</b>A. Liquid metal thermal transfer fluid exits portion <b>751</b>H of loop <b>751</b> at a temperature T<sub>C</sub>, flowing past or through heat exchanger <b>732</b> and picking up thermal energy from the cooled workpiece <b>750</b>, typically a microprocessor, communications integrated circuit, optoelectronic device or array, laser or high power density device. Flow continues through recuperator <b>740</b>, and back to thermoelectric array <b>710</b>. After passing through recuperator <b>740</b>, liquid metal thermal transfer fluid reenters portion <b>751</b>A of loop <b>751</b> at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>, thereby completing the closed cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the illustrated configuration, flow of thermal transfer fluid through loop <b>751</b> is motivated by a single pump <b>720</b>. As before, placement of pump <b>720</b> is merely illustrative. In general, any of a variety of placements may be suitable. Typically, form factor, power supply proximity, EMI, thermal compatibility and other factors specific to a particular design will suggest an appropriate placement. Of course, multiple pumps may be employed if desired and a complete system may include multiple closed-cycle fluid loops without departing from the general design principals illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. For example, multiple stages of cooling, heating or thermal transfer may be provided each with at least one respective closed cycle fluid loop. Also, multiple instances of a configuration such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> may be arranged in parallel such that each includes a single closed-cycle thermal transfer fluid loop traverses both hot- and cold-sides of its respective thermoelectric array. These and other variations will be understood in the context of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates an alternative configuration <b>701</b>B in which fluid path <b>751</b>B is instead configured as an open cycle pathway. Flow in fluid path <b>751</b>B is from a source <b>798</b> to a sink <b>797</b>. As before, in those configurations in which source and sink draw from and return to a body <b>799</b> of sufficient thermal mass, source <b>698</b> and sink <b>697</b> may originate from and terminate in a same pool of thermal transfer fluid. However, more generally, there need not be any common body relationship between source <b>798</b> and sink <b>797</b>. Configurations in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> typically employ a thermal transfer fluid other than a liquid metal and suitable pump <b>720</b>B configurations will, in general, depend on characteristics of the fluid path <b>751</b>B thermal transfer fluid. Since fluid path <b>751</b>B no longer constitutes a closed-loop, heat exchanger <b>731</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts another variation in which hot-side and cold-side flows through a closed-cycle thermal transfer system are commingled. As before, structures and configurations that are identical, common with or generally similar to those described with reference to a previously described configuration (or suitable for inclusion therein) are not again described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the illustrated configuration, a closed-cycle flow of thermal transfer fluid path traverses both hot- and cold-sides of a thermoelectric array. As with the prior configuration, a single pump can suffice to motivate flow of the thermal transfer fluid. However, unlike the prior configuration, the motivated flow is split for hot- and cold-side portions of the closed-cycle fluid path and rejoined after flow past a respective heat exchanger (e.g., heat exchanger <b>831</b> for flow exiting the hot side portion and heat exchangers <b>832</b> for flow exiting the cold side portion).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the illustrated configuration, rejoining occurs at recuperator <b>840</b> in which flows from the hot- and cold-side portions are commingled. Generally, a simple pool recuperator may be employed in which thermal transfer fluid flows of dissimilar temperatures enter, conductive and/or convective heat transfer occurs, and one or more fluid flows exit at (or about) a recuperated mean temperature, T<sub>R</sub>. However, given the heat transfer characteristics of liquid metal thermal transfer fluids, a simple commingling of flows thereof (e.g., in the flow path that includes pump <b>820</b>) may exchange heat adequately to achieve a resulting T<sub>R </sub>flow without substantial localized thermal variations. As a result in some realizations, recuperative heat transfer may devolve to that achievable in a commingled flow portion of the closed-cycle fluid path (with or without flow path structures to accentuate mixing or turbulent flow). In such cases, the distinct pool illustrated as recuperator <b>840</b> may be unnecessary and may be omitted. In such configurations, the commingled flow portion constitutes the recuperator. Of course, if a distinct recuperator is provided, rejoining of flows could occur before entry to any such recuperator. In such case, fluid flowing from hot and cold sides of thermoelectric array <b>801</b> would be at least partially mixed even prior to entry and such a recuperator could be configured to damp out any remaining localized thermal variations. These and other variations will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a closed-cycle fluid loop includes hot-side portions in thermal communication with hot ends of respective thermoelectric modules (such as TE module <b>811</b>) and cold-side portions in thermal communication with cold ends of respective thermoelectric modules. In the illustrated cooling configuration, liquid metal thermal transfer fluid enters both hot-side and cold-side portions of the closed cycle fluid loop at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>. As fluid flows through hot-side portions, heat is transferred from hot ends of respective thermoelectric modules and the fluid exits at a temperature T<sub>H</sub>. From there, the liquid metal thermal transfer fluid flows past or through heat exchanger <b>831</b>, giving up thermal energy and eventually rejoining flow from the cold-side portion of the closed-cycle fluid path. As fluid flows through cold-side portions, heat is transferred from the fluid to cold ends of respective thermoelectric modules and the fluid exits at a temperature T<sub>C</sub>, flowing past or through heat exchangers <b>832</b> and picking up thermal energy from the cooled workpieces <b>850</b>. Depiction of multiple work pieces <b>850</b> in a series flow configuration is purely illustrative. Single workpiece and other multiple workpiece flow topologies are envisioned in this and other ones of the illustrated thermoelectric loop configurations. In the particular configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, flow eventually rejoins that from the hot-side portion of the closed-cycle fluid path and arrives back at thermoelectric array <b>810</b> at a temperature T<sub>R</sub>, thereby completing the closed cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts a thermoelectric cooler configuration <b>901</b> in which temporal integration of thermoelectric action is exploited. Forced fluid flow into heat exchanger <b>941</b> and <b>942</b> reservoirs is intermittent, introducing thermal transfer fluid of nominal temperature T<sub>R </sub>into respective reservoirs and allowing an amount thermal transfer fluid to dwell in therein and transfer heat from or to the respective hot or cold side of thermoelectric module <b>911</b>. As before, thermal transfer fluid enters the portions of the closed cycle fluid pathway in communication with thermoelectric module <b>911</b> at a temperature T<sub>R </sub>and exits at T<sub>H </sub>or T<sub>C</sub>. Integration of thermoelectric action of the single thermoelectric module <b>911</b> occurs over time (i.e., over the dwell time of thermal transfer fluid in respective reservoirs <b>941</b> and <b>942</b>. Since only a single generally isothermal TE module is illustrated, counterflow is unnecessary and the illustrated flow topology has been simplified accordingly. In other configurations, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, counterflow may be desirable and can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Flows from the hot- and cold-side reservoirs <b>941</b> and <b>942</b> are eventually commingled in a recuperator (e.g., recuperator <b>940</b>). As before, any of a variety of recuperators may be employed. For example, a simple pool recuperator may be employed in which thermal transfer fluid flows of dissimilar temperatures enter, conductive and/or convective heat transfer occurs, and one or more fluid flows exit at (or about) a recuperated mean temperature, T<sub>R</sub>. Also as before, a simple commingling of flows of liquid metal thermal transfer fluid (e.g., without a distinct pool recuperator structure), may exchange heat adequately to achieve the desired recuperated (T<sub>R</sub>) flow.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As before, we assume that the thermal transfer fluid is a liquid metal or other conductive fluid or slurry and that pump <b>920</b> includes one or more electromagnetic pumps, such as a magnetofluiddynamic pump described elsewhere herein. In the illustrated configuration, it can be desirable to at least partially synchronize operation of pump <b>920</b> with that of thermoelectric module <b>911</b>. For example, in some realizations, instantaneous current demands can be reduced by driving thermoelectric module <b>911</b> and an electromagnetic pump realization of pump <b>920</b> in differing intervals or phases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates one such configuration or mode of operation in which thermoelectric current (I<sub>TE</sub>) and pump current (I<sub>EM</sub>) demands occur in alternating phases of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">To emphasize use of the temporal integration, a single TE module is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. However, more generally, both spatial and temporal integration of thermoelectric action may be exploited in some realizations. See e.g., the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in which both temporal and spatial integration of thermoelectric action are exploited.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts a counterflow thermoelectric cooler configuration <b>1001</b> in which intermittent or discontinuous flows of thermal transfer fluid result in both temporal and spatial integration of thermoelectric action of thermoelectric array <b>1010</b>. The illustrated configuration is patterned after configuration previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in which hot-side and cold-side flows through a closed-cycle thermal transfer system a commingled. However, more generally, any of the previously illustrated counterflow loop configurations can be adapted (as now described) to incorporate temporal integration.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the particular configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a closed-cycle path for thermal transfer fluid flow splits to traverse both hot- and cold-sides of a thermoelectric array. Thermal transfer fluid of the hot side flow dwells momentarily at respective heat exchanger reservoirs (<b>1041</b>) and accumulates heat from hot-sides of respective thermoelectric modules <b>1011</b>. Similarly, thermal transfer fluid of the cold side flow dwells momentarily at respective heat exchanger reservoirs (<b>1042</b>) and releases heat to cold-sides of respective thermoelectric modules <b>1011</b>. As with the preceding configuration, a single pump can suffice to motivate flow (intermittently or discontinuously) and may be operated such that thermoelectric current (I<sub>TE</sub>) and pump current (I<sub>EM</sub>) demands occur in alternating phases of operation. Additionally, while a merged commingled flow of thermal transfer fluid configuration illustrated, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that loop configurations akin to those presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> (distinct hot-side and cold-side loops) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (single closed-cycle loop traversing both hot- and cold-sides) may also be employed with intermittent or discontinuous fluid flow.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Topological Generalizations</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">While various counterflow thermoelectric array configurations have been illustrated with respect to linear arrangements that allow certain of the inventive concepts herein to be described with clarity, it will be apparent, based on the description herein, that a variety of topological generalizations may be applied to the linear counterflow arrangements illustrated. Two-dimensional arrays of thermoelectric modules are illustrative. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-18</figref> are plan view illustrations of a variety of two dimensional flow topologies that, like the linear counterflow arrangements previously illustrated, provide substantially uniform thermal differentials across respective array elements (or substantially isothermal groups thereof) during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In describing these topological variations, we omit the loop configuration, heat exchanger, pump and recuperator details of the previously illustrated configurations, focusing instead on flow topologies in a small portion of the closed cycle fluid loop (or loops) of the thermoelectric system configurations described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>. In the illustrated two-dimensional portions of overall flow topologies, respective hot-side flows (T<sub>R </sub>to T<sub>H</sub>) and cold-side flows (T<sub>R </sub>to T<sub>C</sub>) are in thermal communication with thermoelectric modules of exemplary two-dimensional arrays thereof. Accordingly, based on the description herein of these two-dimensional topologies, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate a variety of multidimensional thermoelectric array generalizations of the configurations previously illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some configurations (including linear configurations and two dimensional traversals such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), counterdirectional fluid flows may be employed to achieve substantially uniform thermal differentials. In some configurations, other counterflow topologies (including crossflows) may be employed. Generally, an N-stage array or subarray may provide substantially uniform thermal differentials if counterflow topology is structured so that, at any particular thermoelectric module, the impinging hot-side and cold-side flows respectively traverse x and N−1−x stages {x:0≦x&lt;N} enroute to the particular thermoelectric module.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates in a top-side plan view, a simple counterflow topology for a 2×2 array of thermoelectric modules. Cold-side flow <b>1251</b> and hot-side flow <b>1252</b> will be understood to be in thermal communication with respective cold-sides and hot-sides of thermoelectric modules <b>1211</b>. As with the linear arrangements previously described, substantially uniform thermal differentials may be achieved across each of the illustrated thermoelectric modules <b>1211</b> based on the illustrated flow topology.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates in a top-side, plan view, another counterflow topology for a simple 2×2 array of thermoelectric elements. Cold-side flows <b>1351</b> and hot-side flows <b>1352</b> are in thermal communication with respective cold-sides and hot-sides of thermoelectric modules A, B, C and D. Substantially uniform thermal differentials can be achieved across each of the thermoelectric modules based on the illustrated flow topology.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> illustrates two topological transformations of the counterflows for the previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The transformations that allow inflows and outflows to be conveniently grouped for efficient routing in a larger system configuration. As before, cold-side flows <b>1351</b> and hot-side flows <b>1352</b> are in thermal communication with respective cold-sides and hot-sides of thermoelectric modules A, B, C and D.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> generalize the previously illustrated counterflow topologies to larger arrays of thermoelectric elements. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> generalizes the previously illustrated flow topology for a 2×2 array to that suitable for an n×n array. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> generalize the flow topology to that suitable for array without equal number of rows and columns.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">While the invention(s) is(are) described with reference to various implementations and exploitations, it will be understood that these embodiments are illustrative and that the scope of the invention(s) is not limited to them. Many variations, modifications, additions, and improvements are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">For example, while operation of certain configurations has been described in the context of liquid metal thermal transfer fluids and magnetofluiddynamic (MFD) pump configurations, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that alterative thermal transfer fluids including conductive thermal transfer fluids (useful with MFD pump configurations) and non-conductive thermal transfer fluids and other pump configurations (MFD, electromagnetic or otherwise) may be employed. Recuperated flow thermoelectric array configurations have been described with reference to counterflow topologies; however, it will be apparent that counterflow topologies are unnecessary in configurations that employ a single thermoelectric element or module and, more generally, may be omitted in certain array configurations, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Although many of the illustrated configurations are described in the context of a high power density device (HPDD) cooling configuration, it will be apparent that other recuperated fluid cycle thermoelectric heat transfer configurations (including cooling, heating, cooling/heating, thermal regulation, etc.) are all contemplated and that HPDD applications are for illustration only. In general, suitable cooling and/or heating targets are varied and may include targets that are neither dense nor thermal sources. In particular, exploitations of the described thermoelectric systems can include air conditioning and refrigeration.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that terms such as cold, colder, hot, hotter and the like are relative terms and do not imply any particular temperature, temperature range or relation to any particular ambient or quiescent temperature. While loop configurations have been described without regard flow to any particular flow timings, rates or the like, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate suitable adaptations for particular thermal loads and heat transfer characteristics of particular heat exchangers and/or thermal transfer fluids employed in a given exploitation.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A variety of alternate placements of components (including pumps, heat exchangers, recuperators, etc.) and thermoelectric module designs are consistent with the preceding description and claims that follow. In particular, thermoelectric modules may include one or more thermoelectric elements (or couples) in a substantially isothermal configuration. The term “thermoelectric” (e.g., thermoelectric module, couple, element, device, material etc.) is meant in the broadest sense of the term in which thermal potential is traded for electromagnetic potential (or vice versa), and therefore includes those thermoelectric configurations which exploit Peltier or Seebeck effects, as well as those that operate based upon Thomson, quantum tunneling, thermoionic, magneto caloric or other similar effect or combination of effects. Additionally, while some configurations have been described primarily with reference to continuous unidirectional flow of thermal transfer fluids, it will be understood that continuous, semi-continuous, unidirectional, substantially unidirectional, variable direction, variable flow rate, intermittent and/or pulsed flows may employed in some realizations without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention(s).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Certain materials or material systems are commonly employed in configurations that exploit particular thermoelectric-type effects. In general, appropriate material selections are based on the particular thermoelectric-type effects exploited and may be optimized for operating temperatures, compatibility with other materials and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">More generally, plural instances may be provided for components, operations or structures described herein as a single instance. Finally, boundaries between various components and particular operations are illustrated in the context of specific illustrative configurations. Other allocations of functionality are envisioned and may fall within the scope of the invention(s). In general, structures and functionality presented as separate components in the exemplary configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements may fall within the scope of the invention(s).</p>
