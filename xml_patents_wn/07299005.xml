<p id="p-0002" num="0001">I. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention is directed to field of wireless communications. More specifically, this is invention is directed to radio frequency repeaters with automated frequency (block, band and/or communication channel) selection.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">II. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication is an ever growing industry. Wireless communication devices are applied in numerous applications, such as cellular communications, wireless (computer) networking, data delivery, and any number of other uses. For applications that employ bi-directional communication, such as cellular communications and wireless networking, signals are sent and received from at least two points. In the context of cellular communications, signals are normally communicated between a base transceiver station (e.g., a radio tower) and one or more mobile devices (e.g., cellular phones, wireless personal digital assistants, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, various factors may contribute to the attenuation of such signals and, depending on the proximity of the mobile device to the base transceiver station (BTS), signal quality may be inadequate for reliable communications. In this regard, numerous factors may contribute to the attenuation of these signals, such as buildings, trees, hills, other radio frequency signals, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One solution that has been employed to compensate for this attenuation of radio frequency (wireless) signal quality for signals communicated between mobile devices and BTSs, is the use of wireless signal repeaters (which may also be termed radio frequency repeaters or consumer electronics repeaters). Such repeaters receive signals from a BTS and then amplify those signals and retransmit them to the mobile device. Likewise, such repeaters receive signals from mobile devices, amplify those signals and retransmit them to the BTS. Such devices, as currently implemented, have certain drawbacks, however.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, some repeaters simply amplify and retransmit all signals that they receive across a wide range of frequencies, such as the entire spectrum of cellular communication frequencies. Because only certain bandwidths are typically used for cellular communications in a given area (not the entire available spectrum), such an approach may result in unwanted signals and/or noise being repeated. This may result in interference with the desired signals, consume more power than is desirable, and result in lower signal quality than is possible for the signals of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other repeaters require that a user manually configure the repeater for use, which may require interfacing a computer with the repeater or repeatedly pressing a button to shift through frequencies. Such devices may be complicated to set up, difficult to maintain and require technical knowledge not common to most consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still other repeaters reduce the frequency bandwidth that is amplified by mixing received signals with differential mixers prior to amplifying the signals. Such an approach may result in noise being introduced into the repeated signals due to the mixing and un-mixing employed by such approaches. Based on the foregoing, alternative approaches for receiving, amplifying and transmitting wireless (radio frequency signals) are desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an exemplary embodiment, a wireless repeater for receiving, amplifying and transmitting one or more wireless signals comprises a signal processing device for determining one or more attributes of a wireless signal received from a mobile. The signal processing device may comprise a digital signal processor or, alternatively, an RF power measurement device. The repeater further comprises a memory for storing a reference list that includes a list of one or more preferred frequency bandwidths to be received, amplified and transmitted. The reference list, for the exemplary embodiment, comprises a lookup table.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The repeater also comprises a controller coupled with the signal processing device for comparing the one or more attributes of the wireless signal from the mobile with the reference list. Depending on particular embodiment, the controller and the signal processing device may be combined as a single entity. The controller selects a first active set of one or more frequency bandwidths from the preferred frequency bandwidths based on the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The repeater further comprises a first reception filter coupled with the controller, which, responsive to one or more control signals from the controller, filters out signals, communicated to the first reception filter, with frequencies that are not within the first active set of frequency bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The controller also provides for determining a second active set of frequency bandwidths and communicating control signals to a second reception filter to filter out signals received by the repeater that are not within the second active set of frequency bandwidths. The first and second active sets may comprise corresponding reverse-link frequency bandwidths and forward-link frequency bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The exemplary repeater may overcome some of the disadvantages of current repeaters. For example, repeating a limited number of frequency bandwidths will reduce the radio frequency interference caused by the repeater, as well as reducing the amount of power consumed. Furthermore, the automated tuning capability of the exemplary repeater overcomes the disadvantages of tuners requiring significant user intervention to effect setup and tuning of such devices. Still further, because the signals repeated by the exemplary repeater are not mixed, the likelihood of introducing noise from one signal into another signal is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These as well as other advantages of various aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail, so as not to obscure the present invention. The operations of methods described herein may, in some instances, be implemented in other sequences. Therefore, the sequences discussed and illustrated herein are not limiting in scope.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is noted, that while this disclosure describes exemplary embodiments generally in the context of cellular communications, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention may be employed to repeat wireless signals in other types of communication systems, such as communication systems in accordance with the 802.11 wireless LAN protocol, Bluetooth, and cordless telephone communications, as some examples.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Exemplary Use of a Wireless Repeater</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a drawing illustrating a common implementation of a wireless repeater in a cellular communication system is shown. For cellular communications, such as in a code division multiple access system (CDMA), “forward-link” signals are transmitted from a base transceiver station (BTS) <b>105</b> to a mobile device <b>110</b>, such as a cell phone, over an air interface (e.g., radio frequency interface) <b>115</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile device <b>110</b> is located inside a building <b>120</b>. The structure of the building <b>120</b> may result in substantial attenuation of signals transmitted by the BTS <b>105</b> over the air interface <b>115</b>. Therefore, the quality of those signals may be inadequate to establish reliable communications between the BTS <b>105</b> and the mobile device <b>110</b>. Likewise, the signals transmitted from the mobile device <b>110</b> over the air interface <b>115</b> may also be substantially attenuated by the structure of the building <b>120</b>, such that the BTS <b>105</b> is unable to receive those signals reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In such a situation, a repeater <b>125</b> may be employed. For this situation, the repeater <b>125</b> typically is coupled with a first antenna that is located along, for example, an outer wall of the building <b>120</b>, so as to reduce the amount of attenuation observed. The BTS <b>105</b> then communicates over the air interface <b>115</b> with the repeater <b>125</b>. Wireless signals from the BTS <b>105</b> are received, amplified and transmitted to the mobile device <b>110</b> by the repeater <b>125</b> (using a second antenna) over the air interface <b>130</b>. The second antenna is typically situated so as to provide RF coverage within the building <b>120</b>. Such signals are commonly referred to as being communicated over a forward-link, which, for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is from the BTS <b>105</b> to the mobile device <b>110</b> via the repeater <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The mobile device <b>110</b> communicates signals to the repeater via the air interface <b>130</b>. Those signals are then amplified and transmitted to the BTS <b>105</b> by the repeater <b>125</b> via the air interface <b>115</b>. Signals from the mobile device <b>110</b> to the BTS <b>105</b> are said to be communicated over a reverse-link. For <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reverse-link is from the mobile device <b>110</b> to the BTS <b>105</b> via the repeater <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Exemplary Repeater with Reverse-Link Tuning</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an implementation of an exemplary wireless repeater, with reverse-link tuning, in a cellular communication network is shown. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a BTS <b>205</b> communicates with the exemplary repeater via an air interface <b>210</b>. Wireless signals are communicated to/from the repeater and the BTS <b>205</b> with a donor antenna <b>215</b>. Such antennas are known and will not be described in detail here. The donor antenna <b>215</b> is coupled with a first duplexor <b>220</b>. The first duplexor <b>220</b> provides for concurrent handling of transmit and receive signals between the BTS <b>205</b> and the repeater using the donor antenna <b>220</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first duplexor <b>220</b> is also coupled to a forward link block <b>225</b> and a reverse-link block <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Forward link signals from the BTS <b>205</b> to the mobile device <b>250</b> may be processed by the forward link block <b>225</b> of the repeater. A repeater with forward-link tuning will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. On the other hand, the reverse link signals from the mobile device <b>250</b> to the BTS <b>205</b> may be processed by the reverse-link block <b>230</b> of the repeater. The reverse-link block <b>230</b> also tunes the repeater, as will be discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further comprises a second duplexor <b>235</b> coupled with the forward link block <b>225</b>, the reverse link block <b>230</b> and a coverage antenna <b>240</b>. The second duplexor <b>235</b> provides for concurrent handling of transmit and receive signals between the mobile device <b>250</b> and the repeater using the coverage antenna <b>240</b>, in like fashion with the first duplexor <b>220</b> for signals between the repeater and the BTS <b>205</b>. The repeater communicates with the mobile device <b>250</b> (via the coverage antenna <b>240</b>) over an air interface <b>245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Wireless signals from the mobile device <b>250</b> are received by the coverage antenna <b>240</b> and then communicated to the second duplexor <b>235</b>. The second duplexor <b>235</b> then communicates those signals to the reverse-link block <b>230</b> for processing. The wireless signals are then received by a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>255</b>, which is employed to improve the signal to noise ratio of signals processed by the reverse-link block <b>255</b>. After processing by the LNA <b>255</b>, the wireless signals received by the coverage antenna <b>240</b> are communicated to a coupler <b>260</b>. A portion of those wireless signals are then transmitted to a signal processing device <b>265</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the repeater is being tuned, such as when the repeater is first powered up or is restarted, a signal processing device <b>265</b> will analyze a wireless signal received from the mobile device <b>250</b>. The signal processing device <b>265</b> then determines one or more attributes of the wireless signal received from the mobile device, such as a frequency of the signal or other information included in the signal. In this regard, the signal processing device <b>265</b> may take a number of forms.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in certain embodiments the signal processing device <b>265</b> may comprise a radio frequency power measurement device. This measurement device is employed to determine a frequency of the wireless signal. The frequency of the wireless signal is then compared with a reference list <b>280</b>, using a controller <b>270</b>, and the results of this comparison are used to tune the repeater, as will be discussed in further detail below. The reference list may be stored in a memory <b>275</b>, which for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is included in the controller <b>270</b>. Alternatively, the memory <b>275</b> may be separate from the controller <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For certain embodiments, the wireless signal from the mobile device may be a carrier signal that is within a frequency bandwidth supported by the repeater, such as a PCS cellular communication band. Alternatively, the wireless signal may be a Bluetooth or an 802.11 wireless LAN signal if the repeater is being employed in a wireless computing network.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As one alternative, the signal processing device <b>265</b> may comprise a digital signal processor (DSP). In such embodiments, the DSP may process the wireless signal from the mobile device <b>250</b> to determine the one or more attributes. For example, if the mobile device <b>250</b> has just been powered on, the signal received by the repeater may comprise an access probe signal. The access probe signal may include information that indicates a carrier frequency and/or frequency band that was last used by the mobile device. This information may then be communicated to the controller <b>270</b> to be compared with the reference list <b>280</b>, which may comprise a lookup table, as is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Based on the comparison of the one or more attributes, as determined by the signal processing device <b>265</b>, with the reference list <b>280</b>, the controller <b>270</b> may determine a first active set of frequency bandwidths that the repeater will receive, amplify and transmit from the mobile device <b>250</b> to the BTS <b>205</b>. Such determinations will be discussed in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Briefly, however, the frequency bandwidths of the first active set may comprise reverse-link PCS bandwidths in the frequency range of 1850 to 1910 MHz, such as one or more 1.25 MHz bandwidths (e.g., a PCS communication channel bandwidth).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller <b>270</b>, based on the above comparison, communicates one or more control signals to a first reception filter <b>285</b>. The first reception filter <b>285</b> then filters out radio frequency signals received by the coverage antenna <b>240</b> that have frequencies that are not within the first active set of frequency bandwidths. In this regard, the first reception filter <b>285</b> may comprise an electronically tunable filter or signal processor. For example, the reception filter <b>285</b> may comprise a plurality of band-pass filters that are enabled by control signals received from the controller <b>270</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the first reception filter <b>285</b> may comprise a DSP or may be implemented by the signal processor <b>265</b> for embodiments that employ a DSP to analyze incoming wireless signals from the mobile device <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may further comprise a second reception filter (not shown) coupled with the donor antenna <b>215</b> via the first duplexor <b>220</b> (and an LNA and a coupler, both not shown). The second reception filter is also coupled with the controller <b>270</b> and receives control signals from the controller <b>270</b>, which correspond with a second active set of frequency bandwidths. For example, in a CDMA cellular communication system, the second active set of frequency bandwidths comprise a set of forward-link communication bandwidths that correspond with the first active set of reverse-link communication bandwidths. For instance, if the first active set includes a reverse-link bandwidth of 1851.25 MHz to 1852.5 MHz, the second active set would include a corresponding forward-link bandwidth of 1931.25 to 1932.25. As is known, for CDMA based PCS communication systems, the reverse-link bandwidths may be between 1850 MHz and 1910 MHz with the corresponding forward-link bandwidths between 1930 MHz and 1990 MHz. That is, the forward-link communication channel bandwidths are offset from their corresponding reverse-link communication channel bandwidths by 80 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In similar fashion as the first reception filter <b>285</b>, the second reception filter filters out signals received with the donor antenna <b>215</b> with frequencies that are not within the second active set of frequency bandwidths. For CDMA based PCS systems, the second active set of bandwidths may be determined by offsetting the reverse-link bandwidths of the first active set by 80 MHz, as noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Depending on the particular embodiment, the wireless repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may be tuned is to repeat contiguous communication channels based on the comparison described above. For instance, the repeater may be tuned to repeat an entire PCS frequency block (e.g. a 15 MHz block, such as the A, B or C PCS frequency blocks, or the 5 MHz D, E or F PCS frequency blocks). Alternatively, the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be tuned, based on the above-described comparison, to a 5 MHz band within one of the 15 MHz A, B and C blocks. Such an approach depends on the particular communication network with which the repeater is employed and the reference list <b>280</b> that is implemented in the repeater.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Because the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is tuned based on comparing one or more attributes of a wireless signal received from the mobile device <b>250</b> with a reference list, some of the disadvantages of current repeaters may be overcome. For example, repeating a limited number of frequency bandwidths will reduce the radio frequency interference caused by the repeater, as well as reducing the amount of power consumed. Furthermore, the automated tuning capability of the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> overcomes the disadvantages of tuners requiring significant user intervention to effect setup and tuning of such devices. Still further, because the signals repeated by the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are not mixed, the likelihood of introducing noise from one signal into another signal is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reverse link block <b>230</b> of the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> still further comprises a power amp <b>290</b>. The power amp receives filtered signals from the reception filter <b>285</b> and amplifies those signals. The amplified signals are then communicated to the first duplexor <b>220</b>, and then to the BTS <b>205</b> via the donor antenna <b>215</b> and the air interface <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The wireless repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> still additionally comprises a display device <b>295</b> for displaying a result of the comparison of the one or more attributes of a wireless signal with the reference list. Such displaying will be discussed in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Exemplary Repeater with Forward-Link Tuning</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an implementation of an exemplary wireless repeater, with forward-link tuning, in a cellular communication network is shown. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, components of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that are analogous with components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are referenced with like 300 series reference numbers as the 200 series numbers of the analogous components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

In this regard, the BTS <b>310</b>, the air interface <b>310</b>, the donor antenna <b>315</b>, the duplexors <b>320</b> and <b>335</b>, the coverage antenna <b>340</b>, the air interface <b>345</b> and the mobile device <b>350</b> operate in a substantially similar fashion as their analogous components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is tuned based on signals processed in the reverse-link block <b>230</b>, the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is tuned based on signals processed in the forward-link block (e.g., wireless signals received from the BTS <b>205</b>). In this respect, the forward link signals are received by the donor antenna <b>315</b> and communicated to the forward-link block by the first duplexor <b>320</b>. The signals are then processed by the LNA <b>355</b> to improve their signal to noise ratio and then communicated to the signal processor and controller (processor) <b>365</b> via the coupler <b>360</b>. In comparison to the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a combined signal processor and controller in the form of processor <b>365</b>. It will, of course, be appreciated that such a combined device may also be employed in the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the processor <b>365</b> may comprise a microprocessor device with digital signal processing capabilities, or may comprise a DSP. Alternatively, the processor <b>365</b> may comprise a CDMA mobile device chipset for analyzing signals received by the repeater from the BTS <b>305</b> in order to tune the repeater. In the exemplary embodiment, the wireless signal received from the BTS is a synch-channel signal. As is known, for CDMA systems, a synch-channel signal is transmitted on a communication channel frequency within, for example, the PCS bandwidth using a Walsh code of 32. Such techniques are known and, therefore, are not discussed further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The synch-channel signal is a repeating signal that includes a synch-channel message that comprises a system identification (system ID) and a network ID with which the BTS <b>305</b> transmitting the synch-channel message is associated. Such synch-channel messages are also known and will not be described in further detail here.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The processor <b>365</b> determines one or more attributes of the synch-channel signal, such as its frequency, the system ID and/or the network ID, which are included in the synch-channel message, as described above. The system ID typically identifies a wireless communication service provider, while the network ID identifies a particular geography for a respective portion of that provider's network. For example, a system ID of 1039 and a network ID of 448 may correspond to Sprint's PCS network in Kansas City, Mo. Furthermore, the frequency of the signal from the BTS <b>305</b> will be of a frequency that is used by the Sprint network in the Kansas City area, providing further information for tuning the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After the controller <b>365</b> determines the one or more attributes of the wireless signal received from the BTS, those attributes are compared with a reference list, which for this particular embodiment takes the form of a preferred roaming list (PRL) <b>380</b>, such as is utilized by mobile devices for facilitating communications with the BTS <b>305</b> and other BTSs, as is known. The PRL may be stored in the controller <b>365</b>, such as in a memory, or may be stored elsewhere, depending on the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Based on the comparison of the attributes determined by the controller <b>365</b>, a first active set of one or more frequency bandwidths is determined based on a comparison of the attributes with the PRL. The controller then communicates one or more control signals to a reception filter <b>385</b>, which then filters out signals that are communicated to the repeater via the donor antenna <b>305</b> that have frequencies that are not within the first active set of frequency bandwidths. Further, the controller also communicates with a second reception filter (not shown) in the reverse-link block <b>330</b> to filter out signals that are not in a second active set of frequency bandwidths. For the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second active set of frequency bandwidths comprises a set of reverse-link bandwidths that correlate with a set of forward-link bandwidths included in the first active set. For this embodiment, the forward-link and reverse-link bandwidths are in the PCS frequency ranges of 1930 MHz to 1990 MHz (forward-link) and 1850 MHz and 1910 MHz (reverse-link).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In similar fashion as the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a display <b>395</b> for displaying the results of the comparison of the one or more attributes of the wireless signal received from the BTS <b>305</b> with the reference list (e.g., the preferred roaming list <b>380</b>). Such displays will be discussed in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Exemplary Lookup Table for Reverse-Link Tuning</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a table illustrating an exemplary lookup table <b>400</b> that may be used with the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for reverse-link tuning is shown. It will be appreciated that this table is exemplary and that other configurations may be used and additional or fewer parameters may be included in the table.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The table <b>400</b> includes three columns <b>405</b>, <b>410</b> and <b>415</b>. The column <b>405</b> includes a list of preferred frequencies for reverse link communications, which may be determined based on a number of factors, such as wireless carriers that are supported by the repeater, for example. In the lookup table <b>400</b>, a column <b>410</b> includes a list of frequency bands that corresponds with preferred frequencies listed in the column <b>405</b>. The column <b>415</b> includes a list of active sets of communication channels (e.g., PCS communication channels) that correspond with each of the preferred frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">By way of example, if the signal processing device <b>265</b> of the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> determines that the frequency of a wireless signal received from the mobile device <b>250</b> is of frequency F<b>1</b>, as in row <b>420</b>, the repeater may tune itself to channels A<b>1</b>, A<b>4</b> and A<b>7</b> (communication channels in the PCS A block) using the reception filter <b>285</b> to filer unwanted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alternatively, if the received signal is of frequency F<b>2</b>, the repeater may be tuned to repeat channels B<b>3</b> and B<b>5</b> (which are sub channels in the PCS B block frequencies) in correspondence with row <b>425</b> of the lookup table <b>400</b>. Likewise, if the received signal is of frequency F<b>3</b>, the repeater may be tuned to channels C<b>1</b>, C<b>7</b>, C<b>8</b> and C<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the signal received from the mobile device <b>250</b> that is processed by the signal processing device <b>265</b> is an access probe, a last used communication channel frequency and or frequency block of the mobile device may be determined from the access probe. The last used communication channel frequency/block may then be compared with the lookup table <b>400</b> to determine the active set of frequency bandwidths to be amplified and transmitted by the repeater.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Exemplary Preferred Roaming List</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a table illustrating an exemplary PRL <b>500</b> that may be used with the repeater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for forward-link tuning is shown. It will be appreciated that this table is exemplary and that other configurations may be used and additional or fewer parameters may be included in the PRL.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The PRL <b>500</b> includes five columns <b>505</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>515</b>, <b>520</b> and <b>525</b>. The column <b>505</b> includes a list of preferred frequencies for forward-link communications (again, this list is exemplary). In the PRL <b>500</b>, column <b>510</b> includes a list of system IDs that corresponds with the preferred frequencies listed in column <b>505</b>. Column <b>515</b> includes a list of network IDs that corresponds with the preferred frequencies listed in the column <b>505</b> and the system IDs listed in column <b>510</b>. Column <b>520</b> includes a list of geographic locations that correspond with the system IDs listed in the column <b>510</b> and the network IDs listed in the column <b>515</b>. The column <b>525</b> includes a list of active sets (frequency bandwidths) of communication channels (e.g., PCS communication channels) that correspond with the previous columns <b>505</b>-<b>520</b> of the PRL <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">By way of example, if the processor <b>365</b> determines that the frequency of a wireless signal received from the mobile device <b>350</b> is of frequency F<b>1</b>, the system ID in a synch-channel message is SID<b>1</b> and the network ID is “NID<b>1</b>”, the repeater will determine that it is operating in Kansas City on, for example, Sprint's PCS network (SID<b>1</b>), in accordance with row <b>530</b> of the PRL <b>500</b>. The forward-link (and reverse-link) would then be tuned to channels A<b>1</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>7</b> and D<b>1</b> (using the 80 MHz offset). The inclusion of D<b>1</b> in the repeated channels may be due to high level of wireless communication traffic on the A band for the particular network with which the repeater is being employed (in this instance, Sprint's Kansas City network). Rows <b>535</b>, <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provide additional examples of PRL entries for determining an active set of forward-link frequencies.</p>

In this respect, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates a display <b>605</b> that reads “TUNED FROM MOBILE PCS BLOCK A.” A repeater (such as the repeater of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) displaying this message has been tuned based on a signal received from a mobile device (such as an access probe) and is repeating all channels within the PCS ‘A’ block.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> illustrates a display <b>615</b> that reads “NO SIGNAL.” Such a display message may indicate that the repeater is not receiving any reverse-link and/or forward-link signals that it may employ to accomplish tuning the repeater.
