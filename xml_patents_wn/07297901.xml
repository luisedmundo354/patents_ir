<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-0081466, filed Nov. 18, 2003, which application is incorporated herein fully by this reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a PTC element module and a pre-heater for vehicles including the same, and more particularly, to a PTC element module for pre-heating the air in vehicles using heat generation of a PTC element and a pre-heater for vehicles including the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general vehicles, in order to heat the interior of the vehicles, dehumidify or defrost a front window of the vehicles, a heating system using heat energy of coolant heated by engine is installed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of this heating system, since the coolant flowing around the engine is introduced into a heater after the engine is operated, it should be time consuming to heat the interior after the coolant is heated. Therefore, after starting the engine, a driver must wait in cold for an interval long enough to heat the interior.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, Korean Utility Model Publication No. 20-144945 discloses a preheating system using a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) element in order to solve the problems. A structure of the preheating system will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an heater for vehicles including a plurality of PTC elements <b>20</b> for generating heat by supplying power, a plurality of isolation members <b>13</b> having through-holes for receiving the PTC elements are installed in a frame <b>11</b> in parallel with each other, a plurality of radiator fins <b>15</b> are installed between the respective isolation members <b>13</b> to facilitate a heat exchange, terminals (for example, negative terminals) at one side of each PTC element are integrated as one member to be connected to a power source, and terminals (for example, positive terminals) at the other side of each PTC element are connected to the power source through the medium of individually operating switches (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, plates <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are disposed between the isolation members <b>13</b> and the radiator fins <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this connection, a reference numeral“<b>19</b>” designates terminal plates installed at front and rear sides of the frame <b>11</b>, one end of the plate <b>17</b> is connected to the terminal plate to form one negative terminal together with the frame, and one end of the plate <b>18</b> is connected to a wire (not shown) to form one positive terminal, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the aforementioned conventional pre-heater for vehicles, since components constituting the pre-heater are not modulized, assembly operations should be individually performed, thereby lowering productivity and operation performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention and the above basic concept will be described with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate an overall structure of a pre-heater for vehicles in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the pre-heater for vehicles in accordance with the present invention includes: a PTC element module <b>100</b> having a PTC element, heat fin assemblies <b>260</b> disposed parallel to both sides of the PTC element module <b>100</b> respectively, negative terminals <b>300</b> disposed parallel to the heat fin assemblies <b>260</b>, frames <b>600</b> and <b>900</b> respectively fastened to lateral ends of a combined body including the PTC element module <b>100</b>, the heat fin assemblies <b>260</b>, and the negative terminals <b>300</b>, and housings <b>400</b> and <b>800</b> respectively fastened to both longitudinal ends of a combined body including the PTC element module <b>100</b>, the heat fin assemblies <b>260</b>, the negative terminals <b>300</b>, and the frames <b>600</b> and <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The respective components for constituting the pre-heater for vehicles in accordance with the present invention will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate a structure of a PTC element assembly <b>100</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the PTC element assembly <b>100</b>A includes a strip-shaped positive terminal <b>130</b> having fastening holes <b>132</b> formed along its longitudinal direction and ribs <b>131</b> projected from front and rear edges of the fastening holes <b>132</b>. In order to form the PTC element assembly, a thin layer (having a thickness of about 0.8 mm) for forming the positive terminal <b>130</b> may be folded into halves, and an upper half of the assembly <b>100</b>A has the fastening holes <b>132</b> for inserting the PTC element and the ribs <b>131</b> formed at the edges of the fastening holes <b>132</b>. The ribs <b>131</b> have shapes that the front and rear edges of the fastening holes <b>132</b> are bended up.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When there is no difficulty in a manufacturing process, the ribs <b>131</b> may be formed at right and left edges of the fastening holes <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, a thin ring-shaped insert insulator <b>120</b> is disposed to be closely inserted into the ribs <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, a PTC element <b>140</b> is inserted between the ribs <b>131</b> of the positive terminal <b>130</b> through the medium of the insert insulator <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, the insert insulator <b>120</b> and the PTC element <b>140</b> are closely fitted between the ribs <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when side surfaces of the ribs <b>131</b> are pressed inward by a swaging machine and so on, the ribs <b>131</b> are deformed, and simultaneously, the insert insulator <b>120</b> is pushed inward to rigidly fasten the PTC element <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Meanwhile, a first heat fin plate <b>220</b> is closely fastened to an upper surface of the PTC element <b>140</b>, and a corrugated heat fin <b>200</b> is installed on the first heat fin plate <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Preferably, the heat fin <b>200</b> and the first heat fin plate <b>220</b> are made of a light material such as aluminum having a high thermal conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The heat fin <b>200</b> may be fixedly fastened to the first heat fin plate <b>220</b> by a spot welding method.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the other hand, when the first heat fin plate <b>220</b> is formed in a channel shape and longitudinal grooves are formed along both inner sides of the channel, since a front end of the heat fin <b>200</b> may be guided along the channel, the heat fin <b>200</b> may be detachably installed at the fin plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, a second heat fin plate <b>230</b> and a heat fin <b>200</b> are fastened to a lower surface of the positive terminal <b>130</b> through the medium of an entire surface insulator <b>150</b>.
