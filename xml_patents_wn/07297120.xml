<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The field of art to which this invention relates is in the monitoring of certain parameters and transfer of such information to facilitate the diagnosis or therapeutic treatment for patients suffering from respiratory diseases, such as asthma or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). More specifically, the present invention monitors the pH level of a patient's breath and provides data for determining the frequency and volume of a therapeutic dose to be administered to the patients' airways.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, it has been reported that the monitoring of acidity or pH of a patient's breath could help physicians in estimating the degree of air passage inflammation, now considered a key contributor to asthma, LPR and other respiratory conditions. Asthma is characterized by symptoms of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Manifestations include constriction (the tightening of the muscles around the airways) and inflammation (the swelling and irritation of the airways) that can be triggered through exposure to smoking, dust mites, pets, activity, cold, infection, weather, pollen, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A clinical study of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis and asthma demonstrated more acidic levels in COPD and bronchiectasis patients, which is indicative of the chronic inflammation that these patients experience. This study also observed an increased acidic level measured from the breath of patients suffering from moderate asthma when compared to mild forms of the disease. It was also found that the asthmatics' breath was much more acidic during asthma attacks, but normalized after anti-inflammatory medication was administered.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This data suggests that the monitoring of an asthmatic's breath for pH might be an effective way to measure the degree of inflammation in the air passages. Furthermore, this data suggests that close monitoring of an asthmatic's breath pH could lead to prompt and effective treatment, minimizing the occurrence of asthma attacks and providing overall better asthma management.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is estimated that 18-26 million people in the United Stated suffer from asthmatic conditions ranking this disease as the 8<sup>th </sup>worst chronic condition in the US. It is also believed that over 5.6 million of these asthma sufferers are under the age of 18.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Studies have also shown that gastroesophageal reflux (GER) affects approximately 40% of the US adult population and that 60-80 percent of all asthma patients have GER. Gastro-esophageal reflux is a condition in which gastric acid refluxes from the stomach and into the esophagus. Frequent reflux episodes may result in a potentially severe problem known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GER is the most common cause of dyspepsia or heartburn. GER can also manifest in the micro-aspiration of acid from the esophagus into the airway and lungs, damaging tissue, and causing irritation of the vagus nerve. This irritation of the vagus nerve, which is common to both the esophagus and the bronchial tree, can cause constriction of the airway. Acid reflux above the lower esophageal sphincter can cause anatomical damage and is linked to sleep disordered breathing. It has also been found that bronchial dilator drugs can relax the lower esophageal sphincter and trigger GERD induced asthmatic conditions. Sleep apnea has also been found to trigger reflux events. Testing for GER and the diagnosis of GERD are typically accomplished by measuring pH with catheter based devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These current pH monitoring methods suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) the current method requires an invasive procedure to place a pH measurement catheter or implanted pH measurement capsule in the patient's esophagus, 2) the procedure is not well tolerated by some patients, 3) the catheter or capsule placement must be performed by a physician, 4) the capsule cannot be placed above the Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) to measure airway pH, and 5) there are no defined standards for evaluation of pH above the UES.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need in this art for a novel, pH diagnostic and monitoring system with electronic or wireless communication linked to a processing receiver that can also be used to activate a therapeutic nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier for treating asthmatic or other respiratory conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention pertains to an invention for monitoring the pH level of a patient's breath in a specially designed mask or sensor module that provides a means for transferring this data to a processing receiver for diagnosing disease abnormalities and determining the frequency and volume of a therapeutic dose to be administered to a patient, typically with a respiratory condition such as asthma. Monitoring of a patient's breath chemistry is provided by a system that includes a miniaturized pH sensor, provides for real-time monitoring of patient airway pH values, and utilizes solid state cooling to precipitate moisture from a patient's breath.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The specially designed respiratory mask or sensor module is mounted with a miniaturized pH sensor and data transfer means, e.g. direct wiring or by providing a transmitter with an antenna for wireless transferring of the pH data to a processing receiver. The temperature of the pH sensor is lowered below the dew point of the exhaled patient breath by a solid-state Peltier junction engaged on one side to a heat sink. A thermocouple is provided to monitor the temperature of the sensor for more accurate pH calculations. Keeping the sensor temperature below the dew point will cause the patient's exhaled breath to condense as a liquid in close proximity to the surface of the sensor. It is commonly known that monitoring of pH is significantly more accurate if measuring in a condensed liquid. A transmitter with an antenna transfers the observed pH data by employing one of many wireless methods, such as radio-frequency (RF) energy. Alternately, the transfer of observed pH data is accomplished by direct wire methods.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The pH data is transferred or updated at specific intervals, which can be varied according to the patient's needs, to the processing receiver that is engaged to the treatment apparatus. The processing receiver computes and diagnoses the breath chemistry data and determines at what frequency the treatment apparatus should be activated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention mask or sensor module may also be fitted with a means to remove the condensed liquid through an exhaust port or a connected pneumatic hose to remove unnecessary and accumulated breath condensate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following descriptions and claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention provides a system and method for monitoring physiological parameters from a patient's exhaled breath and communicates this information to a processing computer/receiver that diagnoses, stores, or displays the information. The system can use computational instructions to activate and de-activate an electrically connected treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device, and can be integrated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the present invention consisting of a system <b>10</b> comprised of several components. As shown in the Figure, a typical mask apparatus <b>36</b> is fitted with a securing strap or typical headgear apparatus <b>38</b>. The mask configuration is only one embodiment contemplated by the Applicants. The present invention can perform in a mask-less configuration, with the other embodiments consisting of mounting the sensor assembly to a headband or other securing means that suspends the sensor assembly in the path of a patient's exhaled breath. If the example mask apparatus <b>36</b> is employed, it is generally fabricated from a polymeric and/or silicone material and configured to fit over a patient's nose, or nose and mouth, to assist in breathing conditions. The securing strap <b>38</b> is made from a flexible material and is positioned around the patient's head such that the mask substantially engages the patient's face and mouth area, minimizing ambient air from entering the boundaries of the mask. It is contemplated by the Applicants that other mask configurations, including a sensor module without mask, or mask-less configurations, and different positions of the components of the present invention, can still achieve the goal of monitoring, diagnosing and treating respiratory and medical conditions in patients.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Shown attached to the front of the mask apparatus <b>36</b> is a housing <b>27</b> that contains the components necessary for condensing the patient's breath and monitoring certain chemical parameters. The housing <b>27</b> can be machined or molded from a variety of polymeric materials including polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, ABS, nylon, delrin, or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or from metallic materials, such as aluminum or other biocompatible metallic alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mask apparatus <b>36</b> may be connected to the exit port <b>22</b> of a CPAP device <b>16</b> by means of a pneumatic hose <b>18</b>. The hose can be manufactured from a variety of materials, including polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride or silicone. The material used for the hose should be resistant to water and acidic environments, and should not interfere or interact with any medicaments employed in the present invention. CPAP air exits port <b>22</b> and travels along the length of the pneumatic host <b>18</b> to the internal sampling cavity created by the general mask apparatus covering the patient's face. The CPAP device has a control means <b>20</b> for increasing and decreasing the volume of air generated by the apparatus and the output of an optional humidification device. The CPAP device and humidifier are powered by an electrical source such as a standard plug <b>12</b> and cable <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Shown connected to the body <b>27</b> is an electrical wire <b>29</b> that communicates with a processing receiver <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Electrical wire <b>29</b> is typical in that the internal core comprises an electrically conductive metallic material and is encased by a nonconductive jacket. Processing receiver <b>26</b> is connected to the CPAP device <b>16</b> by an electrical wire <b>24</b> for controlling the activation of air generated by the CPAP device <b>16</b> and transferred to the typical mask apparatus <b>36</b>. Also, an electrical connection by means of a wire <b>31</b> to the processing receiver <b>26</b> is a treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b>. As an alternate method, a wireless means <b>40</b> can be utilized instead to communicate between the processing receiver <b>26</b> with an antenna <b>28</b> to the treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b>. Although not shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wireless means also can be employed to communicate between the typical mask apparatus <b>36</b> and the processing receiver <b>26</b>. In addition, a wireless means also can be employed to communicate between the processing receiver <b>26</b> and the CPAP device <b>16</b>. As appreciated by those skilled in the art, wireless means for communicating between various components can be accomplished using radio frequency waves, microwaves, ultrasonic waves, or light optics.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b> is pneumatically connected to hose <b>18</b> at some point along its length between the CPAP device <b>16</b> and the typical mask apparatus <b>36</b>. The treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b> has a medicament storage chamber <b>33</b> where various types of therapeutic medicaments can be delivered to the pneumatic system and to the patient at intervals commanded by the processing receiver <b>26</b>. If necessary, a scavenger can be added to the mask air outlet to remove excess medicament if it is inappropriate to vent the medicament into the room air.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a sectional top view of the mask apparatus demonstrating in more detail the orientation and components of the mask <b>36</b>, the condensing/monitoring body <b>27</b> and the pH sensing means <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged sectional view taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> demonstrating the general location of the pH sensor <b>46</b>, internal heat sink <b>34</b>, Peltier junction <b>50</b>, absorption means <b>62</b>, and one-way exhaust valve <b>61</b>. The internal heat sink is fabricated generally from materials that have good heat conduction properties, such as certain metallic elements and alloys. Some candidates are aluminum, copper, silver and gold. The Peltier junction <b>50</b> is engaged to a polymer film <b>63</b> (shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and reduces the temperature of the film <b>63</b> to facilitate the condensation of breath into a liquid that pools on the surface of the film <b>63</b> and becomes exposed to the pH sensor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional side view taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> demonstrating in more detail the relative locations of the internal heat sink <b>34</b> with fins <b>35</b>, Peltier junction <b>50</b>, absorption means <b>62</b>, condensing film <b>63</b>, thermocouple <b>52</b> and pH sensor <b>46</b>. The heat sink <b>34</b> is fitted with fins <b>35</b> to increase the surface area of the heat sink <b>34</b> to dispense heat generated by the system. As shown in this figure, Peltier junction <b>50</b> engages the back of heat sink <b>34</b>. The Peltier junction <b>50</b> is connected by wires <b>51</b> to a DC power source, such as a battery (not shown) that generally is in the range of 0.2 to 12 volts. The Peltier junction <b>50</b> functions as a heat pump, removing heat from the condensing film <b>63</b>, thereby reducing its relative temperature, and transferring the heat to the heat sink <b>34</b> and fins <b>35</b> that dissipates it into the environment (and a portion of the absorption means). The net effect of this operation is that the temperature of the high surface-tension film <b>63</b>, engaged to the cool side of the Peltier junction, is lower than the ambient dew point. Breath condenses on the film <b>63</b> forming a pool of liquefied breath that is retained on the surface. The film <b>63</b> is generally composed of a polymer material having high surface-tension properties, one example being a mylar-based material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pH sensor <b>46</b>, shown here as a tubular design, is comprised from a metallic antimony or similar alloy that is fitted with a plurality of wires or wireless means to communicate the analog pH information monitored by the sensor to a processing receiver <b>26</b>. Similarly, the thermocouple <b>52</b> is fabricated from standard metallic components and is fitted with a plurality of wires or wireless means to communicate the analog temperature information monitored by the thermocouple to the processing receiver <b>26</b>. The pH sensor <b>46</b> is positioned such that its terminal end is mounted in close proximity to the surface of the film <b>63</b> such that it gets exposed to a sample of breath condensed on the film <b>63</b>. The thermocouple <b>52</b> is shown also residing near the terminal end of the sensor <b>46</b>. The Applicant contemplates that other mounting positions for the thermocouple <b>52</b> and pH sensor <b>46</b> can be employed without sacrificing any performance.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Electronic communication from the pH sensor wires <b>48</b> and the thermocouple wires <b>49</b> that are further connected to a wire or wireless means for communication to the processing receiver <b>26</b>. In the case of a wireless means, wires <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> would terminate in an antenna (not shown) and communicate with an antenna associated with the processing receiver <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An absorption means or pad <b>62</b>, generally constructed from an expanded open-cell material such as certain types of cellulose or urethanes, is mounted with one end in close proximity to a portion of film <b>63</b> and the other end in close proximity with the heat sink <b>34</b>. The absorption means or pad <b>62</b> has the capability to continuously draw or extract, from the surface of film <b>63</b>, some of the liquefied breath sample into its open-cell structure. The portion of absorption means or pad <b>62</b> in contact with the heat sink <b>34</b> causes its temperature to increase. The increased temperature functions to return the breath condensate back into a gaseous state thereby promoting evaporation of the sampled breath. Pulses of non-condensed breath are forced over fins <b>35</b> of the heat sink <b>34</b> as well as through the open cell structure of the absorption means or pad <b>62</b>. Mounted at the terminal end of body <b>27</b> is a one-way exhaust valve <b>61</b> fitted within a cap structure <b>37</b>. Exiting out the one-way valve <b>61</b>, either into the environment or vented to an appropriate location, is the non-condensed gaseous breath.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic representation of the treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b>, demonstrating a base unit having an on/off switch <b>102</b>, operating lights <b>104</b>, a medicament chamber <b>33</b>, and interconnection <b>108</b> for attaching to the pneumatic hose <b>18</b>. The treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b> has an outer shell surrounding various mechanical and electrical components that function to deliver the therapeutic dose. The shell can be made of a variety of materials, including plastics such as polyethylene, polystyrene, ABS, nylon, delrin, or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b> communicates with the processing receiver by direct wiring (not shown) or by use of wireless means employing an antenna means <b>110</b>. The base unit and various components of the treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier can be fabricated from polymeric or metallic materials. Operating light <b>104</b> can consist of LED, LCD, fluorescent, or halide or other means to communicate such conditions, as on/off, medicament chamber empty, etc. Also, the Applicant contemplates that a plurality of operating lights can be employed having different functions. The art associated with atomization of particles and humidification processes are known in the art. Many commercially available units can satisfy the basic requirements for the treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b>. One such device is the MicroAir portable ultrasonic nebulizer manufactured by Omron Healthcare, Inc. of Vernon Hills, Ill. This device can be modified or fabricated so that 1) it can be remotely activated by the processing receiver <b>26</b>, and 2) adapted to connect to the pneumatic tube by an appropriate connection <b>108</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The medicament chamber <b>33</b> can contain liquid, gaseous or powdered therapeutics that the treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b> is designed to administer to the pneumatic system upon instructions from the processing receiver <b>26</b>. It is contemplated that the medicament chamber <b>33</b> could include a plurality of medicaments in various compartments in the medicament chamber <b>33</b>. It is also contemplated that treatment nebulizer/atomizer/humidifier device <b>32</b> can select to administer one or more, or in a combination, multiple medicaments stored in the medicament chamber <b>33</b>. Either a continuous method or, to conserve medicine, a pulsed method corresponding with each breath detected by conventional means can be employed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a simplified electrical schematic of the general components in the processing receiver <b>26</b>. In the center is the microprocessor <b>70</b> that processes the information supplied by the thermocouple and sensor and use internal instructions to control other devices. The microprocessor has an EEPROM memory section that allows for specific programming to be incorporated as processing instructions. Furthermore, the microprocessor must have the capability to convert analog signals into digital information for decoding and processing. An example of a microprocessor that could be used in the processing receiver <b>26</b> is the PIC16F876 28-pin 8-Bin CMOS FLASH micro-controllers manufactured by Microchip Technology, Inc. This particular microprocessor has a 128K EEPROM Data memory bank for flash memory of specific instructions and utilizes a 35-word instruction set. It also has five 10-bit Analog-to-Digital Inputs that are necessary for converting the information obtained from the pH sensor <b>46</b> and thermocouple <b>52</b> from its analog format into a digitized form for processing by the instruction sets of the microprocessor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The microprocessor <b>70</b> includes a timing crystal <b>72</b> used for clocking operations and is connected to and energized by an approximate 12 volt power supply <b>69</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sensor analog data that is communicated either through direct wiring or through a wireless means that is then amplified by a circuit <b>74</b> and connected to the microprocessor <b>70</b> through one of the analog-to-digital modules.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the thermocouple analog data that is communicated either through direct wiring or through a wireless means that is amplified by circuit <b>76</b> and connected to the microprocessor <b>70</b> through another one of the analog-to-digital modules.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In certain embodiments, the transmitted data can be recorded, compressed and stored as it is received using a memory chip set or memory circuit within the microprocessor (not shown). Subsequently, the data stored can be downloaded into an external data retrieval device, which can be a computer or other analysis machine.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate flowcharts showing the sequential computational steps employed by the processing receiver <b>26</b>. As described above, the microprocessor <b>70</b> has an EEPROM memory section that allows for specific programming to be incorporated as processing instructions. The steps programmed in the microprocessor <b>70</b> are outlined in the flowcharts, starting with the 1) monitoring of breath chemistry <b>120</b> without CPAP support (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) 2) the monitoring of breath chemistry and breathing rates (122) with CPAP support (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The analog information obtained from the sensor and the thermocouple is converted to digital information and transferred to the microprocessor. The microprocessor uses the thermocouple data to calculate an accurate pH level that is stored in a registry. Optionally, this data can be diagnosed by the microprocessor <b>70</b> to analyze and diagnose data <b>140</b> and stored in a memory bank whereby the microprocessor <b>70</b> can create diagnostic reports <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The stored data is then compared to a threshold value or range <b>160</b> programmed in the instruction set of the microprocessor <b>70</b>. For example, if the pH level does not reach the threshold value, then no actions are performed and the instruction set loops back to read breath chemistry (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or breath chemistry and monitor breathing rates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). If the pH level reaches the threshold value, then the microprocessor <b>70</b> determines the appropriate therapy <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">These computational steps can be continued over and over again to detect, record, analyze and administer the appropriate therapeutic regime to manage patients with certain respiratory conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective representation of another embodiment of the present invention, showing various components of the system, including the heat sink/condensing means and pH sensing means suspended from a mask-less apparatus to locate the present invention in the path of a patient's exhaled breath.

Draped along and in close proximity to a portion of the heat sink assembly <b>34</b> is absorption means or pad <b>62</b>. The other end of absorption means or pad <b>62</b> is in contact with condensing film <b>63</b> for wicking liquefied breath into the open cell structure. Condensing film <b>63</b> is in close association with Peltier junction <b>50</b> and thermocouple <b>52</b> (with electrical connection <b>49</b>) to provide temperature control. Peltier junction <b>50</b> engages a portion of heat sink <b>34</b> and is connected by wires <b>51</b> to a DC power source, such as a battery (not shown). The Peltier junction <b>50</b> functions as a heat pump, removing heat from the condensing film <b>63</b>, thereby reducing its relative temperature, and transferring the heat to the heat sink <b>34</b> and fins <b>35</b> which function to dissipates the heat.
