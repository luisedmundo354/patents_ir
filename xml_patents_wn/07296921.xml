<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a kitchen utensil with a covered elongate member such as a covered whisk.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to kitchen utensils that are used in contact with food containing surfaces including the surfaces of vessels such as pots and pans, bowls, bottles and jars and other foods and equipment and with food contained within or supported by such surfaces. For example such kitchen utensils include whisks, pastry blenders and cleaning tools. It is often important when using such kitchen utensils that the contact between the utensil and the vessel, or the food contained in the vessel in the case of a whisk or pastry blender, be maximised for efficient and effective use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally such whisks comprises loops, blades, bristles or other elongate members that have a cross-sectional profile that is round. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a utensil <b>10</b>, which is a conventional whisk, generally having an array of flexible elongate members <b>18</b> (e.g. whisking elements or cleaning elements) connected at an inner end <b>14</b> of a handle <b>12</b>. Other conventional whisk configurations are known to those skilled in the art such as the balloon whisk, flat whisk, and Swedish style helical whisk illustrated in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,257,752 B1 issued Jul. 10, 2001. Additional kitchen utensil configurations such as the ball whisk described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,356 B1 issued Jul. 24, 2001 to WMF AG and the stirrer described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,947,595 issued Sep. 7, 1999 to Rösle Metallwarenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. KG are also known. Another example of a kitchen utensil is a cleaning tool that generally has cleaning elements such as bristles extending from a central body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common among the above described kitchen utensils is the round shape of the cross-sectional profile <b>19</b> of the elongate members <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. The round profile <b>19</b> of the elongate members <b>18</b> (e.g. whisking elements or cleaning elements) of the kitchen utensils tends to minimize the frictional engagement of the elements and the vessel or food with which the kitchen utensil is being used. As such, for example, most whisks are not well-suited for scraping food from a vessel such as from a mixing bowl to a baking pan. Increased user effort is often required to achieve desired results or more than one utensil may be required when such results are not achievable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore desired to provide a kitchen utensil that improves the contact between the utensil and vessel or food within the vessel without the requirement of increasing the effort of the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the invention provides a whisk having an elongate member covered by a resilient material covering having a non-round peripheral cross-sectional shape.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further aspect, the elongate member is looped, terminating at the end of the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further aspect, the whisk has a plurality of elongate members configured in one of a balloon, flat and helical configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a kitchen utensil comprising a handle, at least one wire-like, flexible elongate member. Each elongate member having at least one end secured to the handle, the elongate member having a non-round peripheral cross-sectional shape for contacting at least one of a food and a food containing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the elongate member may comprise a thin, flexible element and a covering of resilient material suitable for food processing surrounding each flexible element, the covering having an outer surface having a non-round, cross-sectional shape.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a kitchen utensil comprising a handle having an inner and an outer end; and at least one wire-like flexible elongate member for contacting at least one of a food and a food containing surface. Each elongate member has at least one end connected to the inner end of the handle defining a cross-sectional shape having a peripheral edge for maximising frictional contact with the at least one of a food and food containing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The kitchen utensil may further comprise the elongate member shaped to conform the interior profile of a vessel to aid with cleaning the vessel.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a non-round cross-sectional profile <b>20</b> of an elongate member <b>18</b> constructed in accordance with the invention for a kitchen utensil such as the whisk <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The general peripheral edge <b>22</b> of profile <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is of a varying diameter from the central axis of elongate member <b>18</b> and defines a plurality of valleys or recesses <b>23</b> and peaks or projections <b>24</b> as measured from a notional circumference around member <b>18</b> (not shown) determined from its average diameter. The peripheral edge <b>22</b> increases the surface area of elongate member <b>18</b> relative to a round profile (e.g. profile <b>19</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) for a similarly sized elongate member <b>18</b> thus facilitating increased contact between utensil <b>10</b> and any food or surface with which it may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When employed in a whisk configuration for whipping liquids, such a profile <b>20</b> adds local turbulence to the liquid and increases air entrainment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>show different embodiments of the cross-sectional profile <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows a star-like shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>shows a flower-like shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c </i>shows a V-shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>d </i>shows a cog shape. Preferably the peripheral edge <b>22</b> of the elongate member <b>18</b> defines a series of projections and grooves or recesses located around elongate member <b>18</b>; however, it will be understood that any non-round shape may be used that increases the surface area of elongate member <b>18</b> for contact with the food containing surface and/or the food with which utensil <b>10</b> is to be used. Additional shapes include rectangular shapes such as a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, etc. It being understood that such regular n-sided equilateral shapes having many edges such that the shape approaches a round shape are less preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each elongate member <b>18</b> is preferably made from a flexible resilient material, preferably metal, plastic, nylon or silicon such as by extrusion/drawing methods understood to those in the art. For kitchen utensils that directly contact food for food preparation, a suitable neutral material should be used such as stainless steel or food-friendly plastics. The degree of flexibility of the elongate member <b>18</b> may be chosen according to the intended use of utensil <b>10</b>. Flexibility may be varied through choice of materials and dimensioning of the cross-section profile <b>20</b>. For example, the elongate member <b>18</b> is preferably flexible enough such that when the whisk <b>10</b> is in use, the elongate member <b>18</b> flexes in response to the whisking (or whipping) motion, thereby aiding in the whisking operation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>e </i>shows a further embodiment of elongate member <b>18</b> comprising a central core <b>30</b>, made from a flexible metal (stainless steel), and a surrounding tubing or covering <b>32</b>, made, for example, from resilient silicon. Also, the use of a covering made from a flexible resilient material increases the diameter of the elongate element <b>18</b> without significantly changing the flexibility and spring characteristics of the covered elongate member.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The use of a central core and a surrounding covering has been previously described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,257,752 incorporated herein by reference. At least one of the covering <b>32</b> and central core <b>30</b> is connected at one or more respective ends thereof to handle <b>12</b>. Covering <b>32</b> may be secured at one or both ends but free to rotate or twist about elongate member <b>18</b>. Alternatively, the covering <b>32</b> may be secured throughout its length to central core <b>30</b> such as by adhesive bonding or simply surround central core <b>30</b> and is left unsecured while securing at least one end of central core <b>30</b> to handle <b>12</b>. The later alternative is not preferred if the covering <b>32</b> is configured relative to central core <b>30</b> to permit excessive radial movement of covering <b>32</b>. Such may negate the increase in frictional contact between elongate member <b>18</b> and the food or surface with which it is being used resulting from the non-round profile.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment of the invention central core <b>30</b> of elongate member <b>18</b> can be covered by a resilient material using a molding technique. Each central core <b>30</b> is covered individually and later secured to handle <b>12</b> as is described above. Also central core <b>30</b> can be secured to handle <b>12</b> and a covering <b>32</b> can be molded on to central core <b>30</b> and handle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The performance of whisks having uncoated stainless steel wires and whisks having stainless steel wires with silicon in accordance with the invention were compared. Two whisks having uncoated stainless steel wires and two whisks having stainless steel wires coated with silicon were selected to evaluate their comparative performance. The diameter of the uncoated wires was 0.005″ (0.01 cm), and the diameter of the coated wires was 0.095″ (0.24 cm). In the test, the coated wires were star-shaped as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. The performance of the whisks was evaluated by mixing three raw eggs in identical containers, and then comparing results. The eggs were mixed and observed after 10, 20 and 40 cycles. The result of the testing illustrated that the eggs mixed with the silicon coated whisk appeared more thoroughly mixed after each interval.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It will be understood to those skilled in the art that characteristics of the elongate member may be varied by using materials of varying degrees of flexibility, particularly for a member comprising a central core and tubing. For example, an elongate member constructed from a relatively inflexible core with a tubing exhibiting flexible projections may provide superior cleaning/scraping action to a similar member comprising a more flexible core material. In general, a cleaning tool will be configured to be more rigid that a tool primarily intended for whipping.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a further embodiment of a kitchen utensil <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown. The kitchen utensil <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of flexible elongate members <b>18</b> shaped to conform to the interior profile of a vessel <b>26</b> such as a pot or bowl. It will be understood that the elongate members <b>18</b> could be shaped to conform to different shapes depending on the end use requirements. For example, the elongate member <b>18</b> could be formed to conform to the interior profile of a bottle, or could be formed into a hook shape to be able to reach inside the corners of different shaped vessels as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It will be further understood by a person skilled in the art that the loops will be made of a resilient flexible material that allows for flexibility within the movement of the loops whilst maintaining the contour of the required shape.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a perspective cross-sectional view of an elongate member <b>18</b> for a kitchen utensil <b>10</b> is illustrated in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention. The elongate member <b>18</b> is preferably shaped as a flattened ellipsoid or paddle in cross-section. The degree of to which the elongate member <b>18</b> is flattened may be varied according to the whisking requirements of the particular task.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a perspective cross-sectional view of an elongate member <b>18</b> for a kitchen utensil <b>10</b> is illustrated in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention. The elongate member <b>18</b> is preferably shaped as a flattened ellipsoid or paddle in cross-section. However, in this embodiment, the paddle shaped elongate member <b>18</b> is twisted about its length. The degree of twisting may be varied according to the whisking requirements of the particular task.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>)-(<i>d</i>), the kitchen utensil <b>10</b> may alternately be charaterised as comprising the covering <b>30</b>, which in turn comprises a longitudinal cross-sectional profile <b>40</b> that varies along its length. The longitudinal cross-sectional profile <b>40</b> comprises opposed profile edges <b>42</b>, each respective profile edge <b>42</b> in turn comprises a series of peaks and troughs (<b>23</b>,<b>24</b>). In a preferred embodiment, the opposed profile edges <b>42</b> mirror each other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a preferred embodiment the peaks and troughs (<b>23</b>,<b>24</b>) along a length of the respective edge <b>42</b> comprises a repeating profile unit <b>44</b>. The repeating profile <b>44</b> unit may be repeated at most a number of times sufficient to span the respective edge <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The profile edge <b>42</b> may be any one of sinusoidal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>)), concave scalloped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>)), convex scalloped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>c</i>)) and dental shapes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>d</i>)). It will be understood that the particular profile edge <b>42</b> selected may be varied according to the requirements of the particular task.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>3</b><i>e</i>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, the kitchen utensil <b>10</b> may be characterised as having the transverse cross-sectional profile <b>20</b> varying along the elongate member's <b>18</b> length according to at least one of shape, size and orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the size of the transverse cross-sectional profile <b>20</b> may vary along a length of the covering <b>32</b> between a minimum size 50 at one end of the length to a maximum size 52 at the opposite end of the length (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) for example). The length preferably comprises a repeating size unit <b>44</b>. Preferably, the repeating size unit <b>44</b> is repeated at most a number of times sufficient to span the covering <b>32</b>. It will be understood that the particular degree of variance selected may be altered according to the requirements of the particular task.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the orientation of the transverse cross-sectional profile <b>20</b> may vary along a length of the covering <b>32</b> from a starting orientation (A) at one end of the length to an intermediate orientation (B) at an intermediate point along the length and returns to the starting orientation (C) at the opposite end of the length. The length preferably comprises a repeating orientation unit. Preferably, the repeating orientation unit is repeated at most a number of times sufficient to span the covering <b>32</b>. It will be understood that the particular degree of variance selected may be altered according to the requirements of the particular task.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the shape of the transverse cross-sectional profile <b>20</b> may vary from a first shape (A) at a first point along a length of the covering <b>32</b> to a second shape (B) at a second point along the length. In a preferred embodiment the first point is adjacent the second point. It will be understood that the particular degree of shape shifting selected may be altered according to the requirements of the particular task.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The performances of the whisks <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> (paddle whisk) and <b>7</b> (twisted paddle whisk) were independently tested in comparison to the performances of a whisk having silicone coated elongate members (silicone whisk) and a whisk having stainless elongate members (steel whisks). The whisks were tested for efficacy by determining that apparent viscosity of egg whites and whipping cream that were whisked separately using a constant speed of 250 rpm for 0, ½, 1, 1½, 2 and 5 minute increments. A new solution of egg whites and whipping cream was used for each sample. The apparent viscosity was then measured using a viscometer, as in known in the art. The following results were obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The results of testing clearly demonstrate that the paddle and twisted paddle whisks clearly out perform the silicone and steel whisks. This efficiency gain is further illustrated when the relative efficiencies of the respective whisks are compared. For example, when the twisted paddle whisk is taken as being 100% efficient, the following are the percent efficiencies of the other whisks.</p>
