<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A microwave imaging system uses microwave radiation provided by a microwave source to image targets. The system includes an array of antenna elements that are capable of being programmed with a respective transmission coefficient to direct the microwave illumination from the microwave source toward a position on the target. The antenna elements are further capable of being programmed with a respective additional transmission coefficient to receive reflected microwave illumination reflected from the position on the target and direct the reflected microwave illumination towards a microwave receiver. A processor is operable to measure an intensity of the reflected microwave illumination to determine a value of a pixel within an image of the target. Multiple beams can be directed towards the target to obtain corresponding pixel values for use by the processor in constructing the image.</p>

No. 10/997,422, entitled “A Device for Reflecting Electromagnetic Radiation” and U.S. Non-provisional Application for patent Ser. No. 10/997,583, entitled “Broadband Binary Phased Antenna,” both of which were filed on Nov. 24, 2004.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In response to an increasing threat of terrorism, inspection of persons and other items for weapons and other types of contraband is becoming essential at security checkpoints, such as those found at airports, concerts, sporting events, courtrooms, federal buildings, schools and other types of public and private facilities potentially at risk from terrorist attacks. Conventional security inspection systems currently in place at security checkpoints include physical inspection, such as visual and/or tactile inspection, performed by security personnel, metal detectors and X-ray systems. However, physical inspection by security personnel is tedious, unreliable and invasive. In addition, metal detectors are prone to false alarms, and are not capable of detecting non-metallic objects, such as plastic or liquid explosives, plastic or ceramic handguns or knives and drugs. Furthermore, X-ray systems pose a health risk, particularly to those people who are repeatedly exposed to X-ray radiation, such as airport personnel, and X-ray systems also are not able detect certain materials/geometries, such as ceramic knives.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result of the need for improved security inspection systems, various microwave imaging systems have been proposed as an alternative to existing systems. Microwave radiation is generally defined as electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths between radio waves and infrared waves. An advantage of microwave radiation over X-ray radiation is that microwave radiation is non-ionizing, and therefore, poses no known health risks to people at moderate power levels. In addition, over the spectral band of microwave radiation, most dielectric materials, such as clothing, paper, plastic and leather are nearly transparent. Therefore, microwave imaging systems have the ability to penetrate clothing to image items concealed by clothing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">At present, there are several microwave imaging techniques available. For example, one technique uses an array of microwave detectors to capture either passive microwave energy emitted by the target or reflected microwave energy reflected from the target in response to active microwave illumination of the target. A two-dimensional or three-dimensional image of a person or other item is constructed by scanning (moving) the array of detectors with respect to the item's position and/or adjusting the frequency (or wavelength) of the microwave energy being transmitted or detected. For example, an article by David M. Sheen et al., “Three-Dimensional Millimeter-Wave Imaging for Concealed Weapon Detection,” IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 49, No. 9, September 2001, pp. 1581-1592 describes a three-dimensional holographic microwave imaging technique that uses a scanning bar to mechanically move a linear array of detectors to scan an item or person. The resulting measured data is used to reconstruct a holographic image of the item. However, such scanning systems typically require mechanically moving parts and/or intensive post-processing reconstruction of the image, both of which increase the cost and complexity of the microwave imaging system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another technique uses lenses to focus a beam of microwave illumination on the array of microwave detectors. This type of technique is described, for example, in the article P. F. Goldsmith, et al., “Focal Plane Imaging Systems for Millimeter Wavelengths,” IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 41, No. 10, October 1993, pp. 1664-1675. However, microwave imaging systems that use lenses to focus the microwave energy typically have a limited field of view and small aperture size. In addition, the cost of the lens system may be prohibitively large in many applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, what is needed is a cost-effective and simple microwave imaging system for use in security inspection of persons or other items that does not require any moving parts.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide a microwave imaging system that uses microwave radiation to image targets. The system includes a microwave source for providing microwave illumination to illuminate a target, a microwave receiver for receiving reflected microwave illumination reflected from the target and an array of antenna elements. The antenna elements are capable of being programmed with a respective transmission coefficient to direct the microwave illumination from the microwave source toward a position on the target. The antenna elements are further capable of being programmed with a respective additional transmission coefficient to receive reflected microwave illumination reflected from the position on the target and direct the reflected microwave illumination towards the microwave receiver. A processor is operable to measure an intensity of the reflected microwave illumination to determine a value of a pixel within an image of the target. Multiple beams can be directed towards the target to obtain corresponding pixel values for use by the processor in constructing the image.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the terms microwave radiation and microwave illumination each refer to the band of electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths between 0.3 mm and 30 cm, corresponding to frequencies of about 1 GHz to about 1,000 GHz. Thus, the terms microwave radiation and microwave illumination each include traditional microwave radiation, as well as what is commonly known as millimeter-wave radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a simplified exemplary microwave security inspection system <b>10</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The microwave security inspection system <b>10</b> includes a portal <b>20</b> through which a human subject <b>30</b> is capable of walking. The portal <b>20</b> does not include any moving parts, and therefore, the human subject <b>30</b> is able to walk at a normal pace in a single direction <b>40</b> through the portal <b>20</b>. By enabling the human subject <b>30</b> to walk through the portal <b>20</b>, the throughput of the system <b>10</b> is maximized, while also minimizing the inconvenience to the human subject <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the portal <b>20</b> is an area through which an item, such as luggage, a purse, a briefcase, a laptop, a bag or other type of item, may pass. The item may be placed in the portal <b>20</b> or pass through the portal <b>20</b> on a conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The microwave security inspection system <b>10</b> further includes one or more scanning panels <b>50</b> and one or more microwave antennas <b>60</b>. Each of the microwave antennas <b>60</b> is capable of transmitting microwave radiation and/or receiving microwave radiation. In one embodiment, one or more of the scanning panels <b>50</b> includes a passive programmable reflector array composed of reflecting antenna elements. Each of the reflecting antenna elements is capable of being programmed with a respective phase delay to direct microwave illumination towards the human subject <b>30</b> and/or towards one of the microwave antennas <b>60</b>. The phase delay can be either binary or continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, in one embodiment, one of the microwave antennas <b>60</b> is a receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b> positioned at a predetermined spatial location. Microwave illumination received by one of the scanning panels <b>50</b> from a target position on the human subject <b>20</b> is reflected towards the receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b> by programming each of the individual reflecting antenna elements with a respective phase delay. The transmitting microwave antenna <b>60</b> can be positioned either in the same spatial location as the receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b> as a separate antenna or as part of the receiving microwave antenna, and illuminate the target position through the scanning panel <b>50</b>, or can be positioned at a different spatial location from the receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b> and either illuminate the target position on the human subject <b>30</b> directly or through one of the scanning panels <b>50</b> (e.g., the same scanning panel <b>50</b> as the receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b> or a different scanning panel <b>50</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, one or more of the scanning panels <b>50</b> includes an active transmitter/receiver array composed of active antenna elements capable of producing and transmitting microwave illumination and receiving and capturing reflected microwave illumination. For example, the active array may be in the form of a transmission array. In this embodiment, microwave antennas <b>60</b> are not used, as the scanning panels <b>50</b> operate as the source of microwave radiation. Each of the active antenna elements in the active transmitter/receiver array is individually programmable with a respective phase shift to steer a beam of microwave illumination towards a target position on the human subject <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The microwave imaging system <b>10</b> further includes a processor <b>100</b>, computer-readable medium <b>110</b> and a display <b>120</b>. The processor <b>100</b> includes any hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof for controlling the scanning panels <b>50</b> and microwave antennas <b>60</b> and processing the received microwave illumination reflected from the human subject <b>30</b> to construct a microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b>. For example, the processor <b>100</b> may include one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, programmable logic devices, digital signal processors or other type of processing devices that are configured to execute instructions of a computer program, and one or more memories (e.g., cache memory) that store the instructions and other data used by the processor <b>100</b>. However, it should be understood that other embodiments of the processor <b>100</b> may be used. The memory <b>110</b> is any type of data storage device, including but not limited to, a hard drive, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), compact disc, floppy disc, ZIP® drive, tape drive, database or other type of storage device or storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processor <b>100</b> operates to program the phase delays or phase shifts of each of the individual antenna elements in the scanning panels <b>50</b> to illuminate multiple target positions on the human subject <b>30</b> with microwave radiation and/or receive reflected microwave illumination from multiple target positions on the human subject <b>30</b>. Thus, the processor <b>100</b> in conjunction with the scanning panels <b>50</b> operates to scan the human subject <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The processor <b>100</b> is further capable of constructing a microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b> using the intensity of the reflected microwave illumination received by the receiving microwave antennas <b>60</b> from each target position on the human subject <b>30</b>. Each receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b> is capable of combining the reflected microwave illumination reflected from each antenna element in one of the scanning panels <b>50</b> to produce a value of the effective intensity of the reflected microwave illumination at the target position on the human subject <b>30</b>. The intensity value is passed to the processor <b>110</b>, which uses the intensity value as the value of a pixel corresponding to the target position on the human subject <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The processor <b>100</b> receives multiple intensity values from each of the receiving microwave antennas <b>60</b>, and combines the intensity values to produce the microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b>. For example, the processor <b>100</b> associates a received intensity value with a target position on the human subject and populates the value of a pixel in the microwave image with the received intensity value. The location of the populated pixel in the microwave image corresponds to the target position on the human subject <b>30</b>. In operation, the microwave security inspection system <b>10</b> can operate at frequencies that enable millions of target positions on the human subject <b>30</b> to be scanned per second.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The resulting microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b> can be passed from the processor <b>100</b> to the display <b>120</b> to display the microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the display <b>120</b> is a two-dimensional display for displaying a three-dimensional microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b> or one or more two-dimensional microwave images of the human subject <b>30</b>. In another embodiment, the display <b>120</b> is a three-dimensional display capable of displaying a three-dimensional microwave image of the human subject <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of a simplified exemplary scanning panel <b>50</b> for use in the inspection system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The scanning panel <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a reflector antenna array that includes distinct reflecting antenna elements <b>200</b> that reflect electromagnetic radiation with varying phase depending on their impedance state, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/997422. Ideally, the reflecting antenna elements <b>200</b> reflect electromagnetic radiation with a phase shift of 180 degrees (binary phase-shifted) when their impedance is high relative to when their impedance is low. The reflecting antenna elements <b>200</b> are individually controllable and the reflector antenna array is typically supported by driver electronics (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The reflector antenna array is formed on and/or in a substrate, such as a printed circuit board. In one example, the reflector antenna array has a surface area of approximately one meter square and is covered with 10,000 to 100,000 individually controllable reflecting antenna elements <b>200</b> arranged in rows <b>210</b> and columns <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each reflecting antenna element <b>200</b> includes an antenna and a non-ideal switching device. The antenna functions to absorb or reflect a beam of electromagnetic radiation to varying degrees depending on the impedance level of the reflecting antenna element <b>200</b>. Example antenna types that can be incorporated into a reflector antenna array include patch, dipole, monopole, loop, and dielectric resonator type antennas. In reflector antenna array applications, the antennas are often formed in a single plane on the surface of the reflector antenna array substrate. The antennas have an impedance characteristic that is a function of the antenna design parameters. Design parameters of antennas include but are not limited to, physical attributes such as the dielectric material of construction, the thickness of the dielectric material, shape of the antenna, length and width of the antenna, feed location, and thickness of the antenna metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The non-ideal switching device changes the impedance state of the reflecting antenna element <b>200</b> by changing its resistive state. A low resistive state (e.g., a closed or “short” circuit) translates to a low impedance. Conversely, a high resistive state (e.g., an open circuit) translates to a high impedance. A switching device with ideal performance characteristics (referred to herein as an “ideal” switching device) produces effectively zero impedance (Z=0) when its resistance is at its lowest state and effectively infinite impedance (Z=∞) when its resistance is at its highest state. As described herein, a switching device is “on” when its impedance is at its lowest state (e.g., Z<sub>on</sub>=0) and “off” when its impedance is at its highest state (e.g., Z<sub>off</sub>=∞). Because the on and off impedance states of an ideal switching device are effectively Z<sub>on</sub>=0 and Z<sub>off</sub>=∞, an ideal switching device is able to provide the maximum phase shift without absorption of electromagnetic radiation between the on and off states. That is, the ideal switching device is able to provide switching between 0 and 180 degree phase states. In the case of an ideal switching device, maximum phase-amplitude performance can be achieved with an antenna that exhibits any finite non-zero impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In contrast to an ideal switching device, a “non-ideal” switching device is a switching device that does not exhibit on and off impedance states of Z<sub>on</sub>=0 and Z<sub>off</sub>=∞, respectively. Rather, the on and off impedance states of a non-ideal switching device are, for example, somewhere between Z<sub>on</sub>=0 and Z<sub>off</sub>=4. A non-ideal switching device may exhibit ideal impedance characteristics within certain frequency ranges (e.g., &lt;10 GHz) and highly non-ideal impedance characteristics at other frequency ranges (e.g., &gt;20 GHz).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Because the on and off impedance states of a non-ideal switching device are somewhere between Z<sub>on</sub>=0 and Z<sub>off</sub>=4, the non-ideal switching device does not necessarily provide the maximum phase state performance regardless of the impedance of the corresponding antenna, where maximum phase state performance involves switching between 0 and 180 degree phase states. In accordance with the invention, the antennas of a reflector antenna array that utilizes non-ideal switching devices are specifically designed to provide optimal phase performance, where the optimal phase state performance of a reflecting antenna element is the point at which the reflecting element is closest to switching between 0 and 180 degree phase-amplitude states. In an embodiment, to achieve optimal phase state performance, the antennas are configured as a function of the impedance of the non-ideal switching devices. For example, the antennas are designed such that the impedance of the antennas is a function of impedance characteristics of the non-ideal switching devices.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, the antennas are configured as a function of the impedance of the non-ideal switching devices in the on state, Z<sub>on</sub>, and the impedance of the non-ideal switching device in the off state, Z<sub>off</sub>. In a particular embodiment, the phase state performance of a reflecting element is optimized when the antennas are configured such that the impedance of each antenna is conjugate to the square root of the impedance of the non-ideal switching devices when in the on and off impedance states, Z<sub>on </sub>and Z<sub>off</sub>. Specifically, the impedance of each antenna is the complex conjugate of the geometric mean of the on and off impedance states, Z<sub>on </sub>and Z<sub>off</sub>, of the corresponding non-ideal switching device. This relationship is represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Z</i><sub>antenna</sub>*=√{square root over (<i>Z</i><sub>on</sub><i>Z</i><sub>off</sub>)}  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The above-described relationship is derived using the well-known formula for the complex reflection coefficient between a source impedance and a load impedance. Choosing the source to be the antenna and the load to be the non-ideal switching device, the on-state reflection coefficient is set to be equal to the opposite of the off-state reflection coefficient to arrive at equation (1).
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Designing an antenna that exhibits optimal phase-amplitude performance involves determining the on and off impedances, Z<sub>on </sub>and Z<sub>off </sub>of the particular non-ideal switching device that is used in the reflecting antenna elements <b>200</b>. Design parameters of the antenna are then manipulated to produce an antenna with an impedance that matches the relationship expressed in equation (1) above. An antenna that satisfies equation (1) can be designed as long as Z<sub>on </sub>and Z<sub>off </sub>are determined to be distinct values.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Types of switching devices that exhibit non-ideal impedance characteristics over the frequency band of interest include low cost surface mount devices such as surface mount field effect transistors (FETs) and surface mount diodes. Although surface mount FETs exhibit non-ideal impedance characteristics over the frequency band of interest, they are relatively inexpensive and can be individually packaged for use in reflector antenna array applications.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the antennas in the reflector antenna array are planar patch antennas. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an antenna element <b>200</b> that utilizes a planar patch antenna <b>320</b><i>a </i>with a surface mounted FET <b>322</b> as the non-ideal switching device, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The reflecting antenna element <b>200</b> is formed on and in a printed circuit board substrate <b>314</b> and includes the surface mounted FET <b>322</b>, a patch antenna <b>320</b><i>a</i>, a drain via <b>332</b>, a ground plane <b>336</b> and a source via <b>338</b>. The surface mounted FET <b>322</b> is mounted on the opposite side of the printed circuit board substrate <b>314</b> as the planar patch antenna <b>320</b><i>a </i>and the ground plane <b>336</b> is located between the planar patch antenna <b>320</b><i>a </i>and the surface mounted FET <b>322</b>. The drain via <b>332</b> connects the drain <b>328</b> of the surface mounted FET <b>322</b> to the planar patch antenna <b>320</b><i>a </i>and the source via <b>338</b> connects the source <b>326</b> of the surface mounted FET <b>322</b> to the ground plane <b>336</b>. In one embodiment, the surface mounted FETs <b>322</b> are placed on the printed circuit board substrate <b>314</b> using a robotic “pick and place” process and then wave soldered to the printed circuit board <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a working product, the reflector antenna array is connectable to a controller board <b>340</b> that includes driver electronics. An example controller board <b>340</b> is also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and includes a ground plane <b>344</b>, a drive signal via <b>346</b>, and driver electronics <b>342</b>. The controller board <b>340</b> also includes connectors <b>348</b> that are compatible with connectors <b>350</b> of the reflector antenna array. The connectors <b>348</b> of the two boards can be connected to each other, for example, using wave soldering. It should be understood that in other embodiments, the FET <b>322</b> can be surface mounted on the same side of the printed circuit board substrate <b>314</b> as the planar patch antenna <b>320</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, the driver electronics <b>342</b> can be soldered directly to the same printed circuit board in which the reflecting antenna element <b>200</b> is built.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a reflector antenna array that utilizes FETs as the non-ideal switching devices, the beam-scanning speed that can be achieved depends on a number of factors including signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, and switching time. In the case of a FET, the switching time depends on gate capacitance, drain-source capacitance, and channel resistance (i.e., drain-source resistance). The channel resistance is actually space-dependent as well as time-dependent. In order to minimize the switching time between impedance states, the drain of the FET is DC-shorted at all times. The drain is DC-shorted at all times because floating the drain presents a large off-state channel resistance as well as a large drain-source capacitance due to the huge parallel-plate area of the patch antenna. This implies that the antenna is DC-shorted but one wishes the only “rf short” the antenna sees be at the source. Therefore, the additional antenna/drain short must be optimally located so as to minimally perturb the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other embodiments, the reflector antenna array can include continuous phase-shifted antenna elements <b>200</b> by replacing the FETs with variable capacitors (e.g., Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) capacitors). With the variable capacitor loaded patches, continuous phase shifting can be achieved for each antenna element <b>200</b>, instead of the binary phase shifting produced by the FET loaded patches. Continuous phased arrays can be adjusted to provide any desired phase shift in order to steer a microwave beam towards any direction in a beam scanning pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In further embodiments, the scanning panel is an active transmit/receive array including active antenna elements. An example of an active antenna element <b>1200</b> for use in an transmit/receive array is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and described in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/997,583. The active antenna element <b>1200</b> is a broadband binary phased antenna element including an antenna <b>1210</b> connected to a respective switch <b>1215</b>. The switch <b>1215</b> can be, for example, a single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch or a double-pole double-throw (DPDT) switch. The operating state of the switch <b>1215</b> controls the phase of the respective antenna element <b>1200</b>. For example, in a first operating state of the switch <b>1215</b>, the antenna element <b>1200</b> may be in a first binary state (e.g., 0 degrees), while in a second operating state of the switch <b>1215</b>, the antenna element <b>1200</b> may be in a second binary state (e.g., 180 degrees). The operating state of the switch <b>1215</b> defines the terminal connections of the switch <b>1215</b>. For example, in the first operating state, terminal <b>1218</b> may be in a closed (short circuit) position to connect feed line <b>1216</b> between the antenna <b>1210</b> and the switch <b>1215</b>, while terminal <b>1219</b> may be in an open position. The operating state of each switch <b>1215</b> is independently controlled by a control circuit (not shown) to individually set the phase of each antenna element <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term symmetric antenna <b>1210</b> refers to an antenna that can be tapped or fed at either of two feed points <b>1211</b> or <b>1213</b> to create one of two opposite symmetric field distributions or electric currents. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the two opposite symmetric field distributions are created by using a symmetric antenna <b>1210</b> that is symmetric in shape about a mirror axis <b>1250</b> thereof. The mirror axis <b>1250</b> passes through the antenna <b>1210</b> to create two symmetrical sides <b>1252</b> and <b>1254</b>. The feed points <b>1211</b> and <b>1213</b> are located on either side <b>1252</b> and <b>1254</b> of the mirror axis <b>1250</b> of the antenna <b>1210</b>. In one embodiment, the feed points <b>1211</b> and <b>1213</b> are positioned on the antenna <b>1210</b> substantially symmetrical about the mirror axis <b>1250</b>. For example, the mirror axis <b>1250</b> can run parallel to one dimension <b>1260</b> (e.g., length, width, height, etc.) of the antenna <b>1210</b>, and the feed points <b>1211</b> and <b>1213</b> can be positioned near a midpoint <b>1270</b> of the dimension <b>1260</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the feed points <b>1211</b> and <b>1213</b> are shown positioned near a midpoint <b>1270</b> of the antenna <b>1210</b> on each side <b>1252</b> and <b>1254</b> of the mirror axis <b>1250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The symmetric antenna <b>1210</b> is capable of producing two opposite symmetric field distributions, labeled A and B. The magnitude (e.g., power) of field distribution A is substantially identical to the magnitude of field distribution B, but the phase of field distribution A differs from the phase of field distribution B by 180 degrees. Thus, field distribution A resembles field distribution B at ±180° in the electrical cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The symmetric antenna <b>1210</b> is connected to the symmetric switch <b>1215</b> via feed lines <b>1216</b> and <b>1217</b>. Feed point <b>1211</b> is connected to terminal <b>1218</b> of the symmetric switch <b>1215</b> via feed line <b>1216</b>, and feed point <b>1213</b> is connected to terminal <b>1219</b> of the symmetric switch <b>1215</b> via feed line <b>1217</b>. As used herein, the term symmetric switch refers to either a SPDT or DPDT switch in which the two operating states of the switch are symmetric about the terminals <b>1218</b> and <b>1219</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, if in a first operating state of a SPDT switch, the impedance of channel α is 10Ω and the impedance of channel β is 1 kΩ, then in the second operating state of the SPDT switch, the impedance of channel α is 1 kΩ and the impedance of channel β is 10Ω. It should be understood that the channel impedances are not required to be perfect opens or shorts or even real. In addition, there may be crosstalk between the channels, as long as the crosstalk is state-symmetric. In general, a switch is symmetric if the S-parameter matrix of the switch is identical in the two operating states of the switch (e.g., between the two terminals <b>1218</b> and <b>1219</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be understood that other types of antenna elements and scanning panels may be used to transmit, receive and/or reflect microwave illumination to and from a human subject or other item being scanned. In addition, it should be understood that multiple scanning panels may be used to scan different portions of the human subject or other item. For example, the microwave security inspection system can be implemented with two scanning panels, each including a 1 m×1 m array of antenna elements to scan half of a human subject. As another example, the microwave security inspection system can be implemented with four scanning panels, each including a 0.5 m×0.5 m array of antenna elements capable of scanning a quadrant of the human subject.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a pictorial representation of various potential beams of microwave illumination produced by the microwave security inspection system, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Each scanning panel <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>produces a radiation pattern <b>800</b> and <b>810</b>, respectively, of microwave illumination at a target <b>420</b>. Each radiation pattern <b>800</b> and <b>810</b> represents a beam of microwave illumination having a particular beam width that determines the resolution of the image, where large beam widths produce poor resolution. The beam width is dependent on the wavelength of the microwave illumination and the size and programming of each scanning panel <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To improve the resolution of the microwave image, different scanning panels <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>and different microwave antennas <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>can be used for transmitting and receiving. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, microwave antenna <b>60</b><i>a </i>is a transmitting microwave antenna and microwave antenna <b>60</b><i>b </i>is a receiving microwave antenna. The transmitting microwave antenna <b>60</b><i>a </i>transmits microwave illumination towards the scanning panel <b>50</b><i>a</i>. The scanning panel <b>50</b><i>a</i>, in turn, reflects the microwave illumination towards the target <b>420</b> as a beam <b>800</b> of microwave illumination. The microwave illumination reflected from the target <b>420</b> is received as a beam <b>820</b> of microwave illumination by the scanning panel <b>50</b><i>b </i>and reflected towards the receiving microwave antenna <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Using knowledge of the beam width of each microwave beam <b>800</b> and <b>810</b>, the resolution of the microwave image can be reduced to the intersection (or multiplication) <b>820</b> of the two radiation patterns <b>800</b> and <b>810</b>.</p>
