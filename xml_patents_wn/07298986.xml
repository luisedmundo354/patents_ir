<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present general inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present general inventive concept while referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an image forming apparatus including a position adjustment unit according to an embodiment of the present general inventive concept, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating the position adjustment unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are views illustrating an operation of the position adjustment unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming apparatus includes a housing <b>100</b>, an operation panel <b>120</b> installed at an upper side of the housing <b>100</b> to move upward and downward via a rotary shaft <b>121</b> connected thereto and having operation buttons <b>122</b> provided thereon to operate an image forming unit (not shown) to form an image and other parts provided in the housing <b>100</b>, and a position adjustment unit <b>130</b> to maintain the operation panel <b>120</b> at a predetermined angle with respect to the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the position adjustment unit <b>130</b> includes a bracket <b>131</b>, a swing gear <b>133</b>, an interlocking gear <b>134</b>, and an angle adjusting plate <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The bracket <b>131</b> is rotatably installed at a bracket shaft (<b>123</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) attached to the housing <b>100</b> and is provided with first and second shafts <b>132</b> and <b>132</b>′ at which the swing gear <b>133</b> and the interlocking gear <b>134</b> are rotatably mounted, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The bracket <b>131</b> is connected to an elastic part <b>136</b>. The elastic part <b>136</b> has an end fixed to the housing <b>100</b> and causes the bracket <b>131</b> rotated about the bracket shaft <b>123</b> to return to an original position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The swing gear <b>133</b> is rotatably mounted on the first shaft <b>132</b>. Teeth <b>1331</b> are formed along a predetermined length of an outer periphery of the swing gear <b>133</b> and a lever <b>1332</b> extends from the swing gear <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The interlocking gear <b>134</b> is rotatably mounted on the second shaft <b>132</b>′. Teeth <b>1341</b> are formed on an outer periphery of the interlocking gear <b>134</b> and engage with the teeth <b>1331</b> of the swing gear <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The angle adjusting plate <b>135</b> is installed at the rotary shaft <b>121</b> and has teeth <b>1351</b> on an outer periphery thereof. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b> is provided at an end of the rotary shaft <b>121</b>. Alternatively, teeth may be formed on an outer periphery of the rotary shaft <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bracket <b>131</b> is elastically biased away from the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b> by an elasticity of the elastic part <b>136</b>. Therefore, the teeth <b>1341</b> of the interlocking gear <b>134</b> can be separated from the teeth <b>1351</b> of the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when a user presses the lever <b>1332</b> toward the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b>, the bracket <b>131</b> approaches the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b> while rotating in a counter-clockwise direction (A) about the bracket shaft <b>123</b> and the teeth <b>1341</b> of the interlocking gear <b>134</b> engage with the teeth <b>1351</b> of the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this state, to rotate the rotary shaft <b>121</b> and adjust the operation panel <b>120</b>, the user can move the lever <b>1332</b> in an arrow direction (B) to rotate the swing gear <b>133</b> in a counter-clockwise direction. The teeth <b>1331</b> of the swing gear <b>133</b> engage the teeth <b>1341</b> of the interlocking gear <b>134</b> to rotate the interlocking gear <b>134</b> in a clockwise direction. The teeth of the interlocking gear <b>1341</b> engage the teeth <b>1351</b> of the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b> to rotate the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b> and the rotary shaft <b>121</b> in a counter clockwise direction. When the user stops moving the lever <b>1332</b>, the bracket <b>131</b> returns to an original position, in which the teeth <b>1341</b> of the interlocking gear <b>134</b> are separated from the teeth <b>1351</b> of the angle adjusting plate <b>135</b>, by the elasticity of the elastic part <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rotation of the rotary shaft <b>121</b>, as described above, allows the operation panel <b>120</b> to be maintained at a predetermined angle with respect to the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Meanwhile, the user can move the lever <b>1332</b> in an opposite direction to the direction B to rotate the rotary shaft <b>121</b> in a clockwise direction to adjust the angle of the operation panel <b>120</b> with respect to the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a position adjustment unit <b>230</b> according to another embodiment of the present general inventive concept. The position adjustment unit <b>230</b> includes an angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> and an operator <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> is fixed to an end of the rotary shaft <b>121</b> and teeth <b>2311</b> are formed on an outer periphery of the angle adjusting plate <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The operator <b>232</b> is rotatably installed at the housing <b>100</b>. The operator <b>232</b> includes an operation lever <b>2321</b> at an end thereof and a fixing portion <b>2322</b> at another end thereof. The fixing portion <b>2322</b> engages with the teeth <b>2311</b> of the angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> so that the angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> cannot be rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The fixing portion <b>2322</b> is connected to an elastic part <b>233</b>, an end of which is fixed at the housing <b>100</b>, and is elastically biased upward by the elastic part <b>233</b>. Therefore, the fixing portion <b>2322</b> can prevent the angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> from rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a tensile coil spring can be used as the elastic part <b>233</b>. Alternatively, the operator <b>232</b> may be formed as a twisted spring.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An operation of the position adjustment unit <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the operation lever <b>2321</b> moves in a direction C, the fixing portion <b>2322</b> moves downward as shown by a dotted line. In this state, engagement between the fixing portion <b>2322</b> and the teeth <b>2311</b> of the angle adjustment part <b>231</b> is removed and the rotary shaft <b>121</b> can rotate freely. Therefore, a user can rotate the rotary shaft <b>121</b> to adjust the operation panel (see <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) by a desired angle with respect to the housing (see <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the user releases the operation lever <b>2321</b> after the operation panel <b>120</b> is adjusted to the desired angle with respect to the housing <b>100</b> as described above, the lever <b>2321</b> moves in a direction D by an elasticity of the elastic part <b>233</b>, and the fixing portion <b>2322</b> is positioned as shown by a solid line. Therefore, the fixing portion <b>2322</b> engages with the teeth <b>2311</b> of the angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> so that the angle adjusting plate <b>231</b> is maintained at the adjusted angle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a position adjustment unit according to still another embodiment of the present general inventive concept, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view illustrating an operation of the position adjustment unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the position adjustment unit <b>330</b> includes a first coupling member <b>331</b>, a second coupling member <b>332</b>, and a release member <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first coupling member <b>331</b> is slidingly installed along an axis of a rotary shaft <b>121</b>. The first coupling member <b>331</b> is elastically biased toward the second coupling member <b>332</b> by an elastic part <b>333</b> supported by a blocking portion <b>1211</b> provided at the rotary shaft <b>121</b>. A surface of the first coupling member <b>331</b> opposite to the second coupling member <b>332</b> is formed with multiple first coupling teeth <b>3311</b> that are separated from each other by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second coupling member <b>332</b> is fixed at a housing (see <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and a surface of the second coupling member <b>332</b> opposite to the first coupling member <b>331</b> is formed with multiple second coupling teeth <b>3321</b> separated from each other by a predetermined distance so that the second coupling teeth <b>3321</b> can engage with the first coupling teeth <b>3311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The release member <b>334</b> includes a support member <b>3342</b> fixed at the housing, a release shaft <b>3341</b>, an end of which is slidingly supported by the support member <b>3342</b> and another end of which slidingly passes through the second coupling member <b>332</b>, and a button <b>3343</b> protruding from the end of the release shaft <b>3341</b> and slidingly supported by the support member <b>3342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When a user pushes the button <b>3343</b>, the release shaft <b>3341</b> connected to the button <b>3343</b> slides in an arrow direction through the second coupling member <b>332</b> to contact the first coupling member <b>331</b> so that the first coupling member <b>331</b> is separated from the second coupling member <b>332</b>. At this time, the first coupling member <b>331</b> slides along the rotary shaft <b>121</b> in an arrow direction and presses the elastic part <b>333</b>. In this state, the user adjusts a desired angle of an operation panel (see <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with respect to the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the operation panel <b>120</b> is adjusted by the desired angle with respect to the housing <b>100</b>, when a force applied to the button <b>3343</b> is removed, the first coupling member <b>331</b> slides in an opposite direction to the arrow direction by an elasticity of the elastic part <b>333</b>, and the first coupling teeth <b>3311</b> of the first coupling member <b>331</b> engage with the second coupling teeth <b>3321</b> of the second coupling member <b>332</b>. At this time, the operation panel <b>120</b> is maintained at the desired angle with respect to the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Here, a sliding length of the release shaft <b>3341</b> can be longer than a distance required to separate the first coupling teeth <b>3311</b> of the first coupling member <b>331</b> and the second coupling teeth <b>3321</b> of the second coupling member <b>332</b> when the button <b>3343</b> is pushed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As describe above, an image forming apparatus according to various embodiments of the present general inventive concept allows a user to easily adjust a desired angle position of an operation panel with respect to a housing, thereby enhancing operational convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although a few embodiments of the present general inventive concept have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the general inventive concept, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
