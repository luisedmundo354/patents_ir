<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a buckle assembly, and more particularly to a buckle assembly that is adapted to allow adjustment of an associated webbing or strap.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional buckle assembly <b>10</b> secured to a structure <b>12</b>, such as a portion of a car seat. The conventional buckle assembly <b>10</b> includes a clip <b>14</b> secured to the structure <b>12</b> through a fastener <b>15</b>, such as a screw or bolt, and a strap frame <b>16</b> that is rotatably retained by the clip <b>14</b>. The strap frame <b>16</b> includes a clip bar <b>18</b> that is rotatably secured within a channel of the clip <b>14</b>. The clip bar <b>18</b> is integrally connected to lateral posts <b>20</b>, which are in turn integrally connected to a strap bar <b>22</b>. A strap passage <b>24</b> is defined between the clip <b>14</b>, the lateral posts <b>20</b> and the strap bar <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A slide bar <b>26</b> is slidably retained over the lateral posts <b>20</b> of the strap frame <b>16</b>. The slide bar <b>26</b> and the strap frame <b>16</b> cooperate to secure a strap <b>28</b>, such as a seatbelt strap, within the strap passage <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional buckle assembly <b>10</b> tends to allow the strap <b>28</b> to loosen or creep within the strap passage <b>24</b>. For example, if oriented a particular way, the strap frame <b>16</b> may hang away from the structure <b>12</b>. In this state, it is possible for the strap <b>28</b> to undesirably slacken or otherwise loosen within the strap passage <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need exists for an improved buckle assembly that securely retains a strap. Further, a need exists for a buckle assembly that does not allow a strap retained therein to undesirably slacken.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide a buckle assembly configured to be secured to a structure, such as a child car seat. The buckle assembly may include a clip, a strap frame, and at least one spring member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The clip is configured to be secured to the structure. For example, the clip may be fastened to the structure through a bolt, screw, stitches, staples, glue, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The strap frame may include at least one motion-limiting tab, wherein the tab is configured to abut against a portion of the clip when the strap frame is rotated a maximum radial distance with respect to the clip. The strap frame may also include a clip cross bar integrally connected to lateral posts, which are in turn integrally connected to a strap cross bar. The clip cross bar may be rotatably secured to the clip.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The spring member may be a resilient piece of material that includes a first end fixed to the clip, and a second end that biases into at least a portion of the clip cross bar thereby exerting a constant force into the strap frame. The constant force maintains the strap frame in a generally flat orientation with respect to the structure.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Before the embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including” and “comprising” and variations thereof is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items and equivalents thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an isometric front view of a buckle assembly <b>30</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The buckle assembly <b>30</b> includes a clip <b>32</b>, which is configured to be secured to a structure, and a strap frame <b>34</b>, which is configured to securely retain a strap, such as a seat belt strap.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The clip <b>32</b> includes tubes, walls, or other such structures <b>35</b> having frame passages <b>36</b> formed therethrough. The tubes <b>35</b> are separated from one another by a spring-engaging area <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The strap frame <b>34</b> is a generally rectangular frame including a strap cross bar <b>40</b>, integrally connected to lateral posts <b>42</b>, which are in turn integrally connected to a clip cross bar <b>44</b>. The clip cross bar <b>44</b> is rotatably secured to the clip <b>32</b> within the frame passages <b>36</b> of the tubes <b>35</b>. The strap frame <b>34</b> may be a generally planar body having flat surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, the strap frame <b>34</b> may include rounded surfaces. For example, the strap cross bar <b>40</b>, the lateral posts <b>42</b>, and the clip cross bar <b>44</b> may be cylindrical. Additionally, portions of the strap <b>34</b> may be flat, while other portions may be cylindrical. For example, the lateral posts <b>42</b> may be cylindrical while the clip cross bar <b>44</b> may be flat. In particular, a middle portion of the clip cross bar <b>44</b> may be flat.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A biasing spring <b>46</b> including a fixed clip end <b>48</b> and a free end <b>50</b> is secured to the clip <b>32</b> through a fastener <b>52</b>, such as screw or bolt that also secures the clip <b>32</b> to a structure, such as a portion of a car seat. The biasing spring <b>46</b> may be a resilient piece of material such as flexible plastic, rubber, or the like that is spring biased. The free end <b>50</b> of the biasing spring <b>46</b> is positioned within the spring-engaging area <b>38</b> over a middle portion <b>54</b> of the clip bar <b>44</b> of the strap frame <b>34</b>. The biasing spring <b>46</b> exerts a force into the middle portion <b>54</b> of the clip bar <b>44</b> in the direction of arrow A, thereby maintaining the clip bar <b>44</b>, and therefore the strap frame <b>34</b>, in a generally flat position with respect to a structure to which the clip <b>32</b> is attached. The biasing spring <b>46</b> maintains the strap frame <b>34</b> in an aligned orientation with respect to the clip <b>32</b>. That is, the strap frame <b>34</b> is maintained generally parallel or coplanar with respect to the clip <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one biasing spring <b>46</b>, the buckle assembly <b>30</b> may include additional biasing springs spaced apart from one another within additional spring-engaging areas formed between tubes that rotatably secure the strap frame <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A slide bar <b>56</b> having a main body <b>58</b> integrally connected to terminal slide members <b>60</b>, such as tubes or hooks, is slidably positioned on the lateral posts <b>42</b> of the strap frame <b>34</b>. That is, the slide members <b>60</b> are slidably retained on the lateral posts <b>42</b>. The main body <b>58</b> includes a strap-engaging edge <b>62</b> that is serrated, curved, ribbed, or the like. The strap-engaging edge <b>62</b> and a corresponding edge of the strap cross bar <b>40</b> are configured to securely retain a strap, such as seat belt strap, therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an isometric rear view of the buckle assembly <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tubes <b>35</b> also include tab passages <b>64</b> formed therethrough. Tabs <b>66</b> extending outwardly from the strap cross bar <b>44</b> extend through the tab passages <b>64</b>. The tab passages <b>64</b> may be larger than the cross-sectional area of the tabs <b>66</b>, thereby allowing limited movement of the tabs <b>66</b> within the tab passages <b>64</b>. Thus, the strap frame <b>34</b> may be rotated with respect to the clip <b>32</b> in directions noted by arc B.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the strap frame <b>34</b> may be rotated with respect to the clip <b>32</b>, the force exerted into the strap frame <b>34</b> by the biasing spring <b>46</b> ensures that the strap frame <b>34</b> remains in a flat position, as discussed above. That is, while a user may rotate the strap frame <b>34</b> into an open position with respect to the clip <b>32</b>, the biasing spring <b>46</b> ensures that the strap frame <b>34</b> is not rotated into an open position when a user is not engaging the strap frame <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a plan view of the buckle assembly <b>30</b> without the biasing spring <b>46</b>. The clip <b>32</b> includes a fastener through hole <b>68</b> configured to receive and retain the fastener <b>52</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tabs <b>66</b> pass through the tubes <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an isometric view of the buckle assembly <b>30</b> secured to a structure <b>69</b>, which may be a portion of a child car seat. The fastener <b>52</b> secures the clip <b>32</b> to the structure <b>69</b>, and the biasing spring <b>46</b> to the clip <b>32</b>. The free end <b>50</b> of the biasing spring <b>46</b> exerts a force into the strap frame <b>34</b>, thereby maintaining the strap <b>34</b> in a substantially flat orientation (relative to a conventional buckle assembly) with respect to the structure <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an isometric view of the buckle assembly <b>30</b> in an open position. In order to open the buckle assembly <b>30</b>, that is, rotate the strap frame <b>34</b> relative to the clip <b>32</b>, a user manipulates the strap frame <b>34</b> through the strap cross bar <b>40</b> and lifts the strap frame <b>34</b> in the direction of arc B′ to overcome the force exerted in the direction of arrow A by the spring member <b>46</b> into the strap member <b>46</b>. In this position, the slide bar <b>56</b> may be moved freely over the lateral posts <b>42</b> in order to allow adjustment of a strap, such as a seatbelt strap, between the slide bar <b>56</b> and the strap frame <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, as the strap frame <b>34</b> is urged into an open position, the tabs <b>66</b> move through the tab passages <b>68</b> in a similar direction. The tab passages <b>68</b> are sized to limit the movement of the tabs <b>66</b> therethrough. For example, the tab passages <b>68</b> may be sized to limit movement of the tabs <b>66</b> through a wide range of predetermined arcs. Thus, when the tabs <b>66</b> engage edges <b>70</b> of the tubes <b>35</b> that define the upper ends of the tube passages <b>68</b>, continued movement of the tabs <b>66</b>, and therefore the strap frame <b>34</b>, in the direction of arc B′ is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the user disengages the strap cross bar <b>40</b>, the constant force exerted by the biasing spring <b>46</b> into the strap frame <b>34</b> in the direction of arrow A forces the strap frame <b>34</b> back into a flat position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an isometric view of the buckle assembly <b>30</b> secured to a structure <b>69</b>, such as a car seat. A strap <b>72</b> is securely retained within the buckle assembly <b>30</b> by the strap frame <b>34</b> and the sliding bar <b>56</b>. The biasing spring <b>46</b> maintains the strap frame <b>34</b> in a substantially flat position with respect to the structure <b>69</b>. Therefore, the strap <b>72</b> remains securely retained within the buckle assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide an improved buckle assembly that securely retains a strap therein. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention provide a buckle assembly that does not allow a strap retained therein to undesirably slacken.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Variations and modifications of the foregoing are within the scope of the present invention.
