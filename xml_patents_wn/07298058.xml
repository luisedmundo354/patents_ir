<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application Number 2003-007253, filed on Jan. 15, 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer having an anti-theft capability and, more particularly, to a remote control engine starting device for remotely starting an engine while ensuring enhanced security for the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Remote control engine starting devices for starting vehicle engines by remote control have been commercially implemented in recent years. On the other hand, an increasing number of vehicles come equipped with an anti-theft function known as the immobilizer. The immobilizer works as follows. A chip having a unique key code is embedded in an ignition (IG) key and, when an engine start operation such as the insertion or turning of the key in an IG key cylinder is detected, the key code is read from the key, and an immobilizer controller compares the thus readout key code with a prestored legitimate code, and permits engine control only when they match. Accordingly, if an attempt is made to start the engine by using a key other than the legitimate key, the engine control system does not operate because the key codes do not match and, therefore, the engine cannot be started, thus preventing theft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a remote control engine starting device is installed in a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer function, the engine cannot be started remotely unless the immobilizer is disarmed. To solve this problem, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H08-150902 discloses a system in which when a remote engine start command is received from a legitimate transmitter, the remote control engine starting device issues a request signal to the immobilizer which, in response to the request signal, issues a permit signal to the engine controller.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H10-81201 discloses a system which, while ensuring security such as theft prevention, allows the engine or the like to be started not only by the use of a legitimate vehicle key but also by an operation from a remote location.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer function, wherein security for the vehicle is further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, there is provided a remote control engine starting device having an immobilizer and a remote engine starter and equipped with a remote engine starting function for starting an engine when an engine start command is given from a remote location, wherein</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">the immobilizer comprises an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which gives engine start permission when a remote engine starter code, that the remote engine starter outputs in response to the interrogating signal, matches a remote engine starter verifying code preregistered in the immobilizer, and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">the remote engine starter comprises an engine start signal outputting section which outputs a signal related to engine starting, for example, an IG key insertion signal, an IG ON signal, etc., and a code outputting section which, in response to the interrogating signal, outputs the remote engine starter code preregistered in the remote engine starter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The engine start signal outputting section of the remote engine starter outputs the signal related to engine starting when a remote commander code transmitted from a remote commander matches a remote commander verifying code preregistered in the remote engine starter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one preferred mode, the immobilizer further comprises an activation signal outputting section which outputs an activation signal to a key cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which receives a key code output from a key in response to the activation signal, and which gives engine start permission when the key code matches a preregistered code, and wherein the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when an IG key insertion signal is not received but the signal related to engine starting, other than the IG key insertion signal, is received.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another preferred mode, the immobilizer further comprises an activation signal outputting section which outputs an activation signal to a key cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which receives a key code output from a key in response to the activation signal, and which gives engine start permission when the key code matches a preregistered code, and wherein the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when the key code is not received in response to the activation signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, there is also provided a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle having an immobilizer and a remote engine starter and equipped with a remote engine starting function for staring an engine when an engine start command is given from a remote location, wherein</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">the immobilizer comprises an activation signal outputting section which outputs an activation signal to a key cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which receives a key code output from a key in response to the activation signal, and which gives engine start permission when the key code matches a preregistered code, wherein the immobilizer further comprises an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal, different from the activation signal, when the signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which gives engine start permission when a remote engine starter code that the remote engine starter outputs in response to the interrogating signal matches a remote engine starter verifying code preregistered in the immobilizer, and</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">the remote engine starter comprises an engine start signal outputting section which outputs a signal related to engine starting when the engine start command is given from a remote location, and a code outputting section which, in response to the interrogating signal, outputs the remote engine starter code preregistered in the remote engine starter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one preferred mode, the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when an IG key insertion signal is not received but a signal related to engine starting, other than the IG key insertion signal, is received.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another preferred mode, the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs the activation signal and interrogating signal when the signal related to engine starting is received, and which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when any key code is not received in response to the activation signal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another preferred mode, the immobilizer includes a match/mismatch judging section which outputs the activation signal and interrogating signal when the signal related to engine starting is received, and which, when the key code is received, judges whether the key code matches the preregistered code but, when the “remote engine starter code” is received, then judges whether the “remote engine starter code” matches the preregistered “remote engine starter verifying code”.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The engine start permitting section for giving the engine start permission does not give the engine start permission when the “remote engine starter code” has failed to match the “remote engine starter verifying code” a predetermined number of times.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, according to the present invention, since provisions are made, in remote engine starting, to permit the engine to be started only when the code preregistered in the remote engine starter matches the code preregistered in the immobilizer, the engine cannot be started unless the remote engine starter is a legitimate one, and this serves to enhance the security.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, when sending the engine start command from the remote commander, since provisions are made to permit the remote engine starter to be started only when the code preregistered in the remote commander matches the code preregistered in the remote engine starter, the engine cannot be started unless the remote commander that issued the engine start command is a legitimate one. This serves to further enhance the security.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer function according to the present invention. Reference numeral <b>1</b> is an ignition (IG) key having a built-in antenna <b>12</b> and a built-in transponder <b>11</b> in which a unique code identifying the legitimate key is stored. Reference numeral <b>2</b> is a key cylinder, and various switches, such as an accessory switch (ACC) for turning power on and off to accessories (ACC), an ignition (IG) switch for turning power on and off to spark plugs, etc., and a starter switch for turning power on and off to the starter motor, are built into the key cylinder <b>2</b>. When the IG key <b>1</b> is inserted in the key cylinder <b>2</b>, a key insertion signal is output, and when the IG key <b>1</b> is turned therein, an ACC ON signal, an IG ON signal, a starter ON signal, etc. are output to an immobilizer <b>4</b>, an engine controller <b>5</b>, and the starter motor <b>10</b>. Reference numeral <b>3</b> is an immobilizer amplifier which amplifies signals output from the IG key <b>1</b> and the immobilizer <b>4</b>, and which is provided with a switch <b>31</b> for turning off the operation of the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Reference numeral <b>5</b> is the engine controller to which a permit signal is output from the immobilizer <b>4</b> when a prescribed condition is satisfied, thus permitting the engine to be started. Reference numeral <b>6</b> is a remote engine starter; when a start switch <b>81</b> on a remote commander <b>8</b> is pressed, a remote engine start signal is transmitted from an antenna <b>9</b> and received by an antenna <b>7</b> of the remote engine starter <b>6</b>. The remote engine starter <b>6</b>, upon receiving this signal, outputs an ignition ON signal (IG ON signal), etc. to the immobilizer <b>4</b> and the engine controller <b>5</b>. In addition to the IG ON signal, the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs an ACC ON signal, starter ON signal, etc. A stop switch <b>82</b> is a switch for stopping the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing the configuration of the immobilizer <b>4</b>, the remote engine starter <b>6</b>, and the remote commander <b>8</b>, focusing on the codes preregistered in their respective storing means. The immobilizer <b>4</b> includes a storing section <b>41</b> and a control section <b>42</b>, and a “master key code” <b>43</b> and a “sub key code <b>44</b>, unique key codes for identifying the legitimate IG key, are preregistered in the storing section <b>41</b>. Further, a “remote engine starter verifying code” <b>45</b> is preregistered which is a code for verifying whether the remote engine starter according to the present invention is a legitimate one or not.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the storing means of the remote engine starter <b>6</b>, there are preregistered a “remote engine starter code” <b>61</b>, which is a code uniquely identifying the remote engine starter, and a “remote commander verifying code” <b>62</b>, which is a code for verifying whether the remote commander is a legitimate one or not. On the other hand, a “remote commander code” <b>83</b>, which is a code uniquely identifying the remote commander, is preregistered in the storing means of the remote commander <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The immobilizer <b>4</b> comprises an “interrogating signal outputting section” which outputs an interrogating signal when a signal related to engine starting is received, a “match/mismatch judging section” which judges whether the remote engine starter code matches the remote engine starter verifying code and whether the key code output from the key matches the preregistered key code, an “engine start permitting section” which permits the engine to be started when the remote engine starter code matches the remote engine starter verifying code or when the key code output from the key matches the preregistered key code, and an “activation signal outputting section” which outputs an activation signal to the cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The remote engine starter comprises an “engine start signal outputting section” which outputs a signal related to engine starting, and a “code outputting section” which, in response to the interrogating signal, outputs the remote engine starter code preregistered in the remote engine starter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are waveform diagrams for explaining an anti-theft operation when starting the engine by inserting the IG key <b>1</b> in the key cylinder <b>2</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when the IG key <b>1</b> is inserted in the key cylinder <b>2</b>, the IG key insertion signal is set ON and is output to the immobilizer <b>4</b>. Upon receiving this signal, the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs a pulse-like activation signal to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b>. The immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> is equipped with an antenna (not shown) for receiving the unique key code stored in the transponder <b>11</b> built into the IG key <b>1</b>, and transmits the received key code (KC) to the immobilizer <b>4</b> when the activation signal is received. If the received key code (KC) matches either the master key code or the sub key code, the immobilizer <b>4</b> gives engine start permission to the engine controller <b>5</b>, while stopping the output of the activation signal until the IG key is removed from the key cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The IG ON signal is output with a delay relative to the key insertion signal, because the former is output when the inserted key is turned.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, even when the legitimate IG key is inserted, the unique key code may not match the code stored in the immobilizer due to the effect of noise. In that case, the activation signal is re-transmitted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the case where the activation signal is transmitted three times and the key code KC transmitted for the third time is judged to match the stored code.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the key code is transmitted from the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> to the immobilizer <b>4</b>, the immobilizer <b>4</b> judges whether the key code matches the master key code or the sub key code shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and, if they match, outputs the permit signal to the engine controller <b>5</b>, thus permitting the engine to be started. On the other hand, if an illegitimate IG key is inserted, the key code that matches the code preregistered in the immobilizer is not output even when the activation signal is transmitted from the immobilizer <b>4</b> to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b>. If the key code is not output even when the activation signal has been output a predetermined number of times, it is determined that the inserted key is not a legitimate IG key, and the output of the activation signal is stopped. If a key code different from the one preregistered in the immobilizer <b>4</b> is output, the permit signal will not be output from the immobilizer <b>4</b> to the engine controller <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, one example of remote engine starting according to the present invention will be described with reference to the waveforms shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show a comparison between the signal waveforms at the time of remote engine starting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) and the signal waveforms at the time of engine starting by insertion of the key (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the start switch <b>81</b> on the remote commander <b>8</b> is pressed, the remote engine start signal is transmitted from the transmitting antenna <b>9</b> and received by the receiving antenna <b>7</b> of the remote engine starter <b>6</b>. The signal transmitted from the transmitting antenna <b>9</b> contains the “remote commander code” <b>83</b> which is the unique code of the remote commander. The remote engine starter <b>6</b> receives this signal via the receiving antenna <b>7</b> and, if the “remote commander code” <b>83</b> matches the “remote commander verifying code” <b>62</b> preregistered in the remote engine starter <b>6</b>, the IG ON signal, etc. as the signals related to engine starting are output from the engine start signal outputting section of the remote engine starter <b>6</b> and transmitted to the immobilizer <b>4</b> and the engine controller <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the IG ON signal output from the remote engine starter <b>6</b> is received by the immobilizer <b>4</b>, the interrogating signal outputting section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the interrogating signal QS to the remote engine starter <b>6</b>. At the same time, the activation signal is transmitted to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b>, but no key code is returned because the key is not inserted. The interrogating signal QS is output when the “remote starter verifying code”, is preregistered in the immobilizer <b>4</b>. When the interrogating signal QS is received by the remote engine starter <b>6</b>, the code outputting section of the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs a response signal RS which contains the “remote engine starter code” preregistered in the remote engine starter <b>6</b>. The immobilizer <b>4</b>, which received this signal, judges whether the “remote engine starter verifying code” preregistered therein matches the “remote engine starter code” contained in the response signal and, if they match, the engine start permitting section of the immobilizer outputs the permit signal to the engine controller <b>5</b>, thus permitting the engine to be started. If the remote engine starter <b>6</b> is not a legitimate one, the code preregistered therein does not match the “remote engine starter verifying code” preregistered in the immobilizer <b>4</b>, so that the permit signal will not be output to the engine controller.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, the “remote commander verifying code” and the “remote engine starter code” may be different codes or may be the same code.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When starting the engine by inserting the IG key, the IG key insertion signal is output upon insertion of the IG key, and in response, the activation signal outputting section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the activation signal, whereupon a key code is output from the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b>. At the same time, the interrogating signal QS is also output, but no response signal is returned because the remote engine starter is not operating. In the case of engine starting by insertion of the key, the IG ON signal, etc. are not output when the key is simply inserted, but are output when the key is turned. However, provisions may be made to output the key insertion signal, the IG ON signal, etc. when the key is turned.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of the remote control engine starting device according to the present invention. Control of the operation, etc. shown in the flowchart is performed in the remote engine starter <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When starting the engine by inserting the IG key, the IG key insertion signal is output upon insertion of the IG key and, in response, the activation signal outputting section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the activation signal, but in the case of remote engine starting, the signal is not output. In the case of engine starting by insertion of the key, the IG ON signal, etc. are not output when the key is simply inserted, but are output when the key is turned. However, provisions may be made to output the key insertion signal, the IG ON signal, etc. when the key is turned.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the routine is initiated, it is determined whether an engine start command has been issued or not (S<b>1</b>). When the start switch <b>81</b> on the remote commander <b>8</b> is pressed, the remote engine start signal is transmitted from the transmitting antenna <b>9</b> and received by the receiving antenna <b>7</b> of the remote engine starter <b>6</b>. The remote engine start signal transmitted from the transmitting antenna <b>9</b> contains the “remote commander code” which is the unique code of the remote commander. The remote engine starter <b>6</b> receives this signal via the receiving antenna <b>7</b> and, if this unique code of the remote commander matches the “remote commander verifying code” preregistered in the remote engine starter <b>6</b>, then it is determined that an engine start command has been issued (Yes).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When it is determined that an engine start command has been issued, the engine start signal outputting section of the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs the IG ON signal, the ACC ON signal, etc. to the immobilizer <b>4</b> and the engine controller <b>5</b> (S<b>2</b>). When the IG ON signal is received, the immobilizer <b>4</b> checks whether the “remote engine starter verifying code” is registered or not and, if it is registered, the interrogating signal outputting section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the interrogating signal to the remote engine starter <b>6</b>. Next, it is checked whether or not the interrogating signal is received by the remote engine starter <b>6</b> (S<b>3</b>). If the interrogating signal is not received (No), it is checked once again whether the interrogating signal is received or not.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the interrogating signal is received (Yes in S<b>3</b>), the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs a response signal to the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>4</b>). Next, it is determined whether the interrogating signal is once again received (S<b>5</b>). If the answer is Yes, this means that the response signal was not output in the first place or, if it was output, the “remote engine starter code” of the remote engine starter contained in the response signal did not match the “remote engine starter verifying code” stored in the immobilizer <b>4</b>; therefore, the process returns to S<b>4</b>, and the response signal is output once again.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the interrogating signal is no longer received (No), then it is determined whether a predetermined time, for example, one second, has elapsed from the output of the response signal (S<b>6</b>). If the answer is No, the process returns to S<b>5</b> to determine whether the interrogating signal is once again received. If the interrogating signal is no longer received after one second has elapsed in S<b>6</b> (Yes), this means that the response signal was output and the codes were found to match each other, the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs the starter ON signal to the starter motor <b>10</b>, the immobilizer <b>4</b>, and the engine controller <b>5</b> for a predetermined length of time, for example, two seconds (S<b>7</b>). Next, it is determined whether a predetermined time, for example, four seconds, has elapsed from the output of the starter signal (S<b>8</b>). If four seconds have elapsed (Yes), it is determined whether the engine has started (S<b>9</b>). If the engine has started (Yes), the engine start process is terminated. Here, the determination is made by checking the output of an alternator L terminal <b>13</b> because the output of this terminal being input to the remote engine starter <b>6</b> should go to “H” when the engine has started.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If, in S<b>1</b>, it is determined that there is no engine start command, then it is determined whether an engine stop command has been received (S<b>10</b>). If the engine stop command has been received (Yes), the remote engine starter <b>6</b> stops outputting the IG ON signal, the ACC ON signal, etc. (S<b>11</b>). If there is no engine stop command in S<b>10</b> (No), the process is immediately terminated.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the IG ON signal is received without first receiving the IG key insertion signal, the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the interrogating signal to the remote engine starter <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the routine is initiated, it is determined whether the engine start permit/deny determination process is completed or not (S<b>1</b>). If the determination process is completed and the determination completion flag is ON (F=1) (Yes), the routine is immediately terminated. If the determination process is not completed and the determination completion flag is not ON (not F=1) (No), then it is determined whether the IG key is inserted or not (S<b>2</b>). If the key is inserted, the key insertion signal is output to the immobilizer <b>4</b> and the engine controller <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> (Yes), and the activation signal outputting section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the activation signal to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> (S<b>3</b>). Upon receiving the activation signal, the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> outputs the unique key code KC of the IG key <b>1</b>, and the immobilizer <b>4</b> receives this key code (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The immobilizer <b>4</b> judges whether the unique key code KC matches the stored key code <b>43</b> or <b>44</b> (S<b>5</b>).

On the other hand, if the key codes do not match in S<b>5</b> (No), +1 is added to the number of mismatches, (Cn−1), that occurred up to the previous cycle of the routine (S<b>7</b>), and it is determined whether the accumulated number of mismatches, Cn, exceeds a predetermined value, for example, 10 (S<b>8</b>). Before the determination, a counter is initialized (S<b>7</b>−1) between step S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b>. If it exceeds 10 (Yes), the determination process is terminated (S<b>9</b>), and the engine will not be started. On the other hand, if the answer in S<b>8</b> is No, the process returns to S<b>3</b> where the activation signal is output once again. In this way, the determination as to whether the codes match or not is performed repeatedly and, if they still do not match after trying more than the predetermined number of times, the engine will not be started.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the key insertion signal is not output in S<b>2</b> (No), then it is determined whether the IG ON signal, etc. are output (S<b>10</b>). If they are output (Yes), the remote engine starter <b>6</b> operates as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>; that is, as the IG ON signal is output to the immobilizer <b>4</b>, it is determined whether or not the remote engine starter verifying code for the remote engine starter <b>6</b> is preregistered in the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>11</b>). If it is preregistered (Yes), the interrogating signal outputting section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the interrogating signal QS to the remote engine starter <b>6</b> (S<b>12</b>), whereupon the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs a response signal RS which is received by the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>13</b>). The immobilizer <b>4</b> judges whether the “remote engine starter code” preregistered in the remote engine starter and contained in the received response signal matches the “remote engine starter verifying code” stored in the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>14</b>) and, if they match (Yes), the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the permit signal to the engine controller <b>5</b> (S<b>6</b>), and the determination process is terminated (S<b>9</b>). On the other hand, if the codes do not match in S<b>14</b> (No), +1 is added to the number of mismatches, (Cn−1), that occurred up to the previous cycle of the routine (S<b>15</b>), and it is determined whether the accumulated number of mismatches, Cn, exceeds a predetermined number, for example, 10 (S<b>16</b>).

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If it is determined in S<b>11</b> that 500 ms have elapsed (Yes), that is, if any key code has not been received for 500 ms, then it can be determined that the IG ON signal has been output, not because of the insertion of the key, but from the remote engine starter <b>6</b>; therefore, it is determined whether or not the “remote engine starter verifying code” is preregistered in the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>12</b>). If it is preregistered (Yes), the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the interrogating signal to the remote engine starter <b>6</b> (S<b>13</b>), whereupon the remote engine starter <b>6</b> outputs a response signal which is received by the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The immobilizer <b>4</b> judges whether the “remote engine starter code” <b>61</b> preregistered in the remote engine starter and contained in the received response signal matches the “remote engine starter verifying code” <b>45</b> preregistered in the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>15</b>) and, if they match (Yes), the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the permit signal to the engine controller <b>5</b> (S<b>6</b>), and the determination process is terminated (S<b>9</b>). On the other hand, if the codes do not match in S<b>15</b> (No), +1 is added to the number of mismatches, (Cn−1), that occurred up to the previous cycle of the routine (S<b>16</b>), and it is determined whether the accumulated number of mismatches, Cn, exceeds a predetermined number, for example, 10 (S<b>17</b>). Before the determination, a counter is initialized (S<b>7</b>/<b>16</b>) between steps S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. If it exceeds 10 (Yes), the determination process is terminated (S<b>9</b>), and the engine will not be started. If the answer in S<b>17</b> is No, on the other hand, the process returns to S<b>13</b> where the interrogating signal is output once again. In this case also, the determination as to whether the codes match or not is performed repeatedly and, if they still do not match after trying more than the predetermined number of times, the engine will not be started.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart illustrating still another embodiment of the immobilizer <b>4</b> according to the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> show signal waveforms at the time of remote engine starting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) and signal waveforms at the time of insertion of the key (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) in the flowchart.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when either one of the signals, the key insertion signal or the IG ON signal, is received, the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs both the activation signal and the interrogating signal. In this embodiment also, the remote engine starter <b>6</b> may be configured to output the IG key insertion signal, and not the IG ON signal, as the signal related to engine starting, or to output both the IG ON signal and the IG key insertion signal.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the routine is initiated, it is determined whether the engine start permit/deny determination process is completed or not (S<b>1</b>). If the determination process is completed and the determination completion flag is ON (F=1) (Yes), the routine is immediately terminated. If the determination process is not completed and the determination completion flag is not ON (not F=1) (No), then it is determined whether the key is inserted or not (S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Engine Starting by Key Insertion&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If the key is inserted, the key insertion signal is output to the immobilizer <b>4</b> and the engine controller <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> (Yes). Then, the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the activation signal to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> (S<b>3</b>). At the same time, the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the interrogating signal to the remote engine starter <b>6</b> (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the activation signal is output to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> (S<b>3</b>), the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> responds by outputting the key code KC because the key is inserted. As the key is inserted, this is not the case of remote engine starting; therefore, even when the interrogating signal QS is output to the remote engine starter <b>6</b> (S<b>4</b>), no response signal is returned from the remote engine starter <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the activation signal is received, the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> outputs the unique key code KC of the IG key <b>1</b>. Next, it is determined whether the immobilizer <b>4</b> has received the key code (S<b>5</b>). If the key code is received (Yes), the match/mismatch judging section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> judges whether the unique key code KC matches the registered key code <b>43</b> or <b>44</b> (S<b>51</b>). If they match (Yes), the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the permit signal to the engine controller <b>5</b> (S<b>52</b>), and the process is terminated (S<b>55</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">On the other hand, if the codes do not match in S<b>51</b> (No), +1 is added to the number of mismatches, (Cn−1), that occurred up to the previous cycle of the routine (S<b>53</b>), and it is determined whether the accumulated number of mismatches, Cn, exceeds a predetermined number, for example, 10 (S<b>54</b>). Before the determination, a counter is initialized (S<b>53</b>/<b>63</b>) between S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b>. If it exceeds 10 (Yes), the determination process is terminated (S<b>55</b>), and the engine will not be started. If the answer in S<b>54</b> is No, on the other hand, the activation signal is output (S<b>56</b>). Then, the process proceeds to S<b>5</b>, and if the key code is received (Yes), the process proceeds to S<b>51</b> as in the previous cycle. In this way, the determination as to whether the codes match or not is performed repeatedly and, if they still do not match after trying more than the predetermined number of times (Yes in S<b>54</b>), the determination process is terminated, and the engine will not be started.</p>

On the other hand, if the IG ON signal, etc. are output (Yes), that is, in the case of remote engine starting, the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the activation signal to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b> as in the case of the engine starting by key insertion (S<b>3</b>).

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this case, however, since the key is not inserted, the key code is not output even when the activation signal is output to the immobilizer amplifier <b>3</b>, and therefore, the immobilizer <b>4</b> does not receive any key code (No in S<b>5</b>). On the other hand, as the situation is remote engine starting, the remote engine starter <b>6</b> responds to the interrogating signal by outputting the response signal which is received by the immobilizer <b>4</b> (Yes in S<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When the response signal is received, the match/mismatch judging section of the immobilizer <b>4</b> judges whether the “remote engine starter code” <b>61</b> preregistered in the remote engine starter <b>6</b> and contained in the response signal matches the “remote engine starter verifying code” <b>45</b> stored in the immobilizer <b>4</b> (S<b>61</b>). If they match (Yes), the immobilizer <b>4</b> outputs the permit signal to the engine controller <b>5</b> (S<b>62</b>), and the determination process is terminated (S<b>65</b>).

If it exceeds 10 (Yes), the determination process is terminated, and the engine will not be started (S<b>65</b>).

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">If neither the key code nor the response signal is received (No in S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b>), it is determined whether a predetermined time, for example, 500 ms, has elapsed from the output of the activation signal or the interrogating signal (S<b>7</b>). If the answer is Yes, the process is immediately terminated. If the answer is No, it is once again determined whether the key code is received or whether the response signal is received, and it is determined whether a predetermined time, for example, 500 ms, has elapsed from the output of the activation signal or the interrogating signal (S<b>7</b>). If the key code is received before the time expires (Yes in S<b>5</b>), the process proceeds to S<b>51</b>, while if the response signal is received (Yes in S<b>6</b>), the process proceeds to S<b>61</b>.
