<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/426,856 filed on Nov. 15, 2002, entitled “BASEBOARD CLEANING APPARATUS AND METHOD”, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and method for cleaning baseboards in residences and commercial buildings. More particularly, the invention relates to a baseboard cleaner that will not damage the baseboard and that may be operated without extensive bending or stooping.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Baseboards along the bottom edge of walls are customarily cleaned by a broom or by hand. Cleaning a baseboard with a broom may scratch the baseboard. Hand cleaning by an individual may require bending, stooping, and/or kneeling for prolonged periods. Such activities may cause discomfort or injury (e.g., back injury) to the individual performing the cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some devices are known for cleaning baseboards. U.S. Pat. No. 3,042,952 to Bradley, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes a baseboard duster and applicator having a pair of parallel upright plates spaced apart by one or more supporting members. A pair of rollers is included between the plates. A pad is secured to one or both exterior surfaces of the plates for dusting or applying wax or oil to the baseboard. A handle is pivotally coupled between the plates. The handle may be rotated to alternately position the pads on either side of the apparatus for contact with the baseboard.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 3,339,220 to Barry, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes a device for cleaning corner surfaces. The device includes a right-angled scrubber head attached to a straight elongated handle. The device is adapted for simultaneously cleaning intersecting surfaces such as the adjoining areas of a baseboard and a floor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 3,713,744 to Sims, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes a combination cleaner, polisher and waxing device for walls and floors. The device includes an elongated handle having a pad carrier pivotally connected to the handle. One side margin of the carrier is weighted so that the carrier tends to a vertical position for wall cleaning when held spaced above a floor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many currently available cleaning devices do not provide multiple cleaning pads adapted to perform multiple cleaning steps, such as wetting and drying, in a single operation. In addition, many currently available cleaning devices do not provide a handle that is adapted for comfortable gripping and ease of operation. Many currently available devices do not allow for adjustment of pads to clean baseboards of various heights and widths. It is desirable to have a baseboard cleaner that is adapted to perform multiple cleaning steps in a single operation, that can be comfortably and easily operated by a user, and with pads that may be adjusted for cleaning baseboards of various dimensions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, an apparatus for cleaning a baseboard of a wall may include pads and a handle coupled to the pads. The front surfaces of the pads may be configured to contact adjoining sections of the baseboard during use. In certain embodiments, one of the pads may be a sponge and another pad may be a dry cloth. A liquid dispenser such as a water bottle may be coupled to the sponge to wet the sponge during use. In another embodiment, one pad may be a dust cloth that is adapted to collect dust, and another pad may be a polishing cloth. One or more of the pads may be removable, reversible, washable, and/or replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, an apparatus for cleaning a baseboard of a wall may include one or more rollers. A portion of a handle may be angled to extend away from the wall and rearward from one or more of the pads during use. The handle may include a grip end portion that is angled with respect to an adjoining portion of the handle for the comfort of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, a length of a handle of an apparatus may be adjustable for use by users of various heights. In some embodiments, a middle portion of a handle may be rotatably coupled to a base portion so that the middle portion of the handle can be adjusted during use or storage of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, an apparatus for cleaning a baseboard may include one or more top pads for cleaning a top face of a baseboard. The top pads may be adjustable to facilitate cleaning of baseboards of various dimensions. In some embodiments, top pads may be vertically adjustable relative to the holder. A user may vertically adjust the top pads of the apparatus to facilitate cleaning of baseboards of various heights. In other embodiments, top pads may be horizontally adjustable relative to a holder. A user may horizontally adjust the top pads to facilitate cleaning of baseboards of various thicknesses.</p>
