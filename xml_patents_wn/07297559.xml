<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of fabricating a memory and a memory, and more specifically, it relates to a method of fabricating a memory including a storage material film such as a ferroelectric film or a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) film and a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a device having a ferroelectric film is expected for application to various fields such as that of electronics, due to characteristics such as ferroelectricity. For example, a nonvolatile ferroelectric memory utilizing polarization hysteresis or the like is studied. For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-210795 discloses such a ferroelectric memory. A nonvolatile memory utilizing a colossal magnetoresistance material whose resistance is remarkably varied with pulse application of a voltage or the like is also proposed in general. The nonvolatile memory employing a colossal magnetoresistance material holds data through variation in the resistance value of a colossal magnetoresistance material film held between upper and lower electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A nonvolatile memory employing a ferroelectric film holds data by spontaneous polarization of a ferroelectric material held between upper and lower electrodes. A one-transistor one-capacitor ferroelectric memory having memory cells each constituted of one ferroelectric capacitor and one switching transistor is known as such a ferroelectric memory. In the one-transistor one-capacitor ferroelectric memory, however, switching transistors must be arranged on the respective memory cells, and hence it is disadvantageously difficult to improve the degree of integration. To this end, a nonvolatile memory consisting of a simple matrix (cross-point) ferroelectric memory having memory cells each constituted of only one ferroelectric capacitor is proposed in general. In this simple matrix ferroelectric memory, the area of each memory cell constituted of only one ferroelectric capacitor can be extremely reduced. Consequently, the degree of integration can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a sectional view showing the structure of a conventional simple matrix ferroelectric memory. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a lower electrode <b>102</b> is formed on a substrate <b>101</b> in the conventional simple matrix ferroelectric memory. Upper electrodes <b>104</b> are formed on prescribed regions of the lower electrode <b>102</b> through ferroelectric films <b>103</b>. The lower electrode <b>102</b> is connected to word lines (not shown), for example, and the upper electrodes <b>104</b> are connected to bit lines (not shown), for example. The lower electrodes <b>102</b>, the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> and the upper electrodes <b>104</b> constitute ferroelectric capacitors <b>110</b>. Each memory cell is constituted of only each ferroelectric capacitor <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> are sectional views for illustrating a process of fabricating the conventional simple matrix ferroelectric memory shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The process of fabricating the conventional simple matrix ferroelectric memory is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">First, the lower electrode <b>102</b>, a ferroelectric film layer <b>103</b> and an upper electrode layer <b>104</b> are successively deposited on the substrate <b>101</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Thereafter photoresist films <b>105</b> are formed on prescribed regions of the upper electrode layer <b>104</b>. The photoresist films <b>105</b> are employed as masks for etching the upper electrode layer <b>104</b> and the ferroelectric film layer <b>103</b>, thereby partially exposing the lower electrode <b>102</b>. Thus, the upper electrodes <b>104</b> and the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> are patterned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Thereafter the photoresist films <b>105</b> are removed thereby forming the conventional simple matrix ferroelectric memory as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the conventional simple matrix ferroelectric memory shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the upper electrodes <b>104</b> and the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> are so patterned in the same shapes that the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> are present not obliquely under but only immediately under the upper electrodes <b>104</b>. In this case, the structure disadvantageously prevents contribution of components of the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> polarized due to electric fields transversely leaking from the upper electrodes <b>104</b>. When the structure prevents contribution of components of the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> polarized due to electric fields transversely leaking from the upper electrodes <b>104</b>, the quantities of remanence of the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> are reduced to reduce the strength of signals read from the ferroelectric capacitors <b>110</b>. Consequently, it is difficult to improve read signal detection accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The aforementioned problem also results when the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> are replaced with colossal magnetoresistance materials. In other words, the structure prevents contribution of resistance components of the colossal magnetoresistance materials due to electric fields transversely leaking from the upper electrodes <b>104</b>, to disadvantageously reduce signal detection accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to solve the aforementioned problem, only the upper electrode layer <b>104</b> may be etched without etching the ferroelectric film layer <b>103</b> in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. If only the upper electrodes <b>104</b> are patterned by etching only the upper electrode layer <b>104</b> through the photoresist films <b>105</b> serving as masks in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, however, chlorine-system etching gas employed for etching the upper electrode layer <b>104</b> of Pt, for example, newly disadvantageously corrodes the exposed surface portions of the ferroelectric film layer <b>103</b>. If the exposed surface portions of the ferroelectric film layer <b>103</b> are corroded, the corroded portions lose the ferroelectric function, and hence it is consequently difficult to obtain components of the ferroelectric films <b>103</b> polarized due to the electric fields transversely leaking from the upper electrodes <b>104</b>. This problem also arises when the ferroelectric film layer <b>103</b> is replaced with a colossal magnetoresistance material. Consequently, it is difficult to improve read signal detection accuracy.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide a memory capable of improving signal reading accuracy by increasing the strength of a signal read from a memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of fabricating a memory easily allowing fabrication of a memory capable of improving signal reading accuracy by increasing the strength of a signal read from a memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of fabricating a memory according to a first aspect of the present invention comprises steps of forming a storage material film on a first electrode film, forming a storage part and an etched thin-film part by partially etching the storage material film by a prescribed thickness, forming an insulator film to cover at least the thin-film part of the storage material film and patterning the insulator film and the thin-film part of the storage material film by forming an etching mask on a prescribed region of the insulator film and thereafter etching the insulator film and the thin-film part of the storage material film through the etching mask.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the method of fabricating a memory according to the first aspect, as hereinabove described, the storage part and the thin-film part are formed by partially etching the storage material film so that a surface portion of the storage material film corroded with chlorine-based etching gas employed for etching a second electrode film formed on the storage part, for example, can be removed, whereby the thin-film part can be provided with storage characteristics against a transverse electric field from the second electrode film. Thus, the strength of a signal read from a memory cell can be so improved as to improve signal reading accuracy. Further, the etching mask and the storage material film can be prevented from coming into contact with each other by forming the insulator film to cover at least the thin-film part of the storage material film, thereafter forming the etching mask on the prescribed region of the insulator film and patterning the insulator film and the thin-film part of the storage material film. Thus, also when the etching mask is prepared from a photoresist film and the storage material film is prepared from a ferroelectric film hardly separated from the photoresist film upon contact with the photoresist film, for example, the photoresist film can be easily removed after patterning the thin-film part.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the method of fabricating a memory according to the first aspect, the step of forming the storage part and the thin-film part preferably includes a step of partially etching the storage material film so that the thin-film part has a thickness of at least about 15% of the thickness of the storage material film on the average. According to this structure, the thin-film part can be inhibited from exposing the first electrode film due to entire etching resulting from dispersion in depositional thickness of the storage material film in a wafer plane and dispersion in etching rate. Thus, it is possible to suppress inconvenience such as a short circuit resulting from an etching compound adhering to the side surface of the storage material film when the first electrode film is exposed by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the aforementioned method of fabricating a memory including the step of partially etching the storage material film so that the thin-film part has the thickness of at least about 15% of the thickness of the storage material film on the average, the step of forming the storage part and the thin-film part preferably includes a step of partially etching the storage material film so that the thin-film part has a thickness of not more than about 95% of the thickness of the storage material film on the average. According to this structure, at least about 5% of the surface of the storage material film can be removed also when a surface portion of the storage material film is corroded with chlorine-based etching gas for etching the second electrode film formed on the storage part, whereby the corroded surface portion of the storage material film can be reliably removed.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments of the present invention are now described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a simple matrix ferroelectric memory according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes a memory cell array region <b>50</b> and a peripheral circuit region <b>60</b>. Element isolation regions <b>2</b> having an STI (shallow trench isolation) structure are formed on prescribed regions of the surface of a p-type silicon substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the peripheral circuit region <b>60</b>, a pair of high-concentration impurity regions <b>8</b> are formed on an element forming region enclosed with the element isolation regions <b>2</b> at a prescribed interval. Extension regions (low-concentration impurity regions) <b>6</b> are formed on the sides of the high-concentration impurity regions <b>8</b> closer to a channel region. The high-concentration impurity regions <b>8</b> and the extension regions (low-concentration impurity regions) <b>6</b> constitute source/drain regions. A gate electrode <b>4</b> of doped polysilicon having a thickness of about 200 nm is formed on the channel region through a gate insulator film <b>3</b> of silicon oxide having a thickness of about 5 nm. A silicon oxide film <b>5</b> having a thickness of about 150 nm is formed on the gate electrode <b>4</b>. Side wall insulator films <b>7</b> of silicon oxide are formed on the side surfaces of the gate electrode <b>4</b> and the silicon oxide film <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An interlayer dielectric film <b>9</b> formed by successively stacking a silicon oxide film, a BPSG film and another silicon oxide film is provided to cover the overall surface. The interlayer dielectric film <b>9</b> is formed with contact holes <b>9</b><i>a </i>reaching the pair of high-concentration impurity regions <b>8</b>. Barrier films consisting of Ti films <b>10</b> having a thickness of about 10 nm and TiN films <b>11</b> having a thickness of about 15 nm are formed in the contact holes <b>9</b><i>a</i>. Tungsten plugs <b>12</b> are embedded in regions enclosed with the TiN films <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An IrSiN film <b>13</b> having a thickness of about 100 nm is formed on a region of the interlayer dielectric film <b>9</b> corresponding to the memory cell array region <b>50</b>. This IrSiN film <b>13</b> functions as an oxygen barrier film inhibiting oxygen from diffusion. A Pt film <b>14</b> having a thickness of about 100 nm is formed on the IrSiN film <b>13</b>. The IrSiN film <b>13</b> and the Pt film <b>14</b> constitute a lower electrode of ferroelectric capacitors. This lower electrode is an example of the “first electrode film” in the present invention. IrSiN films <b>13</b><i>a </i>and Pt films <b>14</b><i>a </i>formed by patterning layers identical to the IrSiN film <b>13</b> and the Pt film <b>14</b> of the memory cell array region <b>50</b> are provided on the tungsten plugs <b>12</b> in the peripheral circuit region <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A ferroelectric film <b>15</b> of SBT (SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>) is formed on the Pt film <b>14</b> in the memory cell array region <b>50</b>. Upper electrodes <b>16</b> of Pt having a thickness of about 200 nm are formed on the ferroelectric film <b>15</b>. The ferroelectric film <b>15</b> is an example of the “storage material film” in the present invention, and the upper electrodes <b>16</b> are examples of the “second electrode film” in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the first embodiment, the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> is constituted of storage parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, located under the upper electrodes <b>16</b>, having a thickness of about 200 nm and thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b</i>, located on regions other than the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, having a thickness of at least about 15% and not more than about 95% of the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>on the average.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lower electrode consisting of the IrSiN film <b>13</b> and the Pt film <b>14</b>, each storage part <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> and each upper electrode <b>16</b> constitute a ferroelectric capacitor constituting each memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the first embodiment, a silicon nitride film <b>17</b> is formed to cover the upper electrodes <b>16</b> and the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b>. This silicon nitride film <b>17</b> is provided in order to prevent a photoresist film from coming into contact with the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>in a step of patterning the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>described later. The silicon nitride film <b>17</b> also has a function for serving as a hydrogen diffusion barrier inhibiting hydrogen from diffusion. The silicon nitride film <b>17</b> is an example of the “insulator film” in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another interlayer dielectric film <b>18</b> of silicon oxide is formed to cover the overall surfaces of the memory cell array region <b>50</b> and the peripheral circuit region <b>60</b>. The interlayer dielectric film <b>18</b> is formed with via holes <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>. TiN films <b>19</b> having a thickness of about 15 nm are formed to come into contact with the Pt films <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the peripheral circuit region <b>60</b> and the Pt film <b>14</b> of the memory cell array region <b>50</b> in the via holes <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>respectively. Al films <b>20</b> having a thickness of about 200 nm are formed on the TiN films <b>19</b>. The TiN films <b>19</b> and the Al films <b>20</b> constitute connecting wires for connecting the memory cell array region <b>50</b> and the peripheral circuit region <b>60</b> with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the first embodiment, the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> are patterned not to be present in the vicinity of the via hole <b>18</b><i>b </i>for connecting the memory cell array region <b>50</b> with the connecting wires.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The relation between the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> and the quantity of remanent polarization is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the axis of abscissa shows the percentage of the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>with reference to the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b>. The axis of ordinate shows the rate of increase of the quantity of remanent polarization with respect to a ferroelectric memory (prior art) having no thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows the rate of increase of the quantity of remanent polarization with reference to the upper electrodes <b>16</b> having a line width of 1 μm. It is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the rate of increase of the quantity of remanent polarization is increased in proportion to the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, the rate of increase of the quantity of remanent polarization is about 3% when the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>is 50% (100 nm) of the thickness (200 nm) of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>. When the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> is identical (100%) to the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, the rate of increase of the quantity of remanent polarization is about 14%. It is understood from the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>can be provided with a larger quantity of remanent polarization against transverse electric fields from the upper electrodes <b>16</b> as the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>is increased. As understood from the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the quantity of remanent polarization provided in the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>against the transverse electric fields from the upper electrodes <b>16</b> is further increased when the line width of the upper electrodes <b>16</b> is not more than 1 μm. Therefore, the line width of the upper electrodes <b>16</b> is preferably not more than 1 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed with the thickness identical to that of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b>, however, surface portions of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>corroded with chlorine-based etching gas (Cl<sub>2</sub>/Ar gas) employed for patterning the upper electrodes <b>16</b> remain unremoved. In this case, the corroded surface portions of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>lose the ferroelectric function, and hence the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>hardly ferroelectrically function against the transverse electric fields from the upper electrodes <b>16</b>. Thus, the quantity of remanent polarization is not increased. In order to remove the corroded surface portions of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b</i>, the surfaces of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>must be removed by at least about 5% of the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>is preferably set to not more than about 95% of the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>on the average.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>is set smaller than 15% of the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>may be entirely removed to partially expose the Pt film <b>14</b> constituting the lower electrode due to dispersion in depositional thickness of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> in a wafer plane and dispersion in etching rate. In this case, the exposed portions of the Pt film <b>14</b> are so etched that an etching compound disadvantageously adheres to the side surfaces of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>to short-circuit the lower electrode and the upper electrodes <b>16</b>. This problem is now described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is extremely difficult to leave a ferroelectric material in the range of 0 to 15% along the overall area in a wafer plane. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates thickness distribution in a ferroelectric film deposited on a wafer of 6 inches, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates in-plane dispersion of an etching rate for the ferroelectric film etched with CF<sub>4</sub>/Ar gas. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ferroelectric film deposited on the wafer of 6 inches causes dispersion of about 5%. Further, the etching rate is dispersed by about 10% as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, it is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> that the Pt film <b>14</b> constituting the lower electrode is partially etched in peripheral regions of the wafer when the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> are to be left on the central portion of the wafer with a thickness smaller than about 15%. In such regions, an etching compound resulting from the Pt film <b>14</b> adheres to the side surfaces of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b>, to easily short-circuit the ferroelectric capacitors. In consideration of the dispersion in depositional thickness of the ferroelectric film and the dispersion in etching rate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, therefore, the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>must be set to at least about 15% of the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>on the average.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, the thickness of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> is preferably set to at least about 15% and not more than about 95% of the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>on the average.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> provided with the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>and the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>having the thickness smaller than the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>is so formed that the surfaces of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>are partially removed by etching when the same are corroded with chlorine-based etching gas employed for etching the upper electrodes <b>16</b> formed on the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a</i>, whereby the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>can ferroelectrically function against the transverse electric fields from the upper electrodes <b>16</b>. Thus, the strength of signals read from the memory cells can be so improved as to improve signal reading accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the first embodiment, further, the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed with the thickness of at least about 15% of the thickness of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>on the average as hereinabove described, whereby the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>can be inhibited from partially exposing the Pt film <b>14</b> constituting the lower electrode due to entire removal resulting dispersion in depositional thickness of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> in the wafer plane and dispersion in etching rate when the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed by partially etching the ferroelectric film <b>15</b>. Thus, it is possible to suppress inconvenience such as a short circuit between the lower electrode and the upper electrodes <b>16</b> resulting from an etching compound adhering to the side surfaces of the storage parts <b>15</b><i>a </i>when the Pt film <b>14</b> constituting the lower electrode is exposed by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the silicon nitride film <b>17</b> serving as an insulator film is formed to cover the surfaces of the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>so that a photoresist film (etching mask) can be formed on the silicon nitride film <b>17</b> for patterning the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>as described later, whereby the photoresist film can be prevented from coming into contact with the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b</i>. Thus, also when the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> is made of a material hardly separated from the photoresist film upon contact with the photoresist films, the photoresist film can be easily removed after patterning the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The silicon nitride film <b>17</b> having the function of inhibiting hydrogen from diffusion can inhibit hydrogen from diffusing into the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> from above. Thus, the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> consisting of an oxide can be easily inhibited from deterioration of characteristics resulting from penetration of hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the first embodiment, further, the thin-film parts <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> are patterned not to be present in the vicinity of the via hole <b>18</b><i>b </i>for connecting the memory cell array region <b>50</b> with the connecting wires so that the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> made of a hardly etched material may not be etched in formation of the via hole <b>18</b><i>b</i>, whereby the via hole <b>18</b><i>b </i>can be easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A process of fabricating the ferroelectric memory according to the first embodiment is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> to <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the element isolation regions <b>2</b> of the STI structure are formed on the prescribed regions of the p-type silicon substrate <b>1</b>. Thereafter n and p wells are formed by ion implantation and the thresholds of n- and p-channel transistors are adjusted by another ion implantation. Thereafter a silicon oxide film <b>3</b><i>a </i>is formed by thermal oxidation with a thickness of about 5 nm.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a silicon oxide film (not shown) having a thickness of about 200 nm is formed on the overall surface by LPCVD and thereafter anisotropically etched thereby forming the side wall insulator films <b>7</b> on the side surfaces of the gate insulator film <b>3</b>, the gate electrode <b>4</b> and the silicon oxide film <b>5</b>. The side wall insulator films <b>7</b> are employed as masks for ion-implanting arsenic (As) ions under conditions of implantation energy of about 30 keV and a dose of about 1×10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>, thereby forming the high-concentration impurity regions <b>8</b>. The extension regions <b>6</b> and the high-concentration impurity regions <b>8</b> constitute the source/drain regions. Thereafter heat treatment is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere at about 850° C. for about 30 minutes, in order to activate the ion-implanted impurity.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then, another silicon oxide film is formed by LPCVD to cover the overall surface with a thickness of about 200 nm, and a BPSG film is deposited on this silicon oxide film with a thickness of about 800 nm. Heat treatment is performed in an oxygen atmosphere at about 850° C. for about 30 minutes, thereby reflowing the BPSG film. Thereafter the BPSG film is etched or polished into a desired thickness by dry etching or CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). Still another silicon oxide film is deposited on the BPSG film by LPCVD with a thickness of about 100 nm, thereby forming the interlayer dielectric film <b>9</b> having a three-layer structure of silicon oxide, BPSG and silicon oxide. The contact holes <b>9</b><i>a </i>reaching the high-concentration regions <b>8</b> are formed in the interlayer dielectric film <b>9</b> by photolithography and dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The Ti films <b>10</b> having the thickness of about 10 nm and the TiN films <b>11</b> having the thickness of about 15 nm are successively deposited in the contact holes <b>9</b><i>a </i>and on the upper surface of the interlayer dielectric film <b>9</b> by sputtering.

Thereafter an annealing step is carried out in an oxygen atmosphere at about 650° C. for about 1 hour. The spin coating of the SBT solution and the heat treatment are repeated until the thickness of the ferroelectric film <b>15</b> reaches about 200 nm. Thereafter a Pt film <b>16</b><i>a </i>is formed by sputtering with a thickness of about 200 nm, and photoresist films <b>22</b> are formed on prescribed regions of the Pt film <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The photoresist films <b>22</b> are employed as masks for etching the Pt film <b>16</b><i>a </i>by dry etching with Cl<sub>2</sub>/Ar gas, thereby forming the upper electrodes <b>16</b> of patterned Pt as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Finally, the TiN films <b>19</b> having the thickness of about 15 nm and the Al films <b>20</b> having the thickness of about 200 nm are deposited by sputtering and thereafter patterned by photolithography and dry etching, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

A lower electrode consisting of an IrSiN film <b>13</b> and a Pt film <b>14</b>, the PCMO film <b>25</b> and the upper electrodes <b>16</b> of Pt constitute resistive elements for storing data.
