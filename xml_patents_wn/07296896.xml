<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ophthalmic measurement apparatus for measuring at least one of refractive power and wavefront aberration of an examinee's eye.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, there is known an eye refractive power measurement apparatus for obtaining refractive power of an examinee's eye which varies in a meridian direction based on signals indicating phase differences from a plurality of photo detectors placed in the meridian direction (for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,907,388 corresponding to Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No. Hei10-108837). In addition, there is known a wavefront aberration measurement apparatus for obtaining wavefront aberration of an examinee's eye using a Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor (for example, see WO 99/27334 corresponding to Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Publication for Patent Application No. 2001-524662).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The wavefront aberration is obtained from the refractive power with ease and high precision if refractive power containing a skew ray component which is ordinarily present in the human eye is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the invention is, in view of the above background arts, to provide an ophthalmic measurement apparatus capable of obtaining refractive power containing a skew ray component, and further, obtaining wavefront aberration from the refractive power with more ease and higher precision.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, an ophthalmic measurement apparatus includes a projection optical system which projects slit light bundles onto a fundus of an examinee's eye and scans the slit light bundles in predetermined first and second directions, a photo-receiving optical system provided with a plurality of photodetectors placed in positions approximately conjugate with a cornea of the examinee's eye and placed in at least one meridian direction orthogonal to an optical axis of the photo-receiving optical system, and an arithmetic part which obtains, based on a signal indicating a phase difference at the time when one of the photodetectors photo-receives the slit light bundle scanned in the first scanning direction and a signal indicating a phase difference at the time when the photodetector photo-receives the slit light bundle scanned in the second scanning direction, refractive power in two directions at a corneal position corresponding to a position of the photodetector, and further obtains at least one of refractive power and a wavefront inclination by vector-synthesizing the obtained refractive power in the two directions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the present invention, an ophthalmic measurement apparatus includes a projection optical system which projects a slit light bundle onto a fundus of an examinee's eye and scans the slit light bundle in a predetermined direction, a photo-receiving optical system provided with a plurality of photodetectors which are placed in positions approximately conjugate with a cornea of the examinee's eye and placed in a first meridian direction orthogonal to an optical axis of the photo-receiving optical system and in a second meridian direction orthogonal to the optical axis of the photo-receiving optical system and intersecting with the first meridian direction at a predetermined angle, a rotation unit which rotates the scanning direction of the slit light bundle about an optical axis of the projection optical system and the photodetectors placed in the first and second meridian directions about the optical axis of the photo-receiving optical system in synchronization with each other, and an arithmetic part which obtains, based on a signal indicating a phase difference at the time when one of the photodetectors placed in the first meridian direction photo-receives the slit light bundle and a signal indicating a phase difference at the time when one of the photodetectors placed in the second meridian direction photo-receives the slit light bundle after being rotated by a predetermined angle, the photodetector being at the same distance from the optical axis of the photo-receiving optical system as the photodetector placed in the first meridian direction, refractive power in two directions at corneal positions corresponding to positions of the photodetectors, and further obtains at least one of refractive power and wavefront inclinations by vector-synthesizing the obtained refractive power in the two directions.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic configuration of an optical system and a control system of an ophthalmic measurement apparatus consistent with the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The optical system includes an eye refractive power measurement optical system, a corneal shape measurement optical system, and a fixation target presenting optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The eye refractive power measurement optical system includes a slit light bundle projection optical system <b>20</b> and a photo-receiving optical system <b>30</b>. The projection optical system <b>20</b> includes an infrared light source <b>21</b> for measurement, a rotation sector <b>22</b> in which slits <b>22</b><i>a </i>and slits <b>22</b><i>b </i>orthogonal to each other are formed in a staggered configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a lens <b>23</b>, a diaphragm <b>24</b>, and a half mirror <b>25</b>. Then, by rotation of the rotation sector <b>22</b>, slit light bundles in two directions orthogonal to each other are alternately projected onto and scanned on a fundus Ef of an examinee's eye E. The rotation sector <b>22</b> is rotated by a rotation mechanism <b>80</b> such as a motor.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In eye refractive power measurement, the slit light bundle in the first scanning direction and the slit light bundle in the second scanning direction are alternately scanned on the fundus Ef, and reflection light bundles thereof are photo-received on the photodetectors <b>33</b><i>a </i>to <b>33</b><i>p</i>. The arithmetic control part <b>70</b> obtains refractive power and wavefront aberration at respective corneal positions corresponding to positions of the respective photodetectors based on signals indicating phase differences from the respective photodetectors.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, a description will be given to measurement of the eye refractive power and calculation of the wavefront aberration. Now, assuming a polar coordinate system in which a horizontal direction is taken as a 0°-180° direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a case is considered where a ray, which starts from a fovea of the fundus Ef and exits from a point Pc on the cornea Ec, the point Pc being at a height h from the optical axis L<b>1</b> in a 90°-270° direction, is deviated by refractive power at the corneal position. In the case of a non-aberration eye with no refractive error, the ray exiting from the point Pc travels in a straight line, so that a position of a point P (a corresponding point to the point Pc) on a screen T which includes a coordinate system perpendicular to the optical axis L<b>1</b> and is placed at a certain distance d from the cornea Ec does not change. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the coordinate system on the screen T. In the case of an eye only with spherical error, the point P on the screen T of the ray exiting from the point Pc is deviated according to its spherical error in a meridian direction (meridional direction) which passes through an origin point O of the coordinate system, the origin point O positioned at the optical axis L<b>1</b>. In the case of an eye with refractive error containing astigmatism, in which a skew ray component is present, the ray exiting from the point Pc travels in a different direction from the meridian direction. In order to simplify the description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a case where an eye E has only refractive power of regular astigmatism with a principal meridian angle θ and the ray exiting from the point Pc is deviated from the point P to a point Q on the screen T. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, refractive power ΔP which deviates the ray from the point P to the point Q is refractive power obtained by vector-synthesizing refractive power ΔPm in the meridian direction (meridional direction) being the 90°-270° direction and refractive power ΔPs in a direction orthogonal to the meridian direction (i.e., in a sagittal direction). Accordingly, once the refractive power in these two directions is obtained, refractive power containing (considering) the skew ray component and a wavefront inclination can be obtained at respective corneal positions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, description on a method for obtaining the refractive power containing the skew ray component based on signals indicating phase differences from the respective photodetectors will be given.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Firstly, when the slit light bundle is scanned in the first scanning direction corresponding to the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction which is placed in (corresponds to) the 90°-270° corneal meridian direction, a position of the optical axis L<b>1</b> in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction is detected by the photodetectors <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>h </i>in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction, and based on signals indicating phase differences between the optical axis L<b>1</b> position and respective positions of the photodetectors in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction, refractive power at corneal positions corresponding to the respective positions of the photodetectors (first refractive power in the 90°-270° corneal meridian direction) (ΔP<b>1</b><i>m</i>) is obtained. At the same time, a position of the optical axis L<b>1</b> in a direction orthogonal to the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction is detected by the photodetectors <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>h </i>in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction, and based on signals indicating phase differences between the optical axis L<b>1</b> position and respective positions of the photodetectors in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction, refractive power at corneal positions corresponding to the respective positions of the photodetectors (second refractive power in a direction orthogonal to the 0°-180° corneal meridian direction) (ΔP<b>2</b><i>s</i>) is obtained.

These measurement results are also stored in the memory <b>70</b><i>a </i>provided to the arithmetic control part <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The arithmetic control part <b>70</b> calls up the measurement results by the slit light bundle in the first scanning direction and the measurement results by the slit light bundle in the second scanning direction from the memory <b>70</b><i>a</i>, and obtains refractive power obtained by vector-synthesizing the refractive power in the two directions at the corneal positions corresponding to the respective positions of the photodetectors in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction, and refractive power obtained by vector-synthesizing the refractive power in the two directions at the corneal positions corresponding to the respective positions of the photodetectors in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction. In other words, at the point P<b>1</b> on the cornea, ΔP<b>1</b> is obtained by vector-synthesizing ΔP<b>1</b><i>m </i>and ΔP<b>1</b><i>s</i>, and at the point P<b>2</b> on the cornea, ΔP<b>2</b> is obtained by vector-synthesizing ΔP<b>2</b><i>m </i>and ΔP<b>2</b><i>s</i>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present embodiment, in order to obtain refractive power in all corneal meridian directions in increments of a predetermined angle, it is essential only that the rotation sector <b>22</b> and the photo-receiving part <b>33</b> are rotated by 90° in increments of the predetermined angle, whereby a measurement time can be shortened compared with the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a view showing placement of photodetectors provided to a photo-receiving part <b>33</b> consistent with the third preferred embodiment. Photodetectors <b>35</b><i>a </i>to <b>35</b><i>n </i>in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction consistent with the third embodiment, of which placement is changed from that of the photodetectors <b>34</b><i>a </i>to <b>34</b><i>n </i>in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction consistent with the second embodiment, are placed with displacement so that respective distances thereof from the optical axis L<b>1</b> become different from (do not correspond to) distances of photodetectors <b>33</b><i>a </i>to <b>33</b><i>n </i>in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction from the optical axis L<b>1</b>. In the third embodiment, the placement of the photodetectors in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction is displaced from that of the photodetectors in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction by 0.25 mm which is a half of 0.5 mm being a space between the photodetectors. Owing to such placement, when the respective photodetectors in the second photo-receiving meridian M<b>2</b> direction are rotated by 90°, refractive power at corneal positions displaced from the corneal positions corresponding to the respective positions of the photodetectors in the first photo-receiving meridian M<b>1</b> direction is obtained in the same corneal meridian direction. Besides, in the present third embodiment, similarly to the first embodiment, through the rotation of the rotation sector <b>22</b> and the photo-receiving part <b>33</b> by 180° in increments of a predetermined angle, refractive power in all corneal meridian directions in increments of the predetermined angle can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As a method for improving measurement resolving power, it is essential only to increase the number of the photodetectors in the meridian directions; however, as areas of the photodetectors need to be secured considering an S/N ratio, there is a limit to the increase in number. According to the present third embodiment, the measurement resolving power can be improved while securing the areas of the respective photodetectors.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, in the photo-receiving part <b>33</b> consistent with the present third embodiment, a four-split photodetector <b>36</b> for detecting an alignment state is placed in the middle of the photodetectors <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>h</i>, <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>h</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows a schematic configuration of a signal processing system of the photodetector <b>36</b>. The photodetector <b>36</b> includes four photodetectors <b>36</b><i>a </i>to <b>36</b><i>d </i>having the optical axis L<b>1</b> as their center. The photodetector <b>36</b> is connected to a detection circuit <b>76</b> separate from the phase-difference detection circuit <b>75</b> for the photodetectors <b>33</b><i>a </i>to <b>33</b><i>n </i>and <b>35</b><i>a </i>to <b>35</b><i>n </i>for measurement, and the detection circuit <b>76</b> is connected to the arithmetic control part <b>70</b>. The light source <b>21</b> for measurement doubles as a light source for alignment and its corneal reflection light bundle is photo-received as a reflex <b>90</b> on the photodetector <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An alignment state of the eye refractive power measurement optical system in the up/down and right/left directions with respect to the eye E is detected from a balance between light amounts of the four photodetectors <b>36</b><i>a </i>to <b>36</b><i>d</i>. To be more specific, when the alignment state is appropriate, the reflex <b>90</b> on the photodetector <b>36</b> centers at the optical axis L<b>1</b> and output signals from the photodetectors <b>36</b><i>a </i>to <b>36</b><i>d </i>become almost equal. When the alignment state shows deviation to the right, the reflex <b>90</b> is located in the right part on the photodetector <b>36</b> and the output signals from the photodetectors <b>36</b><i>b </i>and <b>36</b><i>d </i>become larger than those from the photodetectors <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>c</i>. When the alignment state shows deviation in an upward direction, the reflex <b>90</b> is located in the upper part on the photodetector <b>36</b> and the output signals from the photodetectors <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>become larger than those from the photodetectors <b>36</b><i>c </i>and <b>36</b><i>d</i>. Accordingly, a direction and a degree of alignment deviation can be detected. In addition, based on an output signal from the entire photodetector <b>36</b>, a corneal reflection level can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In measuring the refractive power in all meridian directions by rotating the rotation sector <b>22</b> and the photo-receiving part <b>33</b>, the arithmetic control part <b>70</b> controls to store the output signal from the photodetector <b>36</b> together with phase signals from the photodetectors <b>33</b><i>a </i>to <b>33</b><i>n </i>and <b>35</b><i>a </i>to <b>35</b><i>n</i>. Afterward, at the stage of obtaining the refractive power in the respective meridian directions, detection information from the photodetector <b>36</b> is utilized for judging usefulness of measurement data in the respective meridian directions. In a case where alignment deviation in one meridian direction exceeds a permissible range or a case where there is abnormality in coneal reflection, the measurement data in the meridian direction is subjected to interpolation by the measurement data in the neighboring meridian direction and the like. Besides, the alignment state may be detected using the CCD camera <b>54</b> being observation means for an anterior segment of an eye.</p>
