<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a vehicle suspension and, in particular, to a suspension and a drive assembly for use in skid steer loaders.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Skid steer loaders are loaders that are designed to enable maneuverability within confined spaces. A conventional skid steer loader includes a forward axle and a rear axle with a corresponding set of forward and rear wheels disposed on either side of the vehicle. The forward and rear wheels on any one side of the vehicle are moved together, but are moved independently from the forward and rear wheels on the opposite side of the vehicle. As a result, the speed of the wheels on each side of the vehicle can be independently controlled to allow forward or reverse motion of the loader and to allow the loader to turn within confined spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The wheels in a conventional skid steer loader are driven by a motor disposed between the longitudinal frame rails of the vehicle frame. Sprocket chains connect one or more output shafts of the motor with the axle shafts on which the wheels are supported. The axle shafts are disposed within housings that are rigidly attached to the vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The conventional skid steer loader described above suffers from several drawbacks. In particular, the rigid linking of the axle shafts to the vehicle frame and the lack of independent suspension between the forward and rear wheels restricts motion and vibration damping.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors herein have recognized a need for a suspension and drive assembly that will minimize and/or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides both a suspension and a drive assembly for use on with first and second wheels that are disposed on first and second longitudinally spaced axles in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A suspension in accordance with the present invention includes a bearing support disposed about an axis. The suspension further includes a first arm mounted to the bearing support for rotation about the axis. The first arm extends forward from the bearing support and is configured to support a first wheel proximate a forward end of the first arm. The suspension further includes a second arm mounted to the bearing support for rotation about the axis independent of the first arm. The second arm extending rearward from the bearing support and is configured to support a second wheel proximate a rearward end of the second arm.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A drive assembly in accordance with the present invention includes a motor having an output shaft, a first pinion gear mounted on the output shaft and a first ring gear in mesh with the first pinion gear and drivingly coupled to the first wheel. The drive assembly further includes a universal joint coupled to the output shaft. The drive assembly further includes a driven shaft coupled to the universal joint, a second pinion gear mounted on the driven shaft and a second ring gear in mesh with the second pinion gear and drivingly coupled to the second wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The suspension and the drive assembly of the present invention offer significant advantages. In particular, the present invention allows for flexible and independent movement of forward and rear wheels that are driven by the same power source but supported on longitudinally spaced axles as in skid steer loaders</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other advantages of this invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings illustrating features of this invention by way of example.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to identify identical components in the various views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrates a suspension and drive assembly <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. Assembly <b>10</b> is provided to allow independent movement of forward and rear wheels <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> that are driven together by the same power source and are disposed on longitudinally spaced axles of a vehicle. As a result, assembly <b>10</b> is particularly applicable for use with skid steer loaders. It should be understood, however, that assembly <b>10</b> may find use in other applications having similar power transmission constructs. An assembly <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention may include both a suspension <b>16</b> and a drive assembly <b>18</b>. Although only one suspension and drive assembly is shown in the illustrations, it should be understood that a similar suspension and drive assembly may be replicated on the other side of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Suspension <b>16</b> is provided to dampen movement between the wheels and the vehicle frame. Suspension <b>16</b> may include a bearing support <b>20</b>, suspension arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and dampers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
