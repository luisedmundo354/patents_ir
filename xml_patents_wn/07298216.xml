<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A digital phase locked loop apparatus includes an input signal time detecting device that detects a phase of an input signal with prescribed time resolution obtained by dividing a cycle of an operation clock generated by a clock generator at a prescribed time. An output clock generating device outputs output clock time data per the one cycle in accordance with frequency control data. The output clock time data has a value corresponding to a phase of a virtual output clock generated by dividing the operation clock in accordance with the time resolution. A phase difference detecting device detects a difference between phases of the input signal and the virtual output clock, and outputs a phase difference signal in accordance with the detection result. The frequency control device changes the frequency control data in accordance with the phase difference signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to a digital phase locked loop apparatus including a phase locked loop circuit, which generates a reproduction clock in synchronism with reproduction data of an optical disc apparatus or a magnetic disc apparatus, as well as a recordation clock in synchronism with a wobble signal of the optical disc apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Discussion of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A phase synchronization loop circuit (a phase locked loop circuit) is utilized in a data reproducing apparatus that reproduces data from a rotational storage medium, such as an optical disc, a magnetic disc, etc., to obtain a clock that synchronizes with reproduction data. The phase locked loop circuit is almost realized by an analog circuit that employs a voltage-controlled oscillator. However, a self-running frequency of such an analog voltage controlled oscillator tends to vary in accordance with a change in environment temperature or power supply voltage, thereby resulting in a long pull-in time of the phase locked loop circuit. Then, a digital phase locked loop circuit has been proposed as discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 60.245312.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the digital phase locked loop circuit does not employ an analog voltage controlled oscillator, the above-mentioned variation does not occur, and a self-running frequency is stable with a frequency clock precision (i.e., crystal precision) provided as a reference. Further, since being entirely configured by a digital circuit, the digital phase locked loop circuit can be easily mounted on an integrated circuit, thereby an apparatus can be downsized and is low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a conventional digital phase locked loop circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates an operational wave appearing in the digital phase locked loop circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The digital phase locked loop circuit includes a phase comparator <b>700</b>, a counter <b>701</b>, an incrementer-decrementer <b>702</b>, and a divider <b>703</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The digital phase locked loop circuit needs a high frequency clock as an operational clock PC<b>2</b> used in the phase locked loop when time resolution of a phase of an output clock FS thereof is to be enhanced. For example, a frequency of thirty-two times of a reproduction data rate is required as an operational clock in the digital phase locked loop circuit when time resolution of an output clock phase of the digital phase locked loop is to be thirty-two times of the reproduction data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, recordation and reproduction speeds for a CD and a DVD have significantly increased, and recently, the internal operational clock frequency has become extraordinarily high in the above-mentioned conventional digital phase locked loop circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result, it exceeds an operation frequency limit for the circuit, thereby the digital phase locked loop circuit becomes inoperative when the reproduction data rate is large. This invention is made in view of the above-mentioned aspects, and it is an object of the invention to achieve a fine time resolution of an output clock phase while using a relatively low frequency of an operational clock.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to address and resolve such and other problems and provide a new digital phase locked loop apparatus. The new and novel digital phase locked loop apparatus includes an input signal time detecting device (<b>2</b>) that detects a phase of an input signal (S<b>1</b>) with prescribed time resolution obtained by dividing a cycle of an operation clock generated by a clock generator at a prescribed time (N). The input signal time detecting device (<b>2</b>) outputs input signal time data (S<b>2</b>) in accordance with the detection result per the one cycle. An output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) outputs output clock time data (S<b>5</b>) per the one cycle in accordance with frequency control data. The output clock time data has a value corresponding to a phase of a virtual output clock generated by dividing the operation clock in accordance with the time resolution. A phase difference detecting device (<b>3</b>) detects a difference between phases of the input signal and the virtual output clock, and outputs a phase difference signal (S<b>3</b>) in accordance with the detection result. The frequency control device (<b>4</b>) changes the frequency control data (S<b>4</b>) in accordance with the phase difference signal (S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the clock generator generates a multi phase clock including a plurality of phase clock signals having different phases by a scale of time resolution per one cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another embodiment, the output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) is operated by a clock of the one cycle and stores a state in accordance with a phase of the virtual output clock. The output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) determines the next state based on a relation between the frequency control data and a current state. The output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) outputs output clock time data in accordance with the next state.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In yet another embodiment, the output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) is operated by a clock of the one cycle and including a plurality of storage devices to store a current state and one or more past states in accordance with a phase of the virtual output clock. The output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) determines the next state based on a relation between the frequency control data, a current state, and the one or more past states. The output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) outputs output clock time data in accordance with the next state.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another embodiment, the output clock generating device (<b>5</b>) includes a prescribed number (N) of multipliers that multiply the frequency control data and one to the prescribed number (N) of positive integer, respectively, a storage device configured to store data input per clock of the one cycle, and a prescribed number (N) of adders that add the data stored in the storage device to outputs from the prescribed number (N) of multipliers. An output of one of the prescribed number (N) of adders is input to the storage device, and the outputs from the prescribed number (N) of adders constitute the output clock time data.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another embodiment, the phase difference detecting device (<b>3</b>) selects an output from one of the prescribed number (N) of adders in accordance with the input signal time data (S<b>2</b>). The phase difference detecting device (<b>3</b>) detects the phase difference based on the selected output, and outputs the phase difference signal (S<b>3</b>) in accordance with the detection result.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention of the digital phase locked loop apparatus, fine time resolution of an output clock phase is obtained while maintaining a frequency of an operational clock to be relatively low.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout several views, in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary configuration of a digital phase locked loop circuit (DPLC) of a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates operational waves appearing in the digital phase locked loop circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a clock source <b>1</b> provides an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> having a cycle T<b>1</b> to each of an input signal time detection section <b>2</b>, and an output clock generation section <b>5</b>. The input signal time detection section <b>2</b> detects a phase of an input signal S<b>1</b> input to the digital phase locked loop circuit with time resolution T<b>2</b> (T<b>2</b>=T<b>1</b>/N), which is obtained by dividing the cycle T<b>1</b> of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> by N times. The input signal time detection section <b>2</b> outputs data per cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is conditioned in the operational wave chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the formulas T<b>2</b>=T<b>1</b>/4 and N=4 are established. The larger the N, the finer the detection resolution in the input signal time detection section <b>2</b>. However, the equality N=4 is used for the purpose of easy comprehension. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), clock cycle numbers <b>0</b> to <b>7</b> are assigned to respective cycles of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> for explaining an operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), phases obtained by dividing a cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> by N times (e.g. four) into a unit of T<b>2</b> are assigned with N time division phase numbers from <b>4</b> to <b>1</b>. Here, a larger N time division phase number represents an earlier time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown, an input signal S<b>1</b> changes from low (L) to high (H) at a time corresponding to the N time division phase number <b>3</b> of the clock cycle number <b>0</b>. When detecting such a changing edge, the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> outputs the N time division phase number at the time as input signal time data S<b>2</b> during a cycle of the next operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>e</i>), data “3” is output as an input signal time data S<b>2</b> when the clock cycle number of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is “1”. When a changing edge of the input signal S<b>1</b> does not appear during a cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> causes input signal time data S<b>2</b> output during the next cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> to be “0”.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since a changing edge of the input signal S<b>1</b> does not exist when the clock cycle numbers are “1” and “2” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), the input signal time data S<b>2</b> in clock cycle numbers “2” and “3” thereof becomes “0” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>e</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary interior configuration of an input signal time detection section <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary operational wave appearing in the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A gate circuit <b>251</b> detects a rising edge of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> and outputs a pulse signal S<b>251</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>). A power supply source <b>252</b> continuously charges a condenser <b>253</b> with a constant current. A switch <b>254</b> discharges electric charge of the condenser every time when the pulse signal S<b>251</b> is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As a result, a signal obtained by detecting the charged voltage of the condenser <b>253</b> via a buffer <b>255</b> comes to have the same frequency as the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> and forms a wave signal having a saw shape (a sawtooth wave signal) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>f</i>). Thus, a saw wave signal S<b>253</b> as shown in (f) is output from the buffer <b>255</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The gate circuit <b>256</b> detects both rising and descending edges of the input signal S<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>), and outputs a pulse signal S<b>252</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>e</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the pulse signal S<b>252</b> is generated, the switch <b>257</b> is turned on (ON), and a voltage of the saw wave signal S<b>253</b> charges the condenser S<b>252</b>. The charged voltage is maintained until being discharged by the switch <b>259</b> that is turned on (ON) by a pulse signal S<b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, a signal obtained by detecting a charged voltage of the condenser <b>258</b> via a buffer <b>260</b> causes a voltage signal S<b>254</b> corresponding to a phase of the generated input signal S<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>g</i>). By applying AD conversion to the voltage signal S<b>254</b> from analog to digital using an AD converter (ADC in the drawing) <b>261</b>, input signal time data S<b>2</b> having a value corresponding to the phase of the input signal S<b>1</b> can be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>h</i>). The output clock generation section <b>5</b> changes an edge phase of a virtual output clock with time resolution T<b>2</b> in accordance with frequency control data S<b>4</b>. However, the virtual output clock is not practically output. Instead, output clock time data S<b>5</b> having a value corresponding to an edge phase of the virtual output clock is output per cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As represented by the operational waves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> causes the edge phase of the virtual output clock to position at the N time division phase number “2” when a clock cycle number of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is “0”. Data “2” is thus practically output as output clock time data S<b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>i</i>). Similarly, when the clock cycle numbers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) are <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> causes phases of the virtual output clock to position at N time division phase numbers “2”, “3”, and “3”, respectively, and practically outputs data “2”, “3”, and “3” as output clock time data S<b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>i</i>). An edge of a virtual output clock is not generated during the cycle in the clock cycle number “6”.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this situation, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> outputs data “0” as output clock time data S<b>5</b>. A phase difference detection section <b>3</b> detects a phase difference between the input signal and the virtual output clock based on the input signal time data S<b>2</b> and the output clock time data S<b>5</b>, and outputs a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> having a value corresponding to the detection result per cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>. Since the phase of an input signal S<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>) corresponds to the N time division phase number “3” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), and the virtual output clock phase of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>h</i>) corresponds to the N time division phase number “2”, the phase of the input signal S<b>1</b> advances by one N time division phase number from that of the virtual output clock when the clock cycle number of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is “0”.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The phase difference detection section <b>3</b> detects a phase difference between input signal time data S<b>2</b> obtained in the clock cycle number “1” of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and output clock time data S<b>5</b> obtained in the clock cycle number “0”, and outputs a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> having the value “1” in the cycle of the clock cycle number “2”. When a changing edge of the input signal S<b>1</b> or an edge of the virtual output clock does not appear during a cycle of an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, the value of the phase difference signal S<b>3</b> becomes “0”. The frequency control section <b>4</b> changes frequency control data S<b>4</b> in accordance with the phase difference signal S<b>3</b>. As a result, a feedback loop is formed, and the phase of the virtual output clock can synchronize with the input signal S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As generally known as a phase locked loop technology, the frequency control section <b>4</b> generates frequency control data S<b>4</b> by either multiplying a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> and a prescribed gain or lifting a gain in a low frequency region.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Thus, the digital phase locked loop circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can increase time resolution of a virtual output clock phase about N times while using an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> having a relatively low frequency with a cycle T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, an output clock phase of fine time resolution can be provided while using a clock having a relatively low frequency. Because, the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> detects a phase of an input signal S<b>1</b> with time resolution T<b>2</b> (T<b>2</b>=T<b>1</b>/N) calculated by dividing the cycle T<b>1</b> N times, and outputs input signal time data S<b>2</b> having a value corresponding to the detection result per cycle T<b>1</b>. Further because, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> changes a phase of the virtual output clock with time resolution T<b>2</b> in accordance with frequency control data, and outputs output clock time data S<b>5</b> having a value corresponding to a virtual output clock phase per cycle T<b>1</b>. Accordingly, fine time resolution of an output clock phase can be realized using a relatively low frequency operational clock.</p>

Operations of a phase difference detection section <b>3</b>, a frequency control section <b>4</b>, an output clock generation section <b>5</b> are the same as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, thereby explanation of those are omitted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a multi phase clock source <b>6</b> includes a plurality of (e.g. four) steps of differential buffers <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> serially connected to the other while connected each of respective output buffers <b>105</b> to <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the differential buffers <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> is fed back to the first step differential buffer <b>101</b> while an output signal of the last step differential buffer <b>104</b> is reversed, thereby a ring oscillator is formed. Respective outputs of the differential buffers <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> are output from the differential buffers <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> via the output buffers <b>105</b> to <b>108</b>, respectively, as four phase operational clock signals Clk<b>1</b> to Clk<b>4</b>. These four phase operational clock signals Clk<b>1</b> to Clk<b>4</b> include the same frequencies to each other and a prescribe phase difference as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) to (<i>e</i>). Although the four differential buffers are employed in this second example, the other number of differential buffers can be connected corresponding to time resolution N (positive integer) as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, although illustration is omitted in the second embodiment, a delay value of the differential buffer can be changed by changing an operation voltage or the like of a differential buffer, accordingly, time resolution T<b>2</b> can be changed. Thus, the time resolution T<b>2</b> can be adjusted as necessary. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an input line of an input signal S<b>1</b> is commonly connected to a D-terminal of each of four DFFs <b>201</b> to <b>204</b> in an input signal time detection section <b>20</b> as a D-input.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, input lines of the operational clock signals Clk<b>1</b> to Clk<b>4</b> of the four different phases are connected to CK-terminals as clock signal (CK) inputs, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, a first combination logic <b>208</b> receives output signals of the four DFFs <b>201</b> to <b>204</b> through respective input terminals i<b>1</b> to i<b>4</b>, converts these output signals into two signals, and outputs those to DFFs <b>205</b> and <b>206</b> via output terminals o<b>1</b> and o<b>2</b>, respectively. Respective output signals are input to a second combination logic <b>209</b> via the DFFs <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>. Output signals of the DFFs <b>204</b> and <b>207</b> are also input to the second combination logic <b>209</b>. The second combination logic <b>208</b> receives output signals of DFFs <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>207</b> through respective input terminals i<b>1</b> to i<b>2</b>, i<b>3</b>, and i<b>4</b>, converts these four input signals into two output signals, and outputs input signal time data S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Due to a relation between phases of the input signal S<b>1</b> and the four phase operational clock signals Clk<b>1</b> to Clk<b>4</b>, in the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a combination pattern of the output signals of the four DFFs <b>201</b> to <b>204</b> will become different at the rising edge time of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>. These first and second combination logics <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> each recognize a N time division phase number at a changing edge of an input signal S<b>1</b> based on the combination pattern. Operational waves are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>f</i>) to (<i>j</i>). Truth-values of the first and second combination logic blocks <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> are illustrated in the first and second charts, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thus, the digital phase locked loop circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> having the multi phase clock source <b>6</b> and the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> can adjust time resolutions N and T<b>2</b> as necessary by controlling a number of differential buffers used in the multi phase clock source <b>6</b> and an operational voltage or the like of the differential buffer. Thus, the digital phase locked loop circuit can increase detection time resolution of a phase of an input signal N times while using an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> having a cycle T<b>1</b> and a relatively low frequency. Since the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> is entirely formed from a digital circuit, it is easy to be mounted on an integrated circuit, and is readily downsized at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, since the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> uses multi phase clock signals (Clk<b>1</b> to Clkn) having different phases by an amount of a scale of time resolution T<b>2</b> in a cycle T<b>1</b>, and outputs input signal time data S<b>2</b> based on phases of the multi phase clock signals and that of the input signal S<b>1</b>, the digital phase locked loop circuit can have high detection time resolution of a phase of an input signal while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency, and is readily mounted on an integrated circuit. Accordingly, a digital phase locked loop circuit readily mounted on an integrated circuit can be provided with an input signal time detection section having high detection time resolution of a phase of an input signal using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A third exemplary embodiment is now described.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of an output clock generation section <b>5</b> used in a digital phase locked loop circuit of a third embodiment according to present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a change of data when the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> operates. According to a digital phase locked loop circuit of this third embodiment, number N is eight (N=8), and thereby time resolution T<b>2</b> has a time calculated by dividing a cycle T<b>1</b> of an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> by eight. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> includes a table <b>501</b> and a DFF <b>502</b>. The table <b>501</b> receives an input of the frequency control data S<b>4</b> and a current state St from the DFF <b>502</b> at input terminals Vcoln and St, respectively. The table outputs the next state StN through an output terminal StN based on these inputs signals.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The DFF <b>502</b> latches the next state StN output from the table <b>501</b> in synchronism with a rising edge of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, and holds it until receiving that of the next operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>. Data maintained by the DFF <b>502</b> represents a current state, and is output by the DFF <b>502</b> as is as output clock time data S<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The chart illustrates true value of the table <b>501</b>. In the third embodiment, a value of the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is supposed to be one of −1, 0, and +1. The third chart illustrates a value of the next state StN determined in accordance with a relation between the current state St and the frequency control data S<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, when a current state St is “2” and frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “0”, the next state StN is “2” as shown on the third line in the third chart.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The fourth chart represents a relation between a current state St, i.e., output clock time data S<b>5</b>, and a phase of a virtual output clock. As shown in the fourth chart, for example, an indication “-------” on a line on which a current state St is eight (St=8) represents that an edge of the virtual clock exists at the “8” position among N time division phase numbers (<b>8</b> to <b>1</b>) obtained by dividing a cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> N times into a unit of time resolution T<b>2</b>. Further, an indication “-----” on a line on which the current state St is nine (St=9) represents that edges of the virtual clock exist both at the positions of the N time division phase numbers “8” and “1”.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, an indication “--------” on a line on which the current state St is zero (St=0) represents that there is no edges of a virtual clock in a clock cycle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a change of data when the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> operates for an amount of thirty three (33) clocks (clock cycle numbers <b>0</b> to <b>32</b>) with a cycle of an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>. As shown in the drawing, since one line can not entirely describe information, description is divided into five lines of from (a) to (e). Among the thirty-three clocks, a value of frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “−1” when clock cycle numbers are from <b>0</b> to <b>12</b>. The state St changes in accordance with the truth value described in the third chart as <b>0</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>0</b>, and <b>8</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">This value as is represents a virtual output clock phase. A phase of the virtual output clock deviates backward by one N time division phase number per one cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> during when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “−1”. Specifically, a cycle of the virtual output clock is calculated as 9×T<b>2</b>. Further, a value of the frequency control data S<b>4</b> amounts to zero and the state St maintains “5” when the clock cycle numbers are from “13 to 20”. Accordingly, an edge phase of the virtual output clock remains at the position of the N time division phase number “5”, and a cycle of the virtual output clock is calculated as 8×T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A value of the frequency control data S<b>4</b> amounts to +1 in the clock cycle numbers “21” to “32”. Further, the value of the state St changes as <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b>, and so on</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the state St is nine (St=9), there are two virtual output clock edges.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thus, when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is +1, a phase of the virtual output clock deviates forwardly by one N time division phase number per cycle of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>. Specifically, a cycle of the virtual output clock is calculated as 7×T<b>2</b>. As mentioned previously, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can change a cycle of the virtual output clock in a unit of T<b>2</b> serving as time resolution, which is N times of the cycle T<b>1</b> of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, in accordance with a value of the frequency control data S<b>4</b>. Specifically, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> included in the digital phase locked loop circuit of the third embodiment can increase time resolution of the virtual output clock phase N times while using an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> having a relatively low frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, fine time resolution of an output clock phase can be realized while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency. Because, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> operates with a clock having a cycle T<b>1</b> and functions as a state machine having a state (S<b>5</b>/St) corresponding to a virtual output clock phase. Further because, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> determines the next state StN based on a relation between a frequency control data S<b>4</b> and a current state St, and outputs a value corresponding to the determined state as output clock time data S<b>5</b>. Accordingly, a digital phase locked loop circuit having an output clock generation section that generates a virtual output clock having fine time resolution phase can be realized while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A fourth exemplary embodiment is now described.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of an output clock generation section <b>5</b> used in a digital phase locked loop circuit of a fourth embodiment according to present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a change of data when the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> operates. In a digital phase locked loop circuit of this fourth embodiment, N is 12 (N=12), and the time resolution T<b>2</b> has a time calculated by dividing a cycle T<b>1</b> of an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> by twelve. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> includes a table <b>511</b> and four DFFs <b>512</b> to <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The table <b>511</b> receives an input of frequency control data S<b>4</b> at an input terminal Vcoln. The table <b>511</b> also receives inputs of current states St<b>0</b>, St<b>1</b>, St<b>2</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>4</b> from the DFFs <b>512</b>, <b>513</b>, <b>514</b>, and <b>515</b> at input terminals St<b>0</b>, St<b>1</b>, St<b>2</b>, and St<b>3</b>, respectively. The table <b>511</b> then outputs the next state StN through the output terminal StN based on the input signals from the four DFFs <b>512</b> to <b>515</b>. The DFF <b>512</b> latches the next state StN output from the table <b>511</b> in synchronism with a rising edge of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, and maintains it until a rising edge of the next operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Data held by the DFF <b>512</b> represents a current state and is output from the DFF <b>512</b> as output clock time data S<b>5</b>. Since the four DFFs <b>512</b> to <b>515</b> are connected in a shift register state, and the data held by the DFF <b>512</b> represents current state, the following DFFs <b>513</b> to <b>515</b> hold past states of three clocks. Specifically, the table <b>511</b> outputs the next state StN based on the frequency control data S<b>4</b>, the current state St<b>0</b>, and the past states St<b>1</b>, St<b>2</b>, and St<b>3</b> of the three clocks. The fifth chart illustrates true-value of the table <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is supposed in the fourth embodiment that a value of the frequency control data S<b>4</b> varies from zero to “36”. Fifth to ninth charts illustrate values of the next states StN determined based on a relation between frequency data S<b>4</b>, the current state St, and the past states St<b>1</b>, St<b>2</b>, and St<b>3</b>. True-value practically has significantly a large value, the fifth to ninth charts illustrate only cases when frequency control data S<b>4</b> are <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>35</b>, and <b>36</b>. Specifically, cases when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> are <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, . . . , and <b>34</b> are omitted. As understood from a regularity from the fifth to ninth charts, every time when frequency control data S<b>4</b> increases by one, a content of the state StN is upwardly shifted by one line. Further, the same regularity appears in the cases when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> are <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, . . . , and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A tenth chart illustrates a relation between a current state St<b>0</b>, i.e., output clock time data S<b>5</b>, and a virtual output clock phase. As shown in the tenth chart, an indication “-------” on a line indicating that a current state St<b>0</b> is twelve (St<b>0</b>=12) represents that there exists an edge of a virtual clock at position of the N time division phase number “12” among those “12 down to 1”, which is obtained by dividing a cycle of an operational clock signal Cklk<b>1</b> by N (twelve) into a unit of time resolution T<b>2</b>, for example. Further, an indication “------------” on a line indicating that the current state St<b>0</b> is zero (St<b>0</b>=0) represents that there exists no edges of a virtual clock in such a clock cycle.</p>

Further, frequency control data S<b>4</b> ranges from <b>1</b> to <b>32</b> in the fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> includes eight multipliers <b>531</b> to <b>538</b> (Nos. <b>534</b> to <b>536</b> are omitted in the drawing). These multipliers <b>531</b> to <b>538</b> multiply numbers <b>1</b> to <b>8</b> and frequency control data S<b>4</b> so as to obtain eight data of Mpy<b>1</b> to Mpy<b>8</b>, respectively. Further, eight adders <b>541</b> to <b>548</b> (Nos. <b>544</b> to <b>546</b> are omitted in the drawing) are provided so that lower eight bit values FbDat among outputs of the DFF <b>551</b> can be added to the respective data of Mpy<b>1</b> to Mpy<b>8</b> to obtain eight data of Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b>. A D-input to an input terminal D of the DDF <b>551</b> is the output value Add<b>8</b> of the adder <b>548</b>. Further, an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> is a clock input to the input terminal CK of the DFF <b>551</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Only MSB (top bit) is drawn among the data from each of the adders Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b>, and is input to respective gate circuits <b>581</b> to <b>588</b>. The gate circuits <b>581</b> to <b>588</b> (Nos. <b>584</b> to <b>586</b> are omitted in the drawing)) include NOT circuits <b>561</b> to <b>568</b> (Nos. <b>564</b> to <b>566</b> are omitted in the drawing) and AND gates <b>571</b> to <b>578</b> (Nos. <b>574</b> to <b>576</b> are omitted in the drawing), respectively. Each of outputs of the AND gates <b>571</b> to <b>578</b> becomes “1” when each of the MSBs is “1” and a MSB upper by one in the drawing is “0”. An output of the AND gate <b>571</b> becomes “1” when the MSB of the Add<b>1</b> is “1” and a MSB as an output of the DFF <b>551</b> is “0”.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">An 8 bit data formed by integrating the outputs of these eight AND gates <b>571</b> to <b>578</b> is output as output clock time data<b>1</b> (S<b>5</b>). In this fifth embodiment, a virtual output clock phase is represented by a bit position where the output clock time data<b>1</b> (S<b>5</b>) becomes “1”. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 20</figref> collectively illustrate a change of data when the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> operates on a condition that frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “15”, “16”, or “17”. In each of the respective drawings, data of each section in the circuit is represented in one line per cycle of an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, wherein a line descending direction represents a time elapsing direction. Further, initial data of the DFF <b>551</b> has “64” in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Now, data change during an operation in the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is partially described. For example, the eight data Mpy<b>1</b>, Mpy<b>2</b>, . . . , and Mpy<b>8</b> on the line of the clock cycle number “1” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> become values “15”, “30”, . . . , and “120”, because, “1”, “2”, . . . , and “8” and the frequency control data “15” are multiplied. Since the value of the Add <b>8</b> is “184” in the previous clock cycle, FbDat is also “184”. The data of Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b> become “199”, “214”, . . . , and “304” through calculation of adding FbDat to the respective eight data of the Mpy<b>1</b> to Mpy<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">MSBs of the Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b> are extracted, respectively. A condition if a MSB is “1” and a MSB upper by one in the drawing is “0” is detected. A condition where the Add<b>4</b> is “244” (MSB=0) and Add<b>5</b> is “259” (MSB=1) meets the above-mentioned condition. Thus, the fifth bit in the output clock time data becomes “1” and represents that an edge phase of the virtual output clock exists at this position. A smaller bit number in the output clock time data<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 22</figref> represents an earlier time in contrast to the N time division phase number as described heretofore.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Specifically, it represents that when the bit number<b>1</b> is “1”, an edge phase of the virtual output clock exists at the position of the N time division phase number “8”.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, when a bit number<b>8</b> is “1”, an edge phase of the virtual output clock exists at the position of the N time division phase number “1”. When frequency control data S<b>4</b> is sixteen (S<b>4</b>=16) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a virtual output clock is always generated once per two cycles of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> at the same position of the N time division phase number. In contrast, when frequency control data S<b>4</b> is fifteen (S<b>4</b>=15) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a virtual output clock is generated almost once per two cycles of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, and the phase gradually deviates afterwards. Specifically, a frequency of a virtual output clock decreases when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “15” (S<b>4</b>=15) than when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “16” (S<b>4</b>=16).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, although a virtual output clock is generated almost once per two cycles of the operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b>, the phase gradually deviates forward when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “17” (S<b>4</b>=17). Specifically, a frequency of a virtual output clock is higher when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “17” (S<b>4</b>=17) than when the frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “16” (S<b>4</b>=16). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> illustrate a change of data when the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> operates on a condition where frequency control data S<b>4</b> is “8” or “32”. As understood when the frequency control data (S<b>4</b>=16) is referred to, edges of virtual output clocks are generated in every four, two, and one cycle when frequency control data S<b>4</b> is 8, 16, or 32, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Specifically, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> can obtain a virtual output clock frequency almost in proportion to a value of the frequency control data S<b>4</b> input thereto. Further, a gain performance of the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is constant, a gain of the digital phase locked loop circuit can be maintained to be constant regardless of an operation frequency. Thus, it provides an advantage that a pull-in time of the digital phase locked loop circuit is stable. As mentioned heretofore, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> can obtain excellent gain linearity. Because, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> can increase time resolution of a phase of a virtual output clock N-times while using an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> having a cycle T<b>1</b> and a relatively lower frequency, as well as be able to expand a range of an operation frequency of an output clock.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In other words, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> can obtain fine time resolution of a phase of an output clock while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency, and a wide range operation frequency of an output clock, as well as a excellent gain linearity. Because, the output clock generation section <b>5</b> includes the N items of the multipliers <b>531</b> to <b>538</b> that multiply values of 1 to N and the frequency control data S<b>4</b>, the DFF <b>551</b> that stores data input per operational clock having a cycle T<b>1</b> as a storage device, and the N items of the adders <b>541</b> to <b>548</b> that add data stored in the DFF<b>551</b> to outputs from the N items of the multipliers <b>531</b> to <b>538</b>, respectively. Further because, the DFF <b>55</b> receives an output of one adder <b>548</b> among N items of the adders <b>541</b> to <b>548</b> as input data thereto, and outputs output clock time data S<b>5</b> in accordance with outputs of the N items of the adders <b>514</b> to <b>548</b>. Accordingly, a digital phase locked loop circuit having an output clock generation section <b>5</b> that realizes fine time resolution of a phase of a output clock using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency, while having a wide range operation frequency of an output clock and a excellent gain linearity can be realized</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A sixth exemplary embodiment is now described.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a phase difference detection section <b>3</b> used in a digital phase locked loop circuit of a sixth embodiment according to present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a wave of an output signal of each of sections when the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A phase difference detection section <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> receives an input of input signal time data S<b>2</b> and output signals Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b> serving as output clock time data<b>2</b> (S<b>5</b>) from the input signal time detection section <b>2</b> and the N items of adders <b>514</b> to <b>548</b> included in the output clock generation section <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Each LSB (8 bit) in the Add<b>1</b> to Add <b>8</b> is input to a DFF <b>301</b>. The DFF <b>301</b> delays input data by an amount of a cycle of an operational clock signal Clk<b>1</b> and outputs data DAdd<b>1</b> to DAdd<b>8</b>, respectively. These eight delay data DAdd<b>1</b> to DAdd<b>8</b> are input to a selector (SEL in the drawing) <b>302</b>, and one of them is selectively output as selection data SAdd in accordance with the input signal time data S<b>2</b>. A subtracter (SUB in the drawing) <b>303</b> subtracts a value of the SAdd from fixed data “128” and is output as a phase difference signal S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, output clock time data<b>2</b> (S<b>5</b>=Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b>) input from the output clock generation section <b>5</b> corresponds to the operating data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In the drawing, three cases are represented on one operational wave, in which a phase of an input signal S<b>1</b> is differently positioned. Specifically, a changing edge of the input signal S<b>1</b> appears at N time division phase numbers “7”, “5”, and “2” of the clock cycle number “2” in these first to third cases. Similar to the data change during an operation as mentioned with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, an edge phase of a virtual output clock exists at positions of N time division phase numbers “5” of the clock cycle number “1”, and N time division phase numbers “5” of the clock cycle number “3” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">When the clock cycle number is “2” in which a change edge appears in an input signal S<b>1</b>, output signals Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b> have “80”, “96”, “112”, “128”, “144”, “160”, “176”, and “192” values, respectively. Data DAdd<b>1</b> to DAdd<b>8</b> are delayed from these signals by one operational clock, and these data can be obtained when the clock cycle number is “3”. Data SAdd is selected from these data in accordance with a value of the input signal time data S<b>2</b>. Specifically, DAdd<b>1</b> to DAdd<b>8</b> are selected when the input signal time data (S<b>2</b>) is “8”, “7”, . . . , and “1”, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Since S<b>2</b> is eight (S<b>2</b>=8) in the first case, data DAdd=80 is selected. Since S<b>2</b> is five (S<b>2</b>=5) in the second case, data DAdd=128 is selected. Since S<b>2</b> is two (S<b>2</b>=2) in the third case, data DAdd=176 is selected. These values are subtracted from the fixed data “128”, and “+48”, “0”, and “−48” are obtained and output as a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> in the first to third cases, respectively. In the second case, a changing edge of the input signal S<b>1</b> appears right in the middle of the former and latter virtual clock edge phases. This situation represents that a phase difference is nothing (0), and a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> is zero. The first case represents that a changing edge phase of the input signal S<b>1</b> is advanced from when the phase difference is nothing (0), and accordingly, a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> has a positive value.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The third case represents that a changing edge phase of the input signal S<b>1</b> is delayed from the condition when the phase difference is nothing (0), and accordingly, a phase difference signal S<b>3</b> has a negative value. As understood from the above-mentioned description, a difference in a changing edge phase of the input signal S<b>1</b> between the first and second cases or the second and third cases is smaller than a cycle T<b>1</b> of the operational clock Clk<b>1</b> when a phase difference of the second case is nothing. Specifically, the phase difference includes only three scales of the time resolution T<b>2</b> divided N times. However, the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> provides 48 different values in a phase difference signal S<b>3</b>. Specifically, the phase difference signal S<b>3</b> obtained by the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> has significantly high phase difference detection resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As mentioned heretofore, the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can detect a phase difference between the input signal and the virtual output clock with high detection time resolution while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency. Thus, the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> can achieve fine detection time resolution of a phase difference between input and output signals while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency. Because, the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> selects an output signal of one of the N items of adders among output clock time data<b>2</b> (S<b>5</b>) including output signals Add<b>1</b> to Add<b>8</b> in accordance with input signal time detection data S<b>2</b>, and detects a phase difference based on the selection output value. Specifically, a digital phase locked loop circuit having the phase difference detection section <b>3</b> capable of detecting a phase difference between the input and output signals with high detection time resolution can be realized while using an operational clock having a relatively low frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The phase locked loop apparatus of the present invention can also be employed in an optical disc apparatus including a CD-drive, and a DVD drive, as well as a magnetic disc apparatus including a MO drive.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Numerous additional modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise that as specifically described herein.</p>
