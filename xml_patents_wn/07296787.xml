<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for servicing a vehicle. More particularly, the present invention relates to vehicle component supports.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For all motor vehicles requiring service, a mechanic may lower or raise a vehicle component from a vehicle housing to or from a servicing level. Due to the weight and size of vehicle components and of the confined space that exists under a vehicle, devices have been introduced in the past to assist mechanics with the task of removing and installing these components. Typical vehicle components requiring the assistance of such devices include fuel tanks, engines, and transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, it is common knowledge that after a certain amount of usage of commercial and recreational vehicles, certain of these automotive components wear down or breakdown and need repair or replacement. Because of the weight, size and shape of such components, and the confined space in which a mechanic must ordinarily work, handling of such components, when being removed or installed is time-consuming, strenuous and dangerous unless a properly designed mechanical device is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional mechanical device such as a saddle adapter or fuel tank adapter, is generally unsatisfactory for this purpose because of its failure to provide adequate support with the resulting danger that the removed component may topple from the device and injure the mechanic. In particular, with fuel tanks, there is the added danger that fuel may spill out of the tank and cause a fire or an explosion. In addition, use of conventional saddle adapter may be objectionable because it requires laborious and time-consuming efforts of the mechanic and usually requires assistance by another mechanic in removing or installing the automotive component being repaired. The additional effort and assistance are necessary because conventional saddle adapters do not provide a means to safely and securely balance the particular vehicle component during servicing or when it is returned to its original position. Further, conventional saddle adapters have four legs for retaining a particular vehicle component. Adjustments may be made at a variety of locations of the leg to accommodate a variety of sizes. However, as each location is adjusted, a dangerous and precarious situation of imbalance can be created if the adjustments are even slightly incorrect. Accordingly, use of these prior-art adapters is costly due to the relatively high cost of labor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This potential danger may be addressed by having another mechanic assist in adjusting a corresponding location at the same time. However, danger still exists with issues of timing, miscommunication and human error which may nevertheless result in toppling of the vehicle component and injury to the mechanic. This also results in greater cost in that the more people that are required to assist, the greater the labor cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method and apparatus that is safe to use in the handling of vehicle components and lowers costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Two support frames placed in parallel and connected to each other by a synchronizing sprocket, are presented whereby when one frame is moved in one direction, the other frame reciprocates and moves in the opposite and equal direction. The amount of the displacement of one frame is equivalent to that of the other frame.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of a support apparatus <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The support apparatus <b>10</b> includes a base weldment <b>12</b> that is used to mount the support apparatus <b>10</b> to other devices, such as a work bench or a jack. The base weldment <b>12</b> also contains two stirrups <b>14</b> located on opposing ends of the base weldment <b>12</b> that are angled away from the base weldment <b>12</b>. The stirrups <b>14</b> contain slots <b>16</b> through which a restraining strap (not shown) may be inserted to further secure a vehicle component being supported. The restraining strap may be inserted into one of the stirrup <b>14</b>, then placed over the vehicle component and inserted into the other stirrup <b>14</b> to secure the vehicle component.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The base weldment <b>12</b> can be secured to other surfaces, such as a transmission jack or a work bench through mounting slots <b>18</b>. Although there are four mounting slots <b>18</b> at each corner of the base weldment <b>12</b> illustrated, as one skilled in the art will appreciate, any number of mounting slots <b>18</b> may be used and in any configuration as needed by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The support apparatus <b>10</b> includes two parallel guide tubes <b>20</b>. The guide tubes <b>20</b> extend in opposing directions and have a first end <b>22</b>. The first end <b>22</b> mounts to the base weldment <b>12</b> through welding or any such permanent means. In addition, guide tubes <b>20</b> are hollow tubes and may include perforations therein. The guide tubes <b>20</b> have a second end <b>24</b> that is not mounted to the base weldment <b>12</b>. A person skilled in the art would recognize that the second end <b>24</b> can be mounted on the base weldment <b>12</b> if desired. The guide tubes <b>20</b> contain an opening <b>26</b>, through which a hitch pin <b>25</b> or other secure means may be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The support apparatus <b>10</b> further includes two perforated tubes <b>28</b> that are received and displaceable within the guide tubes <b>20</b>. The perforated tube <b>28</b> has a first end <b>30</b> and a second end <b>32</b>. The perforated tube <b>28</b> may be longer than the guide tube <b>20</b> and is inserted into guide tube <b>20</b>, such that the perforated tube <b>28</b> rests axially within the guide tube <b>20</b> and extends beyond the guide tube <b>20</b>. The first end <b>30</b> of the perforated tube <b>28</b> may lay on the base weldment <b>12</b> and may have a stop bolt <b>36</b> attached thereto that prevents the perforated tube <b>28</b> from slipping out of the guide tube <b>20</b>. The stop bolt <b>36</b> is mounted preferably at the last perforation on the tube <b>28</b> and can abut against a side wall of the guide tube <b>20</b> when the perforated tube <b>28</b> is fully extended.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The perforated tube <b>28</b> may slide axially within the guide tube <b>20</b> and contain numerous openings or perforations <b>34</b>. These perforations <b>34</b> allow for a variety of lengths of the support apparatus <b>10</b> by extending or shortening the perforated tube <b>28</b>. Also, the hitch pin <b>25</b> secures the perforated tube to the guide tube at any one of the perforations <b>34</b> on the perforated tube <b>28</b>. Thus, once the desired length of the support apparatus <b>10</b> is achieved, the hitch pin <b>25</b> is inserted at the appropriate perforation, and temporarily fixes the perforated tube to the guide tube at the desired length. The perforations <b>34</b> are shown equally spaced but may be of any desired spacing. Although, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a square tube with perforations on all four sides, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that any manner of tube, including circular shaped tube, may be used that allows for a variety of attachments at various lengths as embodied in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The perforated tube <b>28</b> connects orthogonally to cross tubes <b>38</b>. Cross tubes <b>38</b> may or may not be hollow or contain perforations. The cross tube <b>38</b> at each end connects to a pad assembly <b>48</b> via a vertical guide tube <b>68</b>, which is further discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective detail view of the center of the support apparatus <b>10</b> with the base weldment <b>12</b> and a sprocket assembly <b>46</b>. This figure illustrates one embodiment in which the guide tubes <b>20</b> are coupled to each other via the sprocket assembly <b>46</b>. The distance between the guide tubes <b>20</b> may be defined by the sprocket assembly <b>46</b>. A sprocket <b>60</b> includes sprocket teeth <b>62</b>, which are constructed and arranged to fit perforations <b>34</b> of the perforated tube <b>28</b>. The spacing between the teeth <b>62</b> corresponds to the distance between the perforations <b>34</b>. Guide tubes <b>20</b> further include an opening <b>64</b> at the first end <b>22</b> to allow for the sprocket teeth <b>62</b> to engage the perforations <b>34</b> of the perforated tube <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The support apparatus <b>10</b> couples the guide tubes <b>20</b> to each other through the use of a metallic bar <b>50</b> that may be welded at each end to the first end <b>22</b> of the tubes or by other secured means. The bar <b>50</b> includes an opening <b>56</b> at its center to receive a sprocket shaft <b>58</b> (partially shown) that itself is received in the sprocket <b>60</b>. The sprocket shaft <b>58</b> may have at one end threads for threading into the base weldment <b>12</b> so that it does not rotate when the sprocket <b>60</b> is rotated during use. Below the bar <b>50</b> is the sprocket assembly <b>46</b> which is the reciprocating means for the support apparatus <b>10</b>. The perforated tube <b>28</b> has the stop bolt <b>36</b> that prevents the perforated tube from being accidentally removed from the support apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The support apparatus <b>10</b> functions to accommodate a variety of dimensions of vehicle components in the following manner. As the perforated tube <b>28</b> is extended or retracted from a center of the support apparatus <b>10</b> represented by the base weldment <b>12</b>, the sprocket teeth <b>62</b> engages the perforations <b>34</b> of the perforated tubes <b>28</b>, respectively. When perforated tube <b>28</b> is pulled outwardly away (extended) from the base weldment <b>12</b>, the sprocket <b>60</b> turns in a clockwise manner. This clockwise motion acts to displace the other perforated tube in an equal and opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the user wishes to shorten the support apparatus <b>10</b>, the user may push the perforated tube <b>28</b> inwardly toward the base weldment <b>12</b> and the sprocket <b>60</b> then turns in a counter-clockwise manner. This motion serves to also translate the other perforated tube <b>28</b> inwardly and equally towards the base weldment <b>12</b>, and thereby shortening the length of the support apparatus <b>10</b>. Thus, the sprocket <b>60</b> allows for the reciprocating action of the support apparatus <b>10</b>. This reciprocating action allows for more precise adjustments of the various pieces of the support apparatus so that the vehicle component can be better supported than conventional support devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should also be noted that the direction of rotation of the sprocket described here may move in opposite directions. It can be recognized by a person skilled in the art that the clockwise rotation may be in other embodiments counter clockwise and that the counter clockwise rotation be clockwise. Additionally, the user can also move other parts of the support apparatus <b>10</b> to have the reciprocating effect and is not required to move only the perforated tube <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed view of one of the pad assembly <b>48</b> with a pad <b>86</b> attached to a pad bracket <b>84</b>. The pad <b>86</b> is used to cushion and brace the vehicle component. The pad bracket <b>84</b> contains at least two positioning holes <b>88</b> that may be used to attach the pad assembly <b>48</b> to a vertical perforated tube <b>76</b>. A hitch pin <b>92</b> may be used to attach the pad assembly <b>48</b> to the vertical perforated tube <b>76</b> via positioning holes <b>88</b> to one of the perforations <b>82</b> on the vertical perforated tube <b>76</b>. Depending on which of the positioning holes is selected, the pad assembly <b>48</b> may pivot at an angle to the horizontal to better accommodate the vehicle component. The vertical tube <b>76</b> can be received in a vertical guide tube <b>68</b>, which is connected to the cross tube <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">These vertical guide tubes <b>68</b> are similar in nature and structure as the guide tubes <b>20</b> and can include at least one hole <b>74</b> to receive the hitch pin <b>92</b> to adjust the height of the vertical perforated tube <b>76</b>. The vertical perforated tube <b>76</b> is similar in nature and manner as the perforated tube <b>28</b>. This vertical perforated tube <b>76</b> may slide axially within the vertical guide tube <b>68</b>. The vertical perforated tube <b>76</b> permits a variety of heights for the support apparatus <b>10</b> through the raising or lowering of the vertical perforated tube <b>76</b>. The hitch pin <b>92</b> can be used to secure the height of the vertical perforated tube as desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As there are four pad assembly <b>48</b>, it will be appreciated that there are then four vertical guide tubes <b>68</b>, one at each respective corner of the support apparatus <b>10</b> marked at 90° angles from each other. However, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that there may be additional pad assembly <b>48</b>, pad bracket <b>84</b>, cross tubes <b>38</b>, hitch pin <b>92</b>, vertical perforated tube <b>76</b>, vertical guide tube <b>68</b> and their corresponding holes (components), and their respective placement as needed that properly balances the vehicle component.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the ability to mount the support apparatus <b>10</b> onto another surface, such as a transmission jack <b>96</b>. The support apparatus <b>10</b> is shown here with the base weldment <b>12</b>, the guide tubes <b>20</b>, the cross tubes <b>38</b>. In addition, the figure shows the four vertical guide tubes <b>68</b>, the vertical perforated tubes <b>76</b>, and the pad assembly <b>48</b>. The support apparatus <b>10</b> mounts by way of the base weldment <b>12</b> and the mounting slots <b>18</b> to the transmission jack <b>96</b> at a transmission jack cradle <b>110</b>. A typical transmission jack <b>96</b> includes a cradle crank <b>98</b> that adjusts the tilt on the cradle <b>110</b> that maintains the support apparatus <b>10</b>. In addition, the transmission jack <b>96</b> contains a vertical column <b>100</b> that couples with four horizontal legs <b>102</b>. Each leg <b>102</b> contains a swivel caster <b>104</b> with wheels <b>106</b> for moving the transmission jack <b>96</b> to a desired location. Finally, the transmission jack contains a handle <b>108</b> used to operate the transmission jack <b>96</b>. As one skilled in the art will readily appreciate, any type of mounting surface or jack may be used in conjunction with the support apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally, the support apparatus <b>10</b> may accommodate a vehicle component having length dimensions of between 24 and 38 inches. Thus, the perforated tubes <b>28</b> may be extended or shortened cumulatively for lengths in the above listed ranges. The support apparatus <b>10</b> may accommodate vehicle component heights of between 7 and 11 inches. Thus, the vertical perforated tubes <b>76</b> may be extended or shortened in this range. The pad <b>86</b> may be fashioned of any polymeric material, such a cross-link polyethylene foam. The support apparatus <b>10</b> footprint may either be 22 by 38 inches or 16 by 44 inches, depending on which of the positioning holes <b>88</b> is chosen. These dimensions are listed as guides and examples only and as any one skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the components of the support apparatus <b>10</b> may be designed to accommodate a variety of sizes and shapes of vehicle components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">This type of equal, but opposite displacement offered by the support apparatus <b>10</b> allows an automotive mechanic to properly balance a vehicle component of various sizes, especially when the size of the component is misjudged by the mechanic. For example, if the fuel tank is shorter than the mechanic presumed, then the mechanic would have to shorten the length of the support apparatus <b>10</b> and could push in perforated tube <b>28</b> towards the center and expect the other frame to also move in towards the center of the apparatus. This reciprocating action ensures that the fuel tank or the vehicle component is properly supported at times. Once the correct length of the support apparatus is established, the mechanic can look the support apparatus at the length via the hitch pin <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In contrast, if the mechanic finds that the fuel tank is larger than expected, the mechanic may pull perforated tube <b>28</b> and displace the other perforated tube <b>28</b> to lengthen the support apparatus <b>10</b> and better support the vehicle component. Thus, the mechanic no longer needs to adjust various adjustment points independently of the other and can make the adjustments more uniformly than before. This results in considerable time savings and lead to a much safer workplace environment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The guide tubes and perforated tube can be made from hollow tubing with perforations that allow for length adjustments, such as TELESPAR® (from Unistrut, in Michigan) tubing. TELESPAR® tubes are square tubes with perforations or holes on all four sides that permit a variety of mounting possibilities. The abundance of perforations allow for numerous sizing capabilities with easy mounting, such as with simple nuts and bolts. An important feature of the TELESPAR® tubing is its ability to telescope to a variety of lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although, the support apparatus <b>10</b> finds particular application in the automotive industry to support vehicle components, it will be readily appreciated by one skilled in the art that the presently claimed invention may have broader application and in a variety of other industries. Thus, the presently claimed invention or a modification thereof may be used to support nearly any object, particularly an object requiring proper balance.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and variations will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
