<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a circuit board and in particular to a printed circuit board (PCB) for a multi-package module for thermal dissipation and an electronic device using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Demand for small, high performance portable electronic products such as mobile phones, protable computers, and the like have driven the industry to increase integration on semiconductor dice. Accordingly, the industry is achieving high integration by turning to 3D packaging by combining assembly technologies including wire bonding or flip chip to stack die packages to form a multi-package module (MPM).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">MPM, a current assembly technology, integrates different dice functions, such as microprocessors or memory, logic, optic ICs, instead of placing individual packages onto a large printed circuit board (PCB). MPM, however, has a much higher power density than an individual single die package. Thus, thermal management is a key factor in its successful development.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional electronic device <b>100</b> with an MPM. The electronic device <b>100</b> comprises an MPM <b>20</b> mounted on a PCB <b>101</b>, comprising a package substrate <b>12</b>. The upper and lower surfaces of the package substrate <b>12</b> have dice <b>16</b> and <b>14</b> with different functions thereon, respectively, to create the MPM <b>20</b>. For example, the die <b>16</b> is mounted on the upper surface of the package substrate <b>12</b> by bumps (or solder balls) of a package substrate <b>12</b>′. The die <b>14</b> is mounted on the lower surface of the package substrate <b>12</b> by flip chip. The lower surface of the package substrate <b>12</b> comprises a plurality of bumps <b>10</b> thereon to correspondingly connect to the bonding pads (not shown) on the PCB <b>101</b>. In the MPM <b>20</b>, heat generated from the die <b>16</b> can be dissipated by radiation and convection. The gap g between the die <b>14</b> and the PCB <b>101</b> is too narrow, however, to dissipate the generated heat by radiation and convection. Accordingly, the heat generated from the die <b>14</b> is dissipated by conduction only. Typically, a metal layer <b>102</b> is disposed on the PCB <b>101</b> corresponding to the die <b>14</b> and connected to the die <b>14</b> by a heat conductive paste <b>22</b>. That is, thermal dissipation is accomplished by a thermal conductive path created by the heat conductive paste <b>22</b>, the metal layer <b>102</b> and the PCB <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Passive cooling, however, cannot provide a higher rate of adequate thermal dissipation for high power dice which may generate higher heat. That is, generated heat cannot be rapidly dissipated from dice by conducting the heat to the PCB through the heat conductive paste and the metal layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A printed circuited board for thermal dissipation and an electronic device using the same are provided. An embodiment of a printed circuit board (PCB) for thermal dissipation comprises a substrate and a heat sink thereon. The heat sink comprises a first portion under the package substrate of the MPM. The heat sink further comprises a second portion adjacent to the first portion, comprising at least one fin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary embodiment of an electronic device comprises a package substrate, comprising a substrate having a die region and at least one thermal channel region outwardly extending to an edge of the substrate from the die region and an array of bumps arranged on the substrate except in the die and thermal channel regions. A circuit board comprises a plurality of bonding pads correspondingly connecting to the bumps. A heat sink is disposed between the circuit board and the package substrate, comprising a first portion corresponding to the die region and a second portion adjacent to the first portion, extending to the circuit board outside the package substrate along the thermal channel region and comprising at least one fin.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An electronic device for multi-package module (MPM) for thermal dissipation will now be described in greater detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate an embodiment of an electronic device with an MPM, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a bottom planar view of the electronic device and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-section along line <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The electronic device comprises MPM <b>40</b>, a circuit board <b>200</b> and a heat sink <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of an MPM <b>40</b>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a bottom planar view of the MPM <b>40</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a cross-section along line <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The MPM <b>40</b> comprises a package substrate <b>32</b>. The lower surface of the package substrate <b>32</b> has a die region <b>32</b><i>a </i>and at least one thermal channel region <b>32</b><i>b </i>and the upper surface of the package substrate <b>32</b> also has a die region (not shown). Here, the lower surface represents a surface facing the surface of a circuit board, such as a printed circuit board (PCB) and the upper surface represents the surface opposite to the lower surface. In this embodiment, the package substrate <b>32</b> may comprise plastic, ceramic, inorganic or organic material. Typically, the die region <b>32</b><i>a </i>is substantially at the center of the package substrate <b>32</b>. Unlike the conventional package substrate, the package substrate <b>32</b> comprises at least one thermal channel region <b>32</b><i>b </i>outwardly extending to an edge of the package substrate <b>32</b> from the die region <b>32</b><i>a. </i>In some embodiments, the thermal channel region <b>32</b><i>b </i>may extend to an opposite edge of the package substrate <b>32</b> across the die region <b>32</b><i>a, </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the package substrate <b>32</b> may comprise one or more thermal channel regions extending to the edges of the package substrate <b>32</b> along different directions from the die region <b>32</b><i>a. </i>It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Dice <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> with different functions may be respectively mounted in the die region <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the lower surface and that of the upper surface of the package substrate <b>32</b> by the same or different electronic packages. For example, dice <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may respectively be mounted on the package substrate <b>32</b> by flip chip or wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An array of bumps <b>30</b>, such as metal bump, solder balls, signal balls or similar, is arranged on the lower surface of the package substrate <b>32</b> except in the die region <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the thermal channel region <b>32</b><i>b, </i>to transmit signals to external circuits from the dice <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. The interval between the bumps <b>30</b> is narrower than the width of the thermal channel region <b>32</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A circuit board <b>200</b>, such as a PCB, comprises a substrate <b>201</b> and a plurality of bonding pads <b>202</b> thereon, correspondingly connected to the bumps <b>30</b>, thereby electronically connecting the circuit board <b>200</b> and the dice <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. Typically, the circuit board <b>200</b> comprises at least one or more metal layers and at least one or more insulating layers, in which the metal layer may serve as a signal layer, a power layer, and/or a grounding layer. In order to simplify the diagram, a flat substrate <b>201</b> is depicted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A heat sink <b>203</b> is disposed on the circuit board <b>200</b> and between the circuit board <b>200</b> and the package substrate <b>32</b>, comprising first and second portions <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>.

Additionally, in some embodiments, the fins <b>206</b><i>a </i>may be triangular (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>), rectangular (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) or polygon (not shown). It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the triangular or rectangular fins <b>206</b><i>a </i>may be alternately arranged on both sides of the second portion <b>206</b> and it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref>. In this embodiment, the heat sink <b>203</b> comprises gold, silver or copper. Moreover, the first portion <b>204</b> of the heat sink <b>203</b> may partially or fully overlap the die <b>34</b> or the die region <b>32</b><i>a. </i>Here, only an example of the full overlap is depicted.

At the same time, the heat can be effectively and rapidly dissipated to the ambient environment by radiation, convection and conduction through the dissipating component <b>205</b>, as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Additionally, if the die <b>34</b> is a high power die, the heat can be dissipated quickly by the fan <b>207</b> for active cooling.
