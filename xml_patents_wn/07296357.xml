<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the device may also include an adjustable positioning mechanism to adjust a distance between the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms according to an inter-pupil distance of the user. In one example, the reference axis may be related to a line of sight of the user through the pair of lenses. In another example, the reference axis may be related to an axis connecting first and second engagement points of the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms with the pair of lenses, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, each of the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms may include a rotatable angle measuring element, which may be slidably mounted on the adjustable positioning mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the angle measuring element may have a base adapted to engage a surface portion of the lens, e.g., a front surface portion of the lens.</p>

For example, at least one of the two sets of marks may include one or more marks on a respective one of the angle-measuring elements and one or more marks on the adjustable positioning mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the plurality of angle values may include angle values between −5 degrees and 30 degrees, e.g., angle values between 0 degrees and 15 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the positioning mechanism may include a pair of interconnected slides attached to the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms, respectively. The pair of slides may be movable with respect to one another along a longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the positioning mechanism may include a first pin attached to a first slide of the pair of slides and fitted to move along a groove in a second one of the slides.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME DEMONSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following description, various aspects of the present invention will be described. For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details presented herein. Furthermore, some features of the invention relying on principles and implementations known in the art may be omitted or simplified to avoid obscuring the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some demonstrative embodiments of the invention include devices and/or methods of measuring a personalized lens-orientation value for a spectacle frame supporting a pair of lenses, e.g., based on a measured inter-pupil distance of the user, as described in detail below. The personalized lens-orientation value may be implemented to customize one or more optical attributes of the lenses, e.g., as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although the invention is not limited in this respect, it will be appreciated that the phrase “personalized lens-orientation value” as used herein may relate to an orientation, position, direction, location, posture and/or angle of a pair of lens customized for a user and supported by a spectacle frame. The personalized lens-orientation value may depend, for example, on one or more attributes of the spectacle frame, e.g., the curvature, shape, form, size, and/or configuration of the spectacle frame; and/or one or more optical attributes of the user, e.g., the measured inter-pupil distance of the user, as discussed in detail below. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, the personalized lens-orientation value may correspond, for example, to an angle between a reference axis, e.g., an axis related to the line of sight of the user, and a normal to a surface, e.g., a front surface, of the spectacle lens, for example, at a location corresponding to a vertex of the lens. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, the line of sight of the user may be defined, for example, as a direction normal to an axis connecting the pupils of the user. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, the location of the vertex of the lens may be determined, for example, based on an intersection between a surface of the lens and the line of sight of the user, e.g., as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Different spectacle frames may have different frame curvatures. For example, some spectacles, e.g., reading spectacles, may typically have a “straight” frame, i.e., having a substantially infinite curvature. Other spectacles, e.g., sport sunglasses, may have a “wrap around” shaped frame, which may have a smaller curvature compared to the curvature of the typical reading spectacles. The curvature of the spectacle frame may affect the positioning and/or orientation of the lens relative to the eyes of the user. For example, the lens may be positioned at a first orientation relative to the eyes of the user, when placed in a first spectacle frame having a first curvature, e.g., a “wrap around” curvature; and a second orientation relative to the eyes of the user, when placed in a second spectacle frame having a second curvature, e.g., a substantially infinite curvature. Accordingly, first and second spectacles including frames having first and second curvatures, respectively, may have first and second different personalized lens-orientation values, e.g., even if intended for the same user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inter-pupil distance may affect the location of the vertex of each one of the spectacle lens. Accordingly, users having different inter-pupil distances may have different personalized lens-orientation values with relation to a single spectacle configuration, e.g., since the personalized lens-orientation value may depend on the inter-pupil distance of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, it may be desired to determine the personalized lens-orientation value corresponding to the inter-pupil distance of the user and/or the configuration of the spectacle frame, e.g., in order to manufacture a customized lens having optical attributes fitting the configuration of the spectacle frame and/or the inter-pupil distance of the intended user. For example, a customized surface geometry of the lenses may be determined based on the personalized lens orientation value, e.g., using any suitable calculation, computation and/or algorithm. The customized lens may be produced based on the customized surface geometry, for example, using any suitable manufacturing method or process, e.g., a freeform manufacturing process as is known in the art. The free-form manufacturing process may include, for example, using a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) milling apparatus, which may be capable of producing the lens according to input data representing the customized surface geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some demonstrative embodiments of the invention may include a device to measure a personalized lens-orientation value for a spectacle frame supporting a pair of lenses customized for a user, e.g., based on the inter-pupil distance of the user as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the device may include a pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms, each to measure a value corresponding to an orientation of a respective one of the lenses relative to a reference axis. The device may also include an adjustable positioning mechanism to adjust a distance between the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms, e.g., according to an inter-pupil distance of the user. One or more of the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms may include, for example, a rotatable angle measuring element which may indicate, when engaged with a surface, e.g., a front surface of one of the pair of lenses, an orientation value corresponding to an orientation of the surface being engaged in relation to the reference axis, e.g., as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The personalized lens-orientation value may be determined, for example, by positioning the device relative to the spectacles such that both orientation-measuring mechanisms measure substantially the same orientation value, e.g., as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A and/or <b>3</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which schematically illustrates a device <b>110</b> to measure a personalized lens-orientation value for spectacles <b>140</b>, in accordance with some demonstrative embodiments of the invention. Spectacles <b>140</b> may include a pair of lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> supported by a spectacle frame <b>143</b>. In some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, lenses <b>141</b> and/or <b>142</b> may include any suitable type of ophthalmic lenses and/or demonstrative (“demo”) lenses, e.g., as are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, device <b>110</b> may include a pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms, e.g., including rotatable angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>.

For example, device <b>110</b> may include a pin <b>122</b> attached to slide <b>111</b><i>a </i>and fitted to move along a longitudinal groove <b>113</b> in slide <b>111</b><i>b</i>; and/or a pin <b>123</b> attached to slide <b>111</b><i>b </i>and fitted to move along a longitudinal groove <b>112</b> in slide <b>111</b><i>a </i>Accordingly, slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>may be confined to move in a longitudinal direction along a longitudinal axis, e.g., an axis defined by grooves <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>, as indicated by an arrow “A” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b> may be slidably mounted on slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>111</b><i>b</i>, respectively. For example, device <b>110</b> may include pivot pins <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> to connect a base portion <b>130</b> of angle-measuring element <b>114</b>, and a base portion <b>131</b> of angle measuring element <b>115</b>, respectively, to slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b</i>, respectively. This configuration may enable the rotation of elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> relative to slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>111</b><i>b </i>may include one or more marks <b>199</b> representing the a plurality of predefined distances between elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> corresponding to a relative positioning between slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b</i>. The distance between elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> may be defined, for example, as the horizontal distance, e.g., the distance measured in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis, between pins <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>. For example, marks <b>199</b> may include a set of values representing a set of horizontal distances between pins <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> along the longitudinal axis. According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention marks <b>199</b> may represent a set of typical inter-pupil distance values, for example, a set of values between 50 millimeters (mm) and 80 mm, e.g., between −55=mm and 77 mm. Accordingly, the distance between elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> may be adjusted, e.g., according to a measured inter-pupil distance of the user, by moving slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>along the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, device <b>110</b> may also include a first set of orientation marks, e.g., including marks <b>126</b><i>a </i>on slide <b>111</b><i>a</i>, and/or a mark <b>125</b><i>a </i>on angle-measuring element <b>114</b>, representing a first angle, denoted θ1, which may be measured by angle-measuring element <b>114</b>; and a second set of orientation marks, e.g., including marks <b>126</b><i>b </i>on slide <b>111</b><i>b</i>, and/or a mark <b>125</b><i>b </i>on angle-measuring element <b>115</b>, representing a second angle, denoted θ2, which may be measured by angle-measuring element <b>115</b>, as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the invention is not limited in this respect, in some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, angles θ1 and θ2 may be measured according to an angular measuring scale in terms of, for example, polar units. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, the first and/or second sets of orientation marks, e.g., marks <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>125</b><i>b</i>, and/or <b>126</b><i>b</i>, may represent a set of predefined orientation angles, for example, a set of angles between −5 degrees and 30 degrees, e.g., between 0 degrees and 15 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, angle θ1 may be defined as the angle between a vertical axis, denoted Z<b>1</b>, e.g., vertical to the longitudinal direction A and passing through pin <b>120</b>; and a direction, denoted N<b>1</b>, normal to a surface of lens <b>141</b> at a point of intersection with the vertical axis Z<b>1</b>. Angle θ2 may be defined by the angle between a vertical axis, denoted Z<b>2</b>, e.g., vertical to the longitudinal direction A and passing through pin <b>121</b>; and a direction, denoted N<b>2</b>, normal to a surface of lens <b>142</b> at a point of intersection with the vertical axis Z<b>2</b>. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that angles θ1 and/or θ2 may be defined in any other manner.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It may be noted that since slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>may be constrained to move in longitudinal direction relative to each other, the axes Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> may be substantially parallel to each other. For example, both axes Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> may be normal to grooves <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. Therefore, the axes Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> may be interchangeably used as a reference axis for determining the angles θ1 and/or θ2. Although some demonstrative embodiments of the invention are described with reference to a reference axis corresponding to lines, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the reference axis may be defined in relation to any other suitable axis, line, and the like. In one example, the reference axis may relate to an axis connecting first and second engagement points of the pair of orientation-measuring mechanisms with the pair of lenses, respectively, e.g., as are described below. In another example, the reference axis may be defined in relation to the line of sight of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although the invention is not limited in this respect, marks <b>126</b><i>a </i>may include, for example, a first mark <b>151</b><i>a </i>to indicate a first value of angle θ1, e.g., a zero angle; a second-mark <b>153</b><i>a </i>to indicate a second value of angle θ1, e.g., an angle of pi/18 radians or 10 degrees; and/or a third mark <b>152</b><i>a </i>to indicate a third value of angle θ1, e.g., an angle of 2*pi/18 radians or 20 degrees. Accordingly, the angle θ1 of angle-measuring element <b>114</b> relative to axis Z<b>1</b> may be determined as being zero, e.g., if mark <b>125</b><i>a </i>of angle-measuring element <b>114</b> is aligned with mark <b>151</b><i>a</i>. The angle θ1 may be increased or decreased by rotating angle-measuring element <b>114</b> counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively. For example, angle θ1 may be increased to 2*pi/18 radians or 20 degrees by rotating angle-measuring element <b>114</b> until mark <b>125</b><i>a </i>is aligned with mark <b>152</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Similarly, marks <b>126</b><i>b </i>may include, for example, a first mark <b>151</b><i>b </i>to indicate a first value of angle θ2, e.g., a zero angle; a second mark <b>153</b><i>b </i>to indicate a second value of angle θ2, e.g., an angle of pi/18 radians or 10 degrees; and/or a third mark <b>152</b><i>b </i>to indicate a third value of angle θ2, e.g., an angle of 2*pi/18 radians or 20 degrees. Accordingly, the angle θ2 of angle-measuring element <b>115</b> relative to axis Z<b>2</b> may be determined as being zero, e.g., if mark <b>125</b><i>b </i>of angle-measuring element <b>115</b> is aligned with mark <b>151</b><i>b</i>. The angle θ2 may be increased or decreased by rotating angle-measuring element <b>1</b>.<b>15</b> counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively. For example, angle θ2 may be increased to pi/18 radians or 10 degrees by rotating angle-measuring element <b>115</b> until mark <b>125</b><i>b </i>is aligned with mark <b>153</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although some demonstrative embodiments of the invention may relate to a device, e.g., device <b>110</b>, including a set of marks, e.g., marks <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, <b>126</b><i>a</i>, and/or <b>126</b><i>b</i>, to indicate measured angle values, e.g., corresponding to angles θ1 and/or θ2, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments of the invention may include any other suitable angle measuring configuration, mechanism and/or arrangement. For example, in an alternative embodiment (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b> may have marks corresponding to an angular measuring scale and slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>111</b><i>b </i>may each have a mark to indicate the extent of angular position of angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> relative to slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>111</b><i>b </i>may include limiting pins <b>118</b> and/or <b>119</b>, respectively, to limit the rotational movement of angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b>, respectively. For example, pins <b>118</b> and/or <b>119</b> may be fitted to move within respective grooves <b>116</b> and/or <b>117</b> of angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b>. Accordingly, the rotation of angle-measuring element <b>114</b> may be limited, for example, by the movement of pin <b>118</b> between first and second ends of groove <b>116</b>, denoted “a” and “b”, respectively. Similarly, the rotation of angle-measuring element <b>115</b> may be limited by the movement of pin <b>119</b> between first and second ends of groove <b>117</b>, denoted “c” and</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may have a shape adapted to steadily engage lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively. For example, base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may have a concave shape. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, the curvature of base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may be configured such that base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may engage a surface, e.g., a front surface, of lenses <b>141</b> and/or <b>142</b>, respectively, at two or more points. For example, base portion <b>130</b> may include engagement points <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> to engage lens <b>141</b>; and/or base portion <b>131</b> may include engagement points <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> to engage lens <b>141</b>. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, a radius of curvature of base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may be smaller, for example, than a predefined maximal lens radius of curvature. For example, the radius of curvature of base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may be smaller than 1000 mm, e.g., smaller than 500 mm. Other shapes for base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> may be used enabling steady engagement of base portions <b>130</b> and/or <b>131</b> with lenses <b>141</b> and/or <b>142</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b> may be made of a material, for example, PVC, such that they may be positioned on lenses <b>141</b> and/or <b>142</b> without causing damage, such as scratches and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skills in the art that the measured angles θ1 and θ2 may depend on the curvatures of the surfaces being engaged by base portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b>. In one example, both angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> may measure angles of zero radians, e.g., if base portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> are positioned on a straight surface, for example, a surface having zero curvature, e.g., a flat table. In another example, angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> may measure two different angles, e.g., if base portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> are positioned on two respective curved surfaces having a different curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the angles θ1 and/or θ2 measured by elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, respectively, may depend on the locations in which base portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> engage the front surfaces of lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively. For example, spectacle lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, when supported by frame <b>143</b> may define a flame front surface, denoted S, having a varying surface curvature. Lenses <b>141</b> and/or <b>143</b> may have, for example, a surface portion, denoted F, having a curvature being substantially infinite, e.g., at an end near a center of frame <b>143</b>. Lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> may also have surface portions, denoted C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, respectively, having a smaller curvature compared to the curvature of surface portion F. Accordingly, the angles θ1 and θ2, measured when angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> are positioned on surface portions C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, respectively, may be larger than the angles measured when angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> are positioned on surface portion F.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, the personalized lens-orientation value for spectacles <b>140</b> may be determined based on the value measured by angle-measuring element <b>114</b>, e.g., at the vertex of lens <b>141</b>; and/or based on the value measured by angle-measuring element <b>115</b>, e.g., at a vertex of lens <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the invention is not limited in this respect, according to some demonstrative embodiments of the invention, it may be assumed that the curvature of the surface S is substantially symmetrical, e.g., with reference to an axis, denoted Z<b>0</b>. Accordingly, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, that the axes Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> may be substantially aligned with the vertex of lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, for example, when the distance between angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> is adjusted according to the pupil distance of the user, and base portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> are engaged with lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively, in a manner such that angles θ1 and θ2 are substantially equal. Accordingly, the personalized lens-orientation value for spectacles <b>140</b> may be determined by adjusting the distance between the angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> according to the inter-pupil distance of the user; and engaging angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> with the surfaces of lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively, such that angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> measure substantially the same angle, e.g., as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although some demonstrative embodiments of the invention may relate to a device, e.g., device <b>110</b>, including a set of marks, e.g., marks <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, <b>126</b><i>a</i>, and/or <b>126</b><i>b</i>, to indicate measured angle values corresponding to angles θ1 and/or θ2, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments of the invention may include any other suitable angle measuring configuration, mechanism and/or arrangement to measure any other angle, e.g., related to angles θ1 and/or θ2. For example, marks <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>125</b><i>a </i>may indicate an angle, denoted θ1′, defined between the axis Z<b>1</b> and a predefined axis, denoted N<b>1</b>′, passing through pin <b>120</b>; and/or marks <b>126</b><i>b </i>and <b>125</b><i>b </i>may indicate an angle, denoted θ2′, defined between the axis Z<b>2</b> and a predefined axis, denoted N<b>2</b>′, passing through pin <b>121</b>. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the values of angles θ1 and/or θ2 may be determined based on angles θ1′ and/or θ2′, respectively. For example, direction N<b>1</b>′ may intersect the outer surface of lens <b>141</b> at a distance D′ from a point of intersection between the direction N<b>2</b>′ and the outer surface of lens <b>142</b>. In one example, marks <b>199</b> may be adapted to indicate the distance D. Accordingly, marks <b>125</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>126</b><i>a </i>may be adapted to indicate a value representing angle θ1, and/or marks <b>125</b><i>b </i>and/or <b>126</b><i>b </i>may be adapted to indicate a value representing angle θ2, e.g., when marks <b>199</b> indicate the distance D. In another example, marks <b>199</b> may be adapted to indicate an adjusted distance scale corresponding to the distance D′. Accordingly, marks <b>125</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>126</b><i>a </i>may be adapted to indicate a value representing angle θ1′, and/or marks <b>125</b><i>b </i>and/or <b>126</b><i>b </i>may be adapted to indicate a value representing angle θ2′, e.g., when marks <b>199</b> indicate the distance D′. In this example, the distance between pins <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> may be adjusted, e.g., by an optometrist, according to the inter-pupil distance of the user, e.g., 60 mm, while the angles measured by elements <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b> may correspond to the distance D′, e.g., 58 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which schematically illustrates a flow-chart of a method of determining a personalized lens-orientation value for spectacles including a frame supporting a pair of lenses customized for a user, in accordance with some demonstrative embodiments of the invention. Although the invention is not limited in this respect, one or more operations of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be performed, e.g., by an optometrist, using a lens-orientation measuring device, e.g., device <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), including a pair of orientation measuring mechanisms, e.g., including angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); and an adjustable positioning mechanism, e.g., including slides <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As indicated at block <b>210</b>, the method may include, for example, measuring an inter-pupil distance of the user. The inter-pupil distance may be measured, for example, using any suitable pupil-distance measuring device, e.g., as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As indicated at block <b>220</b>, the method may also include, for example, adjusting the distance between the angle-measuring mechanisms according to the measured inter-pupil distance. For example, the optometrist may adjust the distance D between angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) using marks <b>199</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As indicated at block <b>230</b>, the method may also include, for example, engaging the pair of orientation mechanisms with the pair of lenses, respectively. For example, the optometrist may position angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) such that base portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) engage lens <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively, e.g., as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Reference is now made again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b>B, which schematically illustrate angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, respectively, engaging spectacle lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, base portion <b>130</b> may be positioned in an initial position such that, for example, engagement point <b>133</b> may be engaged with lens <b>141</b> while engagement point <b>132</b> may not be engaged with lens <b>141</b>. Angle measuring element <b>114</b> may be rotated, for example, in a counterclockwise direction, as indicated by the arrow W, e.g., until both points <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> are engaged with lens <b>141</b>. Similarly, base portion <b>131</b> may be positioned in an initial position such that, for example, engagement point <b>134</b> may be engaged with lens <b>142</b> while engagement point <b>135</b> may not be engaged with lens <b>142</b>. Angle measuring element <b>11</b>.<b>5</b> may be rotated, for example, in clockwise direction as indicated by the arrow Q, e.g., until both points <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> are engaged with lens <b>142</b>. Positioning both engagement points <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> of base portion <b>130</b> on lens <b>141</b> and positioning both engagement points <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> of base portion <b>131</b> on lens <b>142</b>, may result in angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> being steadily engaged with lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as indicated at block <b>240</b> the method may also include, for example, shifting the lens-orientation measuring device along the pair of lenses, e.g., until the both orientation-measuring mechanisms indicate substantially the same orientation value. For example, the optometrist may shift device <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) along lenses <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, e.g., in a longitudinal direction, until angle-measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) measure substantially the same angle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As indicated at block <b>250</b>, the method may also include, for example, determining the lens-orientation value for the spectacles based on the orientation value measured by the personalized orientation measuring mechanisms. For example, the optometrist may determine the personalized lens-orientation value of the spectacles based on the angle measured by angle measuring elements <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), e.g., using mark sets <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which schematically illustrates a conventional inter-pupil distance ruler <b>410</b> to measure an inter-distance pupil of a person <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Ruler <b>410</b> may include a ruler edge <b>411</b> having marks <b>414</b> and <b>415</b> which may correspond to a scale for the measurement of length. Ruler edge <b>411</b> may be configured to enable positioning ruler <b>410</b> in relation to a pair of pupils <b>422</b> and <b>423</b> of person <b>420</b>. For example, edge <b>411</b> may have a portion <b>413</b> curved inward to ruler <b>410</b>. Portion <b>413</b> may enable engaging steadily ruler <b>410</b> on, for example, a bridge <b>421</b> of a nose of person <b>420</b>. Accordingly, ruler <b>410</b> may be fixed with regard to horizontal movement relative to person <b>420</b>, and may enable determining the inter-pupil distance of person <b>420</b>. For example, ruler <b>410</b> may be positioned such that a user of ruler <b>410</b>, e.g., an optometrist, may determine the pupil distance of person <b>420</b> by reading values corresponding to a measurement of length indicated by marks <b>414</b> and <b>415</b>. For example, the user may use marks <b>414</b> to determine the distance, e.g., 30 mm, from bridge <b>421</b> to pupil <b>422</b>. Similarly, the user may use marks <b>415</b> to determine the distance, e.g., 27 mm, from bridge <b>421</b> to pupil <b>423</b>, which may be, for example, 27 mm. As a result, the inter-pupil distance of person <b>420</b> may be determined as 30 mm+27 mm=57mm.</p>
