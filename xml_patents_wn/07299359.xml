<heading id="h-0001" level="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to apparatuses and methods for indicating the quality and variety of a password used for computer system authentication.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Several techniques for protecting the data in computer systems have been utilized. The most common technique is to prevent unauthorized user access by providing authentication and access control through the use of a password. A password typically consists of a sequence of letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Passwords are often used to verify the identity of a user before granting access to computer systems, web pages, e-mail, files, or software programs.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, users frequently choose words that are familiar to them as their password. Thus, these easily detected passwords can compromise the security of a computer system. High speed communications, increased network capabilities and high performance processors can enable a “cracker” program, a computer program used for breaking security on a computer system, to quickly determine a user's password. As a result, software programs that incorporate proactive password checkers, such as Microsoft's Passport, Mozilla's Personal Security Manager, John the Ripper and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), have been developed to predetermine whether a user's proposed password will be vulnerable to cracking. Some of the methods used by proactive password checkers to determine a password's susceptibility to cracking include verifying if the password exists in a dictionary, checking the length of the password, and comparing the password to a permutation of the letters in the user's name.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is well known, PGP uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt e-mails and files in order to prevent unauthorized access. Public-key cryptography uses two keys, a private key and a public key, for encrypting and decrypting data. When creating a private key, a password specified by the user is assigned to protect the key. An example of a “New Key” screen is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The user can enter a password for the private key in the field <b>101</b>. As each character is entered, the “Passphrase Quality” meter <b>102</b> proactively indicates to the user the level of quality of the password. However, PGP does not indicate to the user why the quality of their proposed password is high or low. In addition, PGP does not indicate to the user how to improve the quality of their proposed password without increasing the length of the password.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples such as these show that a need exists for an apparatus and a method to indicate to the user how to improve the quality a password.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment of the invention is a method of presenting password information to a user, the method includes: receiving a password; determining the number of unique character sets utilized in the password; and displaying the number of unique character sets that are contained within the password. In some embodiments of the invention, the number of unique character sets is displayed as the user enters his password. In other embodiments of the invention, the number of unique character sets is displayed after the user has completely entered his password.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment of the invention is a method of presenting password information to a user, the method includes: receiving a password; identifying each unique character set utilized in the password; determining the total number of characters included in the identified character sets; and displaying the total number of characters to a user. In some embodiments of the invention, the total number of characters is displayed as the user enters his password. In other embodiments of the invention, the total number of characters is displayed after the user has completely entered his password.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment of the invention is a program storage device containing instructions that when executed by a computer perform the following acts: receiving a password; determining the number of unique character sets utilized in the password; and displaying the number of unique character sets that are contained within the password.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another embodiment of the invention is a program storage device containing instructions that when executed by a computer perform the following acts: receiving a password; identifying each unique character set utilized in the password; determining the total number of characters included in the identified character sets; and displaying the total number of characters to a user.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One embodiment of the invention is a computer program that allows a user to enter a password and then presents information to the user as each character is specified for the password. As discussed in detail below, the computer program can indicate to the user how to improve the quality of the entered password.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">5.1 Displaying the Change Password Screen</heading>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">5.2 Displaying Password Assistant Information</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display information to the user regarding the length of the new password. As the user enters the new password in field <b>203</b>, the computer program could update the current length text field <b>205</b> to indicate the length of the new password. In addition, the computer program could display the minimum length required for a password in the minimum length text field <b>206</b>. In addition, the computer program could display the maximum length allowed for a password in the maximum length text field <b>207</b>. The minimum and maximum lengths could be specified by the computer program, by external parameters available to the computer program or by other methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display information to the user regarding how to improve the quality of the password. The computer program could display a Quality meter <b>208</b>. As each character for the new password is entered in field <b>203</b>, the Quality meter <b>208</b> could indicate to the user the quality of the password. As the quality of the password increases, the progress bar on the Quality meter <b>208</b> could correspondingly increase in length. In addition, the computer program could display the quality of the password in the Quality text field <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Several methods can be utilized to calculate the quality of the password. In some embodiments of the invention, the quality of the password is determined by the length of the password and the size of the character set used to form the password. The quality of the password could be calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Quality of password=5*log<sub>10 </sub>(number of passwords (length of password))<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">where the number of passwords for length N and character set size sz is calculated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>number of passwords (<i>N</i>)=(<i>sz</i><sup>N</sup><i>+sz</i><sup>(N−1)</sup><i>+ . . . +sz</i>).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Using this formula, the quality calculated for a four character password composed of characters from the full printable 8 bit character set (223 characters) is roughly equivalent to the quality calculated for a seven character password composed of only lower case letters. Thus, a significant improvement in password quality can be obtained by increasing the size of the character set from which the password characters are chosen.
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display information to the user regarding how to improve the variety of the password. The computer program could indicate to the user the number of unique character sets that is contained within the password. A password can consist of a sequence of letters, numbers, and special characters. Character sets for a password can consist of lower case letters [a . . . z], upper case letters [A . . . Z], digits [0 . . . 9], punctuation marks [! . . . ˜] or other 8 bit printable characters. In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display a Variety circle <b>210</b> that contains a wedge for each unique character set utilized within the password. Each wedge in the Variety circle <b>210</b> could be displayed with a distinct fill pattern using color, grids, graphical images, or a combination of these fill patterns. In some embodiments of the invention, the size of the wedge could indicate the total number of unique characters in the character set. In such embodiments, the computer program could calculate the total number of characters available when specifying a password. Then, the computer program could display a Variety circle <b>210</b> containing a wedge for each unique character set sized in proportion to the total number of characters available.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display a Variety text field <b>211</b> that indicates the total number of characters included in the character sets contained within the password. For example, a password containing at least one lower case letter [a . . . z] out of 26 possible values, at least one upper case letter [A . . . Z] out of 26 possible values, at least one punctuation mark [! . . . ˜] out of 33 possible values, at least one digit [0 . . . 9] out of 10 possible values and at least one non-Latin upper case letter out of 34 possible values could display a value of “129” (26+26+33+10+34) in the Variety text field <b>211</b>. Other character sets could include non-Latin lower case letters and symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display information to the user regarding why a password does not meet specific quality criteria. The quality criteria could be specified by the computer program, by external parameters available to the computer program or by other methods known in the art. For example, the computer program could display the information in a Message text field <b>212</b>. Thus, if the password entered in field <b>203</b> is shorter in length than the minimum length criteria, then a message could be displayed to the user indicating such. Similarly, if the quality of the password entered in field <b>203</b> is lower than the minimum quality criteria, then another message could be displayed to the user indicating such. In addition, if the variety of the password entered in field <b>203</b> is lower than the minimum variety criteria, then another message could be displayed to the user indicating such. In other embodiments of the invention, the computer program could utilize other password strength checkers, such as cracklib, to determine the quality of the password and then display the resulting messages from the password strength checker in a Message text field <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program could validate whether the password exists or is similar to a word located in a dictionary. If the password entered in field <b>203</b> is a dictionary word or similar to a dictionary word, then a message could be displayed in the Message text field <b>212</b> indicating such. In other embodiments of the invention, the computer program could validate whether the password is a permutation of the letters in the user's name. If the password entered in field <b>203</b> is a permutation of the letters in the user's name, then a message could be displayed in the Message text field <b>212</b> indicating such.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In still other embodiments of the invention, the computer program could include a Character Set icon <b>213</b>. If the user selects the Character Set icon <b>213</b>, then the computer program could display character sets that can be used to improve the quality of a password. For example, character sets that are utilized in a password could be displayed in one color while unused character sets could be displayed in another color. Alternatively, only unused character sets could be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In still other embodiments of the invention, the computer program could display a “Change Password” screen <b>300</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The Change Password screen <b>300</b> is similar to the Change Password screen <b>200</b> except that the Change Password screen <b>300</b> includes information for the user regarding the minimum allowed quality for a password. The computer program could display a Quality meter <b>308</b> and a Minimum Allowed Quality Mark <b>316</b>. As each character for the new password is entered in field <b>303</b>, the Quality meter <b>308</b> could indicate to the user the quality of the password. As the quality of the password increases, the progress bar on the Quality meter <b>308</b> could correspondingly increase in length and indicate whether it is below, equal or above the Minimum Allowed Quality Mark <b>316</b> for a password. The minimum allowed quality could be specified by the computer program, by external parameters available to the computer program or by other methods known in the art.</p>
