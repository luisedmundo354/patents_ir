<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a convertible vehicle with a rigid, retractable roof, in several sections.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such vehicles are already known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, in particular a convertible vehicle is known with a longitudinal axis, a front and a rear, and comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">a structure;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005">a passenger compartment fitted with seats;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0006">a retractable rigid roof, movable between a closed state above the passenger compartment and an open state in which the roof is stowed behind the seats, the roof comprising a first roof element and a second roof element located behind the first roof element, in the closed roof state.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0007">If the rear area, typically designed on numerous vehicles to stow the roof in its folded state, is unavailable to hold this roof (for example, because it is used to house the engine), another area needs to be found to stow the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0008">In terms of space, this problem is complicated due to the limited space available to stow the roof, problem linked to a lack of space, in particular along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">Under these conditions, it is envisaged in the invention fitting the vehicle so that it comprises, in addition to the aforementioned elements:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0010">a roof stowage space in its open state, the space being located between the seats and the rear area of the vehicle;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0011">first displacement means to bring the first and second roof elements side by side, during the opening of the roof;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0012">and second tipping means to displace, via pivoting, the first and second roof elements between said closed roof state in which these elements are placed substantially horizontally and the open roof state in which said elements are stowed substantially vertically in the stowage space.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">In particular when the roof stowage space is restricted in size and furthermore it is desired that the roof displacement control means interfere as little as possible with the passenger compartment (notably in this case the second tipping means), the kinematics of the roof and the site of these control means must be cleverly defined. Thus, the invention recommends that the movements applied to the roof via the first displacement means and the second tipping means are coordinated so that the first roof element passes under the second roof element until it comes along side it, whilst the second tipping means, connected on one side to the roof elements and on the other side to the bodywork of the vehicle, pivot this second roof element while bringing the first roof element with it.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">Incidentally, within the invention it is preferred that the second tipping means are placed towards the rear end of the second roof element, providing a relative articulation between them and a drive connection (traction) in relation to the first roof element, via rods (runner system notably passing under the second roof element).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0015">Stowing the roof in its stowage space, along a radius of curvature which evolves according to the folded state of this roof, allows to house the latter in a particularly narrow space in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">In line with this approach, the invention therefore recommends that the second roof element is connected, towards the rear and in an articulated manner, to the second tipping means which, in a movement in relation to the bodywork of the vehicle, drive said roof elements along a curvilinear displacement, with a concavity oriented towards a zone located in the vicinity of the upper front edge of the stowage space.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">Within the context of the aforementioned kinematics of the movements of the roof, the invention specially attempted to finding a compromise between the âfluidityâ of the movement, the non-interference with the passenger compartment, the reliability of the chosen mechanical solution and a tipping over that must be quick and of limited amplitude so that the roof moves from its substantially horizontal closed position to its substantially vertical folded position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">Under these conditions, another feature of the invention recommends that, laterally, on each side of the roof, the second roof element and the second tipping means articulate on each other along two axes in a direction transversal to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, respectively via first and second guiding means each bearing an end extending as far as a zone of the bodywork of the vehicle located in the vicinity of the front edge of the roof stowing space, said ends, between each other, and said transversal axes, between each other, being respectively offset along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, so that the displacement towards the rear and downwards of the roof, induced by the guiding means, provoke a vertical offset between the front edge of the second roof element and the rear edge of the first roof element, prior to an action by the first displacement means to bring the first and second roof elements side by side, during the folding of the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019">In the same context, it is furthermore recommended that:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0020">the second tipping means comprise at least a first arm and a second arm;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0021">the first arm is on one side solidly connected to the first roof element and is connected in an articulated manner to the second roof element to allow a relative pivoting about an axis transversal to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0022">the first arm is on the other side assembled in an articulated manner in relation to the bodywork of the vehicle; and</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0023">the second arm is connected in an articulated manner, on one side, to the second roof element and, on the other side, to the bodywork of the vehicle.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0024">Therefore, whilst they can advantageously comprise such first and second arms, the roof tipping means will be advantageously associated, in the invention, to sliding runners, and this even though a purely twin articulated arm solution (preferably extending between the rear of the second roof element and an upper front zone of the stowage space) is also described below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0025">The solution with arms individually assembled in a double runner is preferred to a twin articulated arm system, in that it favours the speed at which the roof pivots and best satisfies the aforementioned space limitation conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0026">Also to be noted is that the invention is of particular benefit to vehicles with trunk rear lid and rear mounted engine, therefore comprising a rear lid articulated on the bodywork and located behind the seats, towards the rear of the vehicle, to provide access (possibly in addition to a luggage stowage space) to a rear mounted engine naturally used to displace the vehicle. Notably, in this case, there are space limiting problems, here for access to the engine, even for access to the inside of the stowage space for the folded roof.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0030">The two preferred embodiments of the invention described below therefore allow, with a retractable roof <b>1</b>, to transform a saloon or coupe type vehicle <b>3</b> into a convertible type vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0031">The problem encountered in the existing solutions to retract the roof being that they generally do not allow to stow the latter in a particularly limited space <b>5</b> notably in the direction of the longitudinal axis XXâ² of the vehicle, when this space is interposed between the rear of the passenger seats <b>7</b> and the front of the zone <b>9</b> of the vehicle notably reserved for the rear lid <b>11</b> under which the engine <b>13</b>, intended to displace the vehicle, is usually housed, the invention has envisaged a roof whose tipping mechanism resolves these problems of limited space.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0032">In the following solutions, the described mechanisms are substantially symmetrical in relation to the median plane of the vehicle (containing XXâ²). Thus only the solution of one side will be disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0033">In the two illustrated embodiments notably in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the roof <b>1</b> of the vehicle comprises, from the front (AVT) towards the rear (ARR), three successive rigid sections <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b>. The two more forward sections <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> constitute first and second movable roof elements or panels, whereas the rear section <b>19</b> is fixed with respect to the bodywork <b>21</b> of the vehicle (âbodyworkâ is used for any part of the chassis and/or the body of the vehicle and which constitute support or reference parts in relation to which the roof <b>1</b> is movable).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0034">Thus, the two elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> of the roof <b>1</b> are interposed, in this example, between, at the front, the windscreen opening <b>23</b> and, at the rear, the fixed section <b>19</b> which integrates the lateral rear struts <b>20</b> which surround a rear window which is not visible in the figures and which thus extends between these struts.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0035">The two movable elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> of the roof <b>1</b> are therefore substantially plane and positioned substantially horizontally in the closed state of the roof as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0036">Note that the rear movable section <b>17</b> of the roof can all the same extend further backwards and integrate in it the section <b>19</b> so that this pivoted assembled rear element will thus extend as far as the zone <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Of course, the rear limit here marked by <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (substantially at the level of the front part of the roof element <b>19</b>) in this case extends backwards as far as to the level of the point <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0037">So as to pivot between its closed state above the passenger compartment <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>) and its folded state, retracted into its stowage space <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>; chain dotted line), the movement of the movable roof elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> is directed and controlled by the first displacement means <b>35</b> and the second tipping means (<b>37</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> and <b>39</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). Respectively, these means are intended to bring the first and second roof elements side by side, when the roof is being opened (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>), and to make them tip over between the closed and open states, resulting in that, in this case, these elements are positioned substantially vertically in the stowage space <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0038">In the space <b>5</b>, the two elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> are positioned side by side (one behind the other). To achieve this it was preferred that, during the folding of the roof, the front element <b>15</b> passes under the rear element <b>17</b> (arrow F<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) following a vertical offset between them (arrow F<b>2</b>). This offset movement between the rear edge of the front element <b>15</b> and the front edge of the rear element <b>17</b> is obtained, in the two embodiments, via an articulated assembly of the rear roof element <b>17</b> (marked <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 41</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in relation to an arm (<b>43</b>, <b>45</b>) connected on one side to the front roof element <b>15</b> and on the other side to the bodywork <b>21</b>, and via the complementary presence of a second arm (<b>47</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 49</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) mounted articulated on one side to the element <b>17</b> and on the other side again in relation to the bodywork <b>21</b> (âdirectâ articulation at the place of the transversal axis <b>51</b> for the solution in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and âindirectâ articulation in particular via the sloping runner <b>53</b> in which the arm <b>49</b> is driven via, if necessary, the rod <b>55</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0039">In the two embodiments, it is to be noted that the combined effect of offset along F<b>2</b> and tipping of the roof elements is all the more efficient as the tipping means <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> articulate on one side towards the rear of the rear roof element <b>17</b> and, on the other side, towards the front edge <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the stowage space <b>5</b> (upper section of this edge in the first embodiment and lower section in the second embodiment consisting in the ends <b>53</b><i>a</i>, <b>57</b><i>a </i>of the two runners <b>53</b> and <b>57</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0040">Also in connection with this tipping coupled with the offset of the roof elements along the F<b>2</b> direction, it is to be noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the forward position, at the place of the articulation on the bodywork, of the axis of rotation <b>59</b> of the rear arm <b>43</b> in relation to the axis of rotation <b>51</b> of the front arm <b>47</b> (whose axis of rotation <b>40</b>, <b>61</b> on the element <b>17</b> moreover inverse). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is to be seen the same offset along the longitudinal axis XXâ² for the limit ends of the arm <b>49</b> in the runners <b>53</b> and <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0041">The use of such âdoubleâ guiding means (double arm <b>43</b>, <b>47</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and double runner system <b>53</b>, <b>57</b> guiding the arms <b>45</b> and <b>49</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) allows to efficiently and accurately guide the movable roof elements in their confined tipping between the closed horizontal position and the folded vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0042">In relation to this particularly confined pivoting, it is to be noted the relatively tapered shape of the rear edge <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the rear element <b>17</b>, this shape being complementary with that of the front edge <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the section <b>19</b> of the bodywork of the vehicle. More precisely, in this case it has a tapered shape, bevelled towards the rear and the bottom in order to facilitate the tipping in the same direction of the element <b>17</b> during tipping of the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0043">As regards the connection between the respectively rear <b>15</b><i>a </i>and front <b>17</b><i>b </i>edges of the elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>, such a shape does not seem to be essential, as long as the pivoting along F<b>2</b> is effected substantially perpendicularly to the overall sliding direction YYâ² of the elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0044">In the figures, this relative movement between the two movable roof elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>, along the direction YYâ², is performed via a bar <b>63</b> (slide) prolonging the front roof element <b>15</b> substantially along XXâ² (when the roof is closed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), in liaison with a co-operating runner <b>65</b> extending substantially in the same direction, in the same roof state.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0045">In practice, the orientation of the elements <b>63</b> and <b>65</b> and their curved shape will be a function of the line of the vehicle (in particular that of its roof zone) and of the surrounding parts such as <b>19</b> and <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0046">Still in the closed state of the roof, the slide <b>63</b>, which is firmly attached to the element <b>15</b>, prolongs it to the rear, under the element <b>17</b> where it engages into the runner <b>65</b> which is, towards the rear of this element <b>17</b>, prolonged by (or firmly attached to) either the arm <b>43</b> (first embodiment) or to the arm <b>45</b> (second embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0047">Such a slide/runner system, combined with the aforementioned tipping means <b>37</b> or <b>39</b> positioned to tilt the rear element <b>17</b> in relation to the front element <b>15</b> of the roof as from the start of the roof opening phase, promotes, in connection with the aforementioned shapes <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the fast tipping towards the rear and downwards of the element <b>17</b>, during the opening of the roof. In this example, the parts <b>63</b> and <b>65</b> act as draw rods (or elements) thanks to which the tipping of the rear roof element <b>17</b>, under the effect of the tipping means <b>37</b>, provokes the tipping of the front element <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0048">Before presenting the opening movement of the roof in the context of the first embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, it is to be noted that in this embodiment, the tipping means <b>37</b> hardly encroaches on the stowage space <b>5</b>, as in the closed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, they show, for the rear arm <b>43</b> which is firmly attached to the rear end of the straight runner <b>65</b>, a âLâ shape pivoted to the left, and, for the second articulated arm <b>47</b>, a âCâ shape also pivoted to the left, each having a lower substantially horizontal strand articulated to the bodywork <b>21</b>, respectively at <b>51</b> and <b>59</b>, close to the upper edge of this bodywork, that is in the vicinity of the upper limit <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the space <b>5</b>, from which limit a lateral rear strut window <b>67</b> can typically rise. In this regard, this window can indifferently, in the context of the opening/closing movement of the roof <b>1</b>, either be pivotally assembled with the tipping means <b>37</b> (for example by articulating about the transversal axis <b>59</b>) or descend by vertically retracting into the bodywork.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0049">It is also to be noted that the articulation axes of the pivoting arms <b>43</b>, <b>47</b> (at <b>40</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>59</b> and <b>61</b>) are transversal (more precisely perpendicular) to the longitudinal axis XXâ² of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0050">The arm <b>43</b> (rear arm in fact) is preferably positioned and shaped to act as the driving arm, that meaning that it initiates the tipping opening of the roof. It is at its axis of articulation <b>40</b> that the rear roof element <b>17</b> is moreover pivotally assembled, via an outgrowth <b>69</b> located at the lower rear end of the element <b>17</b> and extending substantially vertically (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0051">The articulation point <b>61</b> is located slightly further forward and upward, directly on the element <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0052">Due to its assembly and shape, the second arm <b>47</b> is the trailing arm and it is in particular via it that the rear roof element <b>17</b> slopes along F<b>2</b> to allow the front element <b>15</b> to pass by.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0053">Thus, when the roof elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> pivot backwards, to move from the closed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the open position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the arm <b>43</b> drives the runner <b>65</b> backwards and downwards via the pivoting of the arm about the transversal axis <b>59</b>. The bent arm <b>47</b> thus also pivots backwards, provoking the upward tipping of the rear roof element <b>17</b> (arrow F<b>2</b>), via the pivoting about the axis <b>61</b>, thus allowing the slide <b>63</b>, followed by the element <b>15</b>, to slide under the beam of the rear element <b>17</b>, along the runner <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0054">The entire under/before movement of the element <b>15</b> in relation to the rear element <b>17</b>, which therefore starts once the roof <b>1</b> has started to tip over about axes <b>51</b> and <b>59</b>, and which continues to move as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ends when the roof attains its stowed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, position in which the two elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> are therefore side by side, the element <b>15</b> entering into the relative concavity facing forwards of the element <b>17</b>, in front of it.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0055">When the elements reach this completely folded position of the roof inside the space <b>5</b>, the element <b>17</b> has returned to its normal ânon slopingâ position which it occupies when it is aligned with the front element <b>15</b>, thus preventing its upper end from taking up too much space towards the rear.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0056">To ensure the movement of the first and second guiding means <b>43</b>, <b>47</b>, as well as the movement of the roof element <b>15</b> under the element <b>17</b>, known drive means can be used, such as power cylinders or electric motors (not represented).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0057">Looking now more precisely at the second embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> and next ones, it is to be noted that the arm <b>45</b> attached to the front roof element <b>15</b> rigidly prolongs, backwards and in a bent manner downwards, the runner <b>65</b> in the closed state of the roof in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0058">As for the articulation along the transversal axis <b>41</b> of the rear element <b>17</b> in relation to this arm <b>45</b>, it takes place at the rear end of the runner <b>65</b> at the uppermost part of the arm <b>45</b>, at the place of an outgrowth <b>69</b>, as in the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0059">Incidentally, the articulation of the same element <b>17</b> in relation to the arm <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) also operates as in the first embodiment, that is at the rear section of the element <b>17</b>, the transversal axis <b>71</b> (therefore perpendicular to XXâ²), about which the arm <b>49</b> is therefore pivotally assembled on the element <b>17</b>, being located further forward and preferably slightly higher than the transversal axis <b>41</b>, so that the second arm <b>49</b> constitutes (in the image of <b>47</b> in relation to <b>43</b>) the trailing arm in relation to the leading arm <b>45</b>, during the opening of the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0060">Given the shape of the parts and the kinematics in question, the arm <b>49</b>, which will in particular be used to pivot the element <b>17</b> to allow the element <b>15</b> to pass under it, is coupled to the rod <b>55</b>, via an intermediary articulation on a transversal axis <b>73</b>, the rod <b>55</b> sliding along the runner <b>53</b>, via a slug <b>75</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0061">From this figure and from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is moreover to be noted that this slug <b>75</b> here crosses the rod <b>55</b> (with slight clearance to allow the free movement of the rod <b>55</b> when moving along <b>53</b>) and is located at one end of a cross shaft <b>77</b> (perpendicular to the axis XXâ²) which, driven by a motor <b>79</b>, drives a pinion <b>81</b> interposed between the shaft and the slug <b>75</b> and geared to a rack <b>83</b>, in order to therefore ensure the displacement in both directions along the runner <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0062">A comparable drive can be envisaged at the place of a slug <b>85</b> which can freely move inside the other runner <b>57</b> and which is assembled towards the free end of the arm <b>45</b> along an axis <b>87</b> perpendicular to XXâ².</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0063">Notably in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is to be noted that, from the top to the bottom of the arm <b>45</b>, are successively found the articulation axes or slugs <b>41</b>, <b>75</b> and <b>85</b>, all three substantially aligned along the overall direction of extension of this arm (close to the vertical in the closed position of the roof). Thus, the slug <b>85</b> by means of which the leading arm <b>45</b> will initiate the tipping of the roof, is located further downwards and backwards in relation to the slug <b>75</b> of the trailing arm <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0064">The two runners <b>53</b> and <b>57</b> are in a straight line, sloping (in this case along different angles) and extend between the upper rear end of the stowage space <b>5</b> (even from slightly above this space), in the direction of a zone located towards the lower front section of the space.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0065">Combined with the shape of the parts (in particular the roof elements and the arm <b>45</b>), the longitudinally offset position (along the axis XXâ²) of the lower front ends <b>53</b><i>a </i>and <b>57</b><i>a </i>of the two runners promotes a short tipping and a fast vertical positioning of the roof elements (chain dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is also to be noted the benefit of the articulation <b>73</b> of the arm <b>49</b> which, in this embodiment, defines a connection rod comprising two rods articulated to each other, the relative position of these two rods developing with the folding movement of the roof (of course, this is also the case for the opposite movement of unfolding the roof, when it is to be closed over the passenger compartment).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0067">It is also to be noted that during folding, the sliding of the arm <b>45</b> along the two runners <b>53</b> and <b>57</b> engenders the downward displacement of the arm <b>49</b> which, in combination with the articulation <b>41</b>, provokes the sloping of the element <b>17</b> along F<b>2</b>, this concomitantly with the downward and backward pivoting of the two elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>, the element <b>15</b> here being driven by the intermediary organs <b>63</b> and <b>65</b> provided in this embodiment as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0068">Still in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is to be noted once again that the mechanism was designed so that, when the roof is completely stowed in the vertical position inside the space <b>5</b>, the two elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> are just one in front of the other, the rear element <b>17</b> having returned to its ânormalâ non-sloping position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0069">From the above and the illustrations, it is to be understood that in the two illustrated embodiments the pivoting means <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> transfer to the movable roof elements <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> a curvilinear movement substantially developing between the vertical and the horizontal, with a concavity oriented towards a zone <b>90</b> globally located in the vicinity of the front upper part of the stowage space <b>5</b> thus allowing to best attain the sought after compact stowing.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0070">It is also to be noted the reduced lateral and axial (along XXâ²) encumbrance of the tipping means <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> whose constituting elements are advantageously located in the immediate vicinity of the side walls of the bodywork where they articulate, preferably within the dimensions of the space <b>5</b> in the direction of the axis XXâ², that meaning considerably to the rear of the second roof element <b>17</b>, solely between the rear of seats <b>7</b> and the front of the zone <b>9</b> which can thus be entirely reserved for housing the engine.</p>
