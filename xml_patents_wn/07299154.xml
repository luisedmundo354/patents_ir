<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to semiconductor processing, and, more particularly, to detecting disturbances and determining disturbance types during semiconductor processing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Statistical process control (SPC) is commonly used to monitor semiconductor processing tools based on measurements of parameters associated with features formed by the processing tools. For example, an etching process may be monitored by measuring depths of features formed on each semiconductor wafer in a lot of etched wafers. The parameters may be plotted on a statistical process control chart, e.g., as a function of processing lot or run. For example, the statistical process control chart may be formed by plotting the actual measured depths for features formed on a plurality of wafers. In some cases, operating recipes used for the processing tools may be modified during a processing run. The modifications may result in changes to the parameters of the features formed using the processes, such as a depth of an etched feature. Accordingly, a generalized statistical process control chart may plot values of the measured depths that are corrected for the expected changes in the parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although a certain amount of random variation in the parameters is expected, deviations of one or more parameters from a target value may indicate undesirable and/or unexpected operation of the processing tool. Accordingly, the statistical process control chart (or the generalized statistical process control chart) may be examined for outlier points that deviate from a target value by an amount that is larger than expected for normal random variations of the associated parameter. For example, the statistical process control chart may be visually inspected by an engineer for outlier points. Alternatively, the statistical process control chart may be analyzed using statistical techniques. For example, an outlier point may be used as an indication that a disturbance has occurred in the processing. Accordingly, the outlier point may be used as a trigger for further analysis and determination of corresponding actions that may be used to address the issue.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional algorithms for analyzing the statistical process chart calculate a posteriori, i.e., after the fact, probability that the value of the outlier point indicates a step and/or impulse disturbance in the processing. However, the posteriori probability associated with the outlier point rarely, if ever, contains enough information to discriminate between a step disturbance and an impulse disturbance. Accordingly, conventional algorithms may select a second point associated with a feature formed after the feature associated with the outlier point and calculate a posteriori probability that the value of the second point indicates a step and/or impulse disturbance in the processing. If the posteriori probability associated with second point does not contain enough information to discriminate between a step disturbance and an impulse disturbance, another point may be selected and analyzed. This point-by-point process continues until the posteriori probability associated with one of the points increases above a predetermined threshold. In addition to the aforementioned requirement of an outlier detection algorithm (for example, a generalized SPC chart) to trigger the analysis, conventional algorithms for detecting step and/or impulse disturbances typically require a delay of 4 to 5 lots before the posteriori probability can discriminate between a step disturbance and an impulse disturbance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The amplitude of the deviation in the outlier point required to trigger conventional disturbance detection algorithms for analyzing the statistical process chart is typically large enough to trigger an alarm condition in the associated processing tool. Consequently, the conventional disturbance detection algorithm may miss some early warning signals until they become severe enough to trigger the SPC alarm. Accordingly, conventional disturbance detection algorithms may be inappropriate for closed-loop control of the processing tool because closed-loop control algorithms reduce variations in the measured parameters and thus the alarm condition will not be triggered in most cases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to addressing the effects of one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an exhaustive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is discussed later.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions should be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Portions of the present invention and corresponding detailed description are presented in terms of software, or algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the ones by which those of ordinary skill in the art effectively convey the substance of their work to others of ordinary skill in the art. An algorithm, as the term is used here, and as it is used generally, is conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of optical, electrical, or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, or as is apparent from the discussion, terms such as “processing” or “computing” or “calculating” or “determining” or “displaying” or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical, electronic quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Note also that the software implemented aspects of the invention are typically encoded on some form of program storage medium or implemented over some type of transmission medium. The program storage medium may be magnetic (e.g., a floppy disk or a hard drive) or optical (e.g., a compact disk read only memory, or “CD ROM”), and may be read only or random access. Similarly, the transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, or some other suitable transmission medium known to the art. The invention is not limited by these aspects of any given implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention will now be described with reference to the attached figures. Various structures, systems and devices are schematically depicted in the drawings for purposes of explanation only and so as to not obscure the present invention with details that are well known to those skilled in the art. Nevertheless, the attached drawings are included to describe and explain illustrative examples of the present invention. The words and phrases used herein should be understood and interpreted to have a meaning consistent with the understanding of those words and phrases by those skilled in the relevant art. No special definition of a term or phrase, i.e., a definition that is different from the ordinary and customary meaning as understood by those skilled in the art, is intended to be implied by consistent usage of the term or phrase herein. To the extent that a term or phrase is intended to have a special meaning, i.e., a meaning other than that understood by skilled artisans, such a special definition will be expressly set forth in the specification in a definitional manner that directly and unequivocally provides the special definition for the term or phrase.</p>

For another example, the measurement tool <b>115</b> may include a wafer electrical test tool for measuring electrical parameters of features formed on the wafer, such as voltages, currents, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> is communicatively coupled to the measurement tool <b>115</b>. The disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> may access values of one or more of the parameters associated with the wafer <b>105</b> and use these values to detect a disturbance in the processing performed by the processing tool <b>110</b>, as well as any other processing performed on the wafer <b>105</b>. In one embodiment, the disturbance may be detected by assuming that a disturbance occurs at every run, and then the disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> confirms or rejects the hypothesis based on an analysis of a posteriori probability sequence. When the hypothesis is confirmed, i.e., a disturbance has occurred, the disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> determines the type of the disturbance by matching the pattern of the posterior probability to the pattern of the posteriori probability corresponding to a type of disturbance, such as a step disturbance, an impulse disturbance, and the like, as will be discussed in detail below. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> is also communicatively coupled to a process control and fault detection/classification (FDC) system <b>125</b>. The disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> may therefore provide information to the process control and fault detection/classification system <b>125</b> based upon the analysis of the parameter values, the probabilities, and/or the pattern of probabilities discussed above. The disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> may provide disturbance information that may be used by the process control and fault detection/classification system <b>125</b> to modify an operating recipe used by the processing tool <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the disturbance analysis unit <b>120</b> may feed-forward information that may be used by other processing tools (not shown).

In the illustrated embodiment, values <b>201</b> (only one labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) of a parameter associated with a plurality of wafer lots are plotted as a function of lot number. As discussed above, the parameters may be physical parameters or electrical parameters associated with the wafer lots. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the parameter is not limited to individual parameters that may be measured. In alternative embodiments, composite and/or derived parameters may be formed based upon one or more of the measured parameters or combinations of the measured parameters. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis <b>205</b> and increases to the right. The value of the parameter is plotted along vertical axis <b>210</b> and increases upward.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The probabilities <b>235</b> associated with parameter values <b>201</b> for lot numbers in the pre-disturbance group <b>227</b> are prior probabilities, each of which represents the probability that a step disturbance occurred based on information associated with the parameter values <b>201</b> in the pre-disturbance group <b>227</b>. In this illustrative example, the prior probability is approximately equal to 0.5, indicating that without any further information, there are roughly equal probabilities that a step disturbance did or did not occur to the current parameter value <b>201</b>. The probability <b>235</b> associated with parameter values <b>201</b> in the post-disturbance group <b>228</b> are posteriori probabilities, which are calculated by incorporating the parameter values <b>201</b> in post-disturbance group <b>228</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> conceptually illustrates first and second exemplary embodiments of patterns <b>400</b>, <b>405</b> of probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>), <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, each of the probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>), <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) represents a posteriori probability that a step disturbance has occurred, as discussed above. The patterns <b>400</b>, <b>405</b> may be formed using probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>), <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) associated with parameter values selected from a post-disturbance window, such as the post-disturbance windows <b>228</b>, <b>328</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 3B</figref>. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis <b>420</b> and increases to the right. The value of the posteriori probability is plotted along vertical axis <b>425</b> and increases upward.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first exemplary embodiment of the pattern <b>400</b> shows three probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) that generally increase with increasing run (or lot) number. The pattern <b>400</b> may be indicative of a step disturbance, as may be seen by comparing the pattern <b>400</b> to the probability plot <b>230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Accordingly, the pattern <b>400</b> may be used to determine that a step disturbance has occurred. In one embodiment, a disturbance may be detected by determining that the probability <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>) exceeds a threshold <b>430</b>, e.g., the probability <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>) may be used as a trigger for a statistical analysis of the probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>). The disturbance may then be identified as a step disturbance by comparing the pattern <b>400</b> to a target pattern and/or threshold. In one embodiment, the probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) are compared to the threshold <b>430</b> and the disturbance is identified as a step disturbance if all of the probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) exceed the threshold value <b>430</b>. Alternatively, the probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) may be compared to a target pattern <b>435</b>. For example, the disturbance may be identified as a step disturbance if the probabilities <b>410</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) are equal to or exceed the corresponding values of the target pattern <b>435</b>. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the statistical analysis described above is intended to be illustrative and not to limit the present invention.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The second exemplary embodiment of the pattern <b>405</b> shows three probabilities <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) that generally decrease with increasing run number. The pattern <b>405</b> may be indicative of an impulse disturbance, as may be seen by comparing the pattern <b>405</b> to the probability plot <b>330</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Accordingly, the pattern <b>405</b> may be used to determine that an impulse disturbance has occurred. In one embodiment, a disturbance may be detected by determining that the probability <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>) exceeds a threshold <b>440</b>, e.g., the probability <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>) may be used as a trigger for a statistical analysis of the probabilities <b>415</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>).

Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the statistical analysis described above is intended to be illustrative and not to limit the present invention. In alternative embodiments, other techniques for analyzing the pattern <b>405</b> to determine a type of the disturbance may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a method <b>500</b> for detecting and classifying a disturbance. In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of probabilities associated with a corresponding plurality of wafer processing parameters is determined (at <b>505</b>). For example, the probabilities may be indicative of a step disturbance, as discussed above. If none of the probabilities indicates that a disturbance has occurred, then no disturbance analysis is triggered (at <b>510</b>) and data associated with the wafer processing parameters may be provided to, and processed by, an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) filter. If at least one of the probabilities indicates that a disturbance has occurred, this probability may be used to trigger (at <b>510</b>) an analysis of the posteriori probabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The type of the disturbance may be determined (at <b>520</b>) based on a pattern formed with the plurality of probabilities. The pattern may then be compared to a threshold and/or a target pattern, as discussed in detail above. If the pattern is determined (at <b>520</b>) to be indicative of a step disturbance, then a step tracking algorithm may be invoked (at <b>525</b>). Step tracking algorithms are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and so will not be discussed further herein. If the pattern is determined (at <b>520</b>) to be indicative of an impulse disturbance, then an impulse rejection algorithm may be invoked (at <b>530</b>). Impulse rejection algorithms are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and so will not be discussed further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method <b>500</b> may have a number of advantages over conventional practice. For example, the method <b>500</b> does not require an SPC chart to detect the onset of the disturbance. Thus, the method <b>500</b> may be implemented in processes that are not equipped with the SPC charts. Moreover, the amplitude of deviations in outlier points required to trigger an analysis such as may be implemented in the method <b>500</b> may be much smaller that the deviation that could trigger an alarm condition in a processing tool. Accordingly, the method <b>500</b> may be suitable for implementation in closed-loop control algorithms and variations in the measured parameters may be reduced to values substantially smaller than the deviations in the measured parameters that would trigger an alarm condition.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a third exemplary embodiment of a time series process chart <b>600</b>. A lot number is plotted along horizontal axis <b>605</b> and increases to the right. The value of a parameter associated with processing of wafers in each lot is plotted along vertical axis <b>610</b> and increases upward. Units of the parameter and the vertical axis <b>610</b> are arbitrary. In the illustrated embodiment, a step onset (indicated by a square) or an impulse onset (indicated by a triangle) is detected and classified after only 2-3 lots once a disturbance has occurred. For example, the delay in detecting the step onset may be approximately equal to the number of lots in a post-disturbance window. Conventional techniques for analyzing the time series process chart <b>600</b> typically require at least four to five lots to determine whether the disturbance is a step disturbance or not once SPC chart detects the disturbance.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> conceptually illustrates a time series process chart <b>700</b> and a plurality of pre-disturbance windows <b>705</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) and post-disturbance windows <b>710</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, values <b>701</b> (only one indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of a parameter associated with a plurality of wafer lots are plotted as a function of lot number. As discussed above, the parameters may be physical parameters, electrical parameters, parameters formed based upon the measured parameters or combinations of the measured parameters, and the like. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis <b>715</b> and increases to the right. The value of the parameter is plotted along vertical axis <b>720</b> and increases upward. Units of the axes <b>715</b>, <b>720</b> are arbitrary.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The post-disturbance windows <b>710</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) may have different lengths so that they encompass parameter values associated with different ranges of lot number. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the particular ranges of lot numbers associated with the post-disturbance windows <b>710</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) are intended to be illustrative and not to limit the present invention. Furthermore, persons of ordinary skill in the art should also appreciate that the pre-disturbance windows <b>705</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) may also have variable lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The patterns formed using the probabilities associated with parameter values (or lot numbers) in the different post-disturbance windows <b>710</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) may be used to detect and classify different types of disturbances. For example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window <b>710</b>(<b>1</b>), which includes two lot numbers, may be used to detect impulse disturbances. For another example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window <b>710</b>(<b>2</b>), which includes three lot numbers, may be used to detect step disturbances that last for approximately two lots. For yet another example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window <b>710</b>(<b>3</b>), which includes four lot numbers, may be used to detect step disturbances that last for approximately three lots, such as the step disturbance shown in the time series process chart <b>700</b>. For yet another example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window <b>710</b>(<b>4</b>), which includes five lot numbers, may be used to detect step disturbances that last for approximately four lots.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a fourth exemplary embodiment of a time series process chart <b>800</b>. A lot number is plotted along horizontal axis <b>805</b> and increases to the right. The value of a parameter associated with processing of wafers in each lot is plotted along vertical axis <b>810</b> and increases upward. Units of the parameter and the vertical axis <b>810</b> are arbitrary. In the illustrated embodiment, a disturbance onset is detected with at most 2 runs delay, and the type of disturbance is classified without delay (i.e., only one inherent delay). For example, the onset of a step disturbance (indicated by a square) is detected 2 runs later after the disturbance occurs and the onset of an impulse disturbance (indicated by a triangle) is detected 1 run after the disturbance occurs. For another example, an impulse disturbance would be classified one run after the disturbance occurs and a short step with duration 2 would be classified once the short-step finished, i.e., 3 runs after the disturbance occurs.</p>
