<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An angular position sensor is provided which is designed to an angular position of a rotary shaft. The angular position sensor has a magnet affixed to the rotary shaft. The magnet has an N-pole and an S-pole and is so geometrically shaped as to produce magnetic flux which is substantially uniform in amount within a range extending around each of centers of the N-pole and the S-pole.

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an angular position sensor working to measure an angular position of a rotary member, and more particularly to an improved structure of such an angular position sensor designed to sense a magnetic flux density that is higher in linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical angular position sensors working to measure an angular position of a rotary shaft are made up of a ring-shaped magnet with an N-pole and an S-pole arrayed in a circumferential direction thereof, a magnetic yoke disposed around the periphery of the magnet, and magnetic sensors. The magnetic yoke has formed therein radial grooves forming air gaps. The magnetic sensors are disposed within the air gaps and work to measure magnetic flux densities in the air gaps. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,139 to Oudet et al., issued Jun. 18, 1996 (corresponding to Japanese Patent No. 2842482) teaches such a type of angular position sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The N-pole and the S-pole of the magnet are disposed at an angular interval of 180° and create a magnetic flux density changing at a constant rate in the circumferential direction of the magnet. This causes the magnetic flux density as measured by the magnetic sensors to change in the form of a sine wave upon rotation of the rotary shaft. It is, thus, impossible for the magnetic sensors to measure the magnetic flux density that is higher in linearity. Determination of an absolute angular position of the rotary shaft requires large-scaled operations on trigonometric functions and/or using a map, thus posing the problem that the operation load on the system is undesirably high.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore a principal object of the invention to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is another object of the invention to provide an angular position sensor designed to measure a magnetic flux density that is higher in linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided an angular position sensor which may be employed in electric power steering devices for automotive vehicles. The angular position sensor comprises: (a) a hard magnetic member connected to a rotary member, the hard magnetic member having a circumference and magnetized in a circumferential direction thereof to produce a magnetic field therearound; (b) a soft magnetic member disposed within the magnetic field produced by the hard magnetic member to form a magnetic circuit, rotation of the rotary member to change a relative position between the magnetic field and the hard magnetic member causes a magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit to change; and (c) a magnetic flux density measuring sensor disposed at an interval away from the soft magnetic member. The magnetic flux density measuring sensor works to measure the magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit to produce a signal as a function of the magnetic flux density as indicating an angular position of the rotary member. The hard magnetic member is so designed as to create magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within a given angular range in a circumferential direction thereof, thereby causing the density of magnetic flux developed in the magnetic circuit to change substantially in proportion to a change in angular position of the rotary member, which enables the angular position sensor to provide a change in output that is higher in linearity upon rotation of the rotary member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the preferred mode of the invention, the hard magnetic member has a first magnetic pole and a second magnetic pole which are different in polarity from each other and joined at ends thereof together to define the circumference of the hard magnetic member. The first and second magnetic poles work to create the magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within angular ranges defined around central portions of the first and second magnetic poles in the circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member. This structure provides a change in amount of the magnetic flux produced upon rotation of the rotary member in the form of substantially a rectangular wave within the angular range around the central portion of each of the first and second magnetic poles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The central portions of the first and second magnetic poles may have a thickness defined in a direction perpendicular to a plane extending over the circumference of the hard magnetic member which is smaller than a thickness of portions of the first and second magnetic poles around interfaces between ends of the first and second magnetic poles. Specifically, the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles are thinner, in other words, peripheral areas of the first and second magnetic poles are smaller than those of the portions around the interfaces between the ends of the first and second magnetic poles, so that a total amount of magnetic flux produced from the central portions are decreased as compared with when the first and second magnetic poles have the thickness that is uniform over the circumference of the hard magnetic member, thereby resulting in the uniformity of the amount of magnetic flux within the angular ranges defined around the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The central portions of the first and second magnetic poles may alternatively have a width defined in a direction oriented parallel to a plane extending cover the circumference of the hard magnetic member which is smaller than a width of the portions of the first and second magnetic poles around the interfaces between ends of the first and second magnetic poles. Specifically, the peripheral areas of the first and second magnetic poles are smaller than those of the portions around the interfaces between the ends of the first and second magnetic poles, so that a total amount of magnetic flux produced from the central portions are decreased as compared with when the first and second magnetic poles have the width that is uniform over the circumference of the hard magnetic member, thereby resulting in the uniformity of the amount of magnetic flux within the angular ranges defined around the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The hard magnetic member may alternatively have sub-soft magnetic members which work to convert magnetic flux generated from the first and second magnetic poles into the magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within the given angular range. The sub-soft magnetic members are disposed on outer peripheries of the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the structure wherein the hard magnetic member has the thickness defined in the direction perpendicular to a plane extending over the circumference thereof which is smaller than that of the soft magnetic member, the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member may be so disposed that a plane defined on a circumferential center line of the hard magnetic member in a thickness-wise direction thereof coincides with a plane defined on a circumferential center line of the soft magnetic member in a thickness-wise direction thereof. This structure serves to keep the hard magnetic member inside the soft magnetic member in a thickness-wise direction of the hard magnetic member even if a slight shift between the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member occurs in the thickness-wise direction of the hard magnetic member, thereby minimizing a change in magnetic flux density to be measured by the magnetic flux density measuring sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The angular position sensor may further comprise a magnetic shield which surrounds the soft magnetic member to minimize an error of a sensor output arising from external magnetic disturbances.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The soft magnetic member may have a circumference and be disposed outside the circumference of the hard magnetic member. The soft magnetic member may have a first, a second, a third, and a fourth gap formed therein at an interval of approximately 90° in a circumferential direction of the soft magnetic member. A distance between an outer periphery of the soft magnetic member and the magnetic shield is greater than a length of each of the first to fourth gaps in the circumferential direction of the soft magnetic member, thereby avoiding leakage of the magnetic flux from the soft magnetic member to the magnetic shield.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The widths of the first and second magnetic poles of the hard magnetic member defined in the direction perpendicular to the plane extending over the circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member may decrease toward circumferential centers of the first and second magnetic poles. Specifically, the peripheral areas around the circumferential centers of the first and second magnetic poles are smaller than those of the portions around the interfaces between the ends of the first and second magnetic poles, so that a total amount of magnetic flux produced from the central portions are decreased as compared with when the first and second magnetic poles have the width that is uniform over the circumference of the hard magnetic member, thereby resulting in the uniformity of the amount of magnetic flux within the angular ranges defined around the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member may have a circular inner circumference. The hard magnetic member may have substantially circular outer circumference defined by geometry that widths of the circumferential centers of the first and second magnetic poles in the direction perpendicular to the circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member are smaller than widths of interfaces between the first and second magnetic poles.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the structure wherein the thickness of the hard magnetic member in the direction perpendicular to the plane extending over the circumference of the hard magnetic member is greater than that of the soft magnetic member, ends of the hard magnetic member opposed in the direction perpendicular to the plane extending over the circumference of the hard magnetic member may project outside ends of the soft magnetic member in the direction perpendicular to the circumference of the hard magnetic member. This causes the magnetic flux to flow from corners of the hard magnetic member out of the soft magnetic member which serves to attract incoming iron powders to avoid sticking thereof to the inner periphery of the soft magnetic member and an opposed portion of the outer periphery of the hard magnetic member, thus ensuring the stability of flow of magnetic flux from the hard magnetic member to the inner periphery of the soft magnetic member for an extended period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the second aspect of the invention, there is provided an angular position determining apparatus which comprises: (A) an angular position sensor including (a) a hard magnetic member connected to a rotary member, the hard magnetic member having a circumference and magnetized in a circumferential direction thereof to produce a magnetic field therearound and working to produce magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within a given angular range in a circumferential direction thereof, the hard magnetic member having a first magnetic pole and a second magnetic pole different in polarity from the first magnetic pole, the first and second magnetic poles being jointed at ends thereof at locations 180° apart from each other in a circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member, (b) a soft magnetic member disposed outside the circumference of the hard magnetic member within the magnetic field produced by the hard magnetic member to form a magnetic circuit, rotation of the rotary member to change a relative position between the magnetic field and the hard magnetic member causes a magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit to change, the soft magnetic member having gaps formed therein at an interval of approximately 90°, and (c) a magnetic flux density measuring sensor including a first and a second sensor element respectively disposed in two of the gaps adjacent in the circumferential direction of the soft magnetic member, the first and second sensor elements working to measure magnetic flux densities within the two gaps and produce electric signals indicative thereof; and (B) an angular position computing circuit working to computing an angular position of the rotary member based on the electric signals produced by the magnetic flux density measuring sensor. Specifically, the densities of magnetic flux produced in the gaps are 90° out of phase with each other, so that outputs of the first and second sensor elements will also be 90° out of phase with each other, thereby enabling the angular position computing circuit to determine the angular position of the rotary member in a full angular range.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The angular position computing circuit is designed to combine the electric signals to determine the angular position of the rotary member within the full angular range.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The angular position computing circuit is designed to perform at least one of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on the electric signals provided by the magnetic flux density measuring sensor, thus resulting in a decrease in operation load on the angular position computing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The rotary member may be a steering shaft connected to a steering wheel of an automotive vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the third aspect of the invention, there is provided an angular position determining apparatus which comprises: (a) a ring-shaped hard magnetic member connected to a rotary member, the hard magnetic member including a first magnetic pole and a second magnetic pole different in polarity from the first magnetic pole, the first and second magnetic poles being jointed at ends thereof at locations 180° apart from each other in a circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member, the hard magnetic member being so designed as to create magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within a given angular range in a circumferential direction thereof; (b) a soft magnetic member disposed outside a circumference of the hard magnetic member having formed therein gaps arrayed at an interval of approximately 90°, rotation of the rotary member to change a relative position between the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member causes a magnetic flux density in the gaps to change; (c) magnetic flux density measuring sensors disposed one in each of two of the gaps adjacent in a direction of array of the gaps, the magnetic flux density measuring sensors working to magnetic flux densities within the two gaps and produce electric signals indicative thereof which exhibit substantially triangular waves shifted 90° apart in phase from each other and each of which has a straight portion; and (d) an angular position computing circuit working to combine and correct the straight portions of the triangular waves to form a substantially single straight line. The angular position computing circuit computes an angular position of the rotary member using the straight line. This structure serves to provide outputs of the magnetic density measuring sensors which are higher in linearity as a function of a change in angular position of the rotary member. The above combination and correction minimizes an error in determining the angular position of the rotary member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electric signals produced by the magnetic flux density measuring sensors are voltage signals whose level change as a function of the angular position of the rotary member. The correction of the straight portions of the triangular waves is achieved in the angular position computing circuit by extracting segments from the straight portions each of which extends over one of preselected angular ranges of rotation of the rotary member, bringing signs of inclinations of the segments into agreement with each other, moving the segments in parallel to bring a voltage level of an end of each of the segments into agreement with that of an end of an adjacent one of the segments, and joining the moved segments to produce a single voltage-to-angle line, defining a straight voltage-to-angle line extending between a maximum voltage level and a minimum voltage level indicated by the single voltage-to-angle line, determining a middle voltage level intermediate between the straight voltage-to-angle line, determining a voltage correction value required to bring the middle voltage level into agreement with an ideal one, and determining an inclination correction value required to bring an inclination of the straight voltage-to-angle line into agreement with an ideal one.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors may be designed to correct the electric signal so as to compensate for an error arising from an ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors may be equipped with a temperature-to-correction value map. Each of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors works to pick up a correction value from the temperature-to-correction value map which corresponds to the ambient temperature and correct the electric signal using the correction value.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The angular position computing circuit may store therein an ideal maximum voltage level and an ideal minimum voltage level of the electric signals, determine a first difference between an actual maximum voltage level of the electric signals and the ideal maximum voltage level and a second difference between an actual minimum voltage level and the ideal minimum voltage level, and correct the actual maximum and minimum voltage levels using the first and second differences. Usually, the amount of magnetic flux produced by the hard magnetic, member decreases gradually with a rise in ambient temperature, thus resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density to be measured by the magnetic flux density measuring sensors. This will cause the voltage levels of outputs of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors to drop. In order to eliminate this problem, the angular position computing circuit is designed to compensate for the drops in voltage levels of the outputs from the magnetic flux density measuring sensors in the above manner.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like parts in several views, particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>), there is shown an angular position detector <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The angular position detector <b>1</b> consists essentially of an angular position sensor installed on an outer periphery of a rotary shaft <b>2</b> and an angular position computing circuit <b>6</b>. The angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> is designed to determine an angular position of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> using an output of the angular position sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The angular position sensor includes a magnet <b>3</b> made of a hard magnetic material, a yoke <b>4</b> made of a soft magnetic material, and a magnetic sensor <b>5</b> working to measure the density of magnetic flux.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The magnet <b>3</b> is of a ring-shape and affixed to the outer periphery of the rotary shaft <b>2</b>. The magnet <b>3</b> is made up of two semicircular parts: one having an N-pole <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and the other having an S-pole <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>are joined integrally at ends thereof at locations 180° far away from each other. The magnet <b>3</b> has a thickness h, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which decreases gradually from interfaces <b>3</b><i>c </i>between the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>to circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The yoke <b>4</b> is of an annular shape and made up of four segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>b </i>(will also be referred to as a first, a second, a third, and a fourth yoke segment below) which are arrayed in a circle around the periphery of the magnet <b>3</b> through air gaps <b>41</b> located at approximately 90° away from each other. The yoke <b>4</b> has a thickness, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), greater than that of the magnet <b>3</b>. The circumferential center line of the yoke <b>4</b> (i.e., a line extending through the middle of the thickness of the yoke <b>4</b>) coincides with that of the magnet <b>3</b> over the entire circumference thereof. In other words, the magnet <b>3</b> and the yoke <b>4</b> are so disposed that a plane defined on the circumferential center line of the magnet <b>3</b> in a thickness-wise direction thereof coincides with that defined on the circumferential center line of the yoke <b>4</b> in a thickness-wise direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The magnetic sensor <b>5</b> is made up of a first sensor element <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a second sensor element <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The first sensor element <b>5</b><i>a </i>is disposed within the gap <b>41</b> between the first and fourth yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The second sensor element <b>5</b><i>b </i>is disposed within the gap <b>41</b> between the first and second yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The first and second elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>work to measure magnetic flux developed in the gaps <b>41</b> as indicating the density of magnetic flux, respectively. The first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are separate from the yoke <b>4</b> and each implemented by, for example, a Hall sensor, a Hall IC, or a magneto-resistive device which works to output an electric signal (e.g., a voltage signal) as a function of the density of magnetic flux within the gap <b>41</b> to the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> works to determine an angular position (i.e., an absolute angle) of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> using the electric signals outputted from the first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> combines or links the outputs of the first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>together to determine the angular position of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> over 90°.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The density of magnetic flux generated by the magnet <b>3</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The thickness h of the magnet <b>3</b>, as described above, decreases from the interfaces <b>3</b><i>c </i>between the ends of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the ends of the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>to the circumferential centers thereof, so that the thickness of the circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>is smaller than that of the interfaces <b>3</b><i>c</i>. Specifically, an area of a peripheral surface around the circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the magnet <b>3</b> is smaller than that when the thickness h is constant over the entire circumference of the magnet. In other words, the amount of magnetic flux produced in the radius direction of the magnet <b>3</b> from the circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>which are the greatest in magnetic flux density is decreased. This causes a total amount of magnetic flux to be almost uniform around the circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the magnet <b>3</b>. Rotation of the magnet <b>3</b> (i.e., the rotary shaft <b>2</b>) will cause the amount of magnetic flux flowing through each of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the magnetic sensor <b>5</b> to change cyclically in the form of a wave, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>). The amount of magnetic flux within a range X (i.e., around the circumferential center of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a</i>) is substantially identical with that within a range Y (around the circumferential center of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A decrease in thickness h of the magnet <b>3</b> from the interfaces <b>3</b><i>c </i>between the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>is so selected that the amount of magnetic flux created from around each of the circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>is substantially constant.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A change in magnetic flux density as measured by the magnetic sensor <b>5</b> when the rotary shaft <b>2</b> rotates in a circumferential direction thereof will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>4</b>(<i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the rotary shaft <b>2</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), at an angular position I of zero (0°), no magnetic flux flows through the gap <b>41</b> between the first and fourth yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, so that the magnetic flux density shows zero (0), while a maximum magnetic flux density of a negative polarity is developed in the gap <b>41</b> between the first and second yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>output voltage signals having levels on a broken line I, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the rotary shaft <b>2</b> rotates 90° in a clockwise direction from the angular position I to an angular position II, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>), it causes a maximum magnetic flux density of a positive polarity to be developed in the gap <b>41</b> between the first and fourth yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>d</i>, while no magnetic flux flows through the gap <b>41</b> between the first and second yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>output voltage signals having levels on a broken line II, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the rotary shaft <b>2</b> further rotates 90° in the clockwise direction from the angular position II to an angular position III, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>), it causes a maximum magnetic flux density of the positive polarity to be developed in the gap <b>41</b> between the first and second yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>output voltage signals having levels on a broken line III, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The amount of magnetic flux flowing from around each of the circumferential centers of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>is, as described above, substantially constant, thus causing the magnetic flux density within the gaps <b>41</b> between the first and fourth yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>d </i>and between the first and second yoke segments <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>during rotation of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> to change at a constant rate, so that the first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>output the voltage signals, as indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the output voltage Vout of the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b>, as derived in the above operations, which changes at a constant rate over a 360° angular range (i.e., −180° to +180°) of the rotary shaft <b>2</b>. Specifically, the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> works to output an absolute angular position of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> over the full angular range thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The structure of the angular position detector <b>1</b> of this embodiment, as apparent from the above discussion, offers the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The thickness h of the magnet <b>3</b> is so selected as to decrease from the interfaces <b>3</b><i>c </i>between the ends of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the ends of the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>to the circumferential centers thereof, so that the area of the peripheral surface around the circumferential center of each of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>will be the smallest. This causes the density of magnetic flux flowing out of the peripheral surface around the circumferential center of each of the N-pole <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the S-pole <b>3</b><i>b </i>to be constant, so that the amount of magnetic flux within the gaps <b>41</b> during rotation of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> changes at substantially a constant rate. Specifically, each of the first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>works to output a voltage signal as a function of the magnetic flux density within the gap <b>41</b> which exhibits higher linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The magnet <b>3</b> is so designed as to produce the magnetic flux in the radius direction thereof which changes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), in the form of a rectangular wave, thereby causing the magnetic sensor <b>5</b> to sense the magnetic flux density which changes in the form of substantially a triangle wave. This allows the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> to determine the angular position of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> correctly using simple operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division operation or a combination thereof without performing high load operations such as trigonometric function operations.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The yoke <b>4</b> has a thickness, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), greater than that of the magnet <b>3</b>. The circumferential center line of the yoke <b>4</b> coincides with that of the magnet <b>3</b> over the entire circumference thereof. This structure allows the rotary shaft <b>2</b> to which the magnet <b>3</b> is affixed to be shifted in the lengthwise direction thereof within a range where the magnet <b>3</b> lies inside opposed end surfaces of the yoke <b>4</b> (i.e., upper and lower end surfaces, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (<i>a</i>)) in the lengthwise direction of the rotary shaft <b>2</b>, thereby decreasing the amount of magnetic flux leaking outside the yoke <b>4</b>, that is, a change in magnetic flux density to be measured by the magnetic sensor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> is designed to combine electric signals outputted from the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the magnetic sensor <b>5</b>, thereby enabling an angular position indicative analog signal over a range of 90° or more to be produced.</p>

The formation of the recesses <b>42</b> may be achieved by grinding.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The structure of this embodiment facilitates ease of positioning of the yoke <b>4</b> around the magnet <b>3</b> and results in a decrease in parts making up the angular position sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The grinding of the yoke <b>4</b> to form the recesses <b>42</b> serves to minimize a shift in location of the gaps <b>41</b> in the circumferential direction of the yoke <b>4</b> and/or an error in dimension of the recesses <b>42</b> or the gaps <b>41</b> in the circumferential direction of the yoke <b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The magnetic sensor <b>5</b>, as clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>), has terminals which extend in parallel to the length of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> and connect with the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b>.

In other words, the straight segment Lb<b>1</b> is moved while keeping an inclination thereof as it is to bring the voltage P<b>11</b> into agreement in level with the voltage P<b>10</b> of the straight segment La<b>3</b>. Similarly, the straight segment La<b>1</b> is moved in parallel to bring the voltage P<b>13</b> thereof into agreement with the voltage P<b>12</b> of the parallel-moved straight segment Lb<b>1</b>. The straight segment Lb<b>2</b> is moved in parallel to bring the voltage P<b>15</b> thereof into agreement with the voltage P<b>14</b> of the parallel-moved straight segment La<b>1</b>. Finally, the straight segment La<b>2</b> is moved in parallel to bring the voltage P<b>17</b> thereof into agreement with the voltage P<b>16</b> of the parallel-moved straight segment Lb<b>2</b>. This makes a single line. The voltage P<b>18</b> at the end of the straight segment La<b>2</b> after moved parallel is illustrated as a maximum voltage P<b>18</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. For ease of visibility, the maximum voltage P<b>18</b><i>a </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> as being much higher than 4.5V.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, a straight line LH is defined, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, which extends between the minimum voltage P<b>9</b> and the maximum voltage P<b>1</b> <b>8</b><i>a </i>at the parallel-moved straight segment La<b>2</b>. A middle voltage value VM between the value VH of the maximum voltage P<b>1</b> <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the value VL of the minimum voltage P<b>9</b> is determined using the following equation.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>VM</i>=(<i>VH+VL</i>)/2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Afterwards, the routine proceeds to step <b>103</b>. The middle voltage value VM is not always identical with a middle voltage value 2.5V on the ideal straight line VI, as indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>. Thus, a middle voltage correcting value Vofs is determined in accordance with an equation below to correct the middle voltage value VM to 2.5V.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Vofs=<i>VM−</i>2.5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The routine proceeds to step <b>104</b>. The inclination K of the line LH extending between the maximum and minimum voltages P<b>9</b> and P<b>1</b> <b>8</b><i>a </i>is not always identical with an inclination of the ideal line Vl. Thus, an inclination correcting value Kf is determined in accordance with an equation below to bring the inclination K into agreement with that of the ideal line Vl.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Kf=</i>4/(<i>VH−Vl</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The routine proceeds to step <b>104</b> wherein an actual output voltage Vj of the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> is corrected in accordance with an equation below using the middle voltage correcting value Vofs and the inclination correcting value Kf to produce an output voltage Vout′.

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Vout′=(<i>Vj−</i>2.5+Vofs)×<i>Kf+</i>2.5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The above correction works to bring the output voltage Vout′ of the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> nearly into agreement with an ideal output voltage. Specifically, the line made up of the straight segments La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b>, La<b>3</b>, Lb<b>1</b>, and Lb<b>2</b> in the parallel-moving operation in step <b>102</b> is corrected, as indicated by a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, to almost overlap the ideal line Vl made up of segments VaL<b>1</b>, VaL<b>2</b>, VaL<b>3</b>, VbL<b>1</b>, and VbL<b>2</b>. An output voltage range of the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> is also adjusted to an ideal output voltage range of 0.5V to 4.5V. The above operations enable the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> to work to measure an absolute angular position of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> over a full range of 360° with minimum errors.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As apparent from the above discussion, correction values used to connect the straight segments La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b>, La<b>3</b>, Lb<b>1</b>, and Lb<b>2</b> at the joints P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, and P<b>4</b> in the parallel-moving operation in step <b>102</b> are different from each other, thus resulting in an increased operation load on the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b>. Usually, a steering wheel of automotive vehicles stays at a neutral position (angular position of zero (0°)) for the longest period of time. Therefore, in a case where the angular position detector <b>1</b> is installed in the automotive electric power steering device <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a decrease in number of operations to determine the joints P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, and P<b>4</b>, in other words, a decrease in operation load on the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> is accomplished by setting angular positions of the joints P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, and P<b>4</b> to any angular positions other than the neutral position of the steering wheel. The setting of the angular positions of the joints P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, and P<b>4</b> to any angular positions other than the neutral position of the steering wheel is achieved by moving the magnet <b>3</b> in a circumferential direction of the rotary shaft <b>2</b> (i.e., the steering shaft) upon installation on the rotary shaft <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, are unchanged. A further decrease in operation load on the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> may be achieved by rotating the steering wheel over 360° one time in either of clockwise and counterclockwise directions to determine the middle voltage correcting value Vofs and the inclination correcting value Kf as fixed initial values.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The angular position detector <b>1</b> of the eighth embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> demonstrates actual and ideal periodic waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the magnetic sensor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Usually, the amount of magnetic flux produced by the magnet <b>3</b> decreases gradually with a rise in ambient temperature, thus resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density to be measured by the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. This will cause the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>to drop. In order to eliminate this problem, the angular position detector <b>1</b> of this embodiment is designed to compensate for the drops in output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>arising from a rise in ambient temperature. This compensation will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, broken lines Vam and Vbm represent the ideal waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb, respectively. Solid lines Vaj and Vbj represent the actual waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The magnetic sensor <b>5</b> is equipped with a temperature sensor (not shown) which works to measure the temperature around the magnetic sensor <b>5</b>. Some of available Hall sensors are equipped with a temperature compensating function. The first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>of this embodiment are each implemented by the Hall sensor. Specifically, the first and second sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>have installed therein a temperature-to-correction value map for use in brining the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm, respectively. The temperature-to-correction value map is preselected in terms of type of the magnet <b>3</b> and/or the amount of magnetic flux generated by the magnet <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Specifically, the magnetic sensor <b>5</b> monitors the ambient temperature, selects correction values from the temperature-to-correction value maps, and corrects the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm, respectively, thereby compensating for the drops in output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>due to a temperature characteristic of the magnet <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Instead of compensating for the drops in output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>in themselves, the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> may be designed to perform operations, as discussed below, to bring the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm, respectively. Specifically, maximum values Vammax and Vbmmax and minimum values Vammin and Vbmmin of the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm are prestored in the angular position computing circuit <b>6</b>. The angular position computing circuit <b>6</b> calculates differences Hmax between a maximum value Vajmax of the actual output voltage Vaj and Vammax and between a maximum value Vbjmax of the actual output voltage Vbj and between Vbmmax and differences Hmin between a minimum value Vajmin of the actual output voltage Vaj and Vammin and between a minimum value Vbjmin of the actual output voltage Vbj and Vbmmin and corrects the maximum values Vajmax and Vbjmax and the minimum values Vajmin and Vbjmin of the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj using the differences Hmax and Hmin so as to bring the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The magnet <b>3</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>), has a circular inner periphery and an oval outer periphery.
