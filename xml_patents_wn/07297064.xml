<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to improvements in torsional vibration dampers of the type wherein two coaxial rotary components are turnable relative to each other against the opposition of one or more one-piece or composite coil springs. Torsional vibration dampers of such character can be utilized with advantage in the power trains of motor vehicles, e.g., they can constitute composite flywheel assemblies between the output shafts of prime movers (such as the crankshafts or camshafts of internal combustion engines) and the housings or pressure plates of friction clutches, or composite clutch discs (also called clutch plates) in the friction clutches which operate between the prime movers and the change-speed transmissions of motor vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A torsional vibration damper which embodies one or more features of the present invention is disclosed, for example, in published German patent application No. 199 12 970 A1. This publication discloses a damper wherein the means for yieldably opposing rotation of at least one component: of two coaxial rotary components comprises an elongated arcuate compression coil spring having two end coils or convolutions and a plurality of intermediate coils or convolutions (hereinafter, such constituents of the coil spring will be referred to as convolutions). The intermediate convolutions include a first set having first outer diameters and at least one additional set having different second outer diameters. The two coaxial rotary components of the torsional vibration damper embodying the just described coil spring are flywheels in the form of shells together forming a housing which defines an elongated arcuate chamber for the coil spring. Each shell has a retainer which is confined in the chamber, and each end convolution of the coil spring abuts a different one of the two retainers so that the spring opposes angular movements of the retainers toward each other but urges such retainers away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A drawback of the just described conventional torsional vibration damper is that, when the two components are driven to rotate jointly at a high speed, the intermediate convolutions of the coil spring move or tend to move radially outwardly under the action of centrifugal force and come into pronounced frictional engagement with the internal surfaces which surround the arcuate chamber being defined by the two components. Such frictional engagement between the intermediate convolutions of the coil spring and the adjacent portions of the two components is undesirable on several grounds. For example, the internal surfaces of the two components and the surfaces of the radially outermost portions of the intermediate convolutions of the coil spring undergo pronounced wear and generate heat which must be dissipated, often at a high cost involving time and/or material, e.g., due to the need for the use of expensive materials for the components and/or due to the need for the application of highly wear-resistant coatings or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference may also be had to commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,386 (granted Nov. 9, 1999 to Friedmann et al. and disclosing a torsional vibration damper between a rotary output element of a prime mover and a friction clutch), U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,106 (granted Jun. 2, 1998 to Reik et al. and disclosing a different torsional vibration damper between a rotary output element of an engine and the rotary input element of a friction clutch), U.S. Pat. No. 5,632,365 (granted May 27, 1997 to Maucher and disclosing a clutch disc embodying a torsional vibration damper between a set of friction linings (which are flanked by and receive torque from the pressure plate and the counterpressure plate of a friction clutch) and the input shaft of the change-speed transmission), as well as U.S. Pat. No. 5,161,660 (granted Nov. 10, 1992 to Huber and disclosing a clutch plate or clutch disc with several discrete coil springs operating between two constituents of torque transmitting means installed between the flywheels and the engine on the one hand, and the input element of the change-speed transmission on the other hand). The disclosure of each of the aforementioned U.S. patents is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to reduce, preferably to zero or close to zero, friction between the compression coil spring or springs and the surfaces bounding the chamber defined by those components of a torsion vibration damper which can turn relative to each other by overcoming the resistance of the coil spring or springs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the invention is to provide a torsional vibration damper which can offer a highly predictable resistance to turning of the two coaxial components of the damper relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object of our invention is to provide a torsional vibration damper whose operation is not or need not be influenced by centrifugal force, or is influenced less than the operation of conventional torsional vibration dampers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An additional object of the invention is to provide a torsional vibration damper which generates less noise than conventional dampers employing one or more compression coil springs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a relatively simple, compact and inexpensive torsional vibration damper which can be put to use under all or nearly all circumstances involving the damping of torsional vibrations, e.g., in the power trains of motor vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further object of the invention is to provide a novel and improved method of reducing wear upon the constituents of torsional vibration dampers which employ coil springs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of our invention is to provide a novel and improved method of reducing noise being generated by torsional vibration dampers employing one or more coil springs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An additional object of the instant invention is to provide a novel and improved method of enhancing the damping action of torsional vibration dampers which utilize coil springs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still another object of this invention is to provide novel and improved coil springs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further object of the invention is to provide novel and improved coil springs which can be utilized with advantage in existing types of torsional vibration dampers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide a power train for use in motor vehicles which employs one or more torsional vibration dampers of the above outlined character.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An additional object of our present invention is to provide a novel and improved friction clutch for use in the power trains of motor vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another object of this invention is to provide novel and improved means for guiding the coil spring or springs in the chamber of a torsional vibration damper.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One feature of the present invention resides in the provision of a torsional vibration damper, e.g., for use in the power train of a motor vehicle, which comprises a first component turnable about a predetermined axis, a second component also turnable about such (common) axis with and relative to the first component, and at least one elongated (straight or arcuate, such as part circular) coil spring which is interposed between the components and is arranged to oppose turning of such components relative to each other. The at least one coil spring has a first end portion bearing (directly or indirectly) upon a retainer or stop of one of the components, a second end portion reacting against a retainer or stop of the other component, and a third portion which is interposed between the end portions or sections and may but need not always have a diameter larger or smaller from that or from those of the first end portion or of both end portions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first and second components form parts of or constitute a housing for the at least one elongated coil spring and can constitute or form part of discrete flywheels of a composite flywheel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another presently preferred feature of our invention resides in the provision of a torsional vibration damper which comprises a first component turnable about a predetermined axis, a second component turnable about the predetermined axis with and relative to the first component, and at least one arcuate coil spring which is interposed between the two components and serves to prevent them from turning relative to each other, either clockwise or anticlockwise. The at least one coil spring bears upon a first retainer or stop which is turnable with (e.g., which forms part of) the first component, reacts (directly or indirectly) against a second retainer which is turnable with and can form part of the second component, has a constant inner radius, and comprises convolutions including at least one first set of convolutions having first outer diameters and at least one second set of convolutions having second outer diameters greater than the first outer diameters. The transmission of force between the at least one coil spring and the second retainer can take place directly or indirectly, the same as the transmission of force between the at least one coil spring and the first retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first and second components of the just described embodiment of the improved torsional vibration damper can but need not constitute discrete flywheels of a composite flywheel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The convolutions of the at least one first set can include two end convolutions and at least one intermediate convolutions The outer diameters of the end convolutions are or can be greater than the outer diameter of the at laast one intermediate convolution.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with a modification of the just outlined embodiment, the coil spring comprises two end convolutions and a plurality of intermediate convolutions. The outer diameters of convolutions of the at least one first set decrease from the outer convolutions toward at least one median or central convolution of the plurality of intermediate convolutions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At least one of the two components has an internal surface which defines an arcuate chamber for the at least one coil spring, i.e., such chamber may but need not be bounded by one of the components or by both components. The convolutions of the at least one first set are spaced apart from the internal surface, and the convolutions of the at least one second set of convolutions are or can be nearer to the internal surface than the convolutions of the at least one first set. In fact, the convolutions of the at least one second set are or can be in sliding contact with the internal surface. Such damper can further comprise at least one friction reducing slide which is disposed in the chamber between the internal surface and the convolutions of the at least one first set. The slide is or can be mounted in such a way that it is movable relative to the components of the torsional vibration damper and that it surrounds the convolutions of the at least one first set. Such slide can include a cylinder having an at least substantially smooth outer surface and an inner surface which is adjacent the convolutions of the at least one first set of convolutions. The inner and outer surfaces can extend along an arc of less than 360 degrees (as seen circumferentially of the convolutions of the at least one first set. Furthermore, at least a portion of the at least one slide can consist of a plastic material. In accordance with one presently preferred embodiment, the at least one slide partially surrounds the convolutions of the at least one set and extends along an arc of in excess of 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees, as seen circumferentially of the convolutions of the at least one first set.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The convolutions of the at least one first set can include at least one convolution having a radially outer portion which is anchored in the at least one slide for joint movement in the chamber. The inner surface of such slide can be provided with a groove for the radially outer portion of the at least one convolution of the at least one first set. The outer diameter of the at least one convolution of the at least one first set of convolutions can be greater than that of each other covolution of the at least one first set of convolutions, and the radially outermost portion of the at least one convolution can be snugly received in the groove of the at least one slide.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The convolutions of the at least one first set can further include two additional convolutions which flank and lie flush against the at least one convolution.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The at least one first set of convolutions can be disposed at one end of the at least one coil spring, and such damper can further include a slide element which abuts the first retainer and surrounds the convolutions of the at least one first set. The slide element can be installed and arranged to share the movements of the first component and can be in sliding contact with the second component. The internal surface of at least one of the first and second components of the damper can define the aforementioned arcuate chamber for the at least one coil spring, and the slide element can include a substantially disc-shaped base which is disposed between the first retainer and one convolution of the at least one first set. The slide element can further include a part cylindrical portion which is disposed between at least one convolution of the at least one first set of convolutions and the internal surface. The inner surface of the part cylindrical portion of the slide element can include an at least substantially conical portion which tapers toward the base of the slide element and surrounds the at least one convolution of the at least one first set. The base of the slide element can be provided with an at least substantially flat surface which is adjacent the first retainer. Alternatively, the base of the slide element and the first retainer can be provided with surfaces including portions which abut each other and are remotest from the common axis of the two components of such damper. The base of the slide element and the first retainer can be respectively provided with first and second surfaces which are adjacent each other and include abutting portions which are remotest from the common axis of the two components.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The base of the slide element can overlie a portion of the adjacent convolution of the at least one first set of convolutions, and the first component of the damper can be provided with at least one projection which abuts the adjacent convolution. The projection can include a stepped portion of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The improved damper can further comprise an elastic bumper which is interposed between at least one of the retainers and the adjacent convolution of the at least one spring. The bumper can resemble or constitute a cylinder or a sphere. The width of the bumper (as measured radially of the common axis of the two components, can equal or approximate the outer diameter of the adjacent convolution of the at least one spring. It is also possible to dimension and configurate the bumper in such a way that it extends into that convolution of the at least one spring which is adjacent the one retainer. The latter can be provided with a protuberance which abuts the bumper and can extend into the adjacent convolution or convolutions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still another feature of the invention resides in the provision of a torsional vibration damper which comprises a first component turnable about a predetermined axis, a second component which is turnable about the predetermined axis with and relative to the first component, and a composite arcuate coil spring which is interposed between the two components and is arranged to oppose turning of the components relative to each other. The composite spring comprises series-connected first and second coil springs. A first end of the first spring bears upon a first retainer which is provided on the first component of the damper, and a first end of the second spring reacts against a second retainer which is provided on the second component. The second ends of the first and second springs are adjacent each other and include first convolutions having first outer diameters. Each of the first and second springs further includes second convolutions having second outer diameters greater than the first outer diameters. The damper further comprises a slide which is disposed at the second ends of the first and second springs and is movable with the second ends of the first and second springs while being maintained in sliding engagement with the two components.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The slide can include a substantially disc-shaped first portion which is disposed between the second ends of the first and second springs, and a substantially hollow cylindrical portion which at least partially surrounds at least one first convolution of each of the first and second springs. As already mentioned hereinbefore, at least one of the two components of the damper can be provided with an arcuate internal surface which defines a chamber for the first and second springs and for the slide, and the external surface of the second portion of the slide is slidable along the internal surface of the at least one component.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The just discussed damper can further comprise first and second slide elements each disposed between the first end of a different one of the first and second coil springs and the respective retainer and being in sliding engagement with one of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An additional feature of the present invention resides in the provision of a novel and improved article of manufacture, namely a coil spring of finite length for use, for example, in a torsional vibration damper. The improved spring has a plurality of convolutions including at least one first set having first diameters and at least one second set having second diameters greater than the first diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The improved coil spring can comprise two sets of first convolutions, and the at least one second set of convolutions can be disposed between the two sets of first convolutions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, the coil spring can include two sets of second convolutions and one set of first convolutions between the two second sets.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with a further modification, the convolutions of the at least one first set can include a plurality of neighboring convolutions having different diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">All of the convolutions can form an arc having a constant inner radius. Such convolutions can include a plurality of first sets and a plurality of second sets which alternate with the first sets.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The novel features which are considered as characteristic of the invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The improved torsional vibration damper and the improved coil spring, however, both as to their construction and the modes of making, assembling and utilizing the same, together with numerous additional important and advantageous features and attributes thereof, will be best understood upon perusal of the following detailed description of certain presently preferred specific embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawing.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown a torsional vibration damper <b>1</b> which is a composite flywheel and is assumed to be mounted in the power train of a motor vehicle including a prime mover, such as an internal combustion engine having a rotary output element (e.g., a camshaft or a crankshaft) serving to drive a first rotary component <b>2</b> (primary flywheel) of the damper <b>1</b>. The output element of the prime mover is affixed to the component <b>2</b> by a set of bolts or analogous fasteners, not shown, extending through holes <b>5</b> provided in a central portion <b>26</b> of the component <b>2</b>. The illustrated central portion <b>26</b> is a hub which surrounds the input shaft (not shown) of the change-speed transmission in the power train.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The damper <b>1</b> further comprises a second rotary component (secondary flywheel) which, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, is assembled of two parts, namely a shell <b>3</b> and a washer-like part <b>20</b> riveted (at <b>19</b>) to the shell <b>3</b>. The shell <b>3</b> can constitute the counterpressure plate of an engageable and disengageable friction clutch which, when engaged, serves to transmit torque between the aforementioned output element of the prime mover and the input shaft of the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The components <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> of the damper <b>1</b> are rotatable with and relative to each other about a common axis X. An antifriction ball bearing <b>4</b> is interposed between the hub <b>26</b> of the component <b>2</b> and the radially innermost portion of the shell <b>3</b> of the secondary flywheel (second component) of the composite flywheel constituting the damper <b>1</b>. The component <b>2</b> has one or more first retainers <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> (only one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) which cooperates or cooperate with one or more retainers <b>16</b> provided on the washer-like part <b>20</b> to stress or to relax the bias of a resilient unit <b>6</b> including one, two or more arcuate coil springs <b>8</b> of finite length. One end convolution of the coil spring <b>8</b> bears upon the retainer <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the component <b>2</b> and the other end convolution of such coil spring <b>8</b> reacts against the retainer <b>16</b> of the part <b>20</b> of the composite second component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The radially outermost portion <b>24</b> of a first section <b>17</b> of the component <b>2</b> cooperates with the radially outermost portion <b>23</b> of a second section <b>18</b> of the component <b>2</b> to define an annular or arcuate chamber <b>29</b> bounded by the internal surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>21</b> of the portions <b>24</b>, <b>23</b> and receiving the coil spring or springs <b>8</b>. The radially outermost portion of the washer-like part <b>20</b> extends radially outwardly and into the chamber <b>29</b> to serve as the retainer <b>16</b> for one end convolution of the coil spring <b>8</b>. The component <b>2</b> is made of metallic sheet stock and its retainer <b>14</b>,<b>15</b> is constituted by deformed end portions of its welded-together sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the output shaft of the engine drives the component <b>2</b>, the composite retainer <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> bears upon the adjacent end convolution of the coil spring <b>8</b> so that the latter stores energy which is necessary to transmit torque to and to turn the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b>. If the friction clutch is engaged, the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> rotates the clutch disc of the friction clutch and the clutch disc rotates the input shaft of the change-speed transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The retainer <b>16</b> can constitute a radially outwardly. extending arm of the washer-like part <b>20</b> of the second component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b>. The section <b>17</b> of the component <b>2</b> can constitute a converted (cold formed) sheet metal blank and serves to secure the component <b>2</b>, and hence the entire damper <b>1</b>, to the output shaft of the engine. The part <b>20</b> preferably also consists of sheet metal and is cold formed or otherwise deformed to exhibit the portion <b>15</b> of the composite retainer <b>14</b>,<b>15</b> of the component <b>2</b>. The deformed radially outer portions <b>24</b>, <b>23</b> of the sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> define the aforementioned annular chamber <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for the spring <b>8</b> and the retainers <b>14</b>-<b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. The chamber <b>29</b> has a toroidal shape and at least a portion thereof is preferably filled with a lubricant <b>7</b> (such as grease) for the energy storing unit <b>6</b> of the damper <b>1</b>. The portions <b>24</b>, <b>23</b> of the sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> can further serve as a guide means for the convolutions or for certain convolutions of the coil spring <b>8</b> and as a means for limiting lateral displacements of such convolutions when the spring <b>8</b> is caused to store energy as a result of angular movements of the component <b>2</b> relative to the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> and/or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At least when the engine drives the damper <b>1</b>, the convolutions of the coil spring <b>8</b> are acted upon by centrifugal force and move or tend to move radially outwardly (i.e., away from the common axis X of the components <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>20</b>) against the radially outwardly adjacent portions <b>24</b>, <b>23</b> of the sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, i.e., against the internal surfaces <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. The extent of wear upon the sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and/or upon the convolutions of the spring <b>8</b> can be reduced (even to zero) by resorting to one or more suitable inserts which are borne by the sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the component <b>2</b> and are radially outwardly adjacent the convolutions of the spring. Reference may be had, for example, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> of the aforementioned commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,386 to Friedmann et al. Such insert or inserts can be made of hardened metallic sheet material. In addition to preventing wear upon certain adjacent parts and/or to reducing wear upon certain additional parts, such insert or insrts can also serve as a means for frictionally damping undesirable stray movements of parts which are in contact therewith and which move relative to each other and/or relative to the inserts when the component <b>2</b> turns relative to the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> and/or vice versa. The magnitude or extent of frictional damping action is a function of the RPM of the damper <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a detail of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> drawn to a larger scale and turned through 90°. The arcuate coil spring <b>8</b> has a first set of smaller-diameter convolutions <b>27</b> adjacent the retainer <b>16</b> of the washer-like part <b>20</b>, i.e., of the second component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b>, a second set of convolutions <b>27</b> (not shown) adjacent the retainer <b>14</b>,<b>15</b> (also not shown) of the component <b>2</b>, and a set of convolutions <b>28</b> between the two sets of convolutions <b>27</b>. The inner radius R of the coil spring <b>8</b> is constant, i.e., all convolutions of the coil spring <b>8</b> have their innermost portions on a circle having the radius R and its center on the axis X. The ends of the set of intermediate convolutions <b>28</b> are constituted by two or more convolutions whose diameters provide gradual transitions between those of the centrally located convolutions <b>28</b> and the convolutions <b>27</b> of the two sets adjacent the retainers <b>16</b> and <b>14</b>,<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An important advantage of the aforementioned selection of the diameters of the two sets of convolutions <b>27</b> and of the one set of convolutions <b>28</b>, together with the unchanging inner radius R of the entire coil spring <b>8</b>, is that the radially outermost portions of the convolutions <b>27</b> are spaced apart from the internal surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> (only the surface <b>21</b> is identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the component <b>2</b> including the sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> by a clearance which forms part of the chamber <b>29</b> and the width of which (as seen radially of the axis X) increases gradually from the convolutions <b>28</b> toward both retainers (<b>14</b>,<b>15</b> and <b>16</b>) and is constant or nearly constant in the regions outwardly adjacent the two sets of convolutions <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The structure which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> further comprises two slide elements <b>30</b> of which only one is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The illustrated slide element <b>30</b> comprises a substantially disc-shaped base <b>31</b> between the retainer <b>16</b> and the adjacent end convolution <b>27</b>, and a part cylindrical (i.e., trough- or channel-shaped) portion <b>32</b> which surrounds or flanks the sides and the radially outermost portions of the illustrated set of convolutions <b>27</b>. The illustrated hollow part cylindrical portion <b>32</b> constitutes approximately one-half or more than one-half of a circumferentially complete cylinder (see the guide element <b>66</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The thickness of the part cylindrical portion <b>32</b> is selected in such a way that this portion fills or substantially fills the end portion of the chamber <b>29</b> which surrounds the convolutions of the set of smaller-diameter convolutions <b>27</b> adjacent the base <b>31</b> of the guide element <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The guide element <b>30</b> need not have a circumferentially complete radially inner portion because the convolutions <b>27</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> do not exhibit a tendency to move radially inwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the damper <b>1</b> is in use, the outermost smaller-diameter convolutions <b>27</b> (as seen longitudinally of the coil spring <b>8</b>) bear against the conical portions of the inner sides or surfaces of the portions <b>32</b> of slide elements <b>30</b> at both ends of the coil spring <b>8</b>. The conical portions <b>35</b> maintain the convolutions <b>27</b> out of contact with the internal surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> of the component <b>2</b> (as already stated above, only the internal surface <b>21</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as well as in many other Figures which illustrate a portion of the component <b>2</b>). The slide elements <b>30</b> even hold the convolutions <b>28</b> against radially outward movement into contact with the internal surface <b>21</b>. The slide elements <b>30</b> are preferably made of a suitable plastic material which can slide relative to the component <b>2</b> with minimal friction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As utilized in the claims, the term “coil spring” or “at least one coil spring” can denote a one-piece coil spring (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) as well as a composite coil spring with two or more discrete coil springs arranged in series (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or a composite coil spring with one coil spring confined in another (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The improved coil spring(s) can but need not always have an arcuate shape. Reference may be had, for example, to FIG. 2 of the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,161,660 to Huber. It is often of advantage to impart to the improved coil spring (such as <b>41</b> or <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) an arcuate shape prior to installation in the arcuate chamber defined by at least one of two or more relatively movable components of the housing forming part of the improved torsional vibration damper.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As already mentioned above, a coil spring which is to be utilized in the torsional vibration damper of the present invention, or a coil spring which embodies our invention irrespective of its use, can consist of a single series of integral convolutions or of two or more discrete coil springs which can be disposed in series, i.e., end-to-end. One of such plurality of discrete coil springs, or two or all springs, can be arcuate or straight, i.e., it or some or all of them can have a straight longitudinal axis or a common straight longitudinal axis. However, in their entirety, the axes of two or more discrete coil springs can form an arc or a polygon. In the latter instance, the axes of a polygonal array of plural coil springs are tangential to an arc, i.e., the axis of each straight coil spring has a point which is disposed at a predetermined radial distance from a common axis, i.e., each such distance is the same. Reference may be had again to FIG. 2 of the commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,161,660 to Huber.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An important advantage of the feature that the coil spring <b>8</b> comprises a number of convolutions <b>27</b> having relatively small diameters and that the inner radius R of the coil spring is constant is that the convolutions <b>27</b> cannot come into contact with the internal surface <b>21</b> bounding the chamber <b>29</b> except under certain infrequent circumstances, e.g., when the RPM of the damper <b>1</b> is sufficiently high to enable the centrifugal force to move the convolutions <b>27</b> radially outwardly. Such configuration of the coil spring <b>8</b> entails a reduction of hysteresis, at least in the region(s) of the smaller-diameter convolutions <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The radially outermost portions of the larger-diameter convolutions <b>28</b> can come into contact with the internal surface <b>21</b> and serve to guide the coil spring <b>8</b> at least in the radially outermost portion of the chamber <b>29</b>. It has been ascertained that, due to the provision of one but preferably more sets of smaller-diameter convolutions <b>27</b>, the overall friction between the coil spring <b>8</b> and the relatively turnable components (<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>20</b>) of the damper <b>1</b> is much lower than in dampers which employ conventional coil springs.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The configuration of the surface or surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> bounding the chamber <b>29</b> is or can be such that they can guide the coil spring <b>8</b> against excessive radially outwardly directed as well as against any or against excessive lateral movements in the direction of the axis X. This can be readily accomplished by confining at least some of the convolutions of the coil spring <b>8</b> along arcs of more than 180° (see the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the outer diameters of convolutions <b>27</b> of the set adjacent to the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> increase stepwise from convolution to convolution or in pairs or larger groups of neighboring convolutions <b>27</b> or in a direction toward the set of convolutions <b>28</b> having larger outer diameters than any of the convolutions <b>27</b>. Such coil spring can consist of two halves which are mirror images of each other with reference to a plane which includes the axis X, and the number of convolutions <b>27</b> in the set adjacent the slide element <b>30</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is or can be identical with the number of convolutions <b>27</b> at the other end of the coil spring <b>8</b>, i.e., at the non-illustrated slide element which is or which can be a mirror image of the slide element <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The coil spring <b>8</b> can extend along an arc of, e.g., 180°, 60°, 90°, 120° or another arc. For example, the four coil springs three of which are shown in FIG. 12 of the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,386 to Friedmann et al. extend along arcs of somewhat less than 90°; such damper comprises eight slides because each of the coil springs consists or is assumed to consist of a single set of coherent convolutions having identical outer diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The outer diameters of the convolutions <b>27</b> of the left-hand set forming part of the coil spring <b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> increase gradually (i.e., without pronounced changes from convolution to convolution) all the way from the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> to the first larger-diameter convolution <b>28</b>, and such transition can continue beyond the portion <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b>. Alternatively, and as will be described, for example, with reference to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the outer diameters of convolutions (such as those denoted by reference characters <b>65</b><i>a</i>) can increase from the median convolution(s) toward both ends of the set or sets consisting of such convolutions. This can take place at one end, at both ends, in the median portion or in two or more inner portions of a coil spring. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a coil spring <b>64</b> which is assumed to have at least two (as actually shown) intermediate sets of smaller-diameter convolutions <b>65</b><i>a </i>and two additional sets (not shown) at both ends of the coil spring <b>64</b>. The two sets of convolutions <b>65</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> resemble the median portions of hourglasses and each set of convolutions <b>65</b> resembles the top portion or the bottom portion of the hourglass. A smooth transition between a set of convolutions <b>65</b><i>a </i>and each adjacent set of convolutions <b>65</b> has been found to contribute significantly to the advantages of such coil spring over those known in the art. For example, a coil spring of such character does not buckle or is less likely to buckle or break in actual use, such as in a torsional vibration damper.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The slide element or elements <b>30</b>, as well as the slides, slide elements and/or bumpers to be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref>, exhibits or exhibit the important advantage that each thereof further reduces the likelihood, or eliminates the possibility, of wear upon each convolution which is prevented from coming in actual contact with one or more parts of the components (housing) of the improved torsional vibration damper. In fact, a slide, a slide element or a bumper can prevent wear upon convolutions which are not actually overlapped by one or more portions of a slide element or the like, such as by the part <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, because such convolution(s) is or are prevented from reaching the surface <b>21</b> even when the coil spring <b>8</b> is rotated at a very high speed so that it is subjected to the action of a very pronounced centrifugal force.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The configuration of the internal surface of the slide element <b>30</b> is preferably complementary to that of the adjacent set of convolutions <b>27</b>; such internal surface is a partly cylindrical surface and the part <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> can be said to constitute a trough which overlies the adjacent convolutions <b>27</b> and is located between such convolutions and the internal surface. The external surfaces of the base <b>31</b> and the part <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> are preferably smooth. Conformance of the inner side or surface of the part <b>32</b> to the adjacent side of the set of convolutions <b>27</b> greatly reduces the extent or eliminates the possibility of relative movement between the part <b>32</b> and the adjacent convolutions <b>27</b>. The feature that the outer side of the part <b>32</b> is smooth reduces the likelihood of pronounced friction between such outer side and the internal surface <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As already explained hereinabove, the part <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> can overlie the adjacent convolutions along an arc of between 180′ and 360°. However, it is sufficient (at least under certain circumstances) to employ a slide element having a part <b>32</b> which overlies the adjacent convolutions along an arc of not more than 90°. An advantage of slide elements having portions <b>32</b> extending along arcs of more than 180° is that such slide elements can be deformed for the purpose of surrounding more than one-half of each adjacent convolution <b>27</b> to be thereupon released so as to engage one or more convolutions <b>27</b> by snap action. This is advisable because such engagement of a slide element <b>30</b> with the adjacent convolution(s) <b>27</b> reduces the likelihood of accidental (unintentional) separation of the slide element <b>30</b> from the coil spring <b>8</b>. Furthermore, the slide element <b>30</b> can be caused to properly engage the adjacent convolution(s) <b>27</b> before the coil spring <b>8</b> is inserted into the chamber <b>29</b>, preferably in a prebent condition so that its curvature is the same as that of the chamber <b>29</b>. Such mounting of the slide element <b>30</b> on the convolutions <b>27</b> prior to insertion of the coil spring <b>8</b> into the arcuate chamber <b>29</b> greatly simplifies the assembly of the damper <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The slide element <b>30</b> can be made of a suitable plastic material, preferably of a material which exhibits sufficient resiliency to permit convenient temporary expansion of the part <b>32</b> in order to enable a person or an automaton to assemble the temporarily expanded part <b>32</b> with a set of convolutions <b>27</b>, i.e., with a spring <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The utilization of an elastically expandible slide element is of particular advantage if such slide element or a functional equivalent thereof is to be mounted on an intermediate portion of the coil spring (see, for example, the modified slide element <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or the pairs of slides <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> and <b>73</b>, <b>74</b> respectively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref> and <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An advantage of plastic slides and slide elements is that they can be mass produced (e.g., in an injection molding machine) at a small fraction of the cost of metallic slides or slide elements. The elasticity of such slides or slide elements need not be very pronounced because the elasticity of the convolutions <b>27</b> also contributes to convenient snapping of the preferably resilient and preferably plastic slide element <b>30</b> onto the selected set of convolutions <b>27</b>. In fact, the elasticity of the convolutions <b>27</b> can suffice to properly couple such convolutions to a rigid or practically rigid slide or slide element (such as the element <b>30</b>) if the part <b>32</b> does not extend along an arc greatly exceeding 180°.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">An additional advantage of the slide element <b>30</b> is that it permits the convolutions <b>27</b> to move toward and/or away from each other under circumstances (such as at a certain RPM of the damper <b>1</b>) which prevent the larger-diameter convolutions <b>28</b> to slide or simply move along the internal surface <b>21</b> of the component <b>2</b>. This improves the operation of the coil spring <b>8</b> when the damper <b>1</b> is caused to act in opposite directions (i.e., when at least one of the components <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> is caused to repeatedly turn clockwise as well as counterclockwise relative to the other component.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The conical portion <b>35</b> of the inner side or surface of the part <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> contributes to more satisfactory operation of the damper <b>1</b> in that it urges at least the outermost convolution <b>27</b> (i.e., that which is nearest to the base <b>31</b>) radially inwardly toward the axis X. This, in turn, maintains the remaining convolutions <b>27</b> of the set of such convolutions out of contact with the radially outermost portion of the inner side or surface of the part <b>32</b> and hence also away from the internal surface <b>21</b>. Such situation prevails even if the damper is caused to rotate about the axis X at a high or very high speed, i.e., when the convolutions <b>27</b> are subjected to the action of pronounced centrifugal forces.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The feature that the exposed side or surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is flat or predominantly or substantially flat and parallel to the adjacent surface of the retainer <b>16</b> exhibits the advantage that the retainer can transmit force to the slide element <b>30</b> (and hence to the respective end of the coil spring <b>8</b>) in a highly predictable fashion. As already mentioned hereinbefore, the slide element at the other end of the coil spring <b>8</b> and such other end of the spring <b>8</b> are or can be mirror images of those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Unless otherwise stated, this also applies for the slides, slide elements and bumpers as well as end portions of coil springs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is parallel to the adjacent surface of the retainer <b>16</b>. On the other hand, the outer surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is inclined relative to the adjacent surface of the retainer <b>16</b>. The arrangement is such that only the radially outermost portion of the surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>abuts the surface of the retainer <b>16</b>. The slide element <b>30</b> cooperates with the retainer to generate a force which urges the part cylindrical portion <b>32</b> radially inwardly, i.e., away from pronounced frictional engagement with the internal surface of the component <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An advantage of the embodiment which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is analogous to that of the aforedescribed embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, instead of being urged radially inwardly only by the flat surface <b>35</b> of the slide element <b>30</b>, the convolutions <b>27</b> of the coil spring <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are urged radially inwardly by the radially outermost portion of the retainer <b>16</b>, i.e., the latter urges the convolutions <b>27</b> radially inwardly together with the slide element <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a further modification of the structure which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The slide element <b>30</b> has a base <b>31</b> which is smaller than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and overlies only a portion of the adjacent outermost convolution <b>27</b> of the coil spring <b>8</b>. Such outermost convolution <b>27</b> is trimmed at <b>37</b> and its flattened left-hand side lies flush against the adjacent surface of the trimmed base <b>31</b>. The retainer <b>16</b> has a stepped portion <b>38</b> which is a projection in contact with the truncated (at <b>37</b>) outermost convolution <b>27</b> radially inwardly of the base <b>31</b>. The stepped portion <b>38</b> is configurated and dimensioned in such a way that, when the slide element <b>30</b> (i.e., the coil spring <b>8</b>) is to bear or reacts against the retainer <b>16</b>, the stepped portion <b>38</b> contacts the coil spring <b>8</b> before the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> reaches the retainer <b>16</b> of the part <b>20</b>. This ensures that, especially when the coil spring <b>8</b> is subjected to a sudden stress in response to rapid and rather pronounced turning of one of the components <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> relative to the other component, the outermost convolution <b>27</b> is stressed by the projection <b>38</b> before the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> reaches the retainer <b>16</b>. Such mode of operation of the damper including the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is of particular advantage if the convolutions <b>27</b> at the end of the coil spring <b>8</b> lie flush against each other.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The retainer <b>16</b> constitutes a radially outwardly extending arm of the washer-like part <b>20</b> of the component</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">An important advantage of the embodiment which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is that a portion of the force which the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> transmits to the illustrated end (convolutions <b>27</b>) of the coil spring <b>8</b> is transmitted (by the projection or stepped portion <b>38</b>) directly to the coil spring, namely to the trimmed portion <b>37</b> of the nearest convolution <b>27</b>) and the remainder of such force is transmitted to the coil spring <b>8</b> indirectly by way of the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b>. This contributes to longer useful life of the slide element <b>30</b>. It has been found that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> contributes to longer useful life of the slide element <b>30</b> because the base <b>31</b> is much less likely to be deformed in response to abrupt transmission of force from the part <b>20</b> of the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> to the coil spring <b>8</b>. The initially applied part of the force is transmitted radially inwardly to the portion <b>37</b> of the outermost convolution <b>27</b>, and the next-following part of the force being furnished by the part <b>20</b> via retainer <b>16</b> is applied radially outwardly of the portion <b>37</b>, i.e., to the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> and thence to the adjacent convolution <b>27</b> of the coil spring <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a portion of a modified torsional vibration damper. The retainer <b>16</b> of the part <b>20</b> of the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> is configurated in the same way as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, i.e., it has a concave surface which confronts the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b>. However, the base <b>31</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> has a surface which confronts the concave surface of the retainer <b>16</b> and includes a radially outer portion <b>39</b> which is at least substantially parallel to the adjacent radially outermost portion of the concave surface. This ensures that, in the event of force transmission between the part <b>20</b> of the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> and the base <b>31</b>, a component of such force acts radially inwardly as indicated by arrow <b>40</b> which, in turn, ensures a reduction of friction between the external surface of the portion <b>32</b> of the slide element <b>30</b> and the internal surface <b>21</b> in the chamber <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a resilient unit which employs two arcuate coil springs <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> operating in series.

Those sets of convolutions <b>46</b> of each of the two coil springs <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> which are remote from a centrally located slide <b>50</b> abut against discrete slide elements <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> each of which can be identical with or can resemble that (shown at <b>30</b>) in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, especially those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The outer diameters of the two sets of convolutions <b>46</b> are or can be identical.

The slide <b>50</b> further comprises two substantially trough-shaped (part cylindrical) portions <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> which partially surround the adjacent convolutions <b>48</b> of the coil springs <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. The diameters of the convolutions <b>48</b> of each of the two coil springs decrease stepwise toward the base <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the slide <b>50</b>. The outer sides of the trough-shaped portions <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> of the slide <b>50</b> are adjacent to or abut the concave internal surface bounding the radially outermost portion of the chamber defined by the components <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the damper employing the coil springs <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">An advantage of the slide <b>50</b> is that it prevents direct rubbing or other contact between the two sets of convolutions <b>48</b>.

Furthermore, such arrangement renders it possible to reliably clamp an elastic slide <b>66</b> or <b>67</b> to the respective convolution <b>68</b> or <b>69</b> prior to insertion of the coil spring <b>64</b> into the chamber.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the slide <b>66</b> extends around the radially outer portions of the adjacent smaller-diameter convolutions <b>65</b>, <b>68</b> along an arc of approximately and preferably not less than 180°.

The curvature of the longitudinal axis of cylindrical bumper <b>78</b> is or can be the same as that of the coil spring <b>76</b>. This bumper can be made of a suitable resilient plastic material. If desired or necessary, the illustrated solid bumper <b>78</b> can be replaced with an elastic bumper which is provided with slits, holes and/or similar features adapted to enhance its softness, its ability to damp and/or other desirable characteristics. The purpose of the bumper <b>78</b> is to damp abrupt shocks which develop in the structure employing the improved torsional vibration damper and some of which should be taken up by the bumper. An advantage of the bumper <b>78</b> is that, owing to its cylindrical configuration, it can completely fill the space between the retainer <b>16</b> and the nearest convolution of the coil spring <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the cylindrical bumper <b>78</b> is replaced with an at least substantially spherical elastic bumper <b>79</b> which extends, in part, into the adjacent convolution(s) at the respective end of the arcuate coil spring <b>76</b> and abuts the retainer <b>16</b> of part <b>20</b> of the component <b>3</b>,<b>20</b> of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The width of the bumper <b>78</b> or <b>79</b>, as measured radially of the common axis X of the components including the part <b>20</b>, can equal or approximate the outer diameter of the adjacent convolution(s) of the respective coil spring <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">An advantage of the spherical bumper <b>79</b> is that it contributes to a pronounced simplification of assembly of the damper. Thus, the spherical bumper <b>79</b> can be properly installed between the retainer <b>16</b> and the adjacent end convolution of the coil spring <b>76</b> in any randomly selected orientation because its effectiveness is not dependent upon its orientation relative to the parts <b>16</b> and <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">An advantage which is shared by the bumpers <b>78</b> and <b>79</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> is that the outermost convolution of the respective coil spring <b>76</b> is invariably prevented from being struck directly by the retainer <b>16</b>. The reason is that the diameter of the cylindrical bumper <b>78</b> as well as the diameter of the spherical bumper <b>79</b> at least equals the outer diameter of the nearest convolution of the respective coil spring <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an elastic cylindrical bumper <b>80</b> which extends into the adjacent convolutions <b>82</b> at the respective end of the arcuate coil spring <b>76</b> and also abuts a protuberance or projection <b>84</b> provided on the retainer <b>16</b> of the part <b>20</b>. The inner diameter of the convolution <b>82</b>′ is smaller than those of the end convolutions <b>82</b> and that of the bumper <b>80</b> so that the latter cannot advance deeper into the coil spring <b>76</b> (under the action of the projection <b>84</b>) and away from the retainer <b>16</b> in response to repeated axial expansion and contraction of the coil spring.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is analogous to that which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The cylindrical bumper <b>80</b> is replaced with a spherical bumper <b>81</b> which is held against further penetration into the coil spring <b>76</b> by a set of convolutions <b>83</b> having inner diameters smaller than the diameter of the bumper <b>81</b>. The inner diameters of the convolutions <b>83</b> decrease in a direction from the retainer <b>16</b> toward the center of the coil spring <b>76</b>. This even more reliably prevents the projection <b>84</b> from propelling the spherical bumper <b>81</b> deeper into the coil spring <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The elastic bumpers <b>78</b>, <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> contribute to more satisfactory on-off (start-stop) operation as well as to more satisfactory reaction of the damper to changes of load upon the damper. Thus, the retainer <b>16</b> engages first or only the adjacent bumper (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>) or engages the bumper (<b>80</b> or <b>81</b>) before it comes in contact with the nearest convolution at the respective end of the coil spring <b>76</b>. As already mentioned above, the damping action of the bumper can be enhanced by providing it with slits, holes, cavities or analogous elasticity enhancing configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The bumpers <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> also exhibit certain important advantages even though they are received in the adjacent end convolutions of the respective coil springs <b>76</b>. Thus, and since the inner diameters of such convolutions are at least slightly smaller than or at most equal to the diameters of the bumpers <b>80</b> and <b>81</b>, the properly inserted bumpers remain in their illustrated positions before and while being struck by the respective projections or protuberances <b>84</b>. Thus, the bumpers <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> can be assembled with the respective coil springs <b>76</b> prior to installation of such coil springs between the components of the damper. This simplifies the assembly of the coil springs <b>76</b> with the respective bumpers and thus contributes to lower cost of the damper.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The diameter of a cylindrical projection <b>84</b>, or the maximum transverse dimension of a non-cylindrical projection which is utilized in lieu of the projection <b>84</b>, is preferably less than the inner diameter of the adjacent outermost convolution of the respective coil spring <b>76</b>. This ensures that, when the retainer <b>16</b> begins to move toward the adjacent end convolution of the respective coil spring <b>76</b>, the transmission of force to the coil spring takes place only by way of the respective damper <b>80</b> or <b>81</b>; the retainer actually strikes the adjacent end convolution only if and when the bumper <b>80</b> or <b>81</b> has undergone a certain deformation, namely when the projection <b>84</b> is fully confined in the adjacent end of the coil spring <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a semicircular arcuate coil spring <b>90</b> having a constant inner radius <b>92</b> and convolutions adjacent the internal surface <b>21</b> in the chamber of one of the components (not shown) of the damper employing the spring <b>90</b>. The damper which utilizes the coil spring <b>90</b> reduces or minimizes or prevents the development of friction between the convolutions and the internal surface <b>21</b> even though it does not employ any slides and/or slide elements.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The coil spring <b>90</b> comprises several spaced apart convolutions <b>91</b> having outer diameters larger than those of the remaining majority of convolutions <b>91</b><i>a</i>. Since the inner radius <b>92</b> of the arcuate coil spring <b>90</b> is constant and the outer diameters of the convolutions <b>91</b><i>a </i>are smaller than those of the convolutions <b>91</b>, the surface <b>21</b> is or is likely to be contacted only by the relatively small number of convolutions <b>91</b> but not by the much larger number of convolutions <b>91</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The convolutions <b>91</b> serve to guide the coil spring <b>90</b> during movement relative to the one and/or the other of the components with retainers at the longitudinal ends of the coil spring. The median portion of the coil spring <b>90</b> includes three immediately adjacent large-diameter coil springs <b>91</b>. Such arrangement even more reliably prevents the smaller-diameter convolutions <b>91</b><i>a</i>′ from abutting the internal surface <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The outer diameters of the illustrated sets of convolutions <b>91</b><i>a </i>decrease gradually from the adjacent larger-diameter convolutions <b>91</b> (or <b>93</b>) toward the median smaller-diameter convolutions. For example, and referring to the part of the coil spring <b>90</b> between the twelve and one o'clock positions, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the outer diameters of the two outermost convolutions <b>91</b><i>a</i>′ adjacent the respective larger-diameter convolutions <b>91</b> decrease gradually toward the median convolutions <b>91</b><i>a″. </i></p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The radially outermost portions of the smaller-diameter convolutions (such as <b>91</b><i>a</i>, <b>91</b><i>a</i>′ and <b>91</b><i>a</i>″) are not likely to reach the internal surface <b>21</b> in normal use of the damper if the latter is used in the power train of a motor vehicle and the rotary output element of the engine is caused to rotate at an RPM of less than 3000. This is achieved by the the relatively small number of larger-diameter convolutions <b>91</b> which alternate with and/or are provided adjacent to the outer end or ends of one outermost set or both outermost sets of convolutions <b>91</b><i>a</i>. The smaller-diameter convolutions <b>91</b><i>a </i>might move radially outwardly to contact the internal surface <b>21</b> when the coil spring <b>90</b> is compressed (shortened) to such an extent that the neighboring convolutions <b>91</b><i>a </i>assume positions in which they lie flush against each other, i.e., when they together act as a solid block without any further freedom of additional reduction of the length of the set of convolutions <b>91</b><i>a </i>in the axial direction of the coil spring <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic and specific aspects of the above outlined contribution to the art of torsional vibration dampers for use in the power trains of motor vehicles or the like and, therefore, such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the appended claims.</p>
