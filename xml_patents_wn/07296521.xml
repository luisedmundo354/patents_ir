<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies, in which a plurality of lateral travel rail members capable of supporting and guiding guided devices situated on a main rail are provided to the side of a prescribed region of the fixed path, in such a manner that a frame member provided with a supporting section assumes an orthogonal attitude or position with respect to a direction of travel, and the other frame members become aligned in the direction of travel, and causing the guided devices to branch off onto the lateral travel rail member group in the prescribed region. Thereby, spacing between the movable bodies in the lateral travel direction can be maintained readily by using a simple structure, and the group of movable bodies can be moved laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies, which is used to move a movable body for conveying items on a fixed path located on a floor or on a ceiling, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-114094, for example, has been used as this kind of apparatus. More specifically, the main body of a movable body which is able to move along a fixed path by being supported and guided on rails by means of a plurality of guided devices, is formed by three frame members which are connected, by means of a connecting device, in a relatively rotatable fashion in lateral directions traversing the longitudinal travelling direction of the movable body. A supporting section for items to be conveyed is provided on the middle frame, and a group of guided devices are connected, by means of a vertical axle, to the movable body in a relatively rotatable fashion. A plurality of divided rail members capable of supporting the group of guided devices are provided in a set path section within the fixed path, and furthermore, rotating means for causing these divided rail members to rotate about a vertical axis are also provided. Moreover, a group of lateral travel rail members capable of connecting to the divided rail members when the latter are rotated and separated from the rails, are provided to the lateral side of the set path section.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to this conventional constitution, the respective guided devices of the movable body are supported on the divided rail members, and in this state, the group of divided rail members are connected to the lateral travel rail members by reverse rotation of rotating means. Thereby, the respective guided devices can assume a posture facing sideways in the lateral direction, whilst the main body of the movable body is aligned in a direction following the set path section. By moving the group of guided devices sideways in a lateral direction, the movable body can be moved laterally whilst the main body of the movable body remains in an attitude aligned with the set path section. Consequently, by forming a storage path from a lateral travel path section composed of a group of lateral travel rail members, it is possible to store the movable bodies in such a manner that the main bodies thereof are aligned laterally in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, according to the prior art constitution described above, in the lateral travel path section, it is not readily possible to maintain a spacing between movable bodies in the lateral travel direction, and therefore, in order to convey the movable bodies laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between the conveyed items, it has been necessary to separately install lateral conveyance devices, or the like, having a complicated structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies, whereby spacing between movable bodies in the lateral direction can be maintained readily by means of a simple structure, and hence a group of movable bodies can be conveyed in a lateral direction, in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the object, the conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to the present invention is a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies in which each movable body is able to move along a fixed path by being supported and guided on a main rail by means of a plurality of guided devices, the main body of the movable body being formed by a plurality of frame members connected in a relatively rotatable fashion in a traverse direction with respect to a longitudinal direction via connecting devices, at least one of the frame members being provided with a supporting section for conveyed items, each of the guided devices being coupled in a relatively rotatable fashion to the movable body by means of vertical axles, characterized in that a plurality of lateral travel rail members are provided on a lateral side of a prescribed region of the fixed path for supporting and guiding the guided devices in such a manner that the frame member provided with the supporting section assumes an orthogonal position with respect to a direction of travel, whilst the other frame members become aligned with the direction of travel, and branching means is provided in the prescribed region for causing the guided devices on the main rail to branch off onto the plurality of lateral travel rail members.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">By adopting the foregoing constitution, in linear shaped path sections of the fixed path, the movable body can be moved in such a manner that the main body thereof, in other words, the respective frame members thereof, assume a linear attitude in a plan view. Moreover, in a left or right-hand curved path section, the movable body can be moved in such a manner that the respective frame members thereof assume a curved attitude in accordance with the curved path, also in a plan view, by means of the connecting devices, and in this case, such curvature is achieved by relative rotation of the guided devices about vertical axles. Furthermore, by means of the guided devices rotating about the vertical axles, the movable body can be conveyed smoothly by automatically adjusting the orientation thereof in accordance with the leftward or rightward curvature of the rail.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this way, by causing the respective guided devices of a movable body to branch off from the main rail and onto lateral travel rail members when the movable body arrives at the prescribed region of the fixed path by being supported and guided on the main rail, it is possible to branch off and convey the movable body in a lateral direction with respect to the fixed path, in a state where the frame member provided with the supporting section is positioned orthogonally with respect to the direction of travel and the other frame members are aligned in the direction of travel. Thereby, it is possible to move movable bodies laterally in a state where a spacing corresponding to the length of the other frame members is maintained therebetween in the lateral travel direction, and this maintenance of the spacing between movable bodies in the lateral travel direction is achieved readily by means of a simple structure, and hence a group of movable bodies can be conveyed laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a first aspect of the present invention is such that the main body of the movable body is formed by three frame members, the supporting section being provided on the middle frame member, and a pair of lateral travel rail members are provided in such a manner that the movable body is conveyed laterally in a state wherein the front frame member thereof is aligned with one of the lateral travel rail members, and the rear frame member thereof is bent to be aligned with the other lateral travel rail member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this first aspect, it is possible to branch off and convey a movable body in a lateral direction with respect to the fixed path, in a state where the middle frame member provided with the supporting section assumes an orthogonal position with respect to the direction of travel, whilst the front frame member and rear frame member are bent so as to be aligned with the lateral travel rail members. Thereby, movable bodies can be moved in a lateral direction in a state where a spacing corresponding to the length of the front frame member and the rear frame member is guaranteed therebetween in the lateral travel direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a second aspect of the present invention is such that when a plurality of movable bodies are supported and guided on the lateral travel rail members, guided devices of preceding and following movable bodies which are adjacently positioned in the direction of travel can be coupled together.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to this second aspect, by coupling the guided devices of a movable body which is branched off and conveyed laterally, with the guided devices of the preceding movable body, it is possible thereafter to move a group of movable bodies laterally, in a train-like fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a third aspect of the present invention is such that motional force applying means is provided for applying motional force to a movable body supported on the plurality of lateral travel rail members.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to this third aspect, it is possible to convey a movable body that has been branched off, in an state wherein the frame member provided with the supporting section can move orthogonally to the direction of travel, by the operation of the motional force applying means.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a fourth aspect of the present invention is such that the region where the lateral travel rail members are provided is formed into a working path section with respect to conveyed items.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this fourth aspect, it is possible to maintain spacing between movable bodies in the lateral travel direction, and hence various tasks can be performed readily and accurately with respect to the conveyed items, whilst a group of movable bodies are conveyed laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between the conveyed items.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a fifth aspect of the present invention is such that the movable body is formed with passive surfaces on the side faces of the respective frame members thereof, and feeding means having feed rollers capable of abutting on these passive surfaces is provided in the fixed path.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to this fifth aspect, by causing forcibly rotated feed rollers to abut on the passive surfaces of the movable body, it is possible to impart a motional force (travelling force) to the movable body by means of rotational feeding force thereof, and hence the movable body can be conveyed readily and reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a sixth aspect of the present invention is such that the branching means comprises a plurality of divided rail members formed by dividing the main rail in the prescribed region and being capable of supporting the guided devices, and rotating devices for causing these divided rail members to rotate about vertical axes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to this sixth aspect, by causing the divided rail members to rotate about the vertical axles by operating the rotating devices so as to connect them to the main rail whilst separating them from the lateral travel rail members, it is possible to cause the guided devices of the conveyed movable body to be transferred from the main rail to the group of divided rail members, whereupon the movable object can be halted in a position wherein the guided devices are supported by corresponding divided rail members. Next, the divided rail members can be separated from the main rail and connected with the lateral travel rail members by reverse rotation of the rotating devices, and by means of this rotational force on the divided rail members, the guided devices can be rotated about vertical axles with respect to the main body or a supporting section of the movable body.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Consequently, by moving the guided devices by appropriate lateral feeding means, the guided devices can be transferred from the divided rail members onto the lateral travel rail members. Thereupon, by reverse operation of the rotating means, the divided rail members can be separated from the lateral travel rail members and connected with the main rail, thereby returning the system to the initial state. By an operation of this kind, it is possible to branch off a plurality of guided devices onto a plurality of divided rail members.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a seventh aspect of the present invention is such that the branching means is composed in such a manner that all of the movable bodies arriving at the prescribed region in the fixed path are caused to branch off onto the plurality of lateral travel rail members.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this seventh aspect, a movable body arriving at the prescribed region is always transferred to the lateral travel rail members and conveyed laterally, without allowing it to pass through the prescribed region.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according an eighth aspect of the present invention is such that the branching means is composed to branch off the movable body in such a manner that the frame members other than the frame member provided with the supporting section assume an orthogonal attitude in a same direction, with respect to the frame member provided with the supporting section.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this eighth aspect, the movable body can be conveyed laterally in a U-shaped bent attitude, wherein the other frame members are positioned mutually in parallel, in alignment with the lateral travel rail members, and hence a force for lateral conveyance, and the like, can be applied in a stable fashion by means of these other frame members in parallel alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a ninth aspect of the present invention is such that the movable body comprises a supporting section for conveyed items in a lower portion of at least one of the frame members.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to this ninth aspect, it is possible to convey movable bodies of a suspended conveyance design, laterally, whilst the supporting section thereof retains a horizontal position.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">More specifically, as shown by the dotted line C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the feed roller <b>68</b> projecting on the inner side is caused to contact the passive surfaces <b>15</b> of the moving body <b>10</b> arriving there, by means of the elastic force of the compression spring <b>70</b>, whereby, as shown by the solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is pressed against the passive surfaces <b>15</b> in a retracted state, against the elastic force of the compression spring <b>70</b>. In this case, the feed roller <b>68</b> is driven in rotation by the induction motor <b>66</b>, and therefore, since the feed roller <b>68</b> which is subjected to forced rotation is in pressure contact with the passive surfaces <b>15</b>, motional force is imparted to the movable body <b>10</b> due to the conveyance rotational force A thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Here, the abutting section <b>16</b> of the front end portion of the introduced movable body <b>10</b> abuts on the abutting section <b>17</b> of the rear end portion of the last movable body <b>10</b> of a movable body <b>10</b> group situated in a train-like formation on the linear shaped path section <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and thus the group of movable bodies <b>10</b> situated in a train-like formation on the linear shaped path section <b>5</b><i>a </i>is caused to move at a prescribed speed by the conveyance rotational force A of the feeding means <b>60</b>, and the group of movable bodies <b>10</b> situated in a train-like formation on the linear shaped path section <b>5</b><i>a </i>is pushed from the rear and caused to move (see dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Here, since the conveyance rotational force A of the feeding means <b>60</b> is greater than the conveyance rotational force B of the braking roller <b>76</b>, the movable body <b>10</b> corresponding to the braking means <b>75</b> is caused to move whilst receiving a braking action, in accordance with the differential between the forces. Consequently, in the linear shaped path section <b>5</b><i>a</i>, a plurality of movable bodies <b>10</b> are caused to move in an aligned fashion between the feeding means <b>60</b> and the braking means <b>75</b>, whilst being pressed tightly from the rear, without any gaps occurring between the front and rear ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The movement of the movable bodies <b>10</b> by the feeding means <b>60</b> as described above is performed by means of the feed roller <b>68</b> thereof acting successively on the passive surfaces <b>15</b> of the front frame member <b>12</b>, and then from that to the passive surfaces <b>15</b> of the middle frame member <b>13</b>, and on to the passive surfaces <b>15</b> of the rear frame member <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this case, when the feed roller <b>68</b> acts on the front frame member <b>12</b>, the middle frame member <b>13</b> and the rear frame member <b>14</b> are pulled and moved by means of the connecting device <b>20</b>. Moreover, when the feed roller <b>68</b> acts on the middle frame member <b>13</b>, the front frame member <b>12</b> is pushed and moved via the connecting device <b>20</b>, and the rear frame member <b>14</b> is pulled and moved via the connecting device <b>20</b>. Furthermore, when the feed roller <b>68</b> acts on the rear frame member <b>14</b>, the middle frame member <b>13</b> and front frame member <b>12</b> are pushed and moved via the connecting device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this way, whilst a group of movable bodies <b>10</b> are moved in an intermittent or consecutive manner along the linear shaped path section <b>5</b><i>a</i>, or whilst they are intermittently halted, a floor-based operator, for example, can proceed with a variety of operations with respect to the conveyed items <b>115</b> supported by the supporting section <b>50</b>, from below.

Consequently, when there is no requirement to branch off a movable body <b>10</b> into the working path section <b>6</b>, the movable body <b>10</b> is caused to move and pass through the prescribed region <b>5</b><i>d</i>, with the divided rail members <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B in the state.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, if a movable body <b>10</b> is to be branched off into the working path section <b>6</b>, then firstly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the lower side operating device <b>84</b>A in the branching means <b>81</b> is operated, and the divided rail member <b>82</b>A is caused to rotated about the vertical axis <b>83</b>A, in such a manner that the downstream end thereof connects with the lateral travel rail member <b>80</b>A.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In this case, the front side middle guided device <b>30</b> passes along the upper side divided rail member <b>82</b>B, and by detecting the passage thereof, the upper side operating device <b>84</b>B of the branching means <b>81</b> is operated, thereby causing the divided rail member <b>82</b>B to turn about the vertical axis <b>83</b>B and connecting the downstream end thereof to the lateral travel rail member <b>80</b>B.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, when a movable body <b>10</b> has been branched off onto the working path section <b>6</b> in this way, the feed roller <b>68</b> of the pulling means <b>108</b> engages with the outer side of the upper passive surface <b>19</b> of the passive member <b>18</b> provided on the front frame member <b>12</b> or rear frame member <b>14</b>, and with the supporting plate members <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the guided members <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, thereby causing the movable body <b>10</b> to be pulled into the working path section <b>6</b> in the bended attitude, and then to be conveyed laterally.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In this state, when the laterally conveyed movable body <b>10</b> approaches the preceding movable body <b>10</b>, firstly, the cam guide face <b>94</b> of the coupling receiver member <b>90</b> abuts on the cam guide face <b>104</b> of the opposing coupling member <b>100</b>, whereby the coupling member <b>100</b> is caused to swing upwards about the horizontal pin <b>102</b>, against its own weight, as illustrated by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. By means of the cam guide face <b>94</b> passing over the cam guide face <b>104</b>, the coupling member <b>100</b> then swings downwards about the horizontal pin <b>102</b>, due to its own weight, whereby the front end portion thereof falls into the recess section <b>92</b>, the coupling face <b>103</b> thereof abuts on the coupling receiver face <b>93</b>, and the coupling member <b>100</b> is thus coupled to the coupling receiver member <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In this case, in the group of movable bodies <b>10</b> branched off onto the working path section <b>6</b>, the feed roller <b>68</b> of the motional force applying means <b>110</b> provided on the final end side of the working path section <b>6</b> abuts on the outer sides of the upper passive surfaces <b>19</b> of the passive member <b>18</b> of the movable body <b>10</b> opposing it, and the supporting plate members <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the guided devices <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> thereof, thereby causing the movable bodies <b>10</b> to be conveyed laterally in a train-like fashion, whilst maintaining the bended attitude. In this case, the conveyance driving force of the feed roller <b>68</b> is transmitted reliably by means of a backup roller <b>111</b> in contact with the inner sides of the upper passive surface <b>19</b> and the supporting plate members <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">By pulling and moving the group of movable bodies <b>10</b> in the working path section <b>6</b> in a train-like fashion by means of the motional force applying means <b>110</b> in this way, the motional force of the preceding movable body <b>10</b> is transmitted via the coupling member <b>100</b> thereof to the coupling receiver member <b>90</b> of the laterally conveyed movable body <b>10</b>. By this means, the laterally conveyed movable body <b>10</b> receives a pulling force on the guided devices <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> supported on the respective lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, by means of the vertical axles <b>21</b>, <b>25</b>.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the leading movable body <b>10</b> reaches the final end portion of the working path section <b>6</b>, the operating pin <b>105</b> provided on the coupling member <b>100</b> thereof is guided by the guide member <b>115</b>, and coupling member <b>100</b> is caused to swing upwards against its own weight, thereby releasing the coupling thereof with the following movable body <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The leading movable body <b>10</b> is then joined into the fixed path <b>5</b>A by the operation of the feed-in means <b>112</b>. In this case, the joining operation is performed smoothly by means of the joining means <b>85</b> operating in a similar manner to the branching means <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">More specifically, by turning the two dividing rail members <b>86</b>A, <b>86</b>B about the vertical axes <b>87</b>A, <b>87</b>B, the upstream ends thereof are connected with the final end portions of the lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. By then applying a propelling force to the leading movable body <b>10</b> by the operation of feed-in means <b>112</b>, firstly, the leading end guided device <b>40</b> of the movable body <b>10</b> is caused to flow from the lateral travel rail member <b>80</b>A and onto the main rail <b>2</b>A, by means of the divided rail member <b>86</b>A.

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Here, by detecting the passage of the front side middle guided device <b>30</b> over the divided rail member <b>86</b>A, the lower side operating device <b>88</b>A of the joining means <b>85</b> is operated, and the divided rail member <b>86</b>A is turned about the vertical axis <b>87</b>A, thereby connecting the upstream end thereof with the main rail <b>2</b>A. In this state, the rear side middle guided device <b>30</b> joined onto the main rail <b>2</b>A is moved along the divided rail member <b>86</b>A, and the rear side end guided device <b>40</b> is joined onto the main rail <b>2</b>A via the divided rail member <b>86</b>B, similarly to the rear side middle guided device <b>30</b>, and is then moved over the divided rail member <b>86</b>A. In this way, the respective frame members <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the movable body <b>10</b> can be moved over the main rail <b>2</b>A in a linear fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As described above, whilst a group of movable bodies <b>10</b> are moved in a train-like fashion in an intermittent or consecutive manner along the working path section <b>6</b>, or whilst they are intermittently halted, a floor-based operator, for example, can proceed with a variety of operations with respect to the conveyed items <b>118</b> supported by the supporting section <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in this case, since the front frame member <b>12</b> and rear frame member <b>14</b> are positioned in alignment with the downward direction of the two lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, the spacing between the middle frame members <b>13</b> of preceding and following movable bodies <b>10</b> can be maintained at a distance corresponding to the length of the front frame member <b>12</b> or rear frame member <b>14</b>. Thereby, the spacing between movable bodies <b>10</b> in the lateral travel direction can be maintained readily by a simple structure, and hence a group of movable bodies <b>10</b> can be moved laterally in the working path section <b>6</b> in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items <b>118</b>. Consequently, various types of work operations can be performed on the conveyed items <b>118</b>, in a simple and accurate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the movable body <b>10</b> moves in the manner, the middle guided device <b>30</b> is supported and guided via the respective supporting rollers <b>33</b> on the main rails <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A, the divided rail members <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, and the lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, and the respective guided rollers <b>35</b> contact with and are guided by the main rail <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A, the divided rail members <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, and the lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Furthermore, the end guided device <b>40</b> is supported and guided via the respective supported rollers <b>43</b> on the main rails <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A, the divided rail members <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, and the lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, and the respective guided rollers <b>46</b> contact with and are guided by the main rails <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A, the divided rail members <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, and the lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, in addition to which the lift up prevention roller <b>47</b> opposes the main rails <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A, the divided rail members <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, and the lateral travel rail members <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, from the under side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this way, the movement of the movable bodies <b>10</b> is performed in a stable fashion, without catching, toppling, lifting up, or the like, and hence various tasks can be performed with respect to the conveyed items <b>118</b> and the conveyed items <b>118</b> can be loaded and unloaded in an accurate manner at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the train-like pushing movement along the fixed paths <b>5</b> described above, the main bodies <b>11</b> of the respective movable bodies <b>10</b>, in other words, the respective frame members <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, assume a linear arrangement in plan view and side view, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and therefore a state is achieved wherein the abutting sections <b>16</b> abut against the respective abutting sections <b>17</b> directly from the rear direction, and hence the pushing movement is achieved in a smooth and reliable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Furthermore, in the left (or right-hand) curved path section <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the respective frame members <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are pushed from behind and moved in a bent attitude following the curve of the path, in plan view, in the regions of the connecting devices <b>20</b>. Thereby, in plan view, the relative angle formed between the rear frame member <b>14</b> of the leading movable body <b>10</b> and the front frame member <b>12</b> of the following movable body <b>10</b> is an obtuse angle, and since the abutting section <b>16</b> meets the abutting section <b>17</b> at an obtuse angle, the pushing movement can be performed smoothly and reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Here, the curving is performed by relative rotation about the vertical axle <b>21</b> at the connecting device <b>20</b>.
