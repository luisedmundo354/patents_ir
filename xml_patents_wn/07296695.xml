<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, the invention relates to a workroom storage system for organizing the tools and supplies found in workrooms, especially garages. More specifically, the invention relates to a space-efficient workroom storage system providing both wall mounted storage and cabinet storage, with a combination of slotwall panels, slot tracks, cabinets removably mounted to the slotwall panel and/or slot tracks, and a workbench in combination with mobile storage cabinets that are stowable beneath the workbench.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There has long been a need for organized storage in workrooms, whether the workroom is a dedicated workshop, a garage, or any other room, since workrooms by their very nature tend to house many types of tools and equipment, along with general supplies and supplies for the tools and equipment. Past solutions to providing organized storage in workrooms were based on the operator selecting unrelated organization systems and combining them as operator saw fit, without an integrated system. The organization systems often reflected a hodgepodge of non-integrated solutions, such as fixed wall cabinets, pegboards, and workbenches with internal storage, which collectively did not provide a space-efficient solution. That is, the resulting combination of components comprising the operator-selected organization system, often consumed more space in the workroom than what was necessary, which limited the amount of storage and/or work area in the workroom. Therefore, there is still a need for a space-efficient, integrated workroom organization system that helps the operator maximize both the storage of tools and supplies and the useful area of the workroom.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides a unique solution to the need for space-efficient, organized storage for a workroom via a workroom organization system comprising at least one slot track. The slot track has a plurality of slots with at least one undercut sidewall with adjoining slots forming a slat having edges defined by the slots. The slots further have a bottom wall generally parallel to and spaced inwardly from the face of the at least one slat. The organization system includes one or more removable mounting brackets having a support portion for attaching a device to the bracket. The mounting brackets include a first “J” shaped hook on one edge of the support portion opening in a first direction to hook over an edge of a slat into the undercut sidewall. The mounting brackets include a second “J” shaped hook on an opposite edge of the support portion opening in the first direction to hook over an edge of the adjoining slot into the undercut sidewall.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In accordance with the present invention a slotwall and slot track storage system incorporating a slotwall panel <b>10</b> having a plurality of generally “T” shaped slots <b>11</b> forming a plurality of generally “T” shaped slats <b>12</b> and/or a slot track <b>210</b> having a plurality of generally “T” shaped slots <b>211</b> forming at least one generally “T” shaped slat <b>212</b> are provided with a hanger bracket for mounting a device on the slotwall panel or slot track. The slotwall panel and/or slot track can be formed of extruded polyvinyl chloride material. Co-pending patent application Ser. No. 10/747,421, discloses one such material, which patent application is incorporated by reference. The slotwall and/or slot track storage system according to the present invention can be used in a residential garage to provide storage for outdoor tools and equipment. A variety of storage options can be provided as will be described below. The slotwall and/or slot track storage system can also be used in a workroom or workshop, or in commercial and industrial locations. The slotwall and/or slot track storage system can be used in conjunction with a Modular Workbench System as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,926,376, which is incorporated by reference, and the disclosure of which is copied into this application as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-27</figref> and the corresponding description. Slotwall panels <b>10</b> with suitable hanger brackets can be used alone or in combination with slot tracks <b>210</b>, and slot tracks <b>210</b> with suitable hanger brackets can be used alone or in combination with slotwall panels <b>10</b> and/or in combination with a Modular Workbench System mentioned above to form a flexible, space-efficient workroom storage system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a slotwall panel <b>10</b> is shown. It should be understood that the slotwall panel <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is only a portion of the panel that can extend longitudinally for any desired length. Typically, slotwall panels can be extruded in 8 feet long lengths to facilitate handling and installation. However, it should be understood that panels longer or shorter that 8 feet can fabricated and used. Further, a single panel can be used or an entire wall can be covered with panels as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. One embodiment of a hanger bracket <b>20</b> is shown mounted on the panel <b>10</b> and is shown with one example of a hook device <b>40</b> attached to the hanger bracket <b>20</b>. Other well known and available hooks and hanging devices can be attached to one or more hanger brackets <b>20</b> as will be understood by one skilled in the art. While a few examples of types of hook and other storage devices that can be attached to one or more hanger brackets are disclosed in this application, one skilled in the art will understand that there are many available hooks and storage devices available on the market that could be used with the brackets and slotwall panels according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Mounting of hanger bracket <b>20</b> to a slotwall panel <b>10</b> can be understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> a device <b>40</b> has been omitted from hanger bracket <b>20</b> to more clearly show hanger bracket <b>20</b> on the slotwall panel <b>10</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that in use a hook device or other storage device would be attached to hanger bracket <b>20</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> includes a central support portion <b>21</b>, a generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> extending from one edge of support portion <b>21</b>, and a generally “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> extending from an opposite edge of support portion <b>21</b>. Generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> includes a first leg <b>24</b> extending generally perpendicular from the edge of support portion <b>21</b> and a second leg <b>25</b> extending from the distal end of first leg <b>24</b> generally parallel to support portion <b>21</b>. Generally “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> has a first leg <b>26</b> extending generally perpendicular from the edge of support portion <b>21</b> and a second leg <b>27</b> extending from the distal end of first leg <b>26</b> generally parallel to support portion <b>21</b> in the same direction as leg <b>25</b>. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> has two downward opening “J” shaped hooks on opposite edges of support portion <b>21</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> also has a spring arm <b>28</b> extending from the edge of support portion <b>21</b> that divides generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> into two portions. Spring arm <b>28</b> extends in an opposite direction from leg <b>25</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> hooks over an edge <b>13</b> of a generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b>. Generally “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> hooks behind the lower adjacent half slat <b>16</b> in undercut <b>14</b>. Spring arm <b>28</b> is positioned behind the upper adjacent slat <b>12</b> in undercut <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, leg <b>27</b> bears against the underside of the lower adjacent half slat <b>16</b> in undercut <b>14</b> biased against the underside of the slat by the spring arm <b>28</b>. The force of spring arm <b>28</b> holds support portion <b>21</b> out of contact with the face of slat <b>12</b>. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> transfers the load on a device <b>40</b> through hanger bracket <b>20</b> to slotwall panel <b>10</b> by contact of leg <b>24</b> on edge <b>13</b> of slat <b>12</b>, the contact of leg <b>25</b> against the inside edge of slat <b>12</b> and the force of spring arm <b>28</b> against the inside of the upper adjacent slat <b>12</b> in undercut <b>14</b>. Leg <b>26</b> of “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> does not normally contact edge <b>13</b> of lower adjacent slat <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a load is placed on device <b>40</b> that generates a moment sufficient to overcome the bias of spring arm <b>28</b>, hanger bracket <b>20</b> pivots on “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> so that leg <b>27</b> engages the bottom wall <b>15</b> of “T” shaped slot <b>11</b>. When hanger bracket <b>20</b> is loaded, hanger bracket <b>20</b> transfers the load on a device <b>40</b> through hanger bracket <b>20</b> to slotwall panel <b>10</b> by contact of leg <b>24</b> on edge <b>13</b> of slat <b>12</b>, the contact of leg <b>25</b> against the inside edge of slat <b>12</b>, the force of spring arm <b>28</b> against the inside of upper adjacent slat <b>12</b> in undercut <b>14</b> and by contact of leg <b>27</b> against bottom wall <b>15</b> of generally “T” shaped slot <b>11</b>. The length of leg <b>26</b> holds hanger bracket <b>20</b> spaced from the face of slat <b>12</b> when hanger bracket <b>20</b> is loaded by items carried on device <b>40</b> so that leg <b>27</b> rests against the bottom wall <b>15</b> of slot <b>11</b>. In the event hanger bracket <b>20</b> is overloaded by items placed on device <b>40</b>, the pressure on leg <b>24</b> may be sufficient to deform the edge <b>13</b> of slat <b>12</b> allowing hanger bracket <b>20</b> to move down until leg <b>26</b> engages edge <b>13</b> of lower adjacent slat <b>12</b>. In an overload condition, the load is spread over two adjacent slats <b>12</b> by generally “J” shaped hooks <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> in addition to the load spread by spring arm <b>28</b> to upper adjacent slat <b>12</b> and leg <b>27</b> to the bottom wall <b>15</b>. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> is locked in position on slotwall panel <b>10</b> by friction due to spring arm <b>28</b> whether loaded or unloaded. Accordingly, hanger bracket <b>20</b> and its attached device, whether loaded or unloaded, can not inadvertently be knocked off or dislodged from a slotwall panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hanger bracket <b>20</b>, together with any attached device such as device <b>40</b>, can be mounted to a slotwall panel <b>10</b> by inserting spring arm <b>28</b> into the undercut <b>14</b> in a slot <b>11</b> far enough under the upper adjacent slat <b>12</b> for leg <b>25</b> to clear edge <b>13</b> of slat <b>12</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> can then be pivoted down against the moment of spring arm <b>28</b> until leg <b>27</b> clears the lower adjacent slat edge <b>13</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> can then be slid down over slat <b>12</b> until leg <b>25</b> rests on edge <b>13</b> with leg <b>27</b> bearing against the underside of the lower adjacent slat <b>12</b> in undercut <b>14</b>. As mentioned above, hanger bracket <b>20</b> will be held in place by friction resulting from the moment of spring arm <b>28</b> bearing against the inside surface of the upper adjacent slat <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a slotwall panel <b>10</b> can include four generally “T” shaped slots <b>11</b> that form three generally “T” shaped slats <b>12</b> and two half slats <b>16</b>, one on each edge of panel <b>10</b>. One edge of slotwall panel <b>10</b> can include a projecting connecting rib <b>17</b> and the other edge can include a mating connecting groove <b>18</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rib <b>17</b> and connecting groove <b>18</b> connect adjacent panels and, when so joined, the half width slats <b>16</b> of the adjacent panels form a full width slat.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bottom wall <b>15</b> of the generally “T” shaped slots <b>11</b> includes a longitudinal alignment groove <b>19</b> in the center of bottom wall <b>15</b>. Alignment groove <b>19</b> can facilitate mounting of slotwall panels on a wall. Alignment groove <b>19</b> can provide a locating function to allow screws or other mounting devices to be aligned along slotwall panel sections. In a wall installation, screws <b>29</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) can be driven through the slotwall panel along groove <b>19</b> into studs supporting the wall to mount the slotwall panel or panels to the wall as is well known to those skilled in the art. Mounting of plural slotwall panels is facilitated by connecting rib <b>17</b> and connecting groove <b>18</b> since another slotwall panel can be placed on a slotwall panel already attached to a wall and the slotwall panel will remain in place until fastened to the wall by screws or other suitable fasteners. Normally slotwall panels <b>10</b> can be mounted to a wall with connecting rib <b>17</b> directed up and connecting groove <b>18</b> directed down over rib <b>17</b> of an adjacent panel <b>10</b> if an adjacent panel is already mounted. Those skilled in the art will recognize that slotwall panels <b>10</b> can be mounted to a wall in the opposite direction if so desired, i.e. with rib <b>17</b> directed down and connecting groove <b>18</b> directed up. Applicants have found that locating the joint between adjacent slotwall panels in the center of a slat provides a stronger slotwall structure since torsional loads are minimal in the center of a slat as compared to joint locations in a slot or at an edge of a slat.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the dimensions of one embodiment of a slotwall panel <b>10</b> can be as provided in the following table.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hanger bracket <b>20</b> can be formed of metal such as steel. When hanger bracket <b>20</b> is formed with steel, hanger bracket <b>20</b> can be stamped from sheet steel. When hanger brackets <b>20</b> are formed of steel, raised surfaces or bosses <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be stamped in support portion <b>21</b> to provide attachment points for hook devices to be welded to the hanger bracket. After a hook device is attached to hanger bracket <b>20</b>, the hanger bracket can be finished as desired such as by painting the entire hanger bracket and hook.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, spring arm <b>28</b> can extend up from first leg <b>24</b> at an acute angle of approximately 65°. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> the distal end <b>28</b>′ of spring arm <b>28</b> can be bent to extend generally parallel to support portion <b>21</b> and leg <b>25</b>. Referring to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> the function of spring arm <b>28</b> can be seen. The thickness e of a generally “T” shaped slat can be 7.0 mm and the offset E of spring arm <b>28</b> can be 6.6 mm. When a hanger bracket <b>20</b> is installed on a slotwall panel <b>10</b> with spring arm <b>28</b> positioned behind an adjacent generally “T” shaped slat in undercut <b>14</b> and generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> is hooked over an edge <b>13</b> of a generally “T” shaped slat, interference of the distal end of the spring arm <b>28</b> with the inside of the adjacent “T” shaped slat will tend to rotate hanger bracket <b>20</b> away from the face of slotwall panel <b>10</b>. When generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> is hooked over and engages an edge <b>13</b> of a generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b>, hook <b>23</b> will be positioned adjacent edge <b>13</b> of a lower adjacent generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b>. Leg <b>27</b> will be positioned behind the lower adjacent generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b> in undercut <b>14</b>. The moment produced by spring arm <b>28</b> pressing against the inside of upper adjacent “T” shaped slat <b>12</b> will drive leg <b>27</b> into contact with the inner surface of lower adjacent generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b> thus friction locking hanger bracket <b>20</b> in place. When a device such as a hook device <b>40</b> is attached to support portion and a load is placed on the hook device, the downward force on the hook device will drive hanger bracket <b>20</b> toward slotwall panel <b>10</b> until leg <b>27</b> engages the bottom wall <b>15</b> of the generally “T” shaped slot <b>11</b>. The outside length D of leg <b>26</b> can be 12.1 mm and can be slightly greater than the depth d of undercut <b>14</b> which can be 5.0 mm plus the thickness e of slat <b>12</b> which can be 7.0 mm. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> can be held out of contact with the face of slat <b>12</b> over which it is installed, whether loaded or unloaded. The distance A from the inside of first leg <b>24</b> of “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> to the inside of first let <b>26</b> of “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> can be 75.2 mm compared to the center to center spacing a of slots and slats which can be 76.2 mm. When hanger bracket <b>20</b> is installed on a generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b> with leg <b>24</b> of “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> engaging an edge <b>13</b>, leg <b>26</b> of “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> will not engage edge <b>13</b> of adjacent slat <b>12</b>. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> can pivot between the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a load is applied to hanger bracket <b>20</b> by an attached hook device such as <b>40</b>.</p>

Cabinet <b>50</b> can be provided with another embodiment of hanger brackets mounted to one wall of cabinet <b>50</b>. Cabinet brackets <b>30</b> can extend generally the full width of cabinet <b>50</b>. Alternately, cabinet brackets <b>30</b> can extend less than the full width of cabinet <b>50</b> and multiple cabinet brackets <b>30</b> can be installed across the width of cabinet <b>50</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Cabinet brackets <b>30</b> can be formed of metal. Cabinet bracket <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be formed of extruded aluminum cut to lengths corresponding to the width of the cabinet or device to which the particular cabinet bracket will be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As with the case of hanger bracket <b>20</b>, cabinet bracket <b>30</b> can have a dimension A′ from the inside of generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> to the inside of generally “J” shaped hook <b>33</b> that is slightly less than the center to center dimension a of the slotwall panel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When dimension A′ is slightly less than the center to center dimension a of slotwall panel, the load on cabinet bracket <b>30</b> produced by cabinet <b>50</b> will be on generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> and first leg <b>34</b> engaging edge <b>13</b> of generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b>. Because generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> engages an edge <b>13</b> of a generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b> before generally “J” shaped hook <b>33</b>, cabinet bracket <b>30</b> is held parallel to slotwall panel <b>10</b> and does not tip out at the top.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the operation of cabinet brackets <b>30</b> can be seen. As the load on cabinet bracket <b>30</b> is increased by the load placed in cabinet <b>50</b>, the edge <b>13</b> of slat <b>12</b> under generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> deforms allowing generally “J” shaped hook <b>33</b> to engage edge <b>13</b> of adjacent slat <b>12</b> thus increasing support for the cabinet bracket. Thus, cabinet brackets <b>30</b> initially transfer the load of cabinet <b>50</b> through generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> to the slotwall panel <b>10</b> by engagement of leg <b>34</b> with edge <b>13</b> of a generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b>. Generally “J” shaped hook <b>33</b> only engages the lower adjacent generally “T” shaped slat <b>12</b> when the load in cabinet <b>50</b> is sufficient to deform edge <b>13</b> of slat <b>12</b> on which leg <b>34</b> is resting.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> a plurality of square holes <b>39</b> can be provided in cabinet bracket <b>30</b> for mounting cabinet bracket <b>30</b> to cabinet <b>50</b>. Cabinet <b>50</b> can be provided with a plurality of mounting holes <b>51</b> adjacent the top of cabinet <b>50</b> for a top cabinet bracket spaced to correspond to the spacing of mounting holes <b>39</b> in cabinet bracket <b>30</b>. Mounting holes <b>51</b> can be round to permit mounting of a top cabinet bracket <b>30</b> in a fixed position adjacent the top of cabinet <b>50</b>. One or more additional rows of mounting holes <b>52</b> can be provided below mounting holes <b>51</b> to allow mounting of one or more lower cabinet brackets <b>30</b>. Mounting holes <b>52</b> can be vertically elongated slots to permit vertical adjustment of the lower cabinet brackets to insure that each cabinet bracket upper generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> engages a slat edge <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In order to install a cabinet <b>50</b> on a slotwall panel, a top cabinet bracket can be attached to cabinet <b>50</b> utilizing a plurality of mounting bolts <b>55</b> inserted with the head in cabinet bracket <b>30</b> and the threaded portion projecting through mounting holes <b>51</b> into cabinet <b>50</b>. Mounting bolts can be a carriage bolt or similar fastening device that can be tightened without access to the head. Suitable fasteners, not shown, can be threaded on mounting bolts <b>55</b> and tightened to secure top cabinet bracket <b>30</b> to cabinet <b>50</b>. Next, one or more lower cabinet brackets can be attached to cabinet <b>50</b> utilizing a plurality of mounting bolts <b>55</b> inserted with the head in cabinet bracket <b>30</b> and the threaded portion projecting through vertical slot mounting holes <b>52</b> into cabinet <b>50</b>. Suitable fasteners, not shown can be threaded on mounting bolts <b>55</b> and left loose to permit adjustment of the position of the one or more cabinet brackets <b>30</b> on cabinet <b>50</b> relative to the slotwall panel <b>10</b>. Cabinet <b>50</b> can then be mounted on slotwall panels that have mounted or attached to a wall structure. The top cabinet bracket <b>30</b> is first hooked on a selected slotwall panel slat <b>12</b> with leg <b>34</b> engaging a slat edge <b>13</b>. Next, the lower cabinet bracket or brackets <b>30</b> are vertically adjusted so that each generally “J” shaped hook <b>32</b> engages a slotwall panel slat <b>12</b> with leg <b>34</b> engaging a slat edge <b>13</b>. After the one or more lower cabinet brackets <b>30</b> are all positioned hooked over a slotwall panel slat <b>12</b> with leg <b>34</b> engaging a slat edge <b>13</b> the fasteners can be tightened securing the one or more cabinet brackets to the cabinet <b>50</b>. As mentioned above, the vertically elongated mounting holes provide sufficient vertical adjustment to allow multiple cabinet brackets to be employed for mounting a cabinet to a plurality of slotwall panels <b>10</b> with each cabinet bracket transferring load from the cabinet <b>50</b> to the slotwall panel to spread the load in cabinet <b>50</b> across multiple slotwall panels <b>10</b> and slats <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, hanger brackets <b>20</b> can be combined to support plural mounting hooks <b>40</b>′. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also illustrates yard tools carried on the mounting hooks on a slotwall storage system occupying a section of a wall. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, slotwall panels <b>10</b> can be fastened to a wall using a plurality of fasteners such as screws <b>29</b>.

Mounting holes <b>126</b> are elongated in the plane of leg assembly <b>111</b> to allow for expansion and contraction of top <b>130</b> over the range of humidity conditions likely to be encountered in a non-climate controlled environment such as a basement, a garage or other outdoor work area. Thus, elongated mounting holes <b>126</b> are positioned to allow the width of the laminated hard wood maple top to expand and contract with changes in humidity. Mounting holes <b>125</b> in mounting flange <b>117</b> can be circular since laminated hard wood maple top <b>130</b> is unlikely to expand and contract along the direction of the laminated wood strips. In addition, use of round mounting holes <b>125</b> in mounting flange <b>117</b> can provide a sturdy workbench since the leg and stringer assembly can not shift under top <b>130</b> as the fasteners <b>131</b> can lock top <b>130</b> to the leg and stringer assembly <b>128</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that if top <b>130</b> is formed of strips of hard wood that run from front to back instead of side to side that mounting holes <b>126</b> could be round and mounting holes <b>125</b> elongated along the length of stringer <b>115</b> to allow for expansion and contraction in that direction.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In accordance with the present invention a slot track storage system can incorporate a slot track <b>210</b> having a plurality of generally “T” shaped slots <b>211</b> forming at least one generally “T” shaped slats <b>212</b> that can be provided with a hanger bracket for mounting a device on the slot track. A variety of storage options can be provided as described above in conjunction with slotwall panels. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a slot track <b>210</b> is shown. It should be understood that the slot track <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> can extend longitudinally for any desired length. Typically, slot tracks can be extruded in 8 feet long lengths to facilitate handling and installation. However, it should be understood that slot tracks longer or shorter that 8 feet can be fabricated and used. Further, a single slot track can be used or multiple slot tracks can be mounted on one or more walls as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. While the slot tracks <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> include two slots <b>211</b> forming a slat <b>212</b>, those skilled in the art will recognize that more than two slots <b>211</b> forming more than one slat <b>212</b> can be provided if desired. Slot track <b>210</b> can include upper and lower slots <b>211</b> having undercuts <b>214</b> in the sidewalls of the slots <b>211</b> and a bottom wall <b>218</b>. Undercuts <b>214</b> form edges <b>213</b> in the slots <b>211</b>. On the sides of slots <b>211</b> opposite slat <b>212</b> the edges <b>216</b> of slot track <b>210</b> extend away from the slots <b>211</b> and then taper toward the rear surface <b>209</b> of the slot track <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Slot tracks <b>210</b> can be mounted on a wall in a manner similar to slotwall panels <b>10</b>. In a wall installation, screws (not shown) can be driven through the bottom wall <b>218</b> of slot track <b>210</b> along groove <b>219</b> into studs supporting the wall to mount the slot track or tracks <b>210</b> to the wall as is well known to those skilled in the art. Mounting screws (not shown) can be driven in one or both slots <b>211</b> through groove <b>219</b> every 16 or 24 inches into studs supporting the wall. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the spacing of mounting screws can be modified to align with studs supporting the wall on which the slot track(s) is mounted. Similarly, those skilled in the art will recognize that slot tracks <b>210</b> can be mounted to a concrete or concrete block wall using screws (not shown) and suitable anchors well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, one embodiment of a hanger bracket <b>20</b> is shown mounted on the track <b>210</b> and is shown with one example of a hook device <b>40</b> attached to the hanger bracket <b>20</b>. Another embodiment of a hook device <b>40</b>′ is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Other well known and available hooks and hanging devices can be attached to one or more hanger brackets <b>20</b> as will be understood by one skilled in the art. While a few examples of types of hook and other storage devices that can be attached to one or more hanger brackets are disclosed in this application, one skilled in the art will understand that there are many available hooks and storage devices available on the market that could be used with the brackets and slot tracks according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Mounting of hanger bracket <b>20</b> to a slot track <b>210</b> can be understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The slot track <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> can include the same slot and slat geometry as a slotwall panel <b>10</b> as described conjunction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and can be used in conjunction with the same hanger brackets <b>20</b> that can be used with slotwall panels <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> generally “J” shaped hook <b>22</b> hooks over an edge <b>213</b> of a generally “T” shaped slat <b>212</b>. Generally “J” shaped hook <b>23</b> hooks behind lower edge <b>216</b> in undercut <b>214</b>. Spring arm <b>28</b> is positioned behind upper edge <b>216</b> in undercut <b>214</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> interacts with slot track <b>210</b> in the same way as with a slotwall panel <b>10</b> as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> is locked in position on slot track <b>210</b> by friction due to spring arm <b>28</b> whether loaded or unloaded. Accordingly, hanger bracket <b>20</b> and its attached device, whether loaded or unloaded, can not inadvertently be knocked off or dislodged from a slot track <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Hanger bracket <b>20</b>, together with any attached device such as device <b>40</b>, can be mounted to a slot track <b>210</b> by inserting spring arm <b>28</b> into the undercut <b>214</b> in a slot <b>211</b> far enough under the upper edge <b>216</b> for leg <b>25</b> to clear edge <b>213</b> of slat <b>212</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> can then be pivoted down against the moment of spring arm <b>28</b> until leg <b>27</b> clears the edge <b>213</b> of lower edge <b>216</b>. Hanger bracket <b>20</b> can then be slid down over slat <b>212</b> until leg <b>25</b> rests on edge <b>213</b> with leg <b>27</b> bearing against the underside of the lower edge <b>216</b> in undercut <b>214</b>. Thus, hanger bracket <b>20</b> can mount on slot track <b>210</b> the same as hanger bracket <b>20</b> mounts on a slotwall panel <b>10</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As mentioned above, hanger bracket <b>20</b> will be held in place by friction resulting from the moment of spring arm <b>28</b> bearing against the inside surface of the upper edge <b>216</b> in undercut <b>214</b>. For convenience in describing attaching of a bracket <b>20</b> to a slot track <b>210</b>, edges <b>216</b> have been described as upper and lower edges <b>216</b>. Slot track <b>210</b> as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> can be symmetrical so that “upper” and “lower” has no significance other than a reference to understand the description since slot tracks <b>210</b> can be mounted on a wall with either edge “up”.</p>
