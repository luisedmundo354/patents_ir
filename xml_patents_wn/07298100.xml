<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the driving control of a vibration type actuator including a vibrator and a contacting member that are relatively moved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">To drive a vibration type actuator, an alternating driving voltage having a frequency of several tens of KHz and a voltage of several tens of Vpp is required. Therefore, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open application No. 2002-15919, a high voltage generation circuit is disclosed, which uses a low-voltage power source such as a battery, generates a high direct voltage once by a DC-DC converter, and supplies it to a driving circuit that generates the driving voltage. The output of the driving circuit is supplied to an electro-mechanical energy conversion element (piezoelectric element) via an inductor. Thereby, the alternative driving voltage amplified with a boosting effect of the inductor is supplied to the electro-mechanical energy conversion element. Further, a structure for boosting the power source voltage, which includes an amplifying circuit with a transformer, is generally used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, there is a vibration type actuator, which reduces the driving voltage by laminating the piezoelectric elements instead of use of the above-mentioned high voltage generation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the method using the laminated piezoelectric elements and the method for boosting the power source voltage using the DC-DC converter or the transformer increase the cost and the size of the driving circuit. In addition, using the laminated piezoelectric elements has a tendency to reduce the driving efficiency slightly in comparison with a single layer piezoelectric element.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EMBODIMENT 1</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The description will be given of the vibration type actuator that is Embodiment 1 of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a figure showing the circuit structure of the driving apparatus of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>1</b> denotes a power source, and <b>2</b> an inductor, which is a first inductor and is connected to the power source <b>1</b>. Reference numeral <b>3</b> denotes a MOSFET, which is a first switching element and switches the line between the inductor <b>2</b> and the ground. Reference numeral <b>4</b> denotes a diode for transferring the energy accumulated in the inductor <b>2</b> in a state in which the MOSFET <b>3</b> is ON to a piezoelectric element described later.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference numeral <b>5</b> denotes the piezoelectric element (electro-mechanical energy conversion element), which constitutes part of a vibrator, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, and <b>6</b> a switching circuit, which makes the after-mentioned inductor <b>7</b> discharge the energy that has been accumulated in the piezoelectric element <b>5</b>. Reference numeral <b>7</b> denotes the inductor, which is disposed between the switching circuit <b>6</b> and the power source <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reference numeral <b>8</b> denotes a pulse generation circuit, which generates a plurality of pulse signals (P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>) each having a frequency in the vicinity of the resonance frequency of the vibrator and higher than the resonance frequency according to a frequency command from the command circuit <b>100</b>, and outputs these pulse signals to the MOSFET <b>3</b> and the switching circuit <b>6</b>. The Command from the command circuit <b>100</b> is used for controlling the vibration amplitude of the vibrator.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a figure showing the structure of the vibration type actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>200</b> denotes a ring-shaped vibrator. Reference numeral <b>201</b> denotes a rotor, which is a contacting member. The rotor <b>201</b> contacts with the vibrator under pressure, and is rotated by a traveling vibration wave formed on the vibrator <b>200</b>. Reference numeral <b>202</b> denotes a friction member, which is disposed between the vibrator <b>200</b> and the rotor <b>201</b>, and is bonded to a protruding contact portion of the vibrator <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The piezoelectric element <b>5</b> is bonded to the vibrator <b>200</b>, and forms the traveling vibration wave on the vibrator <b>200</b> by receiving alternating signals having a phase difference. Reference numeral <b>203</b> denotes a rotating shaft, which is connected to the rotor <b>201</b>. The rotating shaft <b>203</b> is rotated by the rotation of the rotor <b>201</b>, and the torque is transmitted to a driven mechanism <b>205</b> via a transmission mechanism, not shown in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thereby, the driven mechanism <b>205</b> is driven. Here, the driven mechanism <b>205</b> includes a lens unit, a photoconductive drum or carrying mechanism of an image forming apparatus, or the like. Although a ring-shaped vibration type actuator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, other vibration type actuators such as a rod-shaped vibration type actuator may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a chart showing the relationship between the driving frequency of a common vibration type actuator and the relative speed between the vibrator and the rotor. The horizontal axis denotes the driving frequency, and vertical axis denotes the rotational speed of the rotor <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The drive of the vibration type actuator is controlled in a frequency range higher than the resonance frequency FR shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> normally. In other words, the drive is started at the frequency F<b>1</b> higher than the resonance frequency FR, and the rotational speed is increased by bringing the driving frequency close to the resonance frequency FR. The rotational speed is proportional to the amplitude of the vibrator <b>200</b>. Therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows the characteristic of the vibration amplitude to the driving frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows waveforms in each part of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The description will be given of the operation of the driving apparatus of the present embodiment using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The signal P<b>1</b> is a pulse signal that is input to the gate of the MOSFET <b>3</b> from the pulse generation circuit <b>8</b>; the signal P<b>1</b> has a frequency higher than the resonance frequency of the vibrator <b>200</b>. A pulse signal having the frequency F<b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and a duty ratio of 28%, for example, is used as the signal PI when the operation of the driving apparatus is started.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">V<b>1</b> denotes the drain voltage of the MOSFET <b>3</b>. The voltage V<b>1</b> is zero during the ON state of the signal P<b>1</b> because the MOSFET <b>3</b> is shorted to the ground. The voltage V<b>1</b> increases to a voltage higher than the voltage V<b>0</b> of the power source <b>1</b> during the OFF state of the signal P<b>1</b> because the MOSFET <b>3</b> becomes the OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">V<b>1</b> denotes the input voltage to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b>. The energy accumulated in the inductor <b>2</b> during the ON state of the MOSFET <b>3</b> is transferred to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> via the diode <b>4</b> by switching the MOSFET <b>3</b> to the OFF state, and thereby increasing the voltage V<b>2</b> to a voltage higher than the voltage V<b>0</b> of the power source <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since this voltage amplifying effect makes it possible to input a sufficient voltage to the vibrator <b>200</b> (piezoelectric element <b>5</b>), a large vibration can be generated even if a power source voltage is low. The circuit structure of the present embodiment becomes simpler than a case where a booster circuit such as a DC-DC converter is used because a voltage controller is not required. Therefore, a low-cost and compact driving apparatus can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, the operation to discharge the energy transferred to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The signal P<b>2</b>, which is a discharge command signal, is generated in synchronization with the signal P<b>1</b>. The signal P<b>2</b> has a phase difference of 30 degrees with respect to the signal P<b>1</b>. The duty ratio of the signal P<b>2</b> is 5%, and the ON period (time) of the signal P<b>2</b> is shorter than that of the signal P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The switching circuit <b>6</b> is switched to the ON state during the ON period of the signal P<b>2</b>. Thereby, the energy accumulated in the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> is transferred to the inductor <b>7</b>, and then transferred to the power source <b>1</b>. The filter circuit included in the power source <b>1</b> and constituted by an inductor L<b>0</b> and a condenser C<b>0</b> can sufficiently cut the vibration frequency of the vibration type actuator, and most of the electric current of the vibration frequency component flows to the condenser C<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cycles of the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are the same because the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are formed by the pulse signals generated in the pulse generation circuit <b>8</b>. The voltage V<b>2</b> input to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> becomes an alternating signal that repeats increasing and decreasing like a sine wave by switching the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> alternately to the ON state. Further, the amount of the energy transferred to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> can be changed by changing the phase difference between the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. Thereby, it becomes possible to control the vibration amplitude of the vibrator <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, in the present embodiment, the pulse generation circuit <b>8</b>, which receives the frequency command from the command circuit <b>100</b>, generates the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. In other words, the booster circuit (the inductor <b>2</b> and MOSFET <b>3</b>) that inputs the amplified voltage V<b>2</b> to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> and the discharge circuit (the switching circuit <b>6</b>) that discharges the energy transferred to the piezoelectric element <b>5</b> are controlled using the same driving command for the vibration type actuator. Therefore, it is possible to make the circuit structure simple.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the waveform in each part of the circuit constituting the driving apparatus for the vibration type actuator, which is Embodiment 2 of the present invention. The circuit structure of the driving apparatus of the present embodiment is the same as that of Embodiment 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> and the voltages V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> are the same as those of Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In Embodiment 1, the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are switched to the ON state once in one cycle of the resonance frequency of the vibrator <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. On the other hand, in the present embodiment, the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are switched to the ON state more than once in one cycle of the resonance frequency of the vibrator <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In other words, there is a period in which the signal P<b>1</b> is switched to the ON state third times in a half cycle of the resonance frequency of the vibrator <b>200</b>, and there is a period in which the signal P<b>2</b> is switched to the ON state twice in the half cycle. In the case where the signal P<b>2</b> is switched to the ON state more than once after the signal P<b>1</b> is switched to the ON state more than once like this, the voltage V<b>2</b> becomes a alternating signal that repeats increasing and decreasing like a sine wave by giving them a phase difference.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, by reducing the time of each ON state of the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>, and switching them to the ON state more than once, it is possible to the inductance values of the inductors <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>, and thereby reducing the size of the inductors <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>. Reducing the size of the inductors <b>2</b> and <b>7</b> makes it possible to miniaturize the circuit constituting the driving apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The driving apparatus of the present embodiment controls the vibration amplitude of the vibrator <b>200</b> by changing the pulse width of the signals P<b>1</b> that is input to the gate of MOSFET <b>3</b> and the pulse width of the signals P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reference numeral <b>9</b> denotes a piezoelectric element, which is a vibration detection element. The piezoelectric element <b>9</b> constitutes part of the vibrator <b>200</b>. The piezoelectric element <b>9</b> detects the vibration of the vibrator <b>200</b>, and outputs the signal waveform corresponding to the vibration. Reference numeral <b>10</b> denotes a pulse width control circuit (controller), which compares the output signal from the piezoelectric element <b>9</b> with an amplitude command from the command circuit (CPU) <b>100</b>, and determines the pulse widths of the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> based on the comparison result. Then, the pulse width control circuit <b>10</b> outputs a pulse width command for generating the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> having the determined pulse widths to the pulse generation circuit <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an appearance in which the pulse widths of the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are changed according to the pulse width command from the pulse width control circuit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are switched to the ON state more than once in one cycle of the frequency of the main vibration component of the vibrator <b>200</b>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the pulse widths of the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are changed for controlling the vibration amplitude in the present embodiment, the vibration amplitude can be controlled by changing the frequency of the signals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> (the frequency of the main vibration component of the vibrator <b>200</b>). This is apparent from the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> showing the relationship between the frequency and the driving speed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, an example has been described, in which the vibration amplitude of the vibrator <b>200</b> is controlled in this embodiment.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, by providing a plurality of memory circuits, a waveform having a complicated shape can be formed using the waveform data output from these memory circuits.</p>
