<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to a hot-fillable, blow molded container made of polymer materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or other similar polyester materials, having at least one pair of panel sections capable of resisting undesirable deformation that accommodates reductions in product volume during cooling of a hot-filled product. The container has a pinch-grip within each of the at least one pair of panel sections facilitating container handling by a consumer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Packagers, to ensure adequate sterilization, often fill bottles and containers with liquids or products at an elevated temperature of approximately 180° F. to 205° F. (82° C. to 96° C.) and seal with a closure before cooling. Manufacturers generally refer to this as a “hot-fill” container or as a “hot-filling” process. As the sealed container cools, a slight vacuum, or negative pressure, forms inside causing the container to slightly change shape, particularly, when made of polymer materials and generally having a somewhat flexible nature.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, although not always, manufacturers produce these hot-fill containers in polyester materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), using a “stretch blow-molding” process, well known in the art, that substantially biaxially orients material molecular structure within the container. While PET materials are typical, other polymer materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and other polyesters, such as polyethylene naphthalate, are feasible using a variety of container production processes, also well known in the art, which may or may not establish the biaxial oriented material molecular structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Container and bottle designers attempting to control the change-in-shape from hot-fill often incorporate a plurality of generally recessed vacuum panels within a sidewall around the container's body. Those skilled in the art are well aware of a variety of vacuum panel configurations. The vacuum panels tend to focus the change-in-shape allowing the container to retain a pleasing generally uniform appearance. Retaining the pleasing generally uniform appearance is an important consideration to the packager and its customers. If the container should collapse in an un-uniform manner, the container appearance becomes less pleasing and the customer becomes reluctant to purchase, believing the product damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Containers having a capacity between approximately one liter and three liters often feature a grip means to facilitate handling by the consumer, that is, to facilitate an easy confident grip of the container by thumb and forefingers of a hand. Accordingly, container and bottle designers often incorporate a grip surface typically within two diametrically apposed vacuum panels thereby allowing the vacuum panels to function together as a convenient grip or pinch-grip. Often the entire vacuum panel becomes the grip; however, the grip can also be a subsection of a substantially larger vacuum panel. Those skilled in the art are aware of a variety of grip-vacuum-panel configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Packagers often place one or more spot labels on arcuate container surfaces between the grip-vacuum panels that often have a plurality of relatively shallow recessed ribs to increase rigidity, thus rendering these arcuate surfaces between the grip- or pinch-grip-vacuum panels unavailable to receive other generally recessed vacuum panels in addition to those used for the grip. Often containers having pinch-grip vacuum panels have only the two diametrically apposed vacuum panels, each with a grip surface, which must accommodate all vacuum related forces to the container while retaining the pleasing generally uniform appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Containers having only two large diametrically apposed vacuum panels and the generally circular cross-sectional configuration are particularly vulnerable to unwanted changes-in-shape if the panels do not properly accommodate the vacuum related forces often causing the container to twist and assume a more oval cross-sectional or skewed oval cross-sectional configuration generally unpleasing to the consumer or customer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Packagers attempting to reduce cost, require containers to have less material or to be lighter in weight. Said differently, the sidewall of the container has a thinner thickness and therefore is not as rigid. Accordingly, containers lighter in weight are particularly vulnerable to unwanted changes-in-shape, a particular problem for containers having the pinch-grip and otherwise a generally circular cross-sectional configuration featuring only two diametrically apposed vacuum panels with spot-labeling surfaces between. To function properly, the vacuum panels must be extremely flexible relative to other areas of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, while the panels accommodate vacuum related forces, the grip surfaces themselves must resist pinch-grip related forces from thumb and forefingers of the hand while the consumer pours contents from the container. Consequently, pinch-grip vacuum panels must be both ridged and flexible. Ridged to allow the customer or consumer to grip the container with ease and confidence, and flexible to accommodate vacuum related forces while retaining a uniform generally circular cross-sectional configuration without skewed oval cross-sectional appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the inventor has discovered a new and novel pinch-grip vacuum panel combination providing controlled flexibility necessary to accommodate vacuum related forces thereby retaining the pleasing generally uniform appearance of the polymer container, while providing the rigidity necessary to function as a grip, thereby providing confidence to the consumer while handling the container.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A container made of polymer materials includes a neck finish portion suitable for receiving a closure, a shoulder portion adjacent the neck finish portion, a body portion adjacent the shoulder portion, and a bottom portion adjacent the body portion. The body portion includes a sidewall having at least one pair of substantially diametrically apposed vacuum panels. Each of the at least one pair of diametrically apposed vacuum panels include a pinch-grip portion formed therein and a flexible-field adjacent to the pinch-grip portion. The pinch-grip portion includes a bridge with a tongue portion extending into the flexible-field.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The vacuum panel with the pinch-grip portion has an edge and the bridge has an end adjacent the edge. The flexible-field has an overall generally convex surface appearance in cross section. The edge has an adjacent zone that generally pivots in a hinge-like action and the convex surface transitions into a generally overall concave surface, both in response to an external force. The flexible-field has a plurality of indented dimples arranged in uniformly spaced positions forming a series of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows. The uniformly spaced positions of the plurality of indented dimples form a series of substantially horizontal, vertical, and diagonal flex-lines extending between the dimples.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The container manufacturer typically makes the container of substantially a polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene material and the polyester typically is substantially polyethylene terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">From the following description, the appended claims, and the accompanying drawings, additional benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which this invention relates.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a hot-fillable container <b>10</b> made of a polymer material, such as polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or other polymer materials. Container <b>10</b> has a neck finish portion <b>12</b> with an opening <b>13</b> suitable to receive a closure (not shown), a shoulder portion <b>14</b>, a body portion <b>16</b>, and a bottom portion <b>18</b> all having a centerline <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Body portion <b>16</b> features an indented vacuum panel <b>22</b> having a pinch-grip <b>24</b> with grip ridges <b>25</b>, a flexible-field <b>26</b>, and a bridge <b>28</b> with a tongue <b>30</b> extending across pinch-grip <b>24</b> and into flexible-field <b>26</b>. Container <b>10</b> has an overall height H. To be most effective, vacuum panel <b>22</b> has a height h approximating that of body portion <b>16</b> that in turn is approximately 50 to 75 percent of the container <b>10</b> height H. Those skilled in the art realize grip ridges <b>25</b> create indentations that allow fingers and thumb of an average hand to effectively secure a hold to the container <b>10</b> while handling and can be any convenient configuration, such as vertical ridges (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), horizontal ridges, dimples, roughened texturing, and the like. Shoulder portion <b>14</b> features a groove <b>36</b> useful for stiffening container <b>10</b> thereby helping container <b>10</b> to retain a generally uniform configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of container <b>10</b> showing indented vacuum panels <b>22</b> on two sides of body portion <b>16</b> and therebetween an arcuate surface <b>34</b> with indented ribs <b>32</b> useful for stiffening arcuate surface <b>34</b>. Indented ribs <b>32</b> extend horizontally across arcuate surface <b>34</b>, and are relatively evenly spaced extending from the top to the bottom of body portion <b>16</b>. Arcuate surface <b>34</b> typically receives a label <b>35</b> shown in phantom line that covers all of the ribs <b>32</b>; moreover, container <b>10</b> has two arcuate surfaces <b>34</b>, both of which typically receive label <b>35</b>. In addition, arcuate surface <b>34</b> has a chordal length generally corresponding to a width of vacuum panel <b>22</b> that is a compromise between balancing vacuum panel <b>22</b> effectiveness, pinch-grip <b>24</b> suitable to fit the average hand, and desired size of label <b>35</b>. Bottom portion <b>18</b> features a notch <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) useful for uniformly positioning the container <b>10</b> on a filling-line (not illustrated) so as to accurately receive label <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a bottom view of container <b>10</b> showing its generally circular configuration about centerline <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, container manufacturers will manufacture container <b>10</b> using a well-known stretch-molding heat-setting process wherein, the polymer material is generally molecularly oriented, that is, the polymer material molecular structure is mostly biaxially oriented. The exception is that the molecular structure of some material within the neck finish portion <b>12</b> and some material within sub-portions of the bottom portion <b>18</b> may not be substantially biaxially oriented.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The well-known stretch-molding heat-setting process for making the hot-fillable container <b>10</b> generally involves first manufacture of a preform (not illustrated) of a polyester material, such as polyethylene terephthalate, having a shape well known to those skilled in the art similar to a test-tube with a generally cylindrical cross-section with a length approximately 50 percent that of the container height. A machine (not illustrated) places the preform heated to a temperature between approximately 190° F. to 250° F. (88° C. to 121° C.) into a mold cavity (not illustrated) having a shape similar to the container <b>10</b> and at a temperature between approximately 250° F. to 350° F. (121° C. to 176° C.). A stretch rod apparatus (not illustrated) stretches or extends the heated preform within the mold cavity to a length approximately that of the container thereby molecularly orienting the polyester material in an axial direction generally corresponding with centerline <b>20</b>. While the stretch rod is extending the preform, air having a pressure between 300 PSI to 600 PSI (2.068 MPa to 4.137 MPa) assists extending the preform in the axial direction while expanding the preform in a circumferential or hoop direction thereby substantially conforming the polyester material to the shape of the mold cavity and further molecularly orienting the polyester material in a direction generally perpendicular to the axial direction thus establishing the biaxial molecular orientation of the polyester material in most of the container. The pressurized air holds the mostly biaxially oriented polyester material against the mold cavity for a period of approximately 2 to 5 seconds before removal of the container from the mold cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-section view taken along line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing a pair of diametrically apposed indented vacuum panels <b>22</b> with their indented pinch-grip <b>24</b>, and flexible-field <b>26</b> featuring a plurality of dimples <b>27</b>, each dimple <b>27</b> having a depth approximately half that of its width. Preferably, dimples <b>27</b> have uniform relatively close spacing in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows and have a generally hemispherical shape indented inward generally in a direction toward centerline <b>20</b>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that polygonal shapes for dimple <b>27</b>, such as square, rectangle, diamond, and the like, could be equally effective. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates rib interior surface <b>32</b>′ of indented rib <b>32</b> and groove interior surface <b>36</b>′ of groove <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Between the dimples <b>27</b> is a plurality of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal flex areas illustratively represented in phantom as flex lines <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Container <b>10</b> has an overall average wall thickness. Some areas of container <b>10</b> are thicker than other areas. In general, a natural by-product of the stretch-molding heat-setting process for making the hot-fillable container <b>10</b> is that wall thickness varies. The flexible-field <b>26</b> uses this natural variation to its advantage. The wall thickness of each dimple <b>27</b> will tend to be slightly thicker than the wall thickness adjacent and between any two dimples, particularly if the space between any two dimples is approximately equal to the depth of the dimple, consequently establishing horizontal, vertical, and diagonal flex lines <b>40</b> between any two horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows of dimples <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of container <b>10</b> taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing one indented vacuum panel <b>22</b> with its indented pinch-grip <b>24</b>, and a cross-sectional view of bridge <b>28</b> having bridge sidewalls <b>48</b> and a bridge crown <b>50</b>. Container <b>10</b> is for hot-fill applications where bottlers fill the container <b>10</b> with a liquid or product at an elevated temperature between approximately 180° F. to 205° F. (82° C. to 96° C.) and seal with a closure before cooling (not illustrated). As the sealed container cools, a slight vacuum, or negative pressure, forms inside causing the container to slightly change shape, particularly, when made of lightweight polymer materials and thus generally having a somewhat flexible nature.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Dashed line <b>44</b> illustrates a new position for vacuum panel <b>22</b> and pinch-grip <b>24</b> generally moving toward centerline <b>20</b> in response to vacuum related forces. While not illustrated, those skilled in the art will recognize that the diametrically apposed vacuum panel <b>22</b> and pinch-grip <b>24</b> also move toward centerline <b>20</b>. A substantially continuous rounded edge <b>38</b> surrounds vacuum panel <b>22</b>. Rounded edge <b>38</b> generally establishes a pivot point allowing the vacuum panel <b>22</b> to pivot in a hinge-like action when responding to external or vacuum related forces. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for convenience illustrate the hinge-like action as relatively confined at rounded edge <b>38</b>, the hinge-like action is generally a focused bending within a zone adjacent to either side of the rounded edge <b>38</b>, that is, rounded edge <b>38</b> is approximately center to the zone.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Bridge <b>28</b> with bridge sidewalls <b>48</b> divide pinch-grip <b>24</b> into an upper grip area <b>54</b> and a lower grip area <b>56</b> thereby respectively allowing the upper grip area <b>54</b> and the lower grip area <b>56</b> to generally retain its shape. However, as with the space between any two dimples <b>27</b>, bridge <b>28</b> has a depth approximately equal to its width thereby causing the wall thickness within the bridge crown <b>50</b> adjacent to pinch-grip <b>24</b> to be relatively thinner than bridge sidewalls <b>48</b> allowing localized bending (illustrated by reference numeral <b>52</b>) to occur in response to vacuum related forces.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an enlarged partial cross-sectional view of one vacuum panel <b>22</b>, a view otherwise similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, showing flexible-field <b>26</b> having a generally convex curvature as illustrated by first flexible-field phantom line <b>42</b>. Dashed line <b>44</b> illustrates a new position for vacuum panel <b>22</b> and pinch-grip <b>24</b> generally moving toward centerline <b>20</b> in response to vacuum related forces causing flexible-field <b>26</b> to invert into a generally concave curvature as illustrated by second flexible-field phantom line <b>46</b> to become generally an inverted flexible-field <b>26</b>′. The bridge <b>28</b> with an end adjacent to rounded edge <b>38</b> crosses pinch-grip <b>24</b>. At an opposite end of bridge <b>28</b> is tongue <b>30</b> extending into flexible-field <b>26</b>. Tongue <b>30</b> helps initiate the inversion into the inverted flexible-field <b>26</b>′ with repositioned tongue <b>30</b>′ as the end adjacent to rounded edge <b>38</b> of bridge <b>28</b> and pinch-grip <b>24</b> generally pivots about rounded edge <b>38</b>, thereby providing vacuum panel <b>22</b> with its pinch-grip <b>24</b> the controlled flexibility necessary to accommodate vacuum related forces that otherwise would not be possible. Accordingly, container <b>10</b> retains a pleasing generally uniform appearance, while providing necessary rigidity to function as a grip thereby providing confidence to the consumer while handling the container.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the preferred embodiment of container <b>10</b> features two diametrically apposed indented vacuum panels <b>22</b> each with indented pinch-grip <b>24</b>, those skilled in the art will recognize that container <b>10</b> can have additional vacuum panels placed within the shoulder portion <b>14</b> and/or additional vacuum panels with or without pinch-grip features in the arcuate surface <b>34</b>. The foregoing describes the preferred embodiment and certain alternatives, and one must understand that other variations are feasible that do not depart from the spirit and scope of the inventions as defined by the appended claims.</p>
