<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for applying a test voltage from the external of a memory device in a burn-in test mode.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is well known in general that the burn-in test is carried out to test a semiconductor device in the extreme environment of high temperature and high pressure, which verifies the reliability of the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional burn-in test scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a test mode unit <b>100</b> is a circuit to output a burn-in test signal tm_bi in a test mode. A high voltage generator <b>101</b> is a circuit to generate a high voltage VPP applied to wordlines of a memory device. A wordline driver <b>102</b> applies the high voltage VPP to a wordline. A reference voltage generator <b>103</b> for core voltage generates a reference voltage VREFC. A core voltage generator <b>104</b> outputs a core voltage. Here, the core voltage means a voltage used in a bank region of a memory device. And, a block <b>11</b> depicts a high voltage transfer route, while a block <b>12</b> depicts a core voltage transfer route. In reference, the core voltage is a high-level voltage stored in a memory cell and the reference voltage VREFC is a half level (½) of the core voltage. The core voltage Vcore provided from the core voltage generator <b>104</b> is used as a driving voltage of a bitline sense amplifier <b>105</b>. The core voltage Vcore is transferred to bitlines Bit and /Bit by the bitline sense amplifier <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional case as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a burn-in test is carried out with the high voltage and the core voltage which are made within a memory device. In other word, after the burn-in test signal tm_bi as a control signal generated from the test mode unit <b>100</b> enables the high voltage generator <b>101</b> and the reference voltage generator <b>103</b>, the high voltage and the core voltage (i.e., a burn-in test voltage) are applied to the wordline and bitline.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With such a scheme using the internal burn-in test voltages for a burn-in test mode, there are several disadvantages as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">1) It is difficult to generate accurate voltage levels of the burn-in test voltages (voltage levels of the high voltage and the core voltage);</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">2) It would occur shortness of the burn-in test voltage levels under required voltage levels because of process variations, which degrades the screen ability thereof; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">3) It would result in an overkill effect when the internal burn-in test voltages are very higher than the required voltage levels.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to provide an internal voltage generator capable of performing a reliable burn-in test operation by applying a test voltage from the external of a memory device during a burn-in test mode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an internal voltage generator for a burn-in test comprising pad means for receiving an external voltage; switch means being turned on in a burn-in test mode; and receiving means for receiving the external voltage. The external voltage applied to the pad means is transferred to the receiving means through the switch means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A test mode unit is further comprised for controlling an operation of the switch means.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the embodiment of the present invention, the receiving means comprises a wordline driver used in a memory device, and a reference voltage generator for core voltage. The external voltage includes first and second voltages. The pad means includes first and second pads. The switch means includes first and second switches. The first voltage is applied to the high voltage generator through the first pad. The second voltage is applied to the reference voltage generator for core voltage through the second pad.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present invention, an internal voltage generator for a burn-in test applies an external voltage to a memory device through pad means of the memory device and then generates an internal voltage for the burn-in test.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made in greater detail to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an internal voltage generator for a burn-in test mode according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a test mode unit <b>200</b> is a circuit to output a burn-in test signal tm_bi in a test mode. A high voltage generator <b>201</b> is a circuit to generate a high voltage VPP applied to wordlines of a memory device. A wordline driver <b>202</b> applies the high voltage VPP to a wordline. A reference voltage generator <b>203</b> for core voltage generates a reference voltage VREFC. A core voltage generator <b>204</b> outputs a core voltage. The core voltage Vcore provided from the core voltage generator <b>204</b> is used as a driving voltage of a bitline sense amplifier <b>205</b>. The core voltage Vcore is transferred to bitlines Bit and /Bit by the bitline sense amplifier <b>205</b>. In reference, a block <b>22</b> depicts a high voltage transfer route, while a block <b>21</b> depicts a core voltage transfer route.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a normal operation mode, but not in a burn in test mode, the test mode unit <b>200</b> outputs a test signal of low level to maintain the switches <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> in a turn-off state. Therefore, if a current operation mode is not the burn-in test mode, the block <b>22</b> of high voltage transfer route and the block <b>21</b> of core voltage transfer route perform their normal operations. In other words, the high voltage generator <b>210</b> and the core voltage generator <b>204</b> carry out their normal operations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the burn-in test mode, the switches <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> are turned on by the burn-in test signal tm_bi generated from the test mode unit <b>200</b>. Here, the switches <b>208</b> and <b>209</b> include NMOS transistors, PMOS transistors, and transmission gates. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the switches as structured of NMOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A first external voltage is applied to a pad <b>206</b> connected to the switch <b>208</b>. The first external voltage is a high voltage for the burn-in test and the pad <b>206</b> may be assigned to a CKE pad (e.g., for a clock enable signal) of a memory device. The first external voltage is transferred to a wordline driver <b>202</b> through the pad <b>206</b> and the switch <b>208</b>. During the burn-in test mode, the high voltage generator <b>201</b> is maintained in a disable state. Thus, the wordline driver <b>202</b> applies the first external voltage directly to a wordline. As a result, a stress voltage by the first external voltage is applied to a gate oxide of a cell transistor coupled to the wordline.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, a second external voltage (a reference voltage) is applied to a pad <b>207</b> connected to the switch <b>209</b>. The second external voltage is a reference voltage for the burn-in test and the pad <b>207</b> may be assigned to a Vref pad. The second external voltage is applied to the reference voltage generator <b>203</b> for the core voltage by way of the switch <b>209</b> and then the reference voltage VREFC of a predetermined voltage level is generated from the reference generator <b>203</b>. It is desirable for the reference voltage VREFC to have the same voltage level of the second external voltage. The reference voltage VREFC generated from the reference generator <b>203</b> for core voltage is applied to the core voltage generator <b>204</b>. The core voltage generator <b>204</b> outputs the core voltage VCORE that is used as a driving voltage for the bitline sense amplifier <b>205</b>. The core voltage VCORE is transferred to a bitline by the bitline sense amplifier <b>205</b>. As a result, the core voltage VCORE is supplied to a cell capacitor as a stress voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a more accurate burn-in test operation by applying a burn-in test voltage, to be used in a semiconductor device, through an external pad during a burn-in test mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According further to the aforementioned, the present invention is able to apply an external voltage into a semiconductor device through an external pad during a burn-in test mode, and obtains the merits as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">1) It is possible to generate accurate voltage levels of the burn-in test voltages (voltage levels of the high voltage and the core voltage);</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">2) It reduces fluctuation of the burn-in test voltage levels due to process variations; and</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">3) It lightens an overkill effect to increase a product yield because a test voltage with a required voltage level can be applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims.</p>
