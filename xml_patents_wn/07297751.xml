<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to and the benefit of Russian Patent Application No. 2004-131492, filed on Oct. 28, 2004, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to new photochromic monomers, new photochromic polymers, and methods of obtaining them to create new information technologies, photocontrolled electroluminescent and electroconductive devices including displays and photoswitched polymer light diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flexible and relief displays and light emitting diodes that use organic electroluminescent and electroconductive polymers and polyazomethines or condensation nitrogen containing heterochain polymers have been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A drawback of such polymer materials is that their electroluminescence and electroconductivity are not controlled by light. However, new properties of these polymers expand their functions in the field of photonics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides photochromic electroluminescent and electroconductive polymers, the properties of which become reversibly photocontrollable due to the introduction of photochromic fragments into their structure. Consequently, such polymers have expanded functional possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Photochromic polymers of this type are suitable for use in the development of photochromic materials for various fields of photonics (“Applied Photochromic Polymer Systems.” McArdle C. B., Ed. Blackie, Glasgow, 1992; Barachevsky V. A. “Photochromic organic media: state-of-the-art and future.” Proc. SPIE, vol. 2968, 77-86, 1997). Use of the proposed electroconductive and electroluminescent polymers with photochromic fragments opens the prospects for development of a different type of display with double photo- and electrocontrol.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thermally irreversible photochromic conversions, which are characteristic for compounds of the class of dihetarylethenes, are successfully used to create photochromic registering mediums providing for the development of a three-dimensional bitwise operative optical memory (M. Irie “Dihetarylethenes for Memories and Switches,” Chem. Reviews, vol. 100, 1685-1716, 2000). The inclusion of photochromic fragments into a polymer chain makes it possible to improve developed photochromic registering media due to an increase of the concentration of photochromic molecules in a polymer medium and a sharp reduction of their diffusion displacement. The result of such an improvement is a substantial increase in the information capacity. The absence of mutual thermal conversion of the two forms of dihetarylethene molecules used as photochromic fragments of polymers expands the field of use of reversive photochromic radiation photoswitches (J. A. Delaire, K. Nakatani “Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Photochromic Molecules and Materials,” Chem. Reviews, vol., 100, 1817-1845, 2000).</p>

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention discloses the use of the following dihetarylethene functional groups in the following Structural Formula 1 to form structural photochromic monomers to obtain photocontrolled electroluminescent and electroconductive polymers.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in the following Equation 1, the photochromism of diarylethenes (DAE) includes reversible photocyclization, i.e., in a photoinduced transition from an open form (OF) A to a cyclic form (CF) B.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Photochromic monomers 1,2-bis(2-methyl-6-formyl-1-benzothiophen-3-yl) cyclopentenes 5a-e from the class of photochromic monomers that comprise benzothiophene fragments linked by a cyclopentene bridge were synthesized using benzothiophenes 2a-e according to the reaction presented in Equation 2.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The initial benzothiophenes 2a-e were obtained according to the following methods. 2-methylbenzothiophene (2a) was prepared according to “Synthesis of sulfides, thiophenes and thiols of the type of compounds encountered in oil,” edited by E. N. Karaulova, Pub. “Nauka,” 1988, p. 180 which is incorporated by reference. 2,4-dimethylbenzothiophene and 2,7-dimethylbenzothiophene (2b, 2c were prepared according to Monatsh. Chem. 1960, 91, and 1070, which is incorporated by reference. 2,4-dimethylbenzothiophene and 2,6-dimethylbenzothiophene (2d, 2e) were prepared according to J.Chem.Soc., Chem.Com. 1974, 5, 174, which is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The synthesis of 1,2-bis(2-methyl-6-formyl-1-benzothiophen-3-yl) cyclopentenes 5a-e includes acylation of the benzothiophenes 2a-e with a dichloranhydride of glutaric acid in methylene chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride. The synthesis further includes the subsequent reductive cyclization of the obtained diketones 3a-e, which was distinguished in that the compounds 4a-e were obtained with about 60% to about 73% yield in the case of cyclization of diketones 3a-e under the action of TiCl<sub>4</sub>, Zn in THF in the presence of pyridine. In contrast, literature provides a description of the preparation of the compound 4a by cyclization of diketone 3a under the action of TiCl<sub>4</sub>, Zn in THF with a yield of 54% (Synthesis 1998, 1092-1094). The subsequent formulation of products 4a-e by dichloromethyl ether in nitrobenzene in the presence of aluminum chloride results in the formation of 1,2-bis(2-methyl-6-formyl-1-benzothiophen-3-yl) cyclopentenes 5a-e.</p>

Then the solution was applied onto a quartz substrate using a centrifuge. As a result, a photochromic film was obtained and the absorption spectra of form A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, curve <b>1</b>) and form B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, curve <b>2</b>), and also kinetic photocoloring curves (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, curve <b>1</b>) and photodecoloring curves (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, curve <b>2</b>) were measured according to the method of Example 1. A reduction of the photoinduced optical density under the action of visual light demonstrates the reversibility of photochromic conversions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, curve <b>3</b>). The obtained spectral-kinetic data provide evidence of the photochromism of the obtained sample of photochromic film.</p>
