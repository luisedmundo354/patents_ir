<p id="p-0001" num="0000">One-to-many comparisons of callers'voice prints with known voice prints to identify any matches between them. When a customer communicates with a particular entity, such as a customer service center, the system makes a recording of the real-time call including both the customer's and agent's voices. The system segments the recording to extract at least a portion of the customer's voice to create a customer voice print, and it formats the segmented voice print for network transmission to a server. The server compares the customer's voice print with multiple known voice prints to determine any matches, meaning that the customer's voice print and one of the known voice prints are likely from the same person. The identification of any matches can be used for a variety of purposes, such as determining whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to limiting fraud, and more particularly, relates to an apparatus and method for performing a one-to-many comparison of voice prints to determine if a particular caller voice print matches any one of many known voice prints in order to perform an action related to a financial transaction account.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Preventing attempted fraud in telephonic or other transactions involving oral communications is typically important to many entities, particularly when the fraud involves financial transactions. For example, when a person loses a credit card and calls the credit card company to obtain a replacement, the credit card company often wants to ensure that the person calling is the true cardholder. If a person attempts to fraudulently obtain a replacement card of a different cardholder, then the person may use the replacement credit card to make fraudulent charges. The credit card company can often incur significant losses due to these fraudulent charges. Therefore, the credit card company typically desires to reduce or eliminate fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In that regard, credit card companies often implement certain procedures and install technologies in an attempt to verify the identity of customers who call them. One such technology is the use of an Automatic Number Identification (ANI) service, which attempts to identify the telephone number of an incoming call. A credit card company can maintain a database of area codes from which it has historically received a high number of fraudulent callers. If the telephone number of the person calling is within one of those high fraud area codes, the credit card company can flag the call for additional procedures or investigation to verify the true identity of the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the ANI service has certain limitations. For example, the ANI service does not easily permit one to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the caller. Also, it is possible that multiple persons can be associated with the same telephone number, which can make it difficult to identify which of those persons is the caller. Ultimately, the ANI service only provides a general indication of whether the caller is from an area known to be associated with a high number of fraudulent transactions. However, if the caller is not calling from one of those high fraud area codes, the ANI service provides no indication to provide additional screening, although the caller may actually be attempting to actually engage in fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aside from credit card companies, many other entities receive calls from customers and desire a way to verify the true identity of the callers. This verification can be useful, for example, in determining whether to execute a particular transaction requested by a caller. Accordingly, a need exists for a more reliable way to minimize fraud in telephonic transactions or other transactions involving oral communications, or to screen callers for other purposes during those transactions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method and apparatus consistent with the present invention provides for facilitating the analysis of a caller's voice to determine a potential match with known callers'voices. In the method and apparatus, an agent receives a communication from a caller, and an electronic representation is recorded of both the caller's and agent's voices from the real-time telephone call. The electronic representation of the caller's voice is segmented from the agent's voice to produce a caller voice print, and the caller voice print is compared with a plurality of known voice prints to determine if the caller voice print matches any of the known voice prints. An indication of the comparison is output or otherwise transmitted via a network and can be used for a variety of purposes.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention herein makes reference to the accompanying drawings and pictures, which show the exemplary embodiment by way of illustration and its best mode. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical and mechanical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation. For example, the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments consistent with the present invention provide for one-to-few or one-to-many comparisons of callers' voice prints with known voice prints to identify any matches between them. A caller's voice print represents an electronic recording of a caller's voice, and the known voice prints represent electronic recordings of persons having a particular known characteristic. For example, the known voice prints can correspond with persons known to have engaged in attempted fraudulent transactions. Alternatively, the characteristic for the known voice prints may relate to other factors or criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When a customer calls a particular entity, such as a customer service center, the system makes a recording of the real-time call including both the customer's and agent's voices. The system segments the recording to extract at least a portion of the customer's voice to create a customer voice print, typically in digital form for computer processing. The system also formats the segmented customer voice print for network transmission to a server. Although the processing may occur locally, in some embodiments it can occur at a remote server, requiring network transmission of the customer's voice print. Also, the term customer is used for exemplary purposes and is intended to include any type of caller (e.g., merchant, travel agent, cardholder, agent of cardholder, processor, administrator, and/or the like) and any type of communication (e.g., human or electronic voice).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The server compares the customer's voice print with multiple known voice prints to determine any substantial matches, meaning that the customer's voice print and one of the known voice prints are likely from the same person. The identification of any matches can be used for a variety of purposes, such as determining whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer. For example, a cardholder may call a credit card institution to request replacement of a lost or stolen credit card. The credit card institution wants to ensure that the person calling is the true cardholder and not someone attempting to fraudulently obtain another person's credit card. By comparing the customer's voice print with the multiple known voice prints, associated with persons having attempted fraudulent transactions, the system can determine whether this customer is likely attempting to interact with another person's credit card account based upon any matches with the known voice prints.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As other examples, the system and method disclosed herein may be used to help minimize any fraud related to telephone communications, merchant communications, travel communications, cardholder communications, opening a transaction card account, closing a transaction card account, opening a related transaction account, changing demographic information related to the account and changing financial information related to the transaction card account.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An “account” or “account number”, as used herein, may include any device, code, number, letter, symbol, digital certificate, smart chip, digital signal, analog signal, biometric or other identifier/indicia suitably configured to allow the consumer to interact or communicate with the system, such as, for example, authorization/access code, personal identification number (PIN), Internet code, other identification code, and/or the like which is optionally located on a rewards card, charge card, credit card, debit card, prepaid card, telephone card, smart card, magnetic stripe card, bar code card, transponder, radio frequency card and/or the like. The account number may be distributed and stored in any form of plastic, electronic, magnetic, radio frequency, wireless, audio and/or optical device capable of transmitting or downloading data from itself to a second device. A customer account number may be, for example, a sixteen-digit credit card number, although each credit provider has its own numbering system, such as the fifteen-digit numbering system used by American Express. Each company's credit card numbers comply with that company's standardized format such that the company using a sixteen-digit format will generally use four spaced sets of numbers, as represented by the number “0000 0000 0000 0000”. The first five to seven digits are reserved for processing purposes and identify the issuing bank, card type and etc. In this example, the last sixteenth digit is used as a sum check for the sixteen-digit number. The intermediary eight-to-ten digits are used to uniquely identify the customer. A merchant account number may be, for example, any number or alpha-numeric characters that identifies a particular merchant for purposes of card acceptance, account reconciliation, reporting, or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Network Environment</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an exemplary system <b>10</b> for processing calls. System <b>10</b> includes an agent computer <b>18</b> having a connection via a network <b>16</b> with a server computer <b>14</b>. Agent computer <b>18</b> also includes an associated agent telephone or other oral communication device <b>20</b>. System <b>10</b> includes a customer telephone or other oral communication device <b>24</b> for a customer or other type of caller to contact an agent at agent telephone <b>20</b> via a communications network <b>22</b>. While the system will be described herein with respect to telephone communications, one skilled in the art will appreciate that any communication device now known or hereinafter developed may also be used in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For the sake of brevity, conventional data networking, application development and other functional aspects of the systems (and components of the individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical connections may be present in a practical electronic transaction system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system may include a host server or other computing systems including a processor for processing digital data, a memory coupled to said processor for storing digital data, an input digitizer coupled to the processor for inputting digital data, an application program stored in said memory and accessible by said processor for directing processing of digital data by said processor, a display coupled to the processor and memory for displaying information derived from digital data processed by said processor and a plurality of databases, said databases including client data, merchant data, financial institution data and/or like data that could be used in association with the present invention. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, user computer will typically include an operating system (e.g., Windows NT, 95/98/2000, Linux, Solaris, etc.) as well as various conventional support software and drivers typically associated with computers. Customer computer can be in a home or business environment with access to a network. In an exemplary embodiment, access is through the Internet through a commercially-available web-browser software package.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Communication between the parties to the transaction and the system of the present invention may be accomplished through any suitable communication means, such as, for example, a telephone network, Intranet, Internet, point of interaction device (point of sale device, personal digital assistant, cellular phone, kiosk, etc.), online communications, off-line communications, wireless communications, transponder communications and/or the like. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that, for security reasons, any databases, systems, or components of the present invention may consist of any combination of databases or components at a single location or at multiple locations, wherein each database or system includes any of various suitable security features, such as firewalls, access codes, encryption, de-encryption, compression, decompression, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In use, a customer at customer telephone <b>24</b> calls a particular number which facilitates contacting agent telephone <b>20</b>. For example, the number could include a customer service help line for a particular entity or institution. Although only one agent computer and telephone are shown, system <b>10</b> may include multiple agent computers and telephones, such as in a call center, for receiving calls from customers, and a particular customer's call from customer telephone <b>24</b> can be routed to an available agent via a switching device such as a private branch exchange (PBX). Upon reaching an agent, customer telephone <b>24</b> is in communication with agent telephone <b>20</b> via communications network <b>22</b>. Communication network <b>22</b> can include any wireline or wireless network for telephone calls.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As an example, a voice print can be created from a call answered by a voice response or potentially a point of sale system. In this example, a call is answered by a live agent. Alternatively, the agent telephone can be controlled programmatically by the agent computer to record only the caller's voice without a live agent on the call.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">During the telephone call, agent computer <b>18</b> records at least a portion of the telephone call. The recording, possibly after additional processing, is transmitted via network <b>16</b> to server computer <b>14</b> for processing of the customer's voice print, as explained below. Server computer <b>14</b> can access a database <b>12</b> to retrieve information for the processing. Upon completing the processing, server computer <b>14</b> can optionally transmit back to agent computer <b>18</b> the results of the processing. Network <b>16</b> can include any wireline or wireless network for data transmission such as, for example, a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described herein, the computing units may be connected with each other via a data communication network. The network may be a public network and assumed to be insecure and open to eavesdroppers. In the illustrated implementation, the network may be embodied as the internet. In this context, the computers may or may not be connected to the internet at all times. For instance, the customer computer may employ a modem to occasionally connect to the internet, whereas the bank computing center might maintain a permanent connection to the internet. Specific information related to the protocols, standards, and application software utilized in connection with the Internet may not be discussed herein.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The systems may be suitably coupled to network via data links. A variety of conventional communications media and protocols may be used for data links. Such as, for example, a connection to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) over the local loop as is typically used in connection with standard modem communication, cable modem, Dish networks, ISDN, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), or various wireless communication methods. Merchant system might also reside within a local area network (LAN) which interfaces to network via a leased line (T1 , D3, etc.). Such communication methods are well known in the art, and are covered in a variety of standard texts.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Agent telephone <b>20</b> can receive calls via communications network <b>22</b> from a variety of customer telephones. For example, the telephones discussed herein can include a conventional wireline telephone, a wireless or mobile telephone, a speaker phone, an Internet Protocol (IP) telephone, or a personal computer (PC) telephone. In addition, although shown separately in this example, agent telephone <b>20</b> and agent computer <b>18</b> can be implemented with the same or different physical devices. If agent telephone <b>20</b> is implemented with a PC telephone, in a particular embodiment, then that embodiment may not need agent computer <b>18</b>, as the telephone would contain computing capabilities, and computer <b>18</b> may represent a switch in that embodiment to route calls to PC telephone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of a exemplary computer <b>30</b> illustrating typical components of server computer <b>14</b> and agent computer <b>18</b>. Computer <b>30</b> can include a connection with network <b>16</b> such as the Internet through any suitable network connection. Computer <b>30</b> typically includes a memory <b>32</b>, a secondary storage device <b>40</b>, a processor <b>42</b>, an input device <b>36</b> for entering information into computer <b>30</b>, a display device <b>38</b> for providing a visual display of information, and an output device <b>44</b> for outputting information such as in hard copy or audio form.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Memory <b>32</b> may include random access memory (RAM) or similar types of memory, and it may store one or more applications <b>34</b> for execution by processor <b>42</b>. Applications <b>34</b> can include a voice component, implemented in software for example, for recognition and processing of voice prints, as explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Secondary storage device <b>40</b> may include a hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, CD-ROM drive, or other types of non-volatile data storage. Processor <b>42</b> may execute applications or programs stored in memory <b>34</b> or secondary storage <b>40</b>, or received from the Internet or other network <b>16</b>. Although computer <b>30</b> is depicted with various components, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the server and agent computers can contain different components.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Voice Print Comparison Methodology</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The exemplary network described above can perform one-to-one, one-to-few or one-to-many comparisons of voice prints between callers and known voice prints. In one embodiment with one-to-many comparisons, the comparison can determine whether a caller's voice print matches any of the known voice prints in the database. The known voice prints can correspond with any particular criteria. For example, the known voice prints may correspond with individuals known to have attempted fraudulent transactions in the past. Therefore, by knowing if a caller's voice print matches any of the known voice prints, in this example, the system can provide an indication of whether this particular caller will likely attempt a fraudulent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the processing for recording callers'voice prints and making the comparison typically occurs at both agent computer <b>18</b> and server computer <b>14</b>. However, the processing may occur remotely at server computer <b>14</b>, locally at agent computer <b>18</b>, or divided among multiple computers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention may be described herein in terms of functional block components, screen shots, optional selections and various processing steps. It should be appreciated that such functional blocks may be realized by any number of hardware and/or software components configured to perform the specified functions. For example, the present invention may employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more microprocessors or other control devices. Similarly, the software elements of the present invention may be implemented with any programming or scripting language such as C, C++, Java, COBOL, assembler, PERL, Visual Basic, SQL Stored Procedures, extensible markup language (XML), with the various algorithms being implemented with any combination of data structures, objects, processes, routines or other programming elements. Further, it should be noted that the present invention may employ any number of conventional techniques for data transmission, signaling, data processing, network control, and the like. Still further, the invention could be used to detect or prevent security issues with a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript, VBScript or the like. For a basic introduction of cryptography and network security, the following may be helpful references: (1) “Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, And Source Code In C,” by Bruce Schneier, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons (second edition, 1996); (2) “Java Cryptography” by Jonathan Knudson, published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates (1998); (3) “Cryptography &amp; Network Security: Principles &amp; Practice” by William Stalling, published by Prentice Hall; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. It will be appreciated, that many applications of the present invention could be formulated. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the network may include any system for exchanging data or transacting business, such as the Internet, an intranet, an extranet, WAN, LAN, satellite communications, and/or the like. It is noted that the network may be implemented as other types of networks, such as an interactive television (ITV) network. The users may interact with the system via any input device such as a keyboard, mouse, kiosk, personal digital assistant, handheld computer (e.g., Palm Pilot®), cellular phone and/or the like. Similarly, the invention could be used in conjunction with any type of personal computer, network computer, workstation, minicomputer, mainframe, or the like running any operating system such as any version of Windows, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows 95, MacOS, OS/2, BeOS, Linux, UNIX, Solaris or the like. Moreover, although the invention is frequently described herein as being implemented with TCP/IP communications protocols, it will be readily understood that the invention could also be implemented using IPX, Appletalk, IP- 6, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of existing or future protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary recording method <b>50</b> for recording calls for processing. Method <b>50</b> can be implemented in, for example, hardware and/or software modules for execution by agent computer <b>18</b>. The various steps of method <b>50</b>, and other described methods, are shown in a particular order for illustrative purposes. The steps may occur in a different order and steps may be added or eliminated from the methods, depending upon a particular implementation, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In method <b>50</b>, a customer call is received from customer telephone <b>24</b> via communications network <b>22</b> (step <b>52</b>). As indicated above, this call can be received from a variety of types of telephones or other communications devices via any communications network. The customer call is routed to agent telephone <b>20</b> (step <b>54</b>), such as via a PBX or other switching device in that system <b>10</b> typically includes many agent computers and telephones for processing customer calls.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">During the telephone call, agent computer <b>18</b> records at least a portion of the call, including both the agent's and caller's (customer's) voice (step <b>56</b>). Agent computer <b>18</b>, via a connection with agent telephone <b>20</b>, can receive an analog signal representing the real-time telephone call and can digitize and store it for processing. Agent computer <b>18</b> segments at least a portion of the caller's voice from the agent's voice (step <b>58</b>). The segmentation refers to identifying within the recording at least a portion representing the caller's voice and extracting it from the recording. Therefore, the segmented recording includes an electronic representation of only the caller's voice, possibly with background noise. Algorithms are known in the art for performing this type of segmentation. Each person's voice has a unique voice print, due to for example the various combinations of frequencies within each person's voice, and thus one person's voice can be extracted from a recording containing multiple voice recordings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The recording of the segmented caller's voice is formatted by agent computer <b>18</b> for transmission via network <b>16</b> (step <b>60</b>). For example, it can be formatted into a wav file, known in the art and identified by a .wav extension. The use of a wav file, for example, provides for a standard format for network transmission to server computer <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the recording can be formatted into any type of file that can be transmitted via a TCP/IP or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Agent computer <b>18</b> transmits the file, having the recorded caller's voice print, to server computer <b>14</b> for processing (step <b>62</b>), explained below. Agent computer <b>18</b> can optionally receive back from server computer <b>14</b> results of the processing (step <b>64</b>). For example, an agent at agent computer <b>18</b> may want to receive the results while still engaged in a telephone call with a customer at customer telephone <b>24</b>. The agent can potentially use those results during the telephone call to determine whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer such as, for example, opening a transaction card account, closing a transaction card account, opening a related transaction account, changing demographic information related to an account and changing financial information related to a transaction card account.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>70</b> for processing calls by facilitating the comparison of at least a portion of caller voice prints with known voice prints. Method <b>70</b> can be implemented in, for example, software modules for execution by server computer <b>14</b>. In method <b>70</b>, server computer <b>14</b> receives a file via network <b>16</b> from agent computer <b>18</b> (step <b>72</b>). The file contains a voice print of the caller's voice, formatted for example in a wav file. In an exemplary embodiment, server computer <b>14</b> can possibly operate in at least two modes, real-time and batch processing, as determined in step <b>74</b>. The real-time mode refers to almost immediately processing the caller's voice print upon receipt and providing results of the processing back to the agent, typically while still engaged in a telephone call with the customer. The batch processing mode refers to saving the file for later processing with a group of files. The batch processing has the advantage of processing many files at once, during a particular time, and thus more efficiently making use of the processing capability of server computer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The particular mode selected can be based upon any particular criteria. For example, server computer <b>14</b> may by default operate in the batch processing mode but could be switched to the real-time mode by an agent for a particular customer's voice print. Alternatively, server computer <b>14</b> can be programmed to operate in one or both the modes based upon a desired application.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Database <b>12</b> can store the known voice prints in any particular data structure and format. In addition, it can also associate other information with each of the voice prints, such as an identification of the person corresponding with each voice print and characteristics of the person. For example, the characteristics can include the types of fraudulent transactions attempted by the corresponding person. Any databases discussed herein may be any type of database, such as relational, hierarchical, object-oriented, and/or the like. Common database products that may be used to implement the databases include DB2by IBM (White Plains, N.Y.), any of the database products available from Oracle Corporation (Redwood Shores, Calif.), Microsoft Access or MSSQL by Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.), or any other database product. Database may be organized in any suitable manner, including as data tables or lookup tables. Association of certain data may be accomplished through any data association technique known and practiced in the art. For example, the association may be accomplished either manually or automatically. Automatic association techniques may include, for example, a database search, a database merge, GREP, AGREP, SQL, and/or the like. The association step may be accomplished by a database merge function, for example, using a “key field” in each of the manufacturer and retailer data tables. A “key field” partitions the database according to the high-level class of objects defined by the key field. For example, a certain class may be designated as a key field in both the first data table and the second data table, and the two data tables may then be merged on the basis of the class data in the key field. In this embodiment, the data corresponding to the key field in each of the merged data tables is preferably the same. However, data tables having similar, though not identical, data in the key fields may also be merged by using AGREP, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the real-time mode, server computer <b>14</b> compares the caller's voice print with the known voice prints in database <b>12</b> (step <b>76</b>). For example, the comparison step <b>76</b> can include determining a match between the caller's voice print and one of the known voice prints based upon a probability, greater than a particular threshold, that the caller voice print and one of the known voice prints are from a voice of the same person. Therefore, the comparison seeks to determine whether the caller's voice print and any of the known voice prints are likely from the same person. Algorithms are known in the art for performing this type of comparison and can include, for example, statistical analysis between the voice prints. This comparison is typically performed sequentially between the caller's voice print and each of the known voice prints.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Server computer <b>14</b> records an indication of any matches found as a result of the comparison (step <b>78</b>). Server computer <b>14</b> formats the results into a report (step <b>80</b>) and transmits the report back to agent computer <b>18</b> via network <b>16</b> (step <b>82</b>). Examples of reports are provided below. For step <b>82</b>, the report may be transmitted back to the live agent handling the corresponding telephone call; alternatively, the report can be transmitted to other agents or entities for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the batch processing mode, server computer <b>14</b> saves the received file in a group of unprocessed files (step <b>84</b>), possibly in database <b>12</b>. Server computer <b>14</b> determines if it is time for batch processing of the group of unprocessed files (step <b>86</b>). The batch processing can occur at a time based upon any particular parameters. For example, server computer <b>14</b> may be programmed to process, at a particular time each day, the group of files saved since the previous processing of files. Alternatively, server computer can process the group of unprocessed files at multiple times during each day or every multiple days. One advantage of this batch processing is that it can be performed at a time of day, for example, when server computer <b>14</b> typically has greater bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When it is time for batch processing, server computer <b>14</b> retrieves a file from the group of unprocessed files (step <b>88</b>) and compares the voice print in the file with the known voice prints in database <b>12</b> (step <b>90</b>). The comparison can include the same processing described with respect to step <b>76</b>. Server computer <b>14</b> records an indication of any matches from the comparison (step <b>92</b>). If there are more files in the group to be processed (step <b>94</b>), server computer <b>14</b> repeats steps <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, and <b>92</b> for the next file. Once the group of unprocessed files have all been processed, server computer <b>14</b> formats the results into a report and saves them (step <b>96</b>). Server computer <b>14</b> can optionally use the results of processing to determine whether to authorize particular transactions for customers relating to the recorded voice prints in the processed files (step <b>98</b>). For example, it can automatically and programmatically deny the requested transaction if any matches are found for the caller voice print in question.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of an exemplary report <b>100</b> for providing results of the processing in steps <b>80</b> and <b>96</b>. Report <b>100</b> can be formatted in, for example, a web page or screen using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for display on the agent computer <b>18</b> or server computer <b>14</b> using a web browser. It can alternatively be formatted in any type of electronic screen. Report <b>100</b> includes, for example, a section <b>102</b> providing an identification of a particular customer whose voice print was recorded. A section <b>104</b> can display identifications of known voice prints in database <b>12</b> that match the caller's voice print. In addition, other information concerning the matches can optionally be displayed as well.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The computers discussed herein may provide a suitable website, webpage or other Internet-based graphical user interface which is accessible by users. In one embodiment, the Internet Information Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and Microsoft SQL Server, are used in conjunction with the Microsoft operating system, Microsoft NT web server software, a Microsoft SQL database system, and a Microsoft Commerce Server. Additionally, components such as Access or SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix MySQL, Intervase, etc., may be used to provide an ADO-compliant database management system. The term “webpage” as it is used herein is not meant to limit the type of documents and applications that might be used to interact with the user. For example, a typical website might include, in addition to standard HTML documents, various forms, Java applets, Javascript, active server pages (ASP), common gateway interface scripts (CGI), extensible markup language (XML), dynamic HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS), helper applications, plug-ins, and the like. A server may include a webservice which receives a request from a browser which includes a URL (http://yahoo.com/stockquotes/ge) and an IP address (123.56.789). The webservice retrieves the appropriate webpages and sends the webpages to the IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Table 2 illustrates a more detailed exemplary format for report <b>100</b> containing results of the processing. A caller's voice print might typically match only one of the known voice prints, as the known voice prints may be from different persons. However, it is possible that one person can have multiple voice prints in database <b>12</b> of known voice prints, making multiple matches with the caller's voice print a possibility. In addition, the system can be configured to provide a degree of reliability for each match, again providing for multiple matches based upon multiple degrees of reliability. For example, the system might discover a match having a 95% degree of reliability, meaning that statistically there is a 95% probability that the caller's voice print and the matched known voice print are from the same person. If configured in this manner, report <b>100</b> (and Table 2) can include a section to identify the degree of reliability for each of the matched known voice prints.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In Table 2, the IDs for the matches can include optional information for identifying a person corresponding with the matched voice print. The characteristics for the matches can include, for example, the types of fraudulent transactions attempted by the corresponding person, as shown in Table 1. Also, additional information can be associated with each report, if desired.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Report <b>100</b> can be represented in a variety of formats. It can be presented in any electronic form or, alternatively, in a hard copy or other format. For example, it can be a web page for transmission via network <b>16</b> and display on agent computer <b>20</b> or server computer <b>14</b> using a web browser. If represented electronically, report <b>100</b> can be e-mailed to the agent at agent computer <b>18</b> or any particular subscribers to it. If the processing occurs in the real-time mode, report <b>100</b> can be transmitted and displayed to the agent in, for example, a pop-up window on agent computer <b>18</b>. Therefore, the agent can view results of the processing, most likely while still engaged in a telephone call with a customer, and use those results to determine whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The results of the processing can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, they can be used to determine whether to authorize a transaction or request, or verify the identity of the caller. As other examples, they can be used to help prevent any telephone fraud, merchant fraud, travel fraud, or cardholder fraud, possibly in step <b>82</b> of process method <b>70</b>. In particular, if the caller's voice print matches any of the voice prints of persons known to have attempted to engage in fraudulent transactions, as determined by the processing explained above, the caller can be refused authorization to engage in any merchant, travel, or cardholder transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The information in the reports from results of the processing can also be stored in database <b>12</b>, or other location, and used for data mining purposes. For example, various types of processing can occur using the stored data to generate statistical analysis of it.</p>
