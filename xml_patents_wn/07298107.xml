<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11/005,355, filed Dec. 6, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,034,486, issued Apr. 24, 2006.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Motor driven operators for garage doors and other barriers have been developed which have the capability of controlling movement of the door to limit the door closing force in the event that an obstruction is disposed in the door movement path. Various types of operator controllers have been developed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,282 to Duhame discloses, for example, a garage door operator controller which senses the speed of the operator motor and utilizes speed change to indicate when motor torque, and thus the door closing force, exceeds a predetermined value. The user may adjust the door closing force and opening force by setting a speed sensor signal value, which correlates with motor torque and thus force exerted by the door, to predetermined limits to prevent damage to the door, the operator or an object in the path of movement of the door or barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other types of force sensing door operators have been developed including that disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,243 to Reed et al. and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The operator controller disclosed in the Reed et al. patent senses a change in current supplied to the operator electric motor which is correlated with motor torque and the force exerted by the operator on the door. User adjustable opening and closing force limits are provided which set the maximum motor current at which a signal is provided to effect stopping and reversing the operator motor, if the door is moving in the closed direction, and at least stopping the motor if the door is moving in the opening direction. However, the complexity of setting two limits by the typical barrier operator user may result in malfunctioning of the operator and frustration on the part of the user in setting the limits. Simplification of user settable controls is desirable for certain consumer products, including products such as residential garage door operators. Accordingly, there has been a need and desire to simplify user settable controls for barrier operators including, in particular, residential garage door operators. It is to these ends that the present invention has been developed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an improved barrier operator control unit wherein the user may set the maximum door (barrier) closing force or opening force and whereby the opposite (either opening force or closing force) setpoint is automatically set as a function of setting the opening or closing force setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention also provides a door operator including a control unit which may be controlled by the user to set either the door opening force setpoint, or closing force setpoint, or cause both setpoints to be automatically determined. The maximum force setpoint for movement of the door or barrier in one direction may be a constant incremental value greater than or less than the setpoint which is selectable by the user. Alternatively, the maximum force setpoints may be automatically set at an incremental value greater than the maximum force exerted on the door/barrier when moving between open and closed positions. For example, the barrier or door opening force setpoint may be equal to the door closing force setpoint plus a constant incremental value greater than the door closing force setpoint. These force setpoint values may be correlated with operator motor speed, electrical current applied to the motor or a force sensor, such as a strain gauge or force transducer, operably associated with the barrier and/or the barrier operator. The force transducer may also be a so-called torque transducer or sensor. Still further, the door opening force setpoint may be equal to the value of the door closing force setpoint plus a constant plus a further constant including some fraction of the door closing force setpoint. Other mathematical functions may be implemented relating to the barrier opening or closing force setpoint with respect to the other setpoint. Accordingly, the user may select one setpoint and the other setpoint is automatically determined thus simplifying user interface operation during setup of the operator or adjustment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Still further, in accordance with the invention, it is contemplated that a barrier operator control unit may be provided which includes a user adjustable setpoint for setting a maximum closing force of the barrier while the maximum opening force is preset at a constant value. Accordingly, less complicated user relationships are required for the door operator control unit and methods in accordance with the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the description which follows, like elements are marked throughout the specification and drawing with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures are not to scale and certain elements are shown in somewhat generalized schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness. U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,243 issued Sep. 12, 2000 to Reed et al. is hereby incorporated by reference in this application.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a generalized schematic diagram of a barrier operator control unit in accordance with the invention and generally designated by the numeral <b>10</b>. The operator control unit <b>10</b> includes a motor <b>12</b>, which may be of a type described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,243, and operably connected to a motor speed detector <b>14</b> also of a type described in the aforementioned patent. A suitable digital processor or microcontroller <b>16</b> is operable to control operation of the motor through a motor control circuit <b>18</b> and to receive signals indicating motor speed from speed detector <b>14</b>. Alternatively, a suitable barrier force or motor current sensor <b>20</b> may be associated with the motor <b>12</b>, and the door operator driven thereby, to provide a signal to controller <b>16</b> which is related to a force exerted by the barrier when moving between open and closed positions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, if motor speed is detected, electric motors typically generate a torque which is related to speed and if resistance to motor driving torque is encountered, speed will decrease and such speed change may be sensed to determine when a maximum barrier force is being exerted or would be exerted on an obstruction in the path of movement of the barrier. In like manner, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,243, there is a correlation between electrical current supplied to motor <b>12</b> and the motor torque or effort being imposed on the barrier operator and the barrier, and such current may be sensed and used as a signal to control operation of the motor. Still further, a force sensor including a strain gauge or other type of force transducer, may be associated with the door operator, such as the operator described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,243, to provide a signal to the controller <b>16</b> to indicate when an obstruction is being encountered if the barrier (door) is moving to a closed position or an open position or if some fault in the door guide structure is being experienced or encountered, for example. In this way, the control unit <b>10</b> may operate to cause the motor <b>12</b> to reverse and drive the barrier in the opposite direction, for example, or simply shut off to prevent a catastrophic event. Typically, for barriers such as residential garage doors, if the door is moving in the direction to close and an obstruction is encountered, the increase in motor torque resulting from a speed decrease or increased current flow can be sensed to cause the motor control unit to stop the motor and reverse its direction to move the barrier to an open position. If the barrier is moving toward an open position and an obstruction is encountered, the motor <b>12</b> may be controlled to simply shut off. The actual forces may be measured by strain gauges or other force or torque transducers associated with the door operator mechanism to provide a signal, a limiting value of which may be utilized by the microcontroller <b>16</b> to effect operation of the motor <b>12</b>, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the operator control unit <b>10</b> includes a user interface circuit <b>22</b> which may include suitable user operable pushbutton or momentary switches <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> for controlling operation of a barrier connected to the motor <b>12</b> to move between open and closed positions. The user interface circuit <b>22</b> is connected to microcontroller <b>16</b> by a suitable communication link <b>27</b>, and also includes a user operable force limit setting device <b>28</b> whereby, for example, the maximum torque exerted by the motor <b>12</b> may be set by the user and which is correlated with motor speed decrease which will provide a signal to the controller <b>16</b> and motor control circuit <b>18</b>. The user setting device <b>28</b> may be, for example, a rotary potentiometer or the like which changes a voltage and/or current signal supplied to the microcontroller <b>16</b> through a suitable converter circuit, if needed, as a limit value corresponding to a speed signal detected by the speed detector <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, when the control unit <b>10</b> is controlling operation of the motor <b>12</b> to move a barrier, such as a garage door, to the closed position, the speed detector <b>14</b> is constantly monitoring the motor speed and, if motor speed drops below a predetermined value, for example, correlated with a increase in motor torque and force exerted by the door, the controller <b>10</b> will cause the motor <b>12</b> to cease operation and then reverse. This type of barrier operator operation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,282 and the patent incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention when a user adjusts the device <b>26</b> to set the maximum motor torque or door closing force value at the microcontroller <b>16</b>, then the maximum door opening motor torque or force value is also automatically set. For example, if the user sets the door closing force setpoint then the door opening force setpoint is set at a value equal to the door closing force setpoint plus a constant K. Typically, the motor torque (and current) required for opening an upward acting garage door, for example, is greater than required for closing the door, so the constant K could be a positive value. Moreover, the door opening force setpoint value could be determined from a more complex function, such as being equal to the closing force setpoint value plus the constant K plus an incremental value, such as one-half the value of the closing force setpoint, for example. Alternatively, the manipulation of the user setpoint device <b>28</b> could result in setting the value of the motor torque limit in the barrier or door opening direction which would automatically then set the limit torque value to be exerted by the motor in the door closing direction. Still further, the door opening force setpoint value for a given operator and a given door, taking into account door weight and travel distance, could be a predetermined value which is not set automatically as a function of the closing setpoint value. In other words, with such an arrangement, the user would be able to set the door maximum closing force setpoint and the microcontroller <b>16</b> would have a preset value of door opening force setpoint already programmed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The user interface <b>22</b> may take various forms. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an alternate embodiment of a user interface is illustrated and designated by the numeral <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The user interface <b>22</b><i>a </i>may include a visual display <b>30</b>, door directional operating pushbutton switches <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, and a keypad including plural pushbutton “keys” or switches <b>32</b>. The user interface <b>22</b><i>a</i>, when connected to the microcontroller <b>16</b>, via a communication link <b>27</b><i>a</i>, in place of the link <b>27</b>, may be operable to set a value of the door (barrier) opening or closing torque which would be displayed by the display <b>30</b>. Simple numeric values may be utilized to indicate the relative maximum motor torque settable by the user through the interface <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still further, the user interface may take a configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, wherein a user interface <b>22</b><i>b </i>is provided and is adapted to be connected to the microcontroller <b>16</b> via a communications link <b>27</b><i>b </i>in place of the communications link or channel <b>27</b>. User interface <b>22</b><i>b </i>includes door opening and closing pushbutton switches <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, a visual display <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a user operable push button switch <b>34</b> which may be manipulated in such a way as to set the door closing force setpoint or door opening force setpoint and which action automatically sets the limiting force value in the other direction of movement of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By way of example, the operator control unit <b>10</b> may be placed in a force learning cycle mode wherein, during operation of the motor <b>12</b> to move the barrier or door between an open and closed position, the microcontroller <b>16</b> learns the force required to open and close the door through signals related to speed of the motor, current applied to the motor or a force value sensed by a suitable force sensor. Accordingly, a user of the operator control unit <b>10</b>, starting with the barrier or door in the closed position, may initiate a force learning cycle by pushing and holding the pushbutton switch <b>24</b> until the door reaches the open limit position. This would establish a force profile measured by the microcontroller <b>16</b>. The force profile in the door closing direction could be generated by pushing and holding the pushbutton switch <b>26</b> in the closed position until the door reaches the closed limit position which would establish the force or motor torque profile in the barrier or door closing direction. The device <b>28</b> would be placed in a zero or minimum force setting position prior to actuation of the switches <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Upon completion of establishing the force or torque profiles in the barrier opening and closing directions, the user could set a maximum closing force or torque value by adjusting the position of the device <b>28</b>, which action would automatically set the barrier closing force limit at a value greater than the maximum force established in the force profile established during the previous operations and such setting would also automatically set the door opening force or torque limit at which the microcontroller <b>16</b> would effect shutoff of the motor <b>12</b>. However, as mentioned previously, the maximum door opening force or torque value could also be preset in the microcontroller <b>16</b> in the control unit <b>10</b> unless the user is only setting the maximum closing force or torque value which the motor <b>12</b> can exert. The controller <b>16</b> of control unit <b>10</b> would also preferably be preprogrammed to automatically limit the maximum force or torque value that could be set by the user at the interface <b>22</b> which would be a value that would prevent injury to a person trapped by the door or barrier as it approached its final closed position. However, for an upward acting garage door, for example, it is preferable to allow the user to set door closing force limits to correct for changes in the position of the garage floor, or accumulations of snow or ice thereon, for example. Thus, the user should be allowed to adjust the control unit <b>10</b> to prevent the door from unwanted stopping and reversal at or near the closed limit position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The operation of interface <b>22</b><i>a </i>in place of interface <b>22</b> would be similar to that just described except that the keypad <b>32</b> may be used to enter numerical values of increased or decreased force or torque settings which would be displayed on display <b>30</b>. For example, after completion of the force learning cycle described above, upon actuation of one of the key switches <b>32</b>, the maximum recorded closing force value may be displayed on the display <b>30</b> after which the closing force or torque limit may be increased by pressing one or more of the key switches <b>32</b>. Switches <b>32</b> may also be used for other purposes during normal use of the interface <b>22</b><i>a</i>, such as inputting user identification codes for a keyless entry system or the like, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Use of the user interface <b>22</b><i>b </i>in place of the user interface <b>22</b> would also follow, generally, the force learning cycle process and force or torque limit setting process in accordance with the invention. For example, after establishing the force or torque learning cycle in both the opening and closing direction of a barrier controlled by the operator control unit <b>10</b>, the opening or closing force limit value would be set by pressing the pushbutton switch <b>34</b>, for example, a predetermined number of times until a numerical value appears in the display <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Pushbutton switch <b>34</b> may then be actuated until another predetermined numerical value appears in the display <b>30</b><i>a </i>showing the set value of the opening or closing force limit. The force limit value in either the opening or closing direction may then be increased or decreased by actuation of the pushbutton switches <b>24</b> or <b>26</b> and, after setting a value of the opening or closing force limit, the switch <b>34</b> may be actuated again to establish that value in the microcontroller <b>16</b> and the force limit in the opposite direction of movement of the door would then automatically be set as a consequence of setting of only one force limit by the user of the interface <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention also contemplates an operator control unit and method wherein the microcontroller <b>16</b> would be programmed to automatically set the force limits in either the opening or closing direction, or both, upon initiation of movement of the barrier during a force learning cycle from the barrier open position to the barrier closed position or vice versa. For example, a force learning process could be initiated by actuation of one of the pushbutton switches, such as the pushbutton switch <b>26</b> of one of the user interfaces <b>22</b>, <b>22</b><i>a </i>or <b>22</b><i>b</i>, to establish the force or torque profile in the barrier closing direction. During movement of the barrier from the open position to the closed position, the forces exerted on the barrier by the operator motor <b>12</b> of control unit <b>10</b> would be recorded by microcontroller <b>16</b> and the maximum force setpoint in the closing direction would then be selected by the microcontroller to be a value a predetermined amount greater than the maximum force recorded during movement of the barrier during the force learning cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the microcontroller <b>16</b> would be programmed to also automatically set the maximum force value to be exerted on or by the barrier when moving in the barrier opening direction as a function of the maximum force value set by the microcontroller for movement of the barrier in the closing direction. This procedure could, of course, be reversed in the sense that the barrier could be moved from the closed position to the open position, the maximum force exerted on the barrier would be sensed and values of maximum forces to be exerted on or by the barrier could then be automatically set by the microcontroller <b>16</b> for movement of the barrier in both the opening direction and the closing direction. This process may require calibration from time to time if the maximum force encountered by the barrier when moving between open and closed positions should increase to a point which would exceed the barrier maximum closing force setpoint or the barrier maximum opening force setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Operation of the user interfaces <b>22</b>, <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>includes the requirement of actuating pushbutton switches <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> for controlling movement of the barrier associated with the control unit <b>10</b> in the opening direction or the closing direction, respectively. A single pushbutton switch could replace the pushbutton switches <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> and which would be actuatable in sequence to first open the barrier, then close the barrier, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferred embodiments of the invention have been described in detail hereinabove. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various substitutions and modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims.</p>
