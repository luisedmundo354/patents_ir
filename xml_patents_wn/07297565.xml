<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1.Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device and to its fabricating method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2.Background of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a liquid crystal display device (hereinafter abbreviated LCD) includes a pair of glass substrates and an interposed liquid crystal that is sealed between those substrates. A TFT-LCD is an LCD device that includes thin film transistors (hereinafter abbreviated TFT) as switching elements that selectively applying signals across the liquid crystal. Thus, a TFT-LCD includes a TFT substrate with thin film transistors, a color filter substrate having color filters, and a liquid crystal between the TFT and color filter substrates. A TFT-LCD produces an image using the electro-optical characteristics of the liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because TFT-CDs have the benefits of low power consumption, lightweight, and portability, they hold the promise of being the next generation of imaging devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Reference will now be made in detail to an LCD according to the related art. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such an LCD includes a lower glass substrate <b>21</b>, an upper glass substrate <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>23</b> between the substrates <b>21</b> and <b>21</b><i>a</i>. A plurality of crossing gate lines and data lines are formed on the lower glass substrate <b>21</b>. A TFT is arranged near each intersection of the gate and data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The TFT includes a gate electrode <b>25</b><i>a </i>on the lower glass substrate <b>21</b>, a gate insulating layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>over the lower glass substrate <b>21</b> and the -gate electrode <b>25</b><i>a</i>, and a semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>c </i>on the gate insulating layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>and over the gate electrode <b>25</b><i>a</i>. The semiconductor layer acts as a TFT channel. A source electrode <b>25</b><i>d </i>and a drain electrode <b>25</b><i>e </i>are on the semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>c</i>. A passivation layer <b>27</b> extends over the source electrode <b>25</b><i>d</i>, over the drain electrode <b>25</b><i>e</i>, over a portion of the semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>c</i>, and over the gate insulating layer <b>25</b><i>b</i>. A pixel electrode <b>29</b> is disposed on the passivation layer <b>27</b> and in electrical contact with the drain electrode <b>25</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the upper glass substrate <b>21</b> is a black matrix <b>31</b> arranged in a pattern to block light, except through the pixel electrode <b>29</b>. The upper glass substrate <b>21</b> also includes color filters <b>33</b>, which include red, green, and blue filters. A common electrode <b>35</b> is over the black matrix <b>31</b> and over the color filters <b>33</b>. A voltage applied between the pixel electrode <b>29</b> and the common electrode produces an electric field in the liquid crystals <b>23</b>. An overcoat layer (not shown in the drawings) may be added to protect and planarize surfaces before the common electrode <b>35</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E</figref> show cross-sectional views during fabrication of a related art LCD. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a metal layer is formed on a lower glass substrate <b>21</b> by depositing Al, Cr, Mo, Cu, Al alloy or the like, beneficially by sputtering. A gate line and a gate electrode <b>25</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) that extends from the gate line is formed from the metal layer by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Then, a gate insulating layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>is formed on the lower glass substrate <b>21</b>, including on the gate electrode <b>25</b><i>a</i>, using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), silicon nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a silicon layer is then formed on the gate insulating layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>by depositing amorphous silicon or the like. Then, a semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>c </i>for the TFT channel is formed by patterning the silicon layer such that the silicon remains over the gate electrode <b>25</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a metal layer is formed over the exposed surfaces, including over the semiconductor layer <b>25</b><i>c</i>, by depositing Al, Cr, Mo, Cu, an Al alloy, or the like by sputtering. Then, a data line that crosses the gate line, and source and drain electrodes <b>25</b><i>d </i>and <b>25</b><i>e </i>that extend from the data line are formed from the metal layer by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a passivation layer <b>27</b> is then formed over the exposed surfaces, including over the source and drain electrodes <b>25</b><i>d </i>and <b>25</b><i>e</i>. The passivation layer <b>27</b> is beneficially silicon nitride, silicon oxide, BCB or the like. A contact hole is then formed by selectively removing a portion of the passivation layer <b>27</b> to expose a portion of the drain electrode <b>25</b><i>e</i>. An ITO (indium tin oxide) layer <b>28</b> is then formed on an exposed surfaces, including in the contact hole, by sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a pixel electrode <b>28</b><i>a </i>is then formed by removing a portion of the ITO layer <b>28</b> using photolithography, beneficially using an etchant belonging to the FeCl<sub>3 </sub>or the (HNO<sub>3</sub>+HCl) family.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">After the TFT substrate is completed, that substrate is combined with a color filter substrate. Subsequently, a liquid crystal is interposed between the thin film transistor and the color filter substrates, thereby completing an LCD according to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Unfortunately, the related art LCD and its fabrication method has problems. The pixel electrode is patterned by etching an ITO layer using an FeCl<sub>3 </sub>or an (HNO<sub>3</sub>+HCl) family etchant. Such etchants can produce a metal oxide layer, or the pixel electrode pattern can be damaged, when a line (gate or data) metal of Al, Cu, or the like is contacted by the ITO etchant, which also contacts the ITO. Contact resistance can be increased, signals can be delayed, and electric shorts can result. Additionally, ITO is deposited in a sputtering device that includes very expensive vacuum equipment. Furthermore, the sputtering process temperature tends to be very high.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a liquid crystal display device, and to its fabricating method, that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To achieve these and other advantages, and in accordance with the purposes of the present invention as embodied and broadly described, a liquid crystal display device includes a first substrate, a second substrate, a plurality of switching elements arranged on the first substrate, a plurality of organic pixel electrodes receiving data signals through the switching elements, and a liquid crystal between the first and second substrates.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further aspect, a method of fabricating a liquid crystal display device according to the present invention includes the steps of preparing a first substrate and a second substrate, forming a plurality of thin film transistors on the first substrate, forming a passivation layer over an exposed surface that includes the thin film transistors, forming a plurality of organic pixel electrodes on the passivation layer and that connect to electrodes of the thin film transistors, and locating a liquid crystal between the first and second substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further aspect, a method of fabricating a liquid crystal display device includes arranging a gate line and a crossing data line on a TFT substrate, forming a thin film transistor at the crossing, forming a passivation layer over an exposed surface that includes the thin film transistor, and forming an organic pixel electrode that is electrically connected to the thin film transistor through the passivation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An advantage of the present invention is a pixel electrode that when formed causes no damage to the data and gate lines, thereby improving fabrication yield.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the present invention, it is intended that a pixel electrode is formed of organic materials, such as PEDOT and the like, instead of nonorganic materials such as ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a pixel electrode is formed of ITO, at least part of the fabricating process should be carried out in a vacuum chamber. Furthermore, an etching step is required. However, an organic pixel electrode according to the principles of the present invention is formed by coating a substrate's exposed surfaces with an organic material (such as PEDOT), and then selectively illuminating that organic material where an electrically-conductive pixel electrode is to be formed. Thus, the present invention does not require a vacuum chamber or an etch step when forming the pixel electrodes. Therefore, the present invention does not induce damage on an existing metal layer, such as that which might result from etching.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference will now be made in detail to the illustrated embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are shown in the accompanying drawings. Where possible, the same reference numerals will be used to illustrate like elements throughout the specification.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an LCD that is in accord with the principles of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such an LCD includes a first substrate <b>41</b>, a confronting second substrate <b>41</b><i>a</i>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>200</b> between the first and second substrates <b>41</b> and <b>41</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first substrate <b>41</b> includes a gate line and a crossing data line, a switching element <b>100</b> formed adjacent the crossing of the gate and data lines, a passivation layer <b>45</b> formed over the gate line and the data line and over the switching element <b>100</b>. Additionally, the first substrate <b>41</b> also includes an organic pixel electrode <b>49</b><i>a </i>that connects to an electrode of the switching element <b>100</b>. Beneficially, the switching element <b>100</b> is an a-Si:H thin film transistor or a poly-Si thin film transistor that is structurally formed as a BCE (back channel etch) type thin film transistor, an etch-stopper type thin film transistor, a staggered type thin film transistor, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While not shown in the drawings, a pad part is formed on the first substrate to assist the transfer of external signals to the respective pixels from external driver circuitry. The pad part includes a gate pad at an end of the gate line, a data pad at an end of the data line, and an organic conductive layer formed on the gate and data pads.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The organic pixel electrode <b>49</b><i>a </i>and the organic conductive layer are beneficially formed of PEDOT (polyethylenedioxythiophene), an organic polymer material, that is placed on the substrate <b>41</b> by coating or screen printing. Typically, ITO was used for the pixel electrodes. ITO pixel electrodes are formed in a vacuum chamber, usually by sputtering. Sputter forming, and vacuum depositing ITO results in low productivity and are not suitable for wide area coatings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When a pixel electrode is formed from ITO, the ITO is usually etched by an etchant belonging to the FeCl<sub>3 </sub>or the (HNO<sub>3</sub>+HCl) families. In such cases the etchant can cause damage to the metal used for the data and gate lines. On the contrary, the present invention does not require etching, and thus avoids damaging the data and gate lines.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While unexposed PEDOT is non-conductive, where PEDOT is exposed to light it becomes electrically conductive. Thus, the present invention enables the formation of pixel electrodes using light exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second substrate <b>41</b><i>a </i>includes a black matrix <b>55</b>, a color filter pattern <b>57</b>, and a common electrode <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views when fabricating an LCD according to the principles of the present invention. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a metal layer is formed on a first substrate <b>41</b> by depositing Al, Cr, Mo, Cu, Al alloy or the like by sputtering. That metal layer is then pattered to form a gate pattern comprising a gate line, a gate electrode <b>43</b><i>a</i>, and a gate pad using photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, a gate insulating layer <b>43</b><i>b </i>is formed over the first substrate <b>41</b> and over the gate pattern by PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) using silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), silicon nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a silicon layer is then formed over the exposed surfaces, including over the gate insulating layer <b>43</b><i>b</i>, by depositing amorphous silicon or the like. A semiconductor layer <b>43</b><i>c </i>for a thin film transistor channel is then formed by patterning the silicon layer so as to remain on the gate insulating layer <b>43</b><i>b </i>and over the gate electrode <b>43</b><i>a</i>. A typical semiconductor layer <b>43</b><i>c </i>is formed of a-Si:H or polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a metal layer is then formed over the exposed surfaces of the first substrate <b>41</b>, including over the semiconductor layer <b>45</b><i>c</i>, by depositing Al, Cr, Mo, Cu, an Al alloy or the like by sputtering. That metal layer is then patterned by photolithography to form a data pattern comprised of a data line, a source electrode <b>43</b><i>d</i>, a drain electrode <b>43</b><i>e</i>, and a data pad.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, a passivation layer <b>45</b> is then formed over the exposed surfaces of the first substrate, including over the the data pattern. That passivation layer is beneficially comprised of an organic material such as acryl, BCB (benzocyclobutene), or the like, or an inorganic material such as silicon nitride, silicon oxide, or the like. A contact hole <b>47</b> is then formed by selectively removing a portion of the passivation layer <b>45</b> so as to expose a portion of the drain electrode <b>43</b><i>e</i>. Additionally, the passivation layer <b>45</b> is removed from over the gate pad and the data pad.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the passivation layer <b>45</b> is then coated with an organic polymer <b>49</b> such that the organic polymer connects to the drain electrode <b>43</b><i>e </i>through the contact hole. An organic pixel electrode <b>49</b><i>a </i>is then formed by illuminating selected areas of the organic polymer <b>49</b>. The illuminated areas become pixel electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Beneficially, an organic conductive layer is also formed by illuminating the organic polymer <b>49</b> over the gate and data pads. As a result, the gate pad electrically connects to the organic conductive layer, and the data pad electrically connects to the organic conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The organic pixel electrode <b>49</b><i>a </i>and organic conductive layer have permeabilities over 75%, sheet resistance under 3 Ωm<sup>2</sup>, and degree of planarization greater then 75% when the passivation layer <b>45</b> is organic.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the illustrated embodiment the pixel electrode <b>49</b><i>a </i>and the organic conductive layers are beneficially comprised of PEDOT, an organic polymer material. Further, that PEDOT is formed on the substrate by general methods such as coating, screen printing, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D</figref> show cross-sectional views when forming an organic pixel electrode according to a first embodiment of the present invention, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C</figref> show cross-sectional views when forming an organic pixel electrode according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, after a passivation layer <b>45</b> has been formed, the contact hole <b>47</b> that exposes the drain electrode <b>43</b><i>e </i>is formed by patterning the passivation layer <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the passivation layer <b>45</b>, including the contact hole <b>47</b>, is then coated with a film of PEDOT <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, light exposure is then carried out on selected areas of the PEDOT <b>49</b> film using a mask <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the exposed areas of the PEDOT <b>49</b> become electrically conductive. Those conductive portions are used as organic pixel electrodes <b>49</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A process of forming an organic pixel electrode by screen printing will now be explained. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, after a passivation layer <b>45</b> has been formed, a contact hole <b>47</b> that exposes the drain electrode <b>43</b><i>e </i>is formed by patterning the passivation layer <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the passivation layer <b>45</b>, including the contact hole <b>47</b>, are then screen printed with PEDOT <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the PEDOT film <b>49</b> is then illuminated with light to form organic pixel electrodes <b>49</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally, organic conductive layers on the pad part are also formed by the same methods used to form the organic pixel electrodes, beneficially simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Photolithography is generally required to form related art ITO pixel electrodes. Pixel electrodes according to the present invention do not require photolithography, and thus damage to exposed metal layers when etching is avoided. Furthermore, the fabrication process is simplified. In particular, aluminum drain electrodes after etching ITO, can suffer from aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), which increase contact resistance. If chrome (Cr) is used, the surface of the chrome can be damaged during etching a passivation layer to form openings for the ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In contrast, an organic pixel electrode <b>49</b><i>a </i>according to the principles of the present invention prevents the generation of metal oxides associated with ITO pixel electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, a liquid crystal display device, and its fabricating method, according to the present invention has simplified process steps by eliminating a pixel electrode etch step. This eliminates damage to the gate lines and data lines caused by the etching. Additionally, forming a pixel electrode according to the principles of the present invention does not require a vacuum chamber. Furthermore, uniform cell gaps can be more easily achieved by the planarizing effects of the organic pixel electrodes. The result is a low cost, efficient process of producing liquid crystal displays with high yields.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The foregoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teachings can be readily applied to other types of devices. The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
