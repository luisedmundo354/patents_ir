<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to plasma reactor apparatus and processes. More specifically, the present invention relates to grounding a semiconductor substrate pedestal of a plasma reactor apparatus during a portion of a positive voltage power bias oscillation cycle to increase the energy of ion particles of the plasma to increase the feature charging effects regarding a substrate being etched using the plasma reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Higher performance, lower cost, increased miniaturization of electronic components, and greater density of integrated circuits are ongoing goals of the computer industry. One commonly used technique to increase the density of integrated circuits involves stacking multiple layers of active and passive components one atop another to allow for multilevel electrical interconnection between devices formed on each of these layers. This multilevel electrical interconnection is generally achieved with a plurality of metal-filled vias (“contacts”) extending through dielectric layers which separate the component layers from one another. These vias are generally formed by etching through each dielectric layer using etching methods known in the industry, such as plasma etching. Plasma etching is also used in the forming of a variety of features for the electronic components of integrated circuits. In addition, vertical capacitors may be formed by etching the features of the wall of the capacitor in the capacitor dielectric and forming the remaining capacitor structure around the etched dielectric. Typically, the capacitance of the capacitor is proportional to the surface area of the wall of the capacitor etched in the dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In plasma etching, a glow discharge is used to produce reactive species, such as atoms, radicals, and/or ions, from relatively inert gas molecules in a bulk gas, such as a fluorinated gas, such as CF<sub>4</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, or other freons, and mixtures thereof, in combination with a carrier gas, such as Ar, He, Ne, Kr, O<sub>2</sub>, or mixtures thereof. Essentially, a plasma etching process comprises: 1) reactive species are generated in a plasma from the bulk gas, 2) the reactive species diffuse to a surface of a material being etched, 3) the reactive species are absorbed on the surface of the material being etched, 4) a chemical reaction occurs which results in the formation of a volatile byproduct, 5) the byproduct is desorbed from the surface of the material being etched, and 6) the desorbed byproduct diffuses into the bulk gas.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an apparatus <b>200</b> used in the plasma etching process consists of an etching chamber <b>202</b> in electrical communication with a first AC (Alternating Current) power source <b>204</b>. The etching chamber <b>202</b> further includes a pedestal <b>206</b> to support a semiconductor substrate <b>208</b> and an electrode <b>212</b> opposing the pedestal <b>206</b>. The electrode <b>212</b> is in electrical communication with a second AC power source <b>214</b>. The pedestal <b>206</b> has an AC power source <b>216</b>. The electrode <b>212</b> and power source <b>214</b> may be an inductively coupled plasma source, a microwave plasma source, or any suitable type plasma source.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the etching chamber <b>202</b>, a plasma <b>222</b> is initiated and maintained by inductively coupling AC energy from the first AC power source <b>204</b> into an atmosphere of gases in the etching chamber <b>202</b> and the plasma <b>222</b> which comprises mobile, positively and negatively charged particles and reactive species. An electric field develops in a sheath layer <b>224</b> around the plasma <b>222</b>, accelerating charged species (not shown) toward the semiconductor substrate <b>208</b> by electrostatic coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To assist with the etching, the potential difference between the plasma <b>222</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>208</b> can be modulated by applying an oscillating bias power from the pedestal power bias source <b>216</b> to the pedestal <b>206</b>, as illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> (showing the voltage profiles during such oscillation). During the positive voltage phase <b>232</b>, the substrate collects electron current from electrons that have enough energy to cross the plasma sheath layer <b>224</b> (see drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) having a plasma potential <b>236</b> (see drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). The difference between the instantaneous plasma potential and the surface potential defines the sheath potential voltage drop <b>238</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Since the plasma potential is more positive than the surface potential, this drop has a polarity that retards electron flow. Hence, only electrons with energy larger than this retarding potential are collected by the substrate. During the negative voltage phase <b>234</b>, positive ions are collected by the substrate. These ions are accelerated by the sheath voltage drop <b>238</b> and strike the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, it is known that the plasma etch results, including profile modification, can occur if the features are charged enough to modify the trajectories of the ions and electrons that are injected into these features.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is the phenomena of electrical charging on a semiconductor device in the process of a plasma etch. A material layer <b>244</b> to be etched is shown layered over a semiconductor substrate <b>242</b>. A patterned photoresist layer <b>246</b> is provided on the material layer <b>244</b> for the etching of a via. During the plasma etching process, the patterned photoresist layer <b>246</b> and material layer <b>244</b> are bombarded with positively charged ions <b>248</b> and negatively charged electrons <b>252</b>. This bombardment results in a charge distribution being developed on the patterned photoresist layer <b>246</b> and/or the semiconductor substrate <b>242</b>. This charge distribution is commonly called “feature charging.”</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order for feature charging to occur, the positively charged ions <b>248</b> and the negatively charged electrons <b>252</b> must become separated from one another. The positively charged ions <b>248</b> and negatively charged electrons <b>252</b> become separated by virtue of the structures being etched and by the differences in directionality and energy between the positive ions and electrons as they approach the feature being etched. As the structure (in this example, a via <b>254</b>) is formed by etching, the aspect ratio (height to width ratio) becomes greater and greater. During plasma etching, the positively charged ions <b>248</b> are accelerated toward the patterned photoresist layer <b>246</b> and the material layer <b>244</b> in a relatively perpendicular manner, as illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by the arrows adjacent positively charged ions <b>248</b>. The negatively charged electrons <b>252</b>, however, are less affected by the AC power bias source at the semiconductor substrate <b>242</b> and, thus, move in a more random isotropic manner, as depicted in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> by the arrows adjacent negatively charged electrons <b>252</b>. This results in an accumulation of a positive charge at a bottom <b>256</b> of via <b>254</b> because, on average, positively charged ions <b>248</b> are more likely to travel vertically towards the substrate <b>242</b> than are negatively charged electrons <b>252</b>. Thus, any structure with a high enough aspect ratio tends to charge more negatively at photoresist layer <b>246</b> and an upper portion of the material layer <b>244</b> to a distance A (i.e., illustrated with “−” indicia) and more positively at the via bottom <b>256</b> and the sidewalls of the via <b>254</b> proximate the via bottom <b>256</b> (i.e., illustrated with “+” indicia).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the negatively charged sidewalls of the top of the opening deflects the positively charged ions <b>248</b> in trajectories towards the sidewalls. In addition, the positively charged via bottom <b>256</b> also decreases the vertical component of the ion velocity and therefore increases the relative effect of initial deflection. The deflection results in ion bombardment of the sidewalls <b>258</b> proximate the via bottom <b>256</b>. This can generate a portion of the etched feature with a re-entrant profile, as shown in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Such a profile can be useful in etching a number of films. For example, a re-entrant profile in a metal film can increase alignment tolerance to shorts to adjacent contacts by shrinking the size of the metal line as it meets the layer below it. In addition, a “bulge” can be etched into dielectric films such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) with these ions. In this case, the feature charging causes a pileup of deflected ions at a location in the feature and some widening of the feature occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the negatively charged photoresist layer <b>246</b> and the upper portion of the material layer <b>244</b> deflect the negatively charged electrons <b>252</b> away from entering the via <b>254</b> or slow the negatively charged electrons <b>252</b> as they enter the via <b>254</b>, both caused by charge repulsion and both of which can change the etch profile. This type of phenomenon is commonly known as “electron shading.”</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, it can be appreciated that it would be advantageous to develop an apparatus and a process of utilizing a plasma reactor which maximizes or adds a controllable effect of feature charging while using inexpensive, commercially available semiconductor device fabrication components and without requiring complex processing steps.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method of reorienting electrons generated in a plasma reactor to minimize the electrons' ability to penetrate a feature and therefore reduce charging inside the feature.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One embodiment of the present invention comprises an etching chamber in electrical communication with a first power source. The etching chamber further includes a pedestal to support a semiconductor substrate and an electrode opposing the pedestal. The electrode is in electrical communication with a second power source. The pedestal is in electrical communication with an AC power source. The etching chamber includes a second electrode in electrical communication with a second AC power source. The pedestal is further in electric communication with a triggerable, high-speed switch. When triggered, the switch closes to short the pedestal to ground. The AC power source is preferably in electrical communication with the switch through a signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As previously discussed, the potential difference between the plasma and the semiconductor substrate can be modulated by applying an oscillating power from the pedestal power source to the semiconductor substrate. During the positive voltage phase, the substrate collects electron current from electrons that have enough energy to cross the plasma sheath. The difference between the instantaneous plasma potential and the surface potential defines the sheath potential drop. Since the plasma potential is more positive than the surface potential, this drop has a polarity that retards electron flow. Hence, only electrons with energy larger than this retarding potential are collected by the substrate. During the negative voltage phase, positive ions are collected by the substrate. These ions are accelerated by the sheath voltage drop and strike the substrate. However, the present invention comprises the shorting of the pedestal, either in a symmetrical manner or nonsymmetrical manner, during the positive voltage phase (i.e., during the time the negatively charged electrons flow to the wafer). This results in an increase in the electric field that retards electron flow to the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Negatively charged electrons are less affected by the DC bias at the semiconductor substrate than are positively charged ions and, thus, move in a more random manner. However, the shorting of the pedestal, according to the present invention, alters the difference between the potential of the plasma and potential of the semiconductor substrate for a part of the positive voltage phase. In addition, because the surface potential is made more negative relative to the plasma potential, only higher energy electrons can overcome this increased potential barrier and reach the surface. This results in more charging and a bigger difference between the positive voltage at the bottom of the feature and the negative voltage at the top of the feature. This increases the feature charging effects. In other words, the shorting of the pedestal increases the role of feature charging on the etch results.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The triggerable, high-speed switch is preferably controlled by the power output of the AC power source. Thus, when the power output of the AC power source reaches a first predetermined level, a first signal is sent from the AC power source or from a sensor (not shown coupled with the AC power source) to the triggerable, high-speed switch via the signal line. When the first signal is received by the switch, the switch closes to short the pedestal to ground. A second signal is sent from the AC power source or from a sensor (not shown coupled with the AC power source) to open the switch, which discontinues the grounding of the pedestal. The second signal can be sent when power output of the AC power source reaches a second predetermined level, or after a predetermined duration of time passes.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, the present invention is capable of providing a simple and controllable method of effecting the quality and efficiency of plasma etching and is easily implemented on most existing plasma reactors.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the examples presented are directed to the formation of an opening with a plasma etching apparatus, it is understood that the present invention may be utilized in a variety of feature-formation and plasma processes.</p>

In general, the electrode <b>112</b> can also be a plasma source driven by microwave power, electron cyclotron resonance power, or capacitively coupled rf power. Multiple frequency capacitively coupled power plasma processing tools (such as a Lam Corporation, Fremont, Calif., etcher called “Exelan ”) are also described in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> wherein the dual-frequency supplies would simply use the switching circuit <b>126</b> (also referred to as “switch <b>126</b>”) on one of the two power supplies.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the etching chamber <b>102</b>, a plasma <b>122</b> is maintained by inductively coupling energy from the first power source <b>104</b> into the plasma <b>122</b>, which comprises mobile, positively and negatively charged particles. An electric field, or bias voltage, develops in a sheath layer <b>124</b> around the plasma <b>122</b>, accelerating the electrons and ions (not shown) toward the semiconductor substrate <b>108</b> by electrostatic coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pedestal <b>106</b> is further in electric communication with a triggerable, high-speed switch <b>126</b> interposed along an electrical path to ground <b>128</b>. When triggered, the switch <b>126</b> closes to short the pedestal <b>106</b> to ground <b>128</b>. The AC power source <b>116</b> is preferably in electrical communication with the switch <b>126</b> with a signal line <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As previously discussed, the potential difference between the plasma <b>122</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>108</b> can be modulated by applying an oscillating bias power from the pedestal AC pulsed power source <b>116</b> to the semiconductor substrate <b>108</b>, as illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C (showing the voltage profile for the pedestal and plasma sheath as well as the current profile during such oscillation). During the positive voltage phase <b>134</b>, the substrate collects electron current from electrons that have enough energy to cross the sheath. The difference between the instantaneous plasma potential and the surface potential defines the sheath potential voltage drop <b>137</b>. Since the plasma potential is more positive than the surface potential, this drop has a polarity that retards electron flow. Hence, only electrons with energy larger than this retarding potential are collected by the substrate. During the negative voltage phase <b>136</b>, positive ions are collected by the substrate. These ions are accelerated by the sheath voltage drop and strike the substrate. However, as also illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, the present invention comprises the shorting of the pedestal <b>106</b> during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> (i.e., during the time the electrons flow to the wafer) for a duration of time <b>138</b>. The shorting of the pedestal <b>106</b> during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> may occur either asymmetrically <b>139</b> or symmetrically <b>139</b>′. As illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, with particular reference to drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the voltage profile has been illustrated as a displaced sine wave about the x-axis and y-axis. Although a displaced sine wave has been illustrated, the voltage could be supplied in any wave manner, displaced or not about the x-axis and y-axis. Further, as illustrated specifically with reference to drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the asymmetrical shorting or grounding <b>139</b> of the pedestal <b>106</b> during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> is shown as occurring for a duration of time <b>138</b> being displaced along the x-axis from the a-axis of drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, such a-axis extending through the peak of the positive voltage phase <b>134</b>. However, the asymmetrical shorting or grounding <b>139</b> of the pedestal <b>106</b> during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> could occur asymmetrically in any manner during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> so long as the desired etching occurs. Additionally, the symmetrical shorting or grounding <b>139</b>′ of the pedestal <b>106</b> during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> is illustrated as occurring for a duration of time <b>138</b> being displaced equally along the x-axis on either side (left or right) from the b-axis of drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, such a-axis extending through the peak of the positive voltage phase <b>134</b>. However, the symmetrical shorting or grounding <b>139</b>′ of the pedestal <b>106</b> during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> could occur symmetrically about the b-axis in any manner for any duration of time <b>138</b> so long as the desired etching occurs. Therefore, the voltage during the positive phase <b>134</b> of the electrical signal to the pedestal <b>106</b> during the closing of the switch <b>126</b> to short or ground the pedestal <b>106</b> may occur when the closing voltage is substantially higher, substantially lower or substantially equal to the voltage during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> when the switch <b>126</b> is opened. Conversely, the opening voltage during the positive voltage phase of the electrical signal of the switch <b>126</b> to the pedestal <b>106</b> may occur when the opening voltage is substantially higher, substantially lower, or substantially equal to the voltage during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> when the switch <b>126</b> is closed. In this manner, any desired asymmetrical or symmetrical shorting or grounding of the pedestal <b>106</b> may occur during the positive voltage phase <b>134</b> of the electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As previously discussed and illustrated in prior art drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, negatively charged electrons <b>252</b> are less affected by the AC bias at the semiconductor substrate than are positively charged ions and, thus, move in a more random manner, as depicted by the arrows adjacent negatively charged electrons <b>252</b>. However, the shorting or grounding of the pedestal <b>106</b>, according to the present invention, alters the difference between the potential of the plasma <b>122</b> and potential of the semiconductor substrate <b>108</b> for a part of the positive voltage phase <b>134</b>, as shown in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring again to drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the triggerable, high-speed switch <b>126</b> is preferably controlled by the power output of the AC pulsed power source <b>116</b>. Thus, when the power output of AC pulsed power source <b>116</b> reaches a first predetermined level, a first signal is sent from the AC pulsed power source <b>116</b> (or from a sensor (not shown) coupled with the AC pulsed power source <b>116</b>) to the triggerable, high speed-switch <b>126</b> via the signal line <b>132</b>. When the first signal is received by the switch <b>126</b>, the switch <b>126</b> closes to a grounded position (see inset A of drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to short or ground the pedestal <b>106</b> to ground <b>128</b>. A second signal is sent from the AC pulsed power source <b>116</b> (or from a sensor (not shown) coupled with the AC pulsed power source <b>116</b>) to open the switch <b>126</b> to an open circuit position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which discontinues the shorting or grounding of the pedestal <b>106</b>. The second signal can be sent when power output of the AC pulsed power source <b>116</b> reaches a second predetermined level, or when a predetermined duration of time passes. Thus, the grounding can be controlled to occur at any point during the positive voltage cycle and for any duration to achieve the desired etching results for a particular semiconductor material. Referring to drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, illustrated in a cross-sectional view of hole <b>144</b> being formed in a substrate <b>148</b> having a material layer <b>146</b> thereon having a layer of photoresist <b>140</b> thereon. Negatively charged electrons <b>142</b> are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In using the present invention to etch typical dielectric material used in a semiconductor device, for a common IPS plasma etcher, sold by Applied Materials, the etcher would operate at a power level of approximately 800 watts having a power level bias of approximately 700 watts using a CHF<sub>3 </sub>gas at a flow rate of approximately 22 sccm, the roof temperature of the etcher being independently controlled, and at a pressure level of approximately 20 mtorr. The roof temperature is set to approximately 140° C. and the ring temperature to approximately 200° C. with the bias frequency in the range of 1.7+/−0.2 MHZ. Under these conditions, the rf voltage at the wafer surface is estimated to be approximately in the range of 300 to 400 volts AC with the plasma having a potential below 50 volts at its peak.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other instances, the present invention may be used to etch metal used in semiconductor devices, such as etching conductors in semiconductor devices. During the time that the conductor is etching, there is no feature charging. However, most metal etches finish on an insulator, including overetching. During this period, the bottom of the feature can charge up since it is an insulator, and the effects of feature charging can begin. For example, the conductor profile could be made re-entrant during the overetch if the feature charging is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention is particularly useful in the formation of high aspect ratio contact holes or apertures in dielectric material used in semiconductor devices. For instance, high aspect ratio contact holes or apertures in dielectric material may have a ratio of height to diameter of greater than 5:1 using the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Additionally, if desired, an aperture <b>254</b>, opening <b>254</b>, via <b>254</b> or hole <b>254</b> may be formed having a plurality of bulges <b>255</b> therein using the present invention as illustrated in drawing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As illustrated, a high aspect ratio hole <b>254</b> is formed in a substrate <b>242</b> having a plurality of bulges <b>255</b> formed therein by the continual switching of the voltage during the operation of the etcher as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For instance, during the deposition of a dielectric into a high aspect ratio feature, the controlled increase in feature charging can be used to reduce ion energy to the bottom of the feature and vary the film deposition rate and film properties in the feature. For example, a fill could be made to form a bread-loaf shape of dielectric material at the top of the feature while having a low deposition rate inside the feature. This allows voids to be formed by increasing the feature charging during the deposition of the dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, the present invention is capable of providing a simple and controllable method of affecting the quality and efficiency of plasma etching and is easily implemented on most existing plasma reactors. Furthermore, although the examples presented are directed to the formation of a via, it is understood that the present invention may be utilized in a variety of feature formation and plasma processes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Having thus described in detail preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention defined by the appended claims is not to be limited by particular details set forth in the above description as many apparent variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit or scope thereof.</p>
