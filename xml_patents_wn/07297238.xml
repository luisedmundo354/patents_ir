<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An acoustic system for applying vibratory energy including a horn connected to an ultrasonic energy source. The horn defines an overall length and wavelength, and at least a leading section thereof is comprised of a ceramic material. The leading section has a length of at least ⅛ the horn wavelength. In one preferred embodiment, an entirety of the horn is a ceramic material, and is mounted to a separate component, such as a waveguide, via an interference fit. Regardless, by utilizing a ceramic material for at least a significant portion of the horn, the ultrasonic system of the present invention facilitates long-term operation in extreme environments such as high temperature and/or corrosive fluid mediums. The present invention is useful for fabrication of metal matrix composite wires.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to acoustics. More particularly, it relates to an ultrasonic system and method incorporating a ceramic horn for long-term delivery of ultrasonic energy in harsh environments, such as high temperature and/or corrosive environments.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ultrasonic is the science of the effects of sound vibrations beyond the limit of audible frequencies. The object of high-powered ultrasonic applications is to bring about some physical change in the material being treated. This process requires the flow of vibratory energy per unit of area or volume. Depending upon the application, the resulting power density may range from less than a watt to thousands of watts per square centimeter. In this regard, ultrasonics is used in a wide variety of applications, such as welding or cutting of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Regardless of the specific application, the ultrasonic device or system itself generally consists of a transducer, a booster, a waveguide, and a horn. These components are often times referred to in combination as a “horn stack”. The transducer converts electrical energy delivered by a power supply into high frequency mechanical vibration. The booster amplifies or adjusts the vibrational output from the transducer. The waveguide transfers the amplified vibration from the booster to the horn, and provides an appropriate surface for mounting of the horn. Notably, the waveguide component is normally employed for design purposes to reduce heat transfer to the transducer and to optimize performance of the horn stack in terms of acoustics and handling. However, the waveguide is not a required component and is not always employed. Instead, the horn is often times directly connected to the booster.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The horn is an acoustical tool usually having a length of a multiple of one-half of the horn material wavelength and is normally comprised, for example, of aluminum, titanium, or steel that transfers the mechanical vibratory energy to the desired application point. Horn displacement or amplitude is the peak-to-peak movement of the horn face. The ratio of horn output amplitude to the horn input amplitude is termed “gain”. Gain is a function of the ratio of the mass of the horn at the vibration input and output sections. Generally, in horns, the direction of amplitude at the face of the horn is coincident with the direction of the applied mechanical vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Depending upon the particular application, the horn can assume a variety of shapes, including simple cylindrical, spool, bell, block, bar, etc. Further, the leading portion (or “tip”) of the horn can have a size and/or shape differing form a remainder of the horn body. In certain configurations, the horn tip can be a replaceable component. As used throughout this specification, the term “horn” is inclusive of both uniformly shaped horns as well as horn structures that define an identifiable horn tip. Finally, for certain applications such as ultrasonic cutting and welding, an additional anvil component is provided. Regardless, however, ultrasonic horn configuration and material composition is relatively standard.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For most ultrasonic applications, accepted horn materials of aluminum, titanium, and steel are highly viable, with the primary material selection criteria being the desired operational frequency. The material to which the ultrasonic energy is applied is at room temperature and relatively inert, such that horn wear, if any, is minimal. However, with certain other ultrasonic applications, wear concerns may arise. In particular, where the horn operates in an intense environment (e.g., corrosive and/or high temperature), accepted horn materials may not provide acceptable results. For example, ultrasonic energy is commonly employed to effectuate infiltration of a fluid medium into a working part. Fabrication of fiber reinforced metal matrix composite wires are one such example whereby a tow of fibers are immersed in a molten metal (e.g., aluminum-based molten metal). Acoustic waves are introduced into the molten metal (via an ultrasonic horn immersed therein), causing the molten metal to infiltrate the fiber tow, thus producing the metal matrix composite wire. The molten aluminum represents an extremely harsh environment, as it is both intensely hot (on the order of 700° C.) and chemically corrosive. Under severe conditions, titanium and steel horns will quickly deteriorate. Other available metal-based horn constructions provide only nominal horn working life improvements. For example, metal matrix composite wire manufacturers commonly employ a series of niobium-molybdenum alloys (e.g., at least 4.5% molybdenum) for the horn. Even with this more rigorous material selection, niobium-based horns provide a limited working life in molten aluminum before re-machining is required. Moreover, near the end of their “first” life, niobium alloy horns become unstable, potentially creating unexpected processing problems. In addition, formation of the niobium-molybdenum alloy horns entails precise, lengthy and expensive casting, hot working, and final machining operations. In view of the high cost of these and other materials, niobium (and its alloys) and other accepted horn materials are less than optimal for harsh environment ultrasonic applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ultrasonic devices are beneficially used in a number of applications. For certain implementations, however, the intense environment in which the ultrasonic horn operates renders current horn materials economically unavailing. Therefore, a need exists for an ultrasonic energy system, and in particular an ultrasonic horn, adapted to provide long-term performance under extreme operating conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention relates to an acoustic system for applying vibratory energy, including a horn connected to an ultrasonic energy source. At least a leading section of the horn is comprised of a ceramic material. More particularly, the horn defines an overall length and wavelength. The ceramic material leading section has a length of at least ⅛ the horn wavelength. In one embodiment, an entirety of the horn is a ceramic material, and is mounted to a separate component, such as a waveguide, via an interference fit. Regardless, by utilizing a ceramic material for at least a leading section of the horn, the ultrasonic system of the present invention facilitates long-tern operation in extreme environments such as high temperature and/or corrosive fluid mediums. For example, it has surprisingly been found that ceramic-based horns such as SiN<sub>4</sub>, sialon, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiC, TiB<sub>2</sub>, etc., have virtually no chemical reactivity when applying vibratory energy to highly corrosive and molten metal media, especially molten aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of applying ultrasonic energy in a fluid medium, and includes providing the fluid medium, and connecting an ultrasonic energy source to a horn at least a leading ⅛ wavelength of which is a ceramic material. At least a portion of the horn is immersed in the fluid medium. To this end, the horn is configured such that an entirety of the immersed portion thereof is comprised of the ceramic material. Finally, the ultrasonic energy source is operated such that the horn delivers ultrasonic energy to the fluid medium. In one embodiment, the fluid medium is corrosive and has a temperature of at least 500° C., and the method is characterized by not replacing the horn for at least 100 hours of ultrasonic energy delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of making a continuous composite wire. The method includes providing a contained volume of molten metal matrix material having a temperature of at least 600° C. A tow comprising a plurality of substantially continuous fibers is immersed into the contained volume of molten metal matrix material. Ultrasonic energy is imparted via a horn, at least the leading ⅛ wavelength of which is ceramic. The so-imparted ultrasonic energy causes vibration of at least a portion of the contained volume of molten metal matrix material to permit at least a portion of the molten metal matrix material to infiltrate into the plurality of fibers such that an infiltrated plurality of fibers is provided. Finally, the infiltrated plurality of fibers is withdrawn from the contained volume of molten metal matrix material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One embodiment of an ultrasonic system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In general terms, the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> includes an energy source <b>12</b> (shown in block form), an ultrasonic or horn stack <b>14</b>, and a cooling system <b>16</b>. Details on the various components arc described below. In general terms, however, the horn stack <b>14</b> includes a transducer <b>20</b>, a booster <b>22</b>, a waveguide <b>24</b>, and a horn <b>26</b>. At least a portion of the horn <b>26</b> is comprised of a ceramic material and is adapted to deliver mechanical vibratory energy generated by the transducer <b>20</b>, the booster <b>22</b>, and the waveguide <b>24</b> via input from the energy source <b>12</b>. The cooling system <b>16</b>, as described below, cools an interface between the horn <b>26</b> and the waveguide <b>24</b>. With this configuration, the ultrasonic system <b>10</b>, and in particular the horn <b>26</b>, can provide ultrasonic energy in extreme operating environments (e.g., elevated temperature and/or chemically corrosive) on a long-term basis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Several components of the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> are of types known in the art. For example, the energy source <b>12</b>, the transducer <b>20</b>, and the booster <b>22</b> are generally conventional components, and can assume a variety of forms. For example, in one embodiment, the energy source <b>12</b> is configured to provide high frequency electrical energy to the transducer <b>20</b>. The transducer <b>20</b> converts electricity from the energy source <b>12</b> to mechanical vibration, nominally 20 kHz. The transducer <b>20</b> in accordance with the present invention can thus be any available type such as piezoelectric, electromechanical, etc. Finally, the booster <b>22</b> is also of a type known in the art, adapted to amplify the vibrational output from the transducer <b>20</b> and transfer the same to waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b>. In this regard, while the system <b>10</b> can include the waveguide <b>24</b> between the booster <b>22</b> and the horn <b>26</b>, in an alternative embodiment, the horn <b>26</b> is directly connected to the booster <b>22</b> such that the waveguide <b>24</b> is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unlike the components described above, the horn <b>26</b>, and where provided the waveguide <b>24</b>, represent distinct improvements over known ultrasonic systems. In particular, a substantial portion of the horn <b>26</b>, and in one embodiment an entirety of the horn <b>26</b>, is formed of a ceramic material. By way of reference, the horn <b>26</b> is defined by a trailing end <b>30</b> and a leading end <b>32</b>. The trailing end <b>30</b> is attached to the waveguide <b>24</b>, whereas the leading end <b>32</b> represents the working end of the horn <b>26</b>. Thus, for example, where the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> is employed to deliver ultrasonic energy to a fluid medium, the leading end <b>32</b> (along with portions of the horn <b>26</b> adjacent the leading end <b>32</b>), is immersed in the fluid medium. With these designations in mind, the horn <b>26</b> is defined by a length from the trailing end <b>30</b> to the leading end <b>32</b>, and defines a horn material wavelength. The ceramic portion of the horn <b>26</b> is at least ⅛ of this wavelength in length, extending proximally from the leading end <b>32</b> toward the trailing end <b>30</b>. In other words, the horn <b>26</b> defines a ceramic leading section <b>34</b> having a length of at least ⅛ the horn material wavelength. Alternatively, the ceramic portion leading section <b>34</b> can have a length that is greater than ⅛ the horn material wavelength, for example at least ¼ wavelength or ½ wavelength. In a most preferred embodiment, an entirety of the horn <b>26</b> is formed of a ceramic material. Regardless, the ceramic portion of the horn is not a mere coating or small head piece; instead, the present invention utilizes ceramic along a significant portion of the horn <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A variety of ceramic materials are acceptable for the horn <b>26</b> (or the leading section <b>34</b> thereof as previously described), and includes at least one of carbide, nitride, and/or oxide materials. For example, the ceramic portion of the horn <b>26</b> can be silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, titanium diboride, zirconia, silicon carbide, etc. In an even more preferred embodiment, the ceramic portion of the horn <b>26</b> is an alumina, silicon nitride ceramic composite, such as sialon (Si<sub>6-x </sub>Al<sub>x </sub>O<sub>x </sub>N<sub>8-x</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the horn <b>26</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being a cylindrical rod, other shapes are available. For example, the horn <b>26</b> can be a rectangular- or square-shaped (in cross-section) bar, spherical, tapered, double tapered, etc. The selected shape of the horn <b>26</b> is a function of the intended end application.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Depending upon how the horn <b>26</b> is provided, the waveguide <b>24</b> can assume a variety of forms, as can the coupling therebetween. For example, where a trailing section <b>36</b> of the horn <b>26</b> is something other than ceramic (e.g., titanium, niobium, or other conventional horn material), the waveguide <b>24</b> can also be of a known configuration, as can the technique by which the horn <b>26</b> is secured to the waveguide <b>24</b>. For example, where the trailing section <b>36</b> of the horn <b>26</b> is comprised of a standard horn material, such as niobium and its alloys, the waveguide <b>24</b> can be formed of a titanium and/or steel material, and the horn <b>26</b> mounted thereto with a threaded fastener. Alternative mounting techniques not previously employed in the ultrasonic horn art are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with one embodiment in which an entirety of the horn <b>26</b> is formed of a ceramic material, a mechanical fit mounting technique can be employed to couple the horn <b>26</b> and the waveguide <b>24</b> (or the booster <b>22</b> when the waveguide <b>24</b> not included). For example, and with reference with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the waveguide <b>24</b> and the horn <b>26</b> are adapted to facilitate an interference fit therebetween. More particularly, the waveguide <b>24</b> forms an internal bore <b>38</b> having a dimension(s) corresponding with an outer dimension(s) of the horn <b>26</b>. Thus, for example, where the horn <b>26</b> is provided as a cylindrical rod, the bore <b>38</b> and the trailing end <b>30</b> define diameters selected to generate an appropriate interference fit therebetween. In this regard, and as previously described, the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> is preferably adapted for use in high temperature environments (i.e., at least 200° C.; at least 350° C. in another embodiment; at least 500° C. in another embodiment), such as molten metal. Under these conditions, the interference or junction fit must be such that the ceramic horn <b>26</b> does not loosen relative to the waveguide <b>24</b> at the high temperatures likely encountered. The waveguide <b>24</b> is formed in one embodiment of a material other than ceramic to best facilitate connection between the booster <b>22</b> and the horn <b>26</b>; it being recognized that by using varying materials for the waveguide <b>24</b> and the horn <b>26</b>, these components will expand at different rates when subjected to highly elevated temperatures. In conjunction with this material expansion, hoop stresses will be imparted by the horn <b>26</b> onto the waveguide <b>24</b> as the horn <b>26</b> expands. With this in mind, and in one embodiment, the waveguide <b>24</b> is formed of a titanium material as opposed to other often employed materials for these high temperature applications (such as niobium) because the hoop stresses caused by the interference fit are much less than the yield strength of titanium. That is to say, niobium (and alloys thereof) is unable to withstand expected hoop stresses at elevated temperatures (e.g., on the order of at least 500° C.). For example, where the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> is used to apply ultrasonic energy to a molten metal medium, the waveguide <b>24</b> is preferably titanium, and the bore <b>40</b> is selected to provide an interference fit of 0.003 inch at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above interference fit clamping-type technique for assembling the horn <b>26</b> to the waveguide <b>24</b> is but one acceptable approach. Other mechanical clamping techniques can be employed, such as forming the waveguide <b>24</b> to include a split clamp configuration, etc. Regardless, the junction point between the waveguide <b>24</b> and the horn <b>26</b> is preferably at the anti-node of the waveguide <b>24</b>, although other junction points (e.g., a vibrational node of the waveguide <b>24</b>) are acceptable. Regardless, the interference assembly technique of the horn <b>26</b> to the waveguide <b>24</b> facilitates overall tuning of the horn stack <b>14</b> by machining or adjusting of the waveguide <b>24</b>. This is in contrast to accepted techniques whereby the horn <b>26</b> is precisely machined as a half-wavelength horn. Due to the potential complications associated with machining of ceramics, the present invention facilitating machining the waveguide <b>24</b> as part of the tuning process. As such, the horn <b>26</b> can have a length that is something other than a half-wavelength. To this end, it is recognized that typically a half-wavelength requirement is needed for both the waveguide <b>24</b> and the horn <b>26</b> lengths to maintain nodes at a mid-span of the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b>, and anti-nodes at the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b> interface(s) for optimal resonance (e.g., 20 kHz) with minimum consumption of energy throughout the horn stack <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> includes, in one embodiment, the cooling system <b>16</b> for effectuating cooling of the previously described junction between the horn <b>26</b> and the waveguide <b>24</b>, as well as other components of the horn stack <b>14</b>. In general terms, one embodiment of the cooling system <b>16</b> includes a shroud <b>40</b>, an air source <b>42</b>, and a conduit(s) <b>44</b>. With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shroud <b>40</b> is sized for placement about the horn stack <b>14</b>, with a distal end <b>46</b> thereof being positioned adjacent the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b> junction. The conduit <b>44</b> fluidly connects the air source <b>42</b> with an interior of the shroud <b>40</b>, thereby directing forced airflow from the air source <b>42</b> within the shroud <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the system <b>10</b> further includes a bracket <b>48</b> for mounting of the horn stack <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, during use, a portion of the horn <b>26</b> (and in particular at least a portion of the ceramic leading section <b>34</b>) is immersed within a fluid medium <b>50</b>. For certain applications, the fluid medium <b>50</b> can be extremely hot, such as molten aluminum having a temperature of approximately 710° C. Under these conditions, heat from the fluid medium <b>50</b> may negatively affect stability of the mounting between the waveguide <b>24</b> and the horn <b>26</b>. In accordance with one embodiment, however, the cooling system <b>16</b> minimizes potential complications. In particular, the shroud <b>40</b> surrounds the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b> junction, and defines a gap <b>52</b> between the shroud <b>40</b> and the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b>. Air from the air source <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is forced into this gap <b>52</b> via the conduit <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and passes outwardly from the shroud <b>40</b>. Thus, the forced airflow removes heat from the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b> junction, and cools the waveguide <b>24</b>, the booster <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the transducer <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Alternatively, other cooling system designs can be employed. Further, where heat from the fluid medium <b>50</b> is of less concern and/or the waveguide <b>24</b>/horn <b>26</b> assembly is stable at expected temperatures, the cooling system <b>16</b> can be eliminated entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The ultrasonic system <b>10</b> of the present invention is highly useful for a variety of ultrasonic applications, especially those involving extreme environments, such as corrosive environments, high temperature fluid mediums, combinations thereof. In particular, by forming a relevant portion of the horn <b>26</b>, preferably an entirety of horn <b>26</b>, of a ceramic material, the horn <b>26</b> will not rapidly erode upon exposure to the extreme environment. In particular, selected ceramic materials, such as sialon, silicon nitride, titanium diboride, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, etc., are highly stable at elevated temperatures, and generally will not corrode when exposed to acidic fluids such as molten aluminum. Further, with respect to high temperature applications, the preferred ceramic horn <b>26</b> exhibits reduced heat transfer characteristics (as compared to known high temperature application horn materials such a niobium and niobium-molybdenum alloys) from the high temperature medium to a remainder of the horn stack. Thus, for molten metal applications having temperatures in excess of 700° C., the preferred ceramic horn <b>26</b> minimizes heat transfer to the transducer <b>20</b>, thereby greatly reducing the opportunity for damage to the transducer crystal. Where the horn <b>26</b> is entirely ceramic, the horn <b>26</b> exhibits virtually constant stiffness and density characteristics at ambient and elevated temperatures (e.g., in the range of 700° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the above in mind, one exemplary application of the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention is in the fabrication of fiber reinforced aluminum matrix composite wires. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates one example of a metal matrix composite wire fabrication system employing the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. The fabrication method reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is referred to as “cast through” and begins with a tow of polycrystalline α-Al<sub>2 </sub>O<sub>3 </sub>fiber <b>60</b> transported through an inlet die <b>62</b> and into a vacuum chamber <b>64</b> where the tow <b>60</b> is evacuated. The tow <b>60</b> is then transported through a cooling fixture <b>65</b> and then to a vessel <b>66</b> containing a metal matrix <b>68</b> in molten form. In general terms, the molten matrix metal <b>68</b> may be aluminum-based, having a temperature of at least 600° C., typically approximately 700° C. While immersed in the molten matrix metal <b>68</b>, the tow <b>60</b> is subjected to ultrasonic energy provided by the ultrasonic system <b>10</b>, and in particular the horn <b>26</b> that is otherwise immersed in the molten metal matrix <b>68</b>. Once again, an entirety of the horn <b>26</b> is preferably ceramic. Alternatively, where only the leading section <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is ceramic, the immersed portion of the horn <b>26</b> consists only of the ceramic leading section <b>34</b> (or a portion thereof). Regardless, the horn <b>26</b> vibrates the molten metal matrix <b>68</b>, preferably at 20 kHz. In doing so, the matrix material is caused to thoroughly infiltrate the fiber tow <b>60</b>. The infiltrated fiber tow <b>60</b> is drawn from the molten metal matrix <b>68</b>. A number of other metal matrix composite wire fabrication techniques in which the system <b>10</b> of the present invention is useful are known, one of which is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,245,425, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Regardless of the exact fabrication technique, and unlike existing ultrasonic systems incorporating a niobium horn, the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> of the present invention provides an extended operational time period without requiring replacement of the horn <b>26</b>. That is to say, niobium horns (and niobium alloys) used in molten metal infiltration applications typically fail due to erosion in less than 50 working hours. In contrast, the ultrasonic system <b>10</b>, and in particular the horn <b>26</b>, in accordance with the present invention surprisingly exhibits a useful working life well in excess of 100 working hours in molten metal; even in excess of 200 working hours in molten metal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the ultrasonic system <b>10</b> has been described as preferably being used with the fabrication of fiber reinforced aluminum matrix composite wire, benefits will be recognized with other acoustic or ultrasonic applications. Thus, the present invention is in no way limited to any one particular acoustic or ultrasonic application.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An ultrasonic horn stack was prepared by forming a cylindrical rod sialon horn having a length of approximately 11.75 inches and a diameter of 1 inch. The horn was interference fit-mounted to a titanium waveguide. The waveguide was mounted to a booster that in turn was mounted to a transducer. An appropriate energy source was electrically connected to the transducer. The so-constructed ultrasonic system was then operated to apply ultrasonic energy to a molten aluminum bath. In particular, aluminum metal was heated to a temperature in the range of about 705° C.-715° C. to form the molten aluminum bath. The ceramic horn was partially immersed in the molten aluminum bath, and the horn stack operated such that the horn transmitted approximately 65 watts at approximately 20 kHz and subjected to air cooling. At approximately 50-hour intervals, the horn was removed from the molten aluminum bath, acid etched, and visually checked for erosion. Further, stability of the junction between the waveguide and the horn was reviewed. The power and frequency readings, along with erosion and junction stability characteristics are noted in Table 1 below. After 200 hours of operation, the waveguide/horn junction remained highly stable, and very limited horn erosion or fatigue was identified. Thus, the ceramic horn was able to withstand delivery of ultrasonic energy to a corrosive, high temperature environment for an extended period of time. Notably, it is believed that horn and waveguide/horn junction stability would have been maintained for many additional hours beyond the 200-hour test. Additionally, measurements were taken to determine whether slight erosion of the ceramic horn results in transfer of horn material, and in particular silicon, to the molten bath. With respect to Example 1, the silicon content of the molten aluminum bath was measured at 153 ppm prior to applying ultrasonic energy. After 150 hours, the silicon content of the bath was again tested, and was found to be 135 ppm. Thus, silicon content of the bath was not adversely affected by the ceramic ultrasonic horn.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Preparation of Metal Matrix Composite Wires</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Composite metal matrix wires were prepared using tows of NEXTEL™ 610 alumina ceramic fibers (commercially available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.) immersed in a molten aluminum-based bath and subjected to ultrasonic energy to effectuate infiltration of the tow. In particular, an ultrasonic system that included a sialon horn, similar to the horn described in Example 1, was employed as part of a cast through methodology, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The process parameters were similar to those employed for fabricating aluminum matrix composites (AMC) and fully described in Example 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,344,270 ('270), herein incorporated by reference. The sialon horn of present invention replaced the niobium alloy horn described in the '270 patent. With this Example, the sialon horn transmitted about 65 watts at a frequency of about 20 kHz. Approximately 6,500 feet of wire was produced over the course of thirteen experimental runs, and was tensile tested using a tensile tester (commercially available as Instron 4201 tester from Instron of Canton, Mass.), pursuant to ASTM D 3379-75 (Standard Test Methods for Tensile Strength and Young's Modulus for High Modulus Single-Filament Materials). The tensile strength of the wires produced in accordance with Example 2 was virtually identical to that associated with metal matrix composite wires fabricated using a niobium-alloy ultrasonic horn, exhibiting a longitudinal strength in the range of approximately 1.51 GPa.</p>
