No. 6,575,159, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/162,133, filed Oct. 29, 1999. The disclosure of the above-referenced provisional patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a portable liquid oxygen unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therapeutic oxygen is the delivery of substantially pure oxygen to a patient in order to facilitate breathing. When a patient suffers from pulmonary/respiratory problems, delivery of oxygen helps the patient get an adequate level of oxygen into his or her bloodstream.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therapeutic oxygen may be warranted in cases where a patient suffers from a loss of lung capacity. Medical conditions that may make oxygen necessary are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including asthma, emphysema, etc., as well as cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, lung injuries, and cardiovascular diseases, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Related art practice has been to provide portable oxygen in two ways. In a first approach, compressed oxygen gas is provided in a pressure bottle, and the gas is output through a pressure regulator and a hose to the nostrils of the patient. The bottle is often wheeled so that the patient may be mobile. The drawback of compressed, gaseous oxygen is that a full charge of a bottle that is portable does not last very long.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to get around this limitation, in a second approach a related art liquid oxygen (LOX) apparatus has been used wherein LOX is stored in a container and the gaseous oxygen that evaporates from the LOX is inhaled by the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The related art LOX apparatus enjoys a longer usable charge than the compressed gas apparatus for a given size and weight, but has its own drawbacks. LOX, being a liquid that is very cold, requires a vacuum-insulated container.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Related art portable LOX units typically are formed with necks that can fill with LOX when tipped, and thus are to be used and carried only in a generally vertical position. This can be impractical at times, such as when driving a vehicle, for example. A vertically positioned related art portable LOX unit is unstable and could potentially cause problems for both the oxygen user and for other drivers if it shifts, slides, or tumbles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There remains a need in the art, therefore, for an improved portable LOX unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment of a portable liquid oxygen unit <b>100</b> of the present invention. The portable LOX unit includes an outer shell <b>101</b> and a container <b>104</b> within the outer shell <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A space <b>110</b> exists around the container <b>104</b> and is preferably evacuated to at least a partial vacuum. In the illustrated embodiment, the container <b>104</b> is held and supported within the outer shell <b>101</b> by an optional top support <b>118</b> and an optional bottom support <b>119</b> (discussed below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The container <b>104</b> may be insulated or may be formed of a material having heat insulating properties.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The container <b>104</b> is formed of a top portion <b>105</b>, a bottom portion <b>106</b>, and a sidewall <b>107</b>. The sidewall <b>107</b> includes a first side portion <b>108</b> and a second side portion <b>109</b>, both extending between the top portion <b>105</b> and the bottom portion <b>106</b>, but with the second side portion <b>109</b> being on an opposite side of the container <b>104</b> from the first side portion <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The container <b>104</b> also includes a liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> and a gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b>. The gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> allows withdrawal of gaseous oxygen from the container <b>104</b>. The gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> enters the container <b>104</b> and has a first outlet <b>117</b> communicating with an interior of the container <b>104</b>. The first outlet <b>117</b> is located adjacent a first juncture between the top portion <b>105</b> and the first side portion <b>108</b> of the container <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> exits both the container <b>104</b> and the outer shell <b>101</b>, and forms a first port <b>440</b> in the container <b>104</b> and in the outer shell <b>101</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The first port <b>440</b> is located adjacent the first juncture between the top portion <b>105</b> and the first side portion <b>108</b> of the container <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> allows withdrawal of LOX from the container <b>104</b>. The liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> extends diagonally across the interior of the container <b>104</b> and has a liquid withdrawal (second) outlet <b>114</b> positioned in the bottom portion <b>106</b> of the container <b>104</b>. The second outlet <b>114</b> is located adjacent a second juncture between the bottom portion <b>106</b> and the second side portion <b>109</b>. The liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> may exit through a second port <b>441</b> adjacent the first port <b>440</b>, with the second port <b>441</b> preferably being concentric with the gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> and exiting within the first port <b>440</b>. Thus, at least a portion of the liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> may be located within the gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an alternate position of the portable LOX unit <b>100</b> illustrating how the portable LOX unit <b>100</b> may be used in different orientations. As can be seen from the figure, the second outlet <b>114</b> of the liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> still resides at a low point of the container <b>104</b>. It can also be seen from the figure that the first outlet <b>117</b> of the gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> remains at a high point in the portable LOX unit <b>100</b>. Even in a horizontal orientation, the portable LOX unit <b>100</b> maintains the liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> and the gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> at desired positions to enable both LOX and gaseous oxygen withdrawal. Therefore, the position of the portable LOX unit <b>100</b> is not limited by the internal configuration of withdrawal conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a detail of the insulated support system <b>119</b>. The insulated support system <b>119</b> supports and positions the container <b>104</b> within the outer shell <b>101</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). A top insulated support <b>118</b> is centrally located on the top portion <b>105</b> of the container <b>104</b> and extends upwardly from the top portion <b>105</b>. A bottom insulated support <b>119</b> is centrally located on the bottom portion <b>106</b> of the container <b>104</b> and extends downwardly from the bottom portion <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The insulated support system <b>119</b> includes an outer shell support <b>121</b>, a container support <b>124</b>, and an insulated support <b>127</b>. The outer shell support <b>121</b> is attached to the outer shell <b>101</b> (top or bottom), while the container support <b>124</b> is attached to the container <b>104</b>. The insulated support <b>127</b> is attached to neither and is merely placed between the two for the purposes of cushioning and insulating. Therefore, the container supports <b>124</b> of both the top and bottom insulated support systems <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> are telescopically received by the respective outer shell supports <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be noted that the insulated support <b>127</b> is preferably made of an insulating material. This is done to minimize heat transfer from the outer shell <b>101</b> to the container <b>104</b>. Due to the insulated support <b>127</b>, the container support <b>124</b> does not come into contact with the outer shell support <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the portable LOX unit <b>100</b> of the present invention being used in a portable LOX system <b>400</b>. The portable LOX unit <b>100</b> further includes a third port <b>401</b> and a LOX delivery conduit <b>402</b>. The LOX delivery conduit <b>402</b> enters the outer shell <b>101</b> through a third port <b>401</b> and also enters the container <b>104</b>. The third port <b>401</b> is located adjacent a third juncture between the first side portion <b>108</b> and the bottom portion <b>106</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The LOX delivery conduit <b>402</b> terminates with an open end <b>404</b> located within the container <b>104</b> and adjacent the top portion <b>105</b> of the container <b>104</b>. Preferably, the open end <b>404</b> is centrally located within the top portion <b>105</b>, so that when LOX is being charged into the container, it flows along the internal sidewall portions of the container so as to minimize turbulence of LOX within the container, thereby facilitating maximal filling of the container with LOX.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the emergence of the gaseous withdrawal conduit <b>116</b> and the liquid withdrawal conduit <b>113</b> from the portable LOX unit <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, both conduits <b>113</b> and <b>116</b> concentrically emerge from the container <b>104</b>, and then emerge from the outer shell <b>101</b> at the first port <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the invention has been described in detail above and shown in the drawings, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments as described and shown.</p>
