<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus and an image transferring unit for use in the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A copier, printer or similar electrophotographic image forming apparatus includes a photoconductive drum or similar photoconductive element on which a toner image is to be formed. Arranged around the drum are a charger, a developing unit and a cleaning unit, which are image forming means joining in the formation of the toner image. An image transfer roller and an intermediate image transfer belt transfer the toner image from the drum to a sheet or recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The various members stated above each have a particular life determined beforehand in accordance with the material and the condition of use and are replaced when the life ends. Each member sometimes must be replaced before the end of life due to the deposition of impurities or scratches.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the various members may be configured to be replaced individually, such a configuration not only increases the frequency of replacement and therefore time and labor necessary for replacement, but also sometimes scratch or otherwise damage the members around the member being replaced. In light of this, a current trend in the imaging art is toward an image forming apparatus in which the drum, charger, developing unit and cleaning unit are constructed into a single process cartridge bodily removable from the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, there has recently been proposed an image forming apparatus in which the drum, which is more expensive than the other members, is extended in life and replaceable independently of the other members. In this configuration, when the quality of an image transferred to a sheet is lowered due to scratches formed on the drum, the drum is replaced alone.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, scratches formed on the drum are, in many cases, ascribable to an intermediate image transfer belt, sheet conveying belt, image transfer roller or similar image transferring member pressed against the drum. It is therefore likely that after the replacement of the scratched drum a new drum is also scratched in a short period of time and again lowers image quality unless the image transferring member, causative of the scratches, is replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, in a color image forming apparatus including an intermediate image transfer belt, when impurities, including residual toner and paper dust, adhere to the outer surface of the belt, they scratch the above surface in the form of spots when pressed against the surface. As the impurities are repeatedly pressed against the drum, the spot-like scratches on the drum grow little by little and soon become stripe-like scratches. Such scratches capture a large amount of toner and appear in an image transferred to the sheet as black stripes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, when the impurities enter nips between the inner surface of the intermediate image transfer belt and rollers supporting it, they cause corresponding projections to appear on the outer surface of the belt. The projections of the belt also scratch the drum in the form of spots when pressed against the drum. These spot-like scratches also become stripe-like scratches.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a color image forming apparatus of the type using a conveying belt for conveying a sheet in place of the intermediate image transfer belt, the conveying belt is not directly pressed against the drum during image formation because a sheet intervenes between the belt and the drum. However, the belt is pressed against the drum at the interval between consecutive sheets. As a result, when impurities adhered to the outer surface of the belt or enter nips between the belt and rollers supporting it and cause the outer surface of the belt to project, stripe-like scratches are also formed on the drum. This is also true with a monochromatic image forming apparatus including an image transfer roller pressed against the drum.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Technologies relating to the present invention are also disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 2000-227688 and 2002-108049.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an object of the present invention to allow, when image quality is lowered due to scratches formed on a photoconductive element, the drum and an image transferring member, causative of the scratches, to be replaced together for thereby obviating time- and labor-consuming replacing work and freeing a new photoconductive element from the same scratches.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is another object of the present invention to allow, when the degradation of image quality is not ascribable to the image transferring member, but is ascribable to the photoconductive element itself, e.g., when charge products deposit on the element in the form of a film, only the element to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention, in an image forming apparatus for forming a toner image on the circumferential surface of a photoconductive element and transferring it to a recording medium, the photoconductive element and an image transferring member, pressed against the above surface, are constructed into an image transferring unit. The image transferring unit is removable from the casing of the apparatus independently of image forming devices arranged around the photoconductive element other than the image transferring member.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> of the drawings, a first embodiment of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is shown and implemented as a color printer by way of example. As shown, the color printer, generally <b>1</b>, includes a casing <b>2</b>. Four image forming stations <b>3</b>Y (yellow), <b>3</b>C (cyan), <b>3</b>M (magenta) and <b>3</b>B (black), an exposing unit <b>4</b> and an endless, intermediate image transfer belt or image transferring member <b>5</b> are arranged in substantially the center portion of the casing <b>2</b>. Because the image forming stations <b>3</b>Y through <b>3</b>B are identical in configuration with each other except for the color of toner to use, structural elements thereof are sometimes also distinguished from each other by suffixes Y through B.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image forming stations <b>3</b>Y through <b>3</b>B each include a photoconductive drum or photoconductive element <b>6</b> rotatable in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Arranged around the drum <b>6</b> are a charger <b>7</b>, a developing unit <b>8</b> and a cleaning unit <b>9</b> each constituting particular image forming means.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The drum <b>6</b> is made up of a hollow cylindrical core formed of aluminum and provided with a diameter of 30 mm to 100 mm and a photoconductive layer formed on the core. The charger <b>7</b> uniformly charges the surface of the drum <b>6</b> without contacting the drum <b>6</b>. The exposing unit <b>4</b> scans the surface of the drum <b>6</b> thus charged with a laser beam in accordance with image data to thereby form a latent image. A slit <b>10</b> is positioned between the charger <b>7</b> and the developing unit <b>8</b>, so that the laser beam from the exposing unit <b>4</b> can scan the drum <b>6</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The developing unit <b>8</b> deposits toner on the latent image formed on the drum <b>6</b> to thereby produce a corresponding toner image. In the illustrative embodiment, the developing unit <b>8</b> effects development without contacting the drum <b>6</b>. The cleaning unit <b>9</b> removes toner left on the drum <b>6</b> after image transfer and, in the illustrative embodiment, uses a brush held in contact with the drum <b>6</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cleaning unit <b>9</b> is formed with an opening <b>9</b><i>a </i>facing upward, i.e., positioned such that the opening <b>9</b><i>a </i>is inclined relative to a horizontal plane by an angle smaller than 90°.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The intermediate image transfer belt (simply belt hereinafter) <b>5</b> includes a base implemented by a 50 μm to 600 μm thick resin film or rubber. The belt <b>5</b> is provided with resistance that allows the toner image to be transferred from the drum <b>6</b> to the belt <b>5</b>. The belt <b>5</b> is passed over rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and caused to turn in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Four image transfer rollers <b>14</b> are positioned inside of the loop of the belt <b>6</b> for transferring toner images of different colors from the drums <b>6</b> to the belt <b>5</b> one above the other. This image transfer will be referred to as primary image transfer. A cleaning unit <b>15</b> is positioned outside of the loop of the belt <b>6</b> for removing toner left on the belt <b>5</b> after image transfer and other impurities, including paper dust, from the belt <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A sheet cassette <b>16</b> is positioned below the four image forming stations <b>3</b>Y through <b>3</b>B and exposing unit <b>4</b> and loaded with a stack of sheets or recording media S. The sheets S are sequentially fed from the sheet cassette <b>16</b> one by one, the top sheet S being first. The sheet S, fed from the sheet cassettes <b>16</b>, is conveyed along a sheet path <b>17</b> on which a registration roller pair <b>18</b>, an image transfer roller for secondary image transfer <b>19</b>, a fixing unit <b>20</b> and an outlet roller pair <b>21</b> are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The registration roller pair <b>18</b> stops the sheet S reached its nip and then starts conveying it at preselected timing toward a secondary image transfer position between the belt <b>5</b> and the image transfer roller <b>19</b>. At the secondary image transfer position, a composite color toner image formed on the belt <b>5</b> is transferred to the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fixing unit <b>20</b> fixes the toner image transferred to the sheet S with heat and pressure. The sheet S with the toner image thus fixed is driven out to a stack tray <b>22</b>, which is formed on the top of the casing <b>2</b>, by the outlet roller pair <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A toner bottle storage <b>24</b> is positioned above the image forming stations <b>3</b>Y through <b>3</b>B and belt <b>5</b> and stores toner containers <b>23</b>Y, <b>23</b>C, <b>23</b>M and <b>23</b>B removably mounted thereto. The toner containers <b>23</b>Y through <b>23</b>B each store toner of a particular color to be replenished to associated one of the developing stations <b>3</b>Y through <b>3</b>B by a respective conveying mechanism not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the illustrative embodiment, the four drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b> are constructed into a single image transferring unit <b>25</b>. Also, at each of the image forming stations <b>3</b>Y through <b>3</b>B, the charger <b>7</b>, developing unit <b>8</b> and cleaning unit <b>9</b> are constructed into a single image forming unit <b>26</b>. Four image forming units <b>26</b> thus configured are mounted on a single image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a</i>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, and each is removable from the tray <b>26</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the printer in a condition wherein a front cover <b>27</b>, mounted on the front end of the casing <b>2</b>, is opened. In this condition, the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a</i>, loaded with the four image forming units <b>26</b>, and toner bottle storage <b>24</b> are freely accessible in the event of replacement. A moving mechanism, not shown, is arranged between the image transferring unit <b>25</b> and image forming units <b>26</b> and configured to selectively move the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>upward or downward for thereby moving the image forming units <b>26</b> toward or away from the image transferring unit <b>25</b>. More specifically, the moving mechanism lowers the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>downward when the operator of the printer opens the front cover <b>27</b> or raises the tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>when the operator closes the front cover <b>27</b>. Alternatively, the moving mechanism may move the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>upward or downward with a cam operated by a lever.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a condition wherein the image transferring unit <b>25</b> is pulled out from the casing <b>2</b> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a condition wherein the image forming units <b>26</b> are pulled out from the casing <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view showing the inside of the printer from which the image transferring unit <b>25</b> has been pulled out from the casing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the illustrative embodiment, the image transferring unit <b>25</b> and image forming units <b>26</b> each are removable from the casing <b>2</b> independently of each other, as stated above. Alternatively, an arrangement may be made such that the image transferring unit <b>25</b> and image forming units <b>26</b> can be pulled out integrally with each other, in which case the image forming unit <b>25</b> will be parted from the image forming units and replaced or the latter will be replaced after the former has been parted therefrom. This alternative arrangement makes the moving mechanism between the image transferring unit <b>25</b> and the image forming units <b>26</b> unnecessary, i.e., it suffices to position the image transferring unit <b>25</b> above the image forming units <b>26</b> at a preselected distance. As a result, the structure for mounting the image forming units <b>26</b> and image transferring unit <b>25</b> to the casing <b>2</b> is simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the image transferring unit <b>25</b> includes a frame including a front and a rear side wall <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b </i>for supporting the belt <b>5</b>, a pair of side wall <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>supporting the image transfer rollers <b>14</b>Y, <b>14</b>C and <b>14</b>M, and stays, not shown, connecting the side walls <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b </i>and side walls <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b</i>. The rollers <b>11</b> through <b>13</b> and image transfer roller <b>14</b>B are supported between the side walls <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b</i>. Slide rails <b>30</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, are affixed to the stays, which form part of the image transferring unit <b>25</b>, so that the image transferring unit <b>25</b> can be smoothly moved into or out of the casing <b>2</b>. A cover <b>31</b>, formed of resin, is affixed to the upper portion of the side walls <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, grips <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> are positioned on the front and top, respectively, of the cover <b>31</b>, so that the operator can hold the grips <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> when mounting or dismounting the image transferring unit <b>25</b> to or from the casing <b>2</b>. Springs <b>34</b> are anchored to the shaft portions of the image transfer roller <b>14</b>, constantly biasing the roller <b>14</b> toward the drum <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The image transfer roller <b>14</b>B is so located as to press the belt <b>5</b> against the drum <b>6</b>. The other image transfer rollers <b>14</b>Y, <b>14</b>C and <b>14</b>M are movable together with the side walls <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>between a position where they release the belt <b>5</b> from the drums <b>6</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and a position where they press the former against the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">How the image forming unit <b>25</b> holds the drums <b>6</b> will be described more specifically hereinafter. A front drum holder <b>35</b> is affixed to the side wall <b>28</b><i>a </i>while the outer race of a ball bearing <b>36</b> is press-fitted in the front drum holder <b>35</b>. A spring holder <b>37</b> is press-fitted in the inner race of the ball bearing <b>36</b> while one end of a compression spring <b>38</b> is received in the spring holder <b>37</b>. A flange <b>6</b><i>b</i>, protruding from the rear end of the drum <b>6</b>, is received in a rear drum holder <b>39</b> with sufficient clearance. A flange <b>6</b><i>a</i>, protruding from the front end of the drum <b>6</b>, is inserted in the other end of the compression spring <b>38</b>. In this configuration, each drum <b>6</b> is held between the front and rear drum holders <b>35</b> and <b>39</b> by the compression spring <b>38</b> and removably held by the image transferring unit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Four drum shaft holders <b>40</b> are affixed to a side wall, not shown, disposed in the casing <b>2</b>, and each supports the shaft <b>42</b> of a particular drum <b>6</b>. More specifically, the shaft <b>42</b> is supported by the drum shaft holder <b>40</b> via two ball bearings <b>41</b> while a coupling <b>43</b> is press fitted on the shaft <b>42</b>. The shaft <b>42</b> extends horizontally and has a diameter of 12 mm at the rear side where the bearings <b>41</b> and coupling <b>43</b> are press-fitted and a diameter of 10 mm at the front side.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Reference will be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> for describing a structure for mounting the image transferring unit <b>25</b>, which supports the belt <b>5</b> and four drums <b>6</b>, to the casing <b>2</b> in detail. When the image transferring unit <b>25</b> is slid into the casing <b>2</b>, the leading end portion of each shaft <b>42</b> is inserted into the associated drum <b>6</b> from the rear flange <b>6</b><i>b </i>toward the front flange <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the drum <b>6</b>. When the image transferring unit <b>25</b> is slid into the casing <b>2</b> as far as a position where the 12 mm portion of the shaft <b>42</b> fits in a hole <b>44</b> formed in the rear flange <b>6</b><i>b </i>and having a diameter of 12 mm, the rear side of the drum <b>6</b> is positioned relative to the casing <b>2</b>. At the same time, the coupling <b>43</b> is brought into mesh with a meshing portion <b>43</b><i>a </i>formed on the rear flange <b>6</b><i>b</i>, so that drive torque can be transferred from a drive source, not shown, to the drum <b>6</b>. Further, part of the rear drum holder <b>39</b> is received in the outer race of the ball bearing <b>41</b>, positioning the entire image forming unit <b>25</b> relative to the casing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The front end portion of the shaft <b>42</b> is inserted in a hole <b>45</b> formed in the rear flange <b>6</b><i>a </i>and having a diameter of 10 mm, a hole <b>46</b> formed in the spring holder <b>37</b> and having a diameter of 11 mm, and the inner race of a bearing <b>47</b> mounted on the side wall <b>28</b><i>a </i>and having a diameter of 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, slide rails <b>48</b> are affixed to opposite sides of the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>and allow the tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>to be slid into or out of the casing <b>2</b>. A grip <b>49</b> protrudes from the front end of the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a</i>, so that the operator can mount or dismount the tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>to or from the casing <b>2</b> by holding the grip <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a color print mode, toner images of different colors are formed on the drums <b>6</b> and sequentially transferred to the belt <b>5</b> one above the other, completing a color toner image on the belt <b>5</b>. When the sheet S fed from the sheet cassette <b>16</b> is nipped and conveyed by the belt <b>5</b> and secondary image transfer roller <b>19</b>, the color toner image is transferred from the belt <b>5</b> to the sheet S. The color toner image is then fixed on the sheet S by the fixing unit <b>20</b>. Subsequently, the sheet or color print S is driven out to the stack tray <b>22</b> by the outlet roller pair <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is likely that the quality of the color image, formed on the sheet S by the above procedure, is lowered by various causes including scratches formed on the drums <b>6</b>. Scratches on the drums <b>6</b> are, in many cases, ascribable to the belt <b>5</b>. For example, when impurities, including residual toner and paper dust, adhere to the outer surface of the belt <b>5</b>, they scratch the above surface in the form of spots when pressed against the surface. During image formation, the belt <b>5</b> and each drum <b>6</b> rarely contact each other at the same position so that the impurities on the belt <b>5</b> are pressed against different portions of the drum <b>6</b> every time image formation is repeated. As a result, the spot-like scratches on the drum <b>6</b> grow little by little and soon become stripe-like scratches. Such scratches capture a large amount of toner and appear in an image transferred to the sheet S as black stripes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, when impurities enter the nips between the inner surface of the belt <b>5</b> and the rollers <b>11</b> through <b>13</b>, they cause corresponding projections to appear on the outer surface of the belt <b>15</b>. The projections of the belt <b>15</b> also scratch the drum <b>6</b> in the form of spots when pressed against the drum <b>6</b>. These spot-like scratches also become stripe-like scratches in due course and therefore appear in an image on the sheet S as black stripes for the same reason as stated in relation to the belt <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the above situation, if only the drums <b>6</b> are replaced, then new drums <b>6</b> will also suffer from the same scratches in a short period of time, lowering image quality. Therefore, not only the scratched drums <b>6</b> but also the belt <b>5</b>, causative of the scratches, must be replaced. For this reason, in the illustrative embodiment, the image transferring unit <b>2</b> is bodily replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to replace the entire image transferring unit <b>2</b>, the operator opens the front cover <b>27</b>. At this instance, the moving mechanism lowers the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>to thereby move the image forming units <b>26</b> away from the image transferring unit <b>25</b> in interlocked relation to the opening of the front cover <b>27</b>. The operator then slides the image transferring unit <b>25</b> toward the front by holding the grip <b>32</b> of the unit <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Subsequently, the operator removes the image forming unit <b>25</b> from the casing <b>2</b> by holding the grips <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. At this instant, the four drums <b>6</b> are released from the respective shafts <b>42</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. The operator then mounts a new image transferring unit <b>25</b> to the casing <b>2</b> in a sequence opposite to the above sequence, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and again closes the front cover <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As stated above, in the illustrative embodiment, when image quality on the sheet S is lowered due to the scratches of the drums <b>6</b>, the operator can replace both of the drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b>, which is quite probably causative of scratches, at the same time. This makes replacing work far easier than when the drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b> are replaced independently of each other. Further, such replacement can be performed without scratching or exposing the surfaces of the drums <b>6</b>. As for exposure, the belt <b>5</b>, positioned above the drums <b>6</b>, serves to sufficiently intercept light otherwise being incident to the drums <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The degradation of image quality on the sheet S is sometimes not ascribable to the impurities adhered to the belt <b>5</b> or the projections of the belt <b>5</b>, but ascribable to the individual drum <b>6</b>, e.g., a film formed on the drum <b>6</b> by charge products. In such a case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, only the drum or drums <b>6</b>, caused the degradation of image quality to occur, can be replaced after the removable of the image transferring unit <b>25</b> from the casing <b>2</b>. For this purpose, the operator moves the drum <b>6</b> concerned toward the compression spring <b>38</b> against the bias of the spring <b>38</b> for thereby releasing the rear flange <b>6</b><i>b </i>from the rear drum holder <b>39</b>. The operator then releases the front flange <b>6</b><i>a </i>from the end of the compression spring <b>38</b>. To mount a new drum <b>6</b>, the operator sets the new drum <b>6</b> and compression spring <b>38</b> on the front drum holder <b>35</b>, inserts the rear side into the rear drum holder <b>39</b> while compressing the compression spring <b>38</b>, and inserts the front drum holder <b>35</b> into a hole <b>35</b><i>a</i>, which is formed in the side wall <b>28</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the front drum holder <b>35</b> slides forward in the hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>under the action of the compression spring <b>38</b> and is prevented from slipping out of the hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As stated above, when the degradation of image quality is ascribable to a particular drum <b>6</b>, only the particular drum <b>6</b> can be replaced with the other drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b> being continuously used. This successfully obviates a wasteful increase in cost. Even when the image transferring unit <b>25</b> is positioned outside of the casing <b>2</b> for the replacement of a particular drum <b>6</b>, the belt <b>5</b> positioned above the drums <b>6</b> protects the other drums <b>6</b>, which are still usable, from external light.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, after the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>has been lowered in interlocked relation to the opening of the front cover <b>27</b>, the operator can pull out the tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>toward the front, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Subsequently, the operator can remove any one of the image forming units <b>26</b>, including the charger <b>7</b>, developing unit <b>8</b>, and cleaning unit <b>9</b>, from the image forming unit tray <b>26</b><i>a </i>and replace it with new one.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Generally, the charger <b>7</b>, developing unit <b>8</b> and cleaning unit <b>9</b> are shorter in life than the drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b> and therefore replaced more frequently than the drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, the charger <b>7</b>, developing unit <b>8</b> and cleaning unit <b>9</b>, configured integrally with each other, can be replaced at the same time. This, coupled with the fact that such replacement can be performed without removing the drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>5</b> from the casing <b>2</b>, promotes easy, rapid replacement of the units <b>7</b> through <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the illustrative embodiment, the opening <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the cleaning unit <b>9</b> faces upward, as stated earlier. Therefore, even when any one of the image forming units <b>26</b> is removed from the casing <b>2</b> with the opening <b>9</b><i>a </i>remaining uncovered, waste toner, collected by the cleaning unit <b>9</b>, is preventing from dropping via the opening <b>9</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While the illustrative embodiment has concentrated on the drums <b>6</b> each playing role of an image carrier, photoconductive belts may be substituted for the drums <b>6</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A second embodiment of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, structural elements identical with those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref> are designated by identical reference numerals and will not be described specifically in order to avoid redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a color printer <b>50</b> includes a top structural body <b>52</b> hinged to the upper portion of the casing <b>2</b> by a shaft <b>51</b> and a side structural body <b>54</b> hinged to the casing <b>2</b> by a shaft <b>53</b>. The top structural body <b>52</b> includes the toner bottle storage <b>24</b> to which the toner bottles <b>23</b>Y through <b>23</b>B are removably mounted. The side structural body <b>54</b> includes the fixing unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">An image transferring unit <b>55</b> is mounted on the bottom of the top structural body <b>52</b> and slidable in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The image transferring unit <b>55</b>, basically identical with the image transferring unit <b>25</b>, includes a frame <b>56</b> supporting the belt <b>5</b> and four drums <b>6</b>. Grips <b>57</b> (only one is visible) are positioned on opposite side walls of the frame <b>56</b>, so that the operator can slide the image transferring unit <b>55</b> in the above direction by holding the grips <b>57</b>. The drums <b>6</b> each are supported by the frame <b>56</b> in such a manner as to be removable independently of the others.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The four image forming units <b>26</b> are removably disposed in the casing <b>2</b> while facing the four drums <b>6</b> mounted on the image transferring unit <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the drums <b>6</b> with scratches and belt <b>5</b>, which is presumably the cause of the scratches, should be replaced, the operator opens the top structural body <b>52</b> away from the casing <b>2</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and then pulls out the image transferring unit <b>55</b> from the top structural body <b>52</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow. Subsequently, the operator replaces the image transferring unit <b>55</b> with a new image transferring unit <b>55</b> and again closes the top structural body <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">On the other hand, when the degradation of image quality is ascribable to any one of the drums <b>6</b> itself, the operator replaces only the drum <b>6</b> concerned while leaving the other drums <b>6</b> still usable and belt <b>5</b> in the image transferring unit <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, the operator may replace any one of the image forming units <b>26</b> by opening the top structural body <b>52</b> to thereby expose the image forming units <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Reference will be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> for describing a third embodiment of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention. As shown, a color printer <b>60</b> is identical with the first embodiment except that it does not include an intermediate image transfer belt. Identical structural elements are designated by identical reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">More specifically, the color printer <b>60</b> includes a conveying belt <b>61</b> for conveying the sheet S and also playing the role of an image transferring member pressed against the drums <b>6</b>. The conveying belt (simply belt hereinafter) <b>61</b> is also passed over the rollers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and caused to turn in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> while electrostatically retaining the sheet S. The four image transfer rollers <b>14</b> are positioned inside of the loop of the belt <b>61</b> for transferring toner images of different colors from the drums <b>6</b> to the sheet S one above the other. The cleaning unit <b>15</b> is positioned outside of the loop of the belt <b>61</b> for removing impurities, including toner left on the belt <b>61</b> after image transfer and paper dust, from the belt <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the illustrative embodiment, the four drums <b>6</b> and belt <b>61</b> are constructed into a single image transferring unit <b>62</b>, which also includes the side walls <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>and stays shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The belt <b>61</b> is positioned above the drums <b>6</b> while each drum <b>6</b> is removable from the image transferring unit <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The image transferring unit <b>62</b> is removably mounted to the casing <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the inside of the printer <b>60</b> with the image transferring unit <b>62</b> mounted thereto while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the inside of the same from which the image forming unit <b>62</b> has been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a color print mode, toner images of different colors are formed on the drums <b>6</b> and sequentially transferred to the sheet S, which is fed from the sheet cassette <b>16</b> and being conveyed by the conveying belt <b>61</b>, one above the other, completing a color toner image on the sheet S.

Scratches on the drums <b>6</b> are, in many cases, ascribable to the belt <b>61</b>. For example, when impurities, including residual toner and paper dust, adhere to the outer surface of the belt <b>61</b>, they are not directly pressed against the drums <b>6</b> during image formation because the sheet S intervenes between the belt <b>61</b> and the drums <b>6</b>. However, the belt <b>61</b> is pressed against the drums <b>6</b> at the interval between consecutive sheets S. As a result, the impurities adhered to the outer surface of the belt <b>61</b> are pressed against the drums <b>6</b> like the impurities adhered to the belt <b>5</b> of the first embodiment, forming stripe-like scratches on the drums <b>6</b> stated earlier. Such scratches capture a large amount of toner and appear in an image transferred to the sheet S as black stripes.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, when impurities enter the nips between the inner surface of the belt <b>61</b> and the rollers <b>11</b> through <b>13</b>, they cause corresponding projections to appear on the outer surface of the belt <b>61</b>.

For this reason, in the illustrative embodiment, too, the image transferring unit <b>62</b> is bodily replaced. To replace the image transferring unit <b>62</b>, the operator opens the front cover <b>27</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and then pulls out the image transferring unit <b>62</b> toward the front in the same manner as in the first embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the illustrative embodiment, too, the image transferring unit <b>62</b> and image forming units <b>26</b> each are removable from the casing <b>2</b> independently of each other. Alternatively, an arrangement may be made such that the image transferring unit <b>62</b> and image forming units <b>26</b> can be pulled out integrally with each other, in which case the image forming unit <b>62</b> will be parted from the image forming units <b>26</b> and replaced or the latter will be replaced after the former has been parted therefrom. This alternative arrangement makes the moving mechanism between the image transferring unit <b>62</b> and the image forming units <b>26</b> unnecessary, i.e., it suffices to position the image transferring unit <b>62</b> above the image forming units <b>26</b> at a preselected distance. As a result, the structure for mounting the image forming units <b>62</b> and image transferring unit <b>26</b> to the casing <b>2</b> is simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show a fourth embodiment of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention. As shown, the illustrative embodiment is implemented as a monochromatic printer <b>70</b> as distinguished from the tandem color printer described above. As shown, the printer <b>70</b> includes a single photoconductive drum <b>6</b> and an image transfer roller or image transfer member <b>71</b> pressed against the drum <b>6</b>. The drum <b>6</b> and image transfer roller <b>71</b> are supported by a single frame, not shown, together, constituting an image transferring unit <b>72</b>. The drum <b>6</b> is removable from the image transferring unit <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A conveying belt <b>73</b> is positioned between the image transferring unit <b>72</b> and the fixing unit <b>20</b> and conveys the sheet S, carrying a monochromatic toner image thereon, while electrostatically retaining the sheet S on its lower run.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The image transferring unit <b>72</b> is removably mounted to the casing <b>2</b>. The operator can remove the image transferring unit <b>72</b> from the casing <b>2</b> by opening the front cover and pulling out the unit <b>72</b> as in the first and third embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the inside of the printer <b>70</b> with the image transferring unit <b>72</b> mounted thereto while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the inside of the same from which the unit <b>72</b> has been removed. A single image forming unit <b>26</b>, including the charger <b>7</b>, developing unit <b>8</b> and cleaning unit <b>9</b>, is mounted on a developing unit tray as in the first embodiment. The operator may pull out the image forming unit <b>26</b> together with the developing unit tray and then remove the former from the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In operation, a toner image, formed on the drum <b>6</b>, is transferred to the sheet S fed from the sheet cassette <b>16</b> and pressed against the drum <b>6</b> by the image transfer roller <b>71</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the monochromatic printer <b>70</b> described above, it is likely that the quality of the color image, formed on the sheet S by the above procedure, is lowered by various causes including scratches termed on the drum <b>6</b>. Scratches on the drum <b>6</b> are, in many cases, ascribable to the roller <b>71</b>. For example, when impurities, including residual toner and paper dust, adhere to the outer surface of the roller <b>71</b>, they are sometimes directly pressed against the drums <b>6</b> during image formation. As a result, the impurities adhered to the outer surface of the roller <b>71</b> form stripe-like scratches on the drums <b>6</b> stated earlier. Such scratches capture a large amount of toner and appear in an image transferred to the sheet S as black stripes. In such a situation, if only the drum <b>6</b> is replaced, then a new drum <b>6</b> will also suffer from the same scratches in a short period of time, lowering image quality. Therefore, not only the scratched drum <b>6</b> but also the roller <b>71</b>, causative of the scratches, must be replaced. For this reason, in the illustrative embodiment, the image transferring unit <b>72</b> is bodily replaced. To replace the image transferring unit <b>72</b>, the operator opens the front cover <b>2</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and then pulls out the image transferring unit <b>72</b> toward the front in the same manner as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As stated above, when image quality on the sheet S is lowered due to the scratches of the drum <b>6</b>, the operator can replace both of the drum <b>6</b> and roller <b>71</b>, which is quite probably causative of scratches, at the same time. This makes replacing work far easier than when the drum <b>6</b> and roller <b>71</b> are replaced independently of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the other hand, when the degradation of image quality on the sheet S is ascribable to the drum <b>6</b>, e.g., when a film of charge products is formed on the drum <b>6</b>, the operator can remove the image transferring unit <b>72</b> from the casing <b>2</b> and then replace only the drum <b>6</b> while leaving the image transfer roller <b>71</b> in the image transferring unit <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The image transfer roller <b>71</b>, serving as an image transferring member in the illustrative embodiment, may be replaced with a conveying belt and a single image transfer roller contacting the inner surface of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Again, an arrangement may be made such that the image transferring unit <b>72</b> and image forming units <b>26</b> can be pulled out integrally with each other, in which case the image transferring unit <b>72</b> will be parted from the image forming unit <b>26</b> and replaced or the latter will be replaced after the former has been parted therefrom. This alternative arrangement makes the moving mechanism between the image transferring unit <b>72</b> and the image forming units <b>26</b> unnecessary, i.e., it suffices to position the image transferring unit <b>72</b> above the image forming units <b>26</b> at a preselected distance. As a result, the structure for mounting the image forming units <b>26</b> and image transferring unit <b>72</b> to the casing <b>2</b> is simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the illustrative embodiments shown and described, the charger <b>7</b>, which is one of image forming means, does not contact the drum <b>6</b>. Therefore, even when impurities adhere to the charger <b>7</b>, they are preventing from being pressed against the drum <b>6</b> and scratching it. It follows that the charger <b>7</b> can be replaced at different timing from the image transferring unit. This is also true with the developing unit <b>8</b>. Also, even when impurities adhere to the cleaning unit <b>9</b>, which uses a brush contacting the drum <b>6</b>, they are prevented from being pressed against and scratching the drum <b>6</b>. The cleaning unit <b>9</b> can therefore be replaced at different timing from the image transferring unit.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof.</p>
