<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a front fork of a motor cycle or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional forks, as a front fork of a motor cycle or the like, there is a structure in which a vehicle body side tube is slidably inserted into an axle side tube. A hollow pipe is provided in a standing manner in a bottom portion of the axle side tube. An oil chamber provided in an outer side of the hollow pipe is divided into upper and lower sides by a piston provided in a leading end portion of the vehicle body side tube. An oil reservoir chamber communicating with the oil chamber is provided in an inner side of the hollow pipe. A partition wall member for dividing the oil reservoir chamber into upper and lower sides is provided in an upper portion of the hollow pipe. A flow path communicating the upper and lower oil reservoir chambers is formed in the partition wall member. A compression side damping valve is provided in the flow path, and a gas chamber in an upper portion of the oil reservoir chamber is provided in an inner portion of the vehicle body side tube, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-232395 (patent document 1) and Japanese Patent Utility Model Application Laid-open No. 60-157496 (patent document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the front fork described in the patent document 1, the partition wall member is mounted on an upper portion of the hollow pipe, and the partition wall member is held in the upper portion of the hollow pipe by being pressed by a suspension spring installed in the vehicle body side tube.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the front fork described in the patent document 2, the partition wall member (a valve case <b>11</b>) provided in the upper portion of the hollow pipe (a seat pipe <b>4</b>) comprises a main body portion provided with the compression side damping valve. A mounting portion connected to the main body portion, and a small-diameter protruding portion provided in the mounting portion is fitted and fixedly provided in the upper portion of the hollow pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the front fork described in the patent document 1, since the partition wall member is only mounted to the upper portion of the hollow pipe, the oil moving from the oil chamber in an outer side of the hollow pipe to the lower oil reservoir chamber in an inner side of the hollow pipe during a compression stroke leaks into the upper oil reservoir chamber through a contact surface between the partition wall member and the upper portion of the hollow pipe, and further through an annular gap between an outer periphery of the partition wall member and an inner periphery of the vehicle body side tube. Further, the partition wall member is shifted in a diametrical direction in the upper portion of the hollow pipe. The shape of the annular gap between the outer periphery of the partition wall member and the inner periphery of the vehicle body side tube fluctuates, so that a flow path coefficient is changed. Accordingly, a compression side damping force property is not stable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the front fork described in the patent document 2, since a small-diameter protruding portion in the mounting portion constituting the partition wall member is fitted to the inner periphery of the upper portion of the hollow pipe, it is possible to inhibit the partition wall member from being shifted in a diametrical direction, which is preferable. However, for this structure, a number of parts in the partition wall member, working man-hours and assembling man-hours are increased and cost is increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to achieve a stable compression side damping force property on the basis of a simple structure in a front fork of a motor vehicle or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a front fork of a motor cycle or the like. A vehicle body side tube is slidably inserted into an axle side tube. A hollow pipe is provided in a standing manner in a bottom portion of the axle side tube. An oil chamber provided is in an outer side of the hollow pipe being vertically divided into upper and lower sides by a piston arranged in a leading end portion of the vehicle body side tube. An oil reservoir chamber communicates with said oil chamber being provided in an inner side of the hollow pipe. A partition member dividing said oil reservoir chamber into upper and lower sides rests on an upper portion of the hollow pipe. A flow path communicates the upper and lower oil reservoir chambers being formed in said partition wall member. A compression side damping valve is provided in said flow path. A gas chamber in an upper portion of said oil reservoir chamber is provided in an inner portion of the vehicle body side tube. A seal member slidably contacted with an inner periphery of the vehicle body side tube is provided in an outer periphery of said partition wall member.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accordingly, the front fork <b>10</b> is provided with a partition wall member <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>) constituting a compression side valve unit <b>50</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in an upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>. The partition wall member <b>50</b> is mounted to an upper end surface of the expanded portion <b>31</b> in the hollow pipe <b>22</b>, and is held while being pinched with respect to the upper end surface of the expanded portion <b>31</b> by the suspension spring <b>26</b> mentioned above. The partition wall member <b>50</b> sections the oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b> mentioned above into upper and lower sides. A valve guide <b>52</b> is provided having a center hole <b>52</b>A communicating an upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A with a lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B so as to be fixed to an inserting and attaching hole <b>50</b>B. The partition wall member <b>50</b> is provided with an expansion and compression common flow passage <b>54</b> communicating the upper and lower oil reservoir chambers <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B in a periphery of the center hole <b>52</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The expansion and compression common flow passage <b>54</b> formed in the partition wall member <b>50</b> is provided with an annular deflection valve <b>60</b> corresponding to a compression side damper valve, when being supported in an inner periphery, and an annular check valve <b>70</b> when supported in an outer periphery. An outer periphery of the deflection valve <b>60</b> and an inner periphery of the check valve <b>70</b> are partially overlapped so as to position the deflection valve <b>60</b> in a side of the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The deflection valve <b>60</b> corresponding to a laminated body of a plurality of sheet valves is mounted on an upper end surface of a deflection valve front surface side supporting portion <b>55</b> around the inserting and attaching hole <b>50</b>B of the valve guide <b>52</b> in the partition wall member <b>50</b> via a thin shim <b>62</b> (not shown) having an outer diameter larger than an inner peripheral diameter of the expansion and compression common flow passage <b>54</b>. A first spring <b>64</b> is provided in a back surface of the deflection valve <b>60</b>, in a side of the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A, via a spring receiver <b>63</b> having a diameter smaller than the deflection valve <b>60</b>. In this case, the first spring <b>64</b> is supported by a back surface to a spring receiver <b>65</b> fixed to an upper end portion of the valve guide <b>52</b> in accordance with a caulking process. An inner periphery of the deflection valve <b>60</b> is provided in an outer periphery of the valve guide <b>52</b> in such a manner as to freely move in an axial direction. The first spring <b>64</b> holds the inner peripheral portion of the deflection valve <b>60</b> with respect to the partition wall member <b>50</b> so as to support in a back surface. The deflection valve <b>60</b> is opened when the working fluid in the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B reaches a fixed flow speed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A guide hole <b>56</b> which can receive the check valve <b>70</b> is provided in an upper end portion in an outer peripheral side of the expansion and compression common flow passage <b>54</b> in the partition wall member <b>50</b>. An outer periphery of the check valve <b>70</b> is slidably fitted to the guide hole <b>56</b> so as to freely slide in an axial direction. A valve stopper <b>71</b> is fixed to an opening portion of the guide hole <b>56</b>. A second spring <b>72</b> is provided on a back surface of the check valve <b>70</b>, in a side of the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B. The second spring <b>72</b> is received in the interior of the guide hole <b>56</b> of the partition wall member <b>50</b>, and holds an outer peripheral portion of the check valve <b>70</b> with respect to the valve stopper <b>71</b> so as to support a back surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A small gap <b>80</b> is provided in the overlapping portion between the deflection valve <b>60</b> and the check valve <b>70</b>. In accordance with the present embodiment, the small gap <b>80</b> is provided owing to an existence of the shim <b>62</b> mentioned above. The size of the small gap <b>80</b> can be changed by adjusting a thickness of the shim <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, an annular groove <b>57</b> is provided in an outer periphery of the partition wall member <b>50</b>, and a seal member <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) is fitted to the annular groove <b>57</b>. The seal member <b>58</b> comprises a C-shaped piston ring having a skewed slit at one position in a peripheral direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, and is slidably contacted with an inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b>. At this time, an upper end surface of the expanded portion <b>31</b> of the hollow pipe <b>22</b> and a lower end surface of the partition wall member <b>50</b> which are in contact with each other both form a flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The seal member <b>58</b> of the partition wall member <b>50</b> is assembled and held in a state of being press inserted to the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b> with a fixed fastening margin. The partition wall member <b>50</b> is prevented from being pushed up from the expanded portion <b>31</b> of the hollow pipe <b>22</b> so as to be offset therefrom, when the pressure of the upper oil chamber <b>27</b>A in the outer side of the hollow pipe <b>22</b> ascends during the expansion stroke in the manner mentioned below. In other words, the fastening margin of the seal member <b>58</b> is set such that the sum of the spring force of the suspension spring <b>26</b> and the friction force of the seal member <b>58</b> with respect to the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b> is more than the pushing up force obtained by the maximum hydraulic pressure of the upper oil chamber <b>27</b>A during the expansion stroke applied to the pressure receiving surface of the seal member <b>58</b> through the annular gap between the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b> and the outer periphery of the expanded portion <b>31</b> of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the front fork <b>10</b>, an impact applied to the vehicle is absorbed and reduced by the suspension spring <b>26</b> and the air spring in the gas chamber <b>29</b>. A vibration of the suspension spring <b>26</b> generated by absorbing the impact is controlled by the following damping effect.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Compression Stroke</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a compression stroke of the front fork <b>10</b>, the inner tube <b>12</b> descends from an expanded state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so as to increase pressure in the lower oil chamber <b>27</b>B. The check valve <b>46</b> of the piston <b>41</b> moves in an upper direction so as to be opened, whereby the oil in the lower oil chamber <b>27</b>B is replaced by oil from the upper oil chamber <b>27</b>A. The oil, in an amount determined by multiplying cross sectional area of the inner tube <b>12</b> by a stroke, moves from the lower oil chamber <b>27</b>B to the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B through the through hole <b>34</b>. When the oil moving to the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B moves to the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A, a damping force is generated based on the center hole <b>52</b>A of the partition wall member <b>50</b>, the small gap <b>80</b> between the deflection valve <b>60</b> of the expansion and compression common flow passage <b>54</b> and the check valve <b>70</b>, and the deflection of the deflection valve <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other words, when the piston speed of the front fork <b>10</b> is low, a damping force is generated caused by a passage resistance of the center hole <b>52</b>A and the small gap <b>80</b> when the oil in the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B moves to the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A via the center hole <b>52</b>A of the partition wall member <b>50</b>, and the small gap <b>80</b> of the expansion and compression flow passage <b>54</b>. The magnitude of the damping force can be changed based on a diameter of the center hole <b>52</b>A and the size of the small gap <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the piston speed of the front fork <b>10</b> is moderate, the deflection valve <b>60</b> is opened in accordance with a deflecting deformation based on a deflection property. A damping force is generated caused by the passage resistance of the oil which moves from the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B to the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A through the opening flow passage of the deflection valve <b>60</b>. The magnitude of the damping force can be changed in accordance with a thickness and a diameter of the deflection valve <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the piston speed of the front fork <b>10</b> is high, the deflection valve <b>60</b> is slid in accordance with the deflection of the first spring <b>64</b> supporting the deflection valve <b>60</b> in the back surface so as to open to a relatively large extent. The passage resistance applied to the oil which moves from the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B to the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A is reduced. The magnitude of the damping force can be changed based on the spring constant and the set load of the first spring <b>64</b>. Accordingly, the front fork <b>10</b> undergoes a large stroke, and a vibration absorbing property is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Expansion Stroke In an expansion stroke of the front fork <b>10</b>, the inner tube <b>12</b> ascends from a compressed state so as to increase pressure in the upper oil chamber <b>27</b>A. A damping force is generated caused by a passage resistance generated in the annular gap <b>48</b> when the oil I the upper oil chamber <b>27</b>A moves from the annular gap <b>48</b> of the check valve <b>46</b> seated on the upper taper portion <b>45</b>A of the piston <b>41</b> to the lower oil chamber <b>27</b>B and a passage resistance generated in the orifice <b>35</b> when the oil in the upper oil chamber <b>27</b>A comes out of the orifice <b>35</b> in the hollow pipe <b>22</b> and moves to the lower oil chamber <b>27</b>B via the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B and the through hole <b>34</b> of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this expansion stroke, oil in an amount determined by multiplying cross sectional areas of the inner tube <b>12</b> by the stroke is resupplied from the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A to the lower oil chamber <b>27</b>B via the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B. At this time, the oil in the upper oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>A passes through the center hole <b>52</b>A of the partition wall member <b>50</b>, and moves to the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B while opening the check valve <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with the present embodiment, the following operations and effects can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">(a) The seal member <b>58</b> provided in the outer periphery of the partition wall member <b>50</b> prevents oil from leaking from the lower oil reservoir chamber <b>28</b>B in the inner side of the hollow pipe <b>22</b> through the contact surface between the partition wall member <b>50</b> and the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>, and further the annular gap between the outer periphery of the partition wall member <b>50</b> and the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b>. As a result, loss of working oil caused by the generation of the compression side damping force is reduced, and the compression side damping force property is stable.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(b) The seal member <b>58</b> provided in the outer periphery of the partition wall member <b>50</b> is brought into contact with the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b>, and inhibits the partition wall member <b>50</b> from being displaced in the diametrical direction. As a result, it is possible to prevent the shape of the annular gap between the outer periphery of the partition wall member <b>50</b> and the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b> from fluctuating due to displacement of the partition wall member <b>50</b> in the diametrical direction in the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>. The compression side damping force property is resulting stable.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(c) It is not necessary that the seal member is provided in the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(d) Since the seal member <b>58</b> provided in the outer periphery of the partition wall member <b>50</b> inhibits the partition wall member <b>50</b> from being displaced in the diametrical direction, it is not necessary that the positioning protruding portion is provided in the end surface of the partition wall member <b>50</b> which is in contact with the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>. It is possible to form the end surface of the partition wall member <b>50</b> in a flat surface. It is possible to make the working shape of the partition wall member <b>50</b> simple. It is also possible to reduce the working cost.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An embodiment 2 is substantially different from the embodiment 1 in that an annular groove <b>31</b>A is provided in an outer periphery of the expanded portion <b>31</b> in the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b>.

The seal member <b>32</b> provided in the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b> block off the increased pressure oil being applied to the side of the partition wall member <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the partition wall member <b>50</b> can be stably arranged in the upper portion of the hollow pipe <b>22</b> without setting the fastening margin of the seal member <b>58</b> provided in the partition wall member <b>50</b> with respect to the inner periphery of the inner tube <b>12</b> too tight.
