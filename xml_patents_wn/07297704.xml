<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to cycloalkylfused indole, benzothiophene, benzofuran, and indene derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods for their use as, for example, serotonin modulators.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Major depressive disorder affects an estimated 340 million people worldwide. Depression is the most frequently diagnosed psychiatric disorder, and according to the World Health Organization, it is the fourth greatest public health problem. If left untreated, the effects of depression can be devastating, robbing people of the energy or motivation to perform everyday activities and, in some cases, leading to suicide. Symptoms of the disorder include feelings of sadness or emptiness, lack of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt. In addition to the personal costs of depression, the disorder also results in more than $40 billion in annual costs in the United States alone, due to premature death, lost productivity, and absenteeism.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have had significant success in treating depression and related illnesses and have become among the most prescribed drugs since the 1980's. Some of the most widely known are fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and citalopram. Although they have a favorable side effect profile compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), they have their own particular set of side effects from the non-selective stimulation of serotonergic sites. They have a slow onset of action, often taking several weeks to produce their full therapeutic effect. Furthermore, they are effective in less than two-thirds of patients.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">SSRIs work by blocking the neuronal reuptake of serotonin, which tends to increase the concentration of serotonin in the synaptic space, and thus increase the activation of postsynaptic serotonin receptors. Although a single dose of a SSRI can inhibit the neuronal serotonin transporter and thus would be expected to increase synaptic serotonin, clinical improvement is achieved only after long-term treatment. It has been suggested that the delay in onset of antidepressant action of the SSRIs is the result of an increase in serotonin levels in the vicinity of the serotonergic cell bodies. This excess serotonin activates somatodendritic autoreceptors, 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors, which reduces cell firing activity and, in turn, causes a decrease in serotonin release in major forebrain areas. This negative feedback limits the increment of synaptic serotonin that can be induced by antidepressants acutely. Over time, the somatodendritic autoreceptors become desensitized allowing the full effect of the SSRIs to be expressed in the forebrain. This time period corresponds to the latency for the onset of antidepressant activity [Perez, V., et al., <i>The Lancet, </i>349:1594-1597 (1997)].</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast to the SSRIs, a 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>agonist or partial agonist acts directly on postsynaptic serotonin receptors to increase serotonergic neurotransmission during the latency period for the SSRI effect. Accordingly, the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>partial agonists buspirone and gepirone [Feiger, A., <i>Psychopharmacol. Bull., </i>32 (4), 659-665 (1996), Wilcox, C., <i>Psychopharmacol. Bull, </i>32 (93), 335-342 (1996)] and the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>agonist flesinoxan [Grof, P., <i>International Clinical Psychopharmacology, </i>8 (3), 167-172 (1993)] have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of depression. Furthermore, such agents would also stimulate the somatodendritic autoreceptors, thus hastening their desensitization and decreasing the SSRI latency period. An agent with a dual mechanism of antidepressant action, i.e. increases serotonin levels by blocking neuronal reuptake of serotonin and desensitizes somaticdendritic autoreceptors, would be expected to have greater efficacy and thus reduce the number of patients refractory to treatment. Indeed, buspirone augmentation to standard SSRI therapy has been shown to produce marked clinical improvement in patients initially unresponsive to standard antidepressant therapy [Dimitriou, E., <i>J. Clinical Psychopharmacol., </i>18(6), 465-469 (1998)].</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Lacking from the current therapy regime, however, is a single compound that effectively displays the dual mechanism of antidepressant action, i.e., one that not only inhibits or blocks serotonin reuptake (and thereby increases the levels of serotonin in the synapse), but also antagonizes the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors (and thereby reduces the latency period). The present invention is directed to these, as well as other, important ends.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0235">Compounds of the invention can alternatively be prepared according to Scheme 6. Intermediate 6/16 can be prepared by at least two procedures, as illustrated below. That intermediate is then reacted with a base, such as KOH, in the presence of a solvent, such as EtOH.

<p id="p-0084" num="0237">Alternatively, compounds of formula I can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 7. Briefly, intermediate 1 in cold anhydrous pyridine was combined with para-toluenesulfonyl chloride in a solvent, such as cold pyridine to form intermediate 2. Intermediate 3 was prepared by treating intermediate 2 with sodium cyanide. To a solution of intermediate 3 in an organic solvent, such as ethanol, was added conc. aqueous ammonia in the presence of a catalyst, such as 5% rhodium on alumina catalyst. This mixture was hydrogenated overnight to yield intermediate 4.

<p id="p-0086" num="0239">Scheme 8 illustrates an alternative synthetic route for preparing compounds of formula I. For example, compound 14 was prepared by a modification of published procedures. (See M. S. Berridge et al., Nucl. Med. Biol. 19 (5) 563-569 (1992); Brueckner R. et al., EP 1 424 337 A1 (2004)). (Compound 22 can be prepared similarly, by generally following a published protocol by Brueckner, R., et al., EP Patent No. 1 424 337 A1). First, cyclohexane-1,3-dione was reacted with an appropriately substituted phenylhydrazine to provide intermediate 9.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0240">Intermediate 10 was then prepared by generally following a published protocol (See R. F. Borch et al., J. Org. Chem. 38 (15), 2729 (1973); Nader G. et al., French Patent 2729141 (1996)) by heating a mixture of intermediate 9, diethylene glycol and para-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate in an aprotic solvent such as toluene. Deprotection of the ethylene ketal 10 by treatment with 10% aqueous sulfuric acid in a solvent such as methanol, provided the intermediate ketone 11. Intermediate 11 was in turn, converted to the corresponding oxime 12. The crude intermediate 12 underwent reduction to the desired amine 13 with Al—Ni alloy in ethanol and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Condensation of intermediate 13 with [{2R)-8-methyl-2,3-dihydro[1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinolin-2-yl]methyl 4-bromobenzenesulfonate (synthesized according to a procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,693,197B1) in a solvent such as acetonitrile and in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate provided compound 14 as the free base. The latter was converted then to compound 14 as the dihydrochloride salt (mixture of diastereomers).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0241">Compounds 15 and 16 were then prepared from compound 14 by chromatographic separation. The mixture of diastereomers 14 was separated by chromatography. The fractions corresponding to peak 1 provided the compound 15 as free base. The other diastereoisomer isolated using the same method (corresponding to peak 2) was compound 16 (free base). The free base was then converted to the dihydrochloride salt.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0243">Scheme 9 illustrates another useful for the preparation of compounds of formula I. Briefly, a condensation reaction between aldehyde 1, methyl nitroacetate 2, and diethylamine hydrochloride, in refluxing toluene, can give the corresponding nitrocoumarin 3. [Dauzonne, D., and Royer, R., <i>Synthesis, </i>836-37 (1983)]. Nitrocoumarin 3 can then treated with a diene, which should yield Diels-Alder product 4, which, after treatment with CTABr and NaOH, followed by treatment with 3.75 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, can afford benzofuran compound 5. [Amantini, D., et al., <i>J. Org. Chem., </i>68:9263-68 (2003)]. Benzofuran compound 5 can then be converted to compound 6 using known chemistry, and then coupled with the broyslate 7 to afford the desired compound 8 as a mixture of diastereomers.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0245">Preferred compounds of this invention can alternatively be synthesized as illustrated in Scheme 10. First, condensation of cyclohexanone 4-ethylcarboxylate with fluorophenylhydrazine is performed by refluxing the two compounds in ethanol. Second, hydrolysis of the ester to the acid is performed using a base, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or anhydrous potassium hydroxide, in ethanol. The resulting ethanol solution is treated with 1N aqueous HCl, the ethanol evaporated, and the acid (e.g., 6-fluoro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-3-carboxylic acid) crystallizes out upon concentration. A 0.1M solution of this racemic acid is then made and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with an optically active base, such as (−)-cinchonidine in acetonitrile. This mixture is left in an open vial for 48 hours. Crystals form slowly.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0246">The mother liquid from the optically active base salt containing the S-enantiomer is mixed in a 4:1 ratio with the R-enantiomer in the presence of second optically active base, such as (+)-pseudoephedrine. Crystals again form slowly. Chiral HPLC shows substantial purity of the S-enantiomer.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0247">Next, the S-enantiomer acid is converted to an amide. First, the acid is converted to the acid chloride using oxalyl chloride at room temperature. The solvent is evaporated at low temperature and low pressure. Ammonolysis of the acid chloride is then accomplished using aqueous ammonia or dioxane. The amide is recovered as a crystal from the acetone/water mixture. The aqueous ammonia produces an exotherm, and should be maintained at 5-10° C., to avoid excessive hydrolysis. For this purpose, the acid chloride is sufficiently diluted with acetone, and the mixture cooled down to 0-5° C. before the fast addition of aqueous ammonia. The amide is then reduced to the amine, in THF with lithium aluminum hydride at reflux. The reaction is quenched at the cold with the saturated aqueous solution of the Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate). The amide is then condensed with the brosylate, dimethylaminopyridine, and excess amine in DMSO. The reaction mixture is quenched with aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and the product extracted with methylene chloride.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0249">Scheme 11 illustrates a procedure amenable to large-scale production of compounds of formula I. The route improves yields and eases operation by concatenation of steps, allows for the resolution of racemic indole acid 3 using a single chiral base (e.g., cinchonidine), and allows for the purification of compounds of formula I via crystalline salt (e.g., maleate salt) formation.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0250">The first step is a Fisher indole reaction of the ketoester 1 with hydrazine HCl followed by hydrolysis of the resulting ester to the racemic indole acid 3 in 97% yield. The chiral resolution of indole acid 3 is accomplished using cinchonidine in isopropanol followed by liberation of the eutomer salt to the desired free indole acid 4. This process gives &gt;97% enantiomeric excess of resolved indole acid in 60% overall yield based on the eutomer. Indole acid 4 is converted to the acid chloride in Step 3 and subsequently treated with aqueous ammonium hydroxide to provide amide 5 in 95% yield. Indole amide 5 is reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in THF in 80% yield to provide amine 6. In Step 5, the amine 6 is coupled with quinaldine brosylate 7 (synthesized according to a procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,693,197B1). The resultant compound is isolated as the maleic acid salt 8. Finally, the maleic acid salt 8 is liberated, followed by recrystallization of compound 9 in 75% yield.</p>

Compounds were initially tested in a single point assay to determine percent inhibition at 1, 0.1, and 0.01 mM. Subsequently, Ki values were determined for compounds defined to be active. Percent inhibition Ki was determined by RFComp (Lundon Software), with Serotonin 8-OH-DPAT as the reference compounds. Results are presented below in Table 1.</p>

<heading id="h-0287" level="1"><sup>3</sup>H-Paroxetine Binding to Assess Affinity of Drugs for the Serotonin Transporter</heading>
<p id="p-0307" num="0460">A protocol similar to that used by Cheetham et al. (Neuropharmacol. 32:737, 1993) was used to determine the affinity of compounds for the serotonin transporter. Briefly, frontal cortical membranes prepared from male S.D. rats were incubated with <sup>3</sup>H-paroxetine (0.1 nM) for 60 min at 25° C. All tubes also contained either vehicle, test compound (one to eight concentrations), or a saturating concentration of fluoxetine (10 μM) to define specific binding. All reactions are terminated by the addition of ice cold Tris buffer followed by rapid filtration using a Tom Tech filtration device to separate bound from free <sup>3</sup>H-paroxetine. Bound radioactivity was quantitated using a Wallac 1205 Beta Plate® counter. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine IC<sub>50 </sub>values which were converted to Ki values using the method of Cheng and Prusoff (Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099, 1973); Ki=IC<sub>50</sub>/((Radioligand conc.)/(1+KD)). Results are presented below in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0308" num="0461">Stably transfected CHO cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% heat inactivated FBS and non-essential amino acids. The cells were plated at a density of 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per well in a 96 well plate and incubated for 2 days in a CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. On the second day, the media was replaced with 0.1 ml Krebs and incubated 15 minutes at 37° C. The media was then replaced with Krebs buffer containing 500 uM IBMX and incubated 5 minutes at 37° C. Wells were treated with forskolin (1 uM final conc) followed immediately by test compound (0.1 and 1 uM for initial screen) and incubated for an additional 10 min at 37° C. Reaction was terminated by removal of the media and addition of 0.5 ml ice cold assay buffer (supplied in RIA kit). Plates are stored at −20° C. prior to assessment of cAMP formation by RIA. Compounds shown to have no agonist activities were further analyzed for ability to reverse agonist activity. In separate experiments, 6 concentrations of antagonist were preincubated for 20 min prior to the addition of agonist and forskolin. Cells were harvested as described. The cAMP kit is supplied by Amersham and the RIA is performed as per kit instructions. In the initial screen, percent inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP was measured. In the secondary screen, IC<sub>50 </sub>of reversal of agonist activity was measured. Calculations of IC<sub>50 </sub>were performed by GraphPad Prism. Serotonin, BMY 7378, Buspirone, and 8-OH-DPAT were used as reference compounds. Results are presented below in Table 1.</p>

<heading id="h-0291" level="1">GTPγS Binding Assay</heading>
<p id="p-0309" num="0462">The <sup>35</sup>S-GTPγS binding assay similar to that used by Lazareno and Birdsall (<i>Br. J. Pharmacol., </i>1993, 109: 1120) was used to determine the test compound's ability to affect the binding of <sup>35</sup>S-GTPγS to membranes containing cloned human 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors. Agonists produce an increase in binding whereas antagonists produce no increase but rather reverse the effects of the standard agonist 8-OH-DPAT. The test compound's maximum stimulatory effect is represented as the E<sub>max</sub>, while its potency is defined by the EC<sub>50</sub>. The test compound's maximum inhibitory effect is represented as the I<sub>max</sub>, while its potency is defined by the IC<sub>50</sub>. [<sup>3</sup>H]-8-OH-DPAT was used to determine maximum agonist or antagonist response. Results are presented below in Table 1.</p>
