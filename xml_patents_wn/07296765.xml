<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Automatic dispensers for dispensing products such as towel, tissue, wipes, sheet-form materials, soap, shaving cream, fragrances and personal care products. A dispenser includes a housing, an electrical power source, a user input device, a dispensing mechanism, and motor control apparatus. The user input device generates a signal responsive to a user request for product. Motor control apparatus de-powers the dispensing mechanism based on a determination of dispenser conditions representing discharge of the product.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, that figure is a schematic of the power supply apparatus <b>47</b> for powering the dispenser <b>10</b> and dispenser components shown in the block diagram <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Four 1.5V “D” cell batteries (two of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref> as batteries <b>271</b>, <b>273</b>) are connected in series at connector P<b>1</b>. The batteries, the power source for dispenser <b>10</b>, provides power characterized by voltage and current.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Regulated power supply apparatus <b>47</b> receives the 6V electrical power from the batteries at connector P<b>1</b> and converts the voltage to 3.3V DC of regulated power output which is supplied to the remaining circuitry (except for the motor drive circuit) at the point represented by reference number <b>575</b>. Regulated power supply apparatus <b>47</b> is actually connected to the points labeled 3.3V throughout <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B-16C</figref>.

The batteries can be replaced by another source of DC power such as a transformer and AC-to-DC conversion circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16B</figref>, free running oscillator <b>501</b> has a frequency which depends on the electrical capacitance of sensor <b>337</b>. The capacitance of sensor <b>337</b> is changed by the presence of a user's hand in proximity to sensor <b>337</b>. Oscillator <b>501</b> generates an oscillating voltage signal at point <b>551</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. The oscillating voltage at point <b>551</b> is at a nominal frequency of approximately 6.1 MHZ when a user is not in proximity of sensor <b>337</b>. This is referred to as the idle state.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16B</figref>, the oscillating voltage signal output of oscillator <b>501</b> is passed through the frequency divider <b>503</b>. Frequency divider <b>503</b> includes a ripple counter <b>509</b> and is configured to divide the oscillating voltage at point <b>551</b> by 4096. This generates a logical-level square wave divider output signal at point <b>577</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B and 16C</figref> with a nominal frequency of about 1.5 kHz. Ripple counter <b>509</b> is preferably a Model 74VHC4040 12-stage binary counter available from Fairchild Semiconductor of South Portland, Me. The frequency of divider output signal at point <b>577</b> is changed by the presence of a user's hand in proximity to sensor <b>337</b>, referred to as the detection state. In general, the presence of a user's hand lowers the frequency of oscillator <b>501</b> and therefore the frequency of the divider output signal at point <b>577</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b>C and <b>17</b>, the divider output signal at point <b>577</b> is an input to micro-controller <b>511</b> pin <b>14</b>. A portion of the firmware instructions which are contained within micro-controller <b>511</b> serve as detector logic <b>601</b> to generate a detector flag <b>603</b> to indicate the presence of a user's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A further input to micro-controller <b>511</b> is provided by a sheet material length selecting circuit <b>517</b> which includes connector P<b>3</b> used to receive jumpers (not shown).

Pin <b>4</b> of P<b>3</b> is held “high” by pin <b>19</b> of micro-controller <b>511</b>. When a jumper is used to connect either pin <b>2</b> or pin <b>6</b> to pin <b>4</b> of connector P<b>3</b>, micro-controller <b>511</b> interprets these jumper settings as 10-inch and 14-inch towel lengths respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref> is a schematic of the portion of control apparatus <b>50</b> circuitry connected to the outputs of micro-controller <b>511</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The logic of control apparatus <b>50</b> will be now be described with reference to the flow diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19F</figref>. Such logic is in the form of the set of instructions residing in the memory of micro-controller <b>511</b>. The logical steps which result in detection of a user represent detector logic <b>601</b>, will first be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. Thereafter, the remaining logical steps for operation of dispenser <b>10</b> will be explained in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, detector logic <b>601</b> operates as follows: Divider output signal <b>577</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b>B and <b>16</b>C) delivered to micro-controller <b>511</b> from proximity detector <b>49</b>. Logic module <b>605</b> of instructions residing in memory of micro-controller <b>511</b> converts output signal <b>577</b> to a stream of detector counts represented by symbol Y<sub>d</sub>. Each count has a value which is equal to the number of micro-controller clock cycles (at a clock frequency f<sub>c</sub>) in a fixed number N<sub>d </sub>of cycles of divider output signal <b>577</b> (with a frequency f<sub>d</sub>). The stream of detector counts Y<sub>d </sub>is a sequential series of numbers each of which is determined by the following relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Y</i><sub>d</sub><i>=N</i><sub>d</sub><i>·f</i><sub>c</sub><i>/f</i><sub>d</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The symbol Y<sub>d </sub>is used to represent both the stream of count values as well as each individual count in the stream. Stream of detector counts Y<sub>d </sub>is also later referred to as the output signal.
</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, if the frequency f<sub>d </sub>of divider output signal <b>577</b> is 1.5 kHz, with a clock frequency f<sub>c </sub>of 1 MHz and a value of N<sub>d </sub>of 135, the value of a detector count Y<sub>d</sub>=135·1,000,000/1,500=90,000. The stream of values Y<sub>d </sub>has a new value every N<sub>d</sub>/f<sub>d </sub>seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Stream of detector counts Y<sub>d </sub>is input to two digital low-pass filters, a detector low-pass filter <b>607</b> and a baseline low-pass filter <b>609</b>. Each digital low pass filter <b>607</b>, <b>609</b> is in the form of firmware residing in micro-controller <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Each of low-pass filters <b>607</b>, <b>609</b> operates as follows: During start-up, the initial low-pass filter output value is set as the initial input value of stream of detector counts Y<sub>d</sub>. In the embodiment described, the symbol F generally represents the low-pass filter output value and the symbol F<sub>i </sub>represents the value of F during any cycle “i” and F<sub>i+1 </sub>is the value of F during the following cycle. Thereafter, for each new value of Y<sub>d</sub>, low-pass filter output value F is a stream of values determined as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i><sub>i+1</sub><i>=W·Y</i><sub>d</sub>+(1<i>−W</i>)·<i>F</i><sub>i</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where the symbol W is the weight of the filter. A typical value for W for the detector low-pass filter is W<sub>d</sub>=½, and a typical value for W for the baseline low-pass filter is W<sub>b1</sub>= 1/64. Thus, the two low-pass filters operate as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Detector low-pass filter <b>607</b>: <i>DF</i><sub>i+1</sub>=½<i>·Y</i><sub>d</sub>+½·<i>DF</i><sub>i</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Baseline low-pass filter <b>609</b>: <i>BLF</i><sub>i+1</sub>= 1/64<i>·Y</i><sub>d</sub>+ 63/64·<i>BLF</i><sub>i</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The values of the outputs of the low-pass filters DF and BLF are similar to the stream of detector counts Y<sub>d</sub>; that is, they are a sequential series of values, such values being in the numerical range of stream of detector counts Y<sub>d</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Digital low-pass filters <b>607</b>, <b>609</b> each have time constants which are equal to 1/W cycles, expressed as time constant τ=(1/W)·N<sub>d</sub>/f<sub>d </sub>seconds. That is, the time constant τ<sub>b1f </sub>of baseline low-pass filter <b>609</b> with a weight W<sub>b1</sub>= 1/64 is 64 cycles or 64·135/1,500 seconds or about 5.76 seconds. Similarly, detector low-pass filter <b>607</b> with a weight W<sub>d</sub>=½ has a time constant τ<sub>df </sub>of about 0.18 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, detector flag <b>603</b> is set to indicate a valid occurrence of the presence of a user's hand. A valid occurrence is defined as a variation in the value of stream Y<sub>d </sub>which is large enough and of long enough duration to be construed as an actual request for a towel to be dispensed. Detector flag <b>603</b> is set when output DF of detector low-pass filter <b>607</b> and output BLF of baseline low-pass filter <b>609</b> differ by more than a preset threshold number of counts T; a typical value for T is 100. This differencing step is shown at the summing junction of step <b>611</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the output of which, as indicated, is DF-BLF. The comparison with threshold T is performed on the difference DF-BLF at step <b>613</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">This combination of detector and baseline digital low-pass filters <b>607</b> and <b>609</b> respectively serves as a “persistence filter” <b>620</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. The difference DF-BLF is shown as difference output <b>619</b>, also a stream of values similar to Y<sub>d</sub>. The decision of step <b>613</b> is YES if DF-BLF (difference output <b>619</b>) is greater than threshold T and NO if DF minus BLF is less than or equal to T. (Throughout the logical block diagrams shown herein, elements nnn of the block diagrams represent reference numbers of YES/NO decisions and are shown as having YES decisions nnnY and NO decisions nnnN.) YES decision <b>613</b>Y triggers detector flag <b>603</b> to be set in step <b>615</b>. NO decision <b>613</b>N triggers detector flag <b>603</b> to be cleared in step <b>617</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">This combination of detector and baseline digital low-pass filters <b>607</b> and <b>609</b> respectively (persistence filter <b>620</b>) has the following behavior: (1) Persistence filter <b>620</b> ignores very brief changes in stream Y<sub>d </sub>such that changes which are too brief are not considered to be valid towel dispense requests and (2) persistence filter <b>620</b> ignores extremely slow changes in stream Y<sub>d </sub>so that filter <b>620</b> adapts to variations in the environment in which sensor <b>337</b> resides, allowing proximity detector <b>49</b> to operate properly even with large shifts in the nominal capacitance of sensor <b>337</b> due to changes in, for example, the humidity of the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a representation of the approximate response of persistence filter <b>620</b> to an instantaneous change in stream Y<sub>d</sub>. The curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is an example of difference output <b>619</b>. The horizontal dotted line along the middle of the graph represents threshold level T. Region <b>621</b> (i.e., the bold portion of the curve) of difference output <b>619</b> represents those values of difference output <b>619</b> which are above threshold T; such values indicate points in time at which divider output signal <b>577</b> is interpreted as detecting the presence of a user's hand resulting in setting of detector flag <b>603</b>. In the embodiment, there may be a slight lag between the point at which the curve crosses the threshold T and commencement of region <b>621</b>. The slight lag occurs because two computation cycles of persistence filter <b>620</b> occur after the instantaneous change in stream Y<sub>d </sub>and the second cycle does not occur until the beginning of region <b>621</b>. Such lag is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> by the time delay between the point <b>622</b> at which difference output <b>619</b> crosses threshold T and the beginning <b>624</b> of bold portion <b>621</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Soon after a user places a hand in detection zone <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>) of sensor <b>337</b>, detector flag <b>603</b> is set. If the user leaves his or her hand in detection zone <b>400</b> for a longer-than-normal length of time, detector flag <b>603</b> is cleared, thereby filtering out “persistent” requests for towels to be dispensed by the user simply holding his or her hand in detection zone <b>400</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an embodiment, the firmware logic illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19F</figref> is organized such that control apparatus <b>50</b> is in one of four states during operation, and these states are used to determine which portion of the firmware instructions are executed as the operation of micro-controller <b>511</b> proceeds through execution of main loop <b>627</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, after initialization <b>625</b> is completed, the controller state is set to “Power-up” state <b>637</b> (step <b>626</b>), the purpose of which is to provide a delay for circuitry other than micro-controller <b>511</b> to establish normal operating conditions. The delay is realized through the use of a delay counter which is initialized as part of initialization <b>625</b> to a value corresponding to the number of passes through main loop <b>627</b> equivalent to the selected delay period. The period of delay may be set, for example, to one second; thus, for a main loop interrupt once every 5 milliseconds, the power-up counter would be set to 200 in step <b>625</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, upon entering the “Power-up” state <b>637</b> portion of main loop <b>627</b>, internal LED <b>581</b> is set to blink normally (see below) in step <b>695</b>, a power-up counter is decremented by one (step <b>697</b>), and the power-up counter is checked in decision <b>699</b> to determine whether the counter has been fully decremented. A NO decision <b>699</b>N returns the controller in step <b>639</b> to main loop <b>627</b>, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop <b>627</b>. Upon a YES decision <b>699</b>Y, indicating that the power-up delay has been completed, the controller is set to “Ready” state <b>631</b> and is returned to main loop <b>627</b> by step <b>639</b>. (The power-up counter is not shown since, as with generally all of the elements of the logic, it resides in firmware instructions. “Not shown” will not be indicated in all further such cases herein.)</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A series of optional steps are provided in the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref> to convey information indicating the state of the electrical power source, preferably in the form of one or more batteries. In an embodiment, such battery health information is provided by adjusting the blink rate of external LED <b>583</b>. In an embodiment, three rates are provided, herein indicated as “slow,” “normal,” and “rapid.” These rates are easily distinguishable by an operator, such as “slow”=once every 5 seconds, “normal”=once every 2 seconds, and “rapid”=once every one-half second.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>, a decision <b>641</b> tests if V<sub>s </sub>is less than a low-voltage threshold T<sub>L</sub>. Since micro-controller <b>511</b> is in “Ready” state <b>631</b> and thus drive motor <b>267</b> is not powered, V<sub>s </sub>is essentially a measurement of the unloaded voltage of the power supply. T<sub>L </sub>has a value such as 4.0 volts, a level of voltage indicating that the batteries are at the end of their useful life. If V<sub>s </sub>is below T<sub>L </sub>(YES decision <b>641</b>Y), the external LED <b>583</b> is set to blink at the “slow” blink rate in step <b>643</b>. Micro-controller <b>511</b> is set to be in “Losing-power” state <b>635</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20F</figref>) in step <b>645</b>, and the controller returns to main loop <b>627</b> in step <b>639</b>, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the result of decision <b>641</b> is NO decision <b>641</b>N, a further test of the voltage V<sub>s </sub>is carried out in decision <b>647</b> wherein V<sub>s </sub>is tested against a voltage threshold T<sub>H</sub>, T<sub>H </sub>being higher than T<sub>L</sub>. T<sub>H </sub>is set to a value such as 4.9 volts to indicate a level at which the batteries are near the end of their useful life. A YES decision <b>647</b>Y therefore indicates that V<sub>s </sub>is between T<sub>L </sub>and T<sub>H</sub>, and the micro-controller <b>511</b> then sets the external LED <b>583</b> to blink at the “rapid” blink rate (step <b>651</b>) indicating that the batteries may need to be replaced in the near future. A NO decision <b>647</b>N indicates that the batteries have sufficient life remaining, and the external LED blink is therefore set to the “normal” blink rate in step <b>649</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Blink patterns and rates other than those described above may be employed. For example, LED <b>583</b> may be inactive in response to a NO decision at step <b>647</b>, such inactive state indicating that the batteries are at a proper operating voltage. Indicators other than LED <b>583</b> may be used to provide the optional power source condition indication. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref>, LED <b>583</b> may be replaced with an audible sound emitter such as a magnetic buzzer <b>585</b> available from CUI, Inc., Beaverton, Oreg. as part number CEM-1205C.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In an embodiment, micro-controller <b>511</b> next checks to determine whether an delay period between dispense cycles has been set and is active. Instructions residing in memory of micro-controller <b>511</b> may optionally include a delay feature imposing a delay of a predetermined time duration between dispense cycles to prevent continuous cycling of dispenser <b>10</b>. If provided, such delay is initialized in step <b>683</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref> at the end of a dispense cycle by the setting of a dispense delay counter in the set of instructions on micro-controller <b>511</b>. The time duration of the delay period set in step <b>683</b> may be one second. The delay may be set in a fashion similar to the power-up counter. The dispense delay counter would be set to <b>200</b> in step <b>683</b> for a main loop interrupt once every 5 milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In decision step <b>653</b>, if the dispense delay counter has not reached a value of zero, the result is NO decision <b>653</b>N. During each pass through the “Ready” state portion of main loop <b>627</b> during which NO decision <b>653</b>N is a result, the dispense delay counter is decremented (step <b>655</b>) by one until the dispense delay counter=0. If the dispense delay counter equals zero (YES decision <b>653</b>Y), the controller then checks to see if detector flag <b>603</b> is set (decision <b>657</b>) indicating a valid request by a user for a towel to be dispensed. A NO decision <b>657</b>N is followed by step <b>639</b> which returns the controller to main loop <b>627</b>, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A YES decision <b>657</b>Y in decision step <b>657</b> indicates that detector flag <b>603</b> is set, in which case the state of the controller is set to the “Dispensing” state <b>633</b> in step <b>659</b>. The drive motor <b>267</b> is turned on at step <b>661</b>, and a dispense sum is set in step <b>663</b> to a predetermined initial value which depends on the selected towel length. Micro-controller <b>511</b> is returned to main loop <b>627</b> in step <b>639</b> as described above. The dispense sum will be described in the explanation of “Dispensing” state <b>633</b> which follows.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref> is a block diagram depicting the logic of the instructions executed in main loop <b>627</b> when the controller is in “Dispensing” state <b>633</b>. The general concept for control of “Dispensing” state <b>633</b> is that an estimate of the inductive component of motor <b>267</b> voltage is used to determine a further estimate of drive roller <b>139</b> rotational velocity such that motor <b>267</b> is de-powered to enable the desired length of sheet material to be dispensed. The instructions on micro-controller <b>511</b> compensate for changes in power source <b>49</b> voltage, including fluctuations during dispensing and those which occur during the life cycle of a set of batteries (e.g., batteries such as batteries <b>271</b>, <b>273</b>) used to power dispenser <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A series of further steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref> may be provided to compensate for coasting of the motor <b>267</b> which will occur after the motor <b>267</b> is de-powered. In general, the coasting steps provide mathematical operations resulting in the motor being de-powered slightly sooner if the estimate of motor RPM is above an inertia threshold T<sub>2</sub>. Inertia threshold T<sub>2 </sub>is an experimentally-determined value which correlates with a level of dispensing mechanism inertia useful for controlling the amount of coasting which will occur after motor de-powering. This simple determination with respect to inertia threshold T<sub>2 </sub>provides a crude estimate of inertia or angular momentum. The motor <b>267</b> is de-powered sooner because the inertia in dispensing mechanism <b>43</b> and motor <b>267</b> operating at an RPM level above inertia threshold T<sub>2 </sub>will result in coasting for a greater rotational distance than if the motor RPM is below inertia threshold T<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Within the circuit of <b>16</b>D, power source voltage V<sub>s </sub>is the sum of several individual voltage terms, including the voltage V<sub>R </sub>across the resistive portion of the motor armature impedance, voltage V<sub>ind </sub>across the inductive portion of the motor armature impedance, the voltage V<sub>FET </sub>across the motor drive transistor Q<b>1</b>, and the motor current-sensing voltage V<sub>curr </sub>across the current-sensing resistor R<b>2</b>. This sum is expressed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>s</sub><i>=V</i><sub>R</sub><i>+V</i><sub>ind</sub><i>+V</i><sub>FET</sub><i>+V</i><sub>curr</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
or can be expressed by solving for V<sub>ind</sub>:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>ind</sub><i>=V</i><sub>s</sub><i>−V</i><sub>R</sub><i>−V</i><sub>FET</sub><i>−V</i><sub>curr</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Since V<sub>ind </sub>is approximately proportional to the RPM of the motor, an estimate of V<sub>ind </sub>provides an estimate of motor RPM. The following approximation facilitates this estimation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>R</sub><i>+V</i><sub>FET</sub><i>+V</i><sub>curr</sub>≅3<i>·V</i><sub>curr</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
resulting in the following relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>ind</sub><i>≅V</i><sub>s</sub>−3<i>·V</i><sub>curr</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The estimate of V<sub>ind </sub>is defined as a dispense sum increment Q. As such, dispense sum increment Q is an instantaneous estimate of V<sub>ind</sub>, based on measurements of V<sub>s </sub>and V<sub>curr</sub>. Both V<sub>s </sub>and V<sub>curr </sub>are analog inputs to two analog-to-digital (A/D) lines at pins <b>8</b> and <b>10</b> respectively of micro-controller <b>511</b>. Thus, Q is approximately proportional to motor <b>267</b> RPM, and a sum of a sequence of values for Q is approximately proportional to the length of sheet material dispensed. In the calculation of Q, indicated in step <b>667</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref>, Q is constrained to be non-negative.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref>, upon entering “Dispensing” state <b>633</b>, the external LED <b>583</b> is first set to blink at the normal rate. Next, in step <b>667</b>, the instructions begin the estimating process by determining dispense sum increment Q as described above. In step <b>629</b>, both V<sub>s </sub>and V<sub>curr </sub>are measured by micro-controller <b>511</b> during each pass through main loop <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the embodiment described herein, the summing of dispense sum increments Q is accomplished by decrementing the predetermined initial value until the dispense sum drops below zero, at which point the dispense cycle is ended, thereby consistently controlling the sheet length as desired. For example, a representative target value for a 12-inch length of sheet material in the form of paper towel could be 120,000. A first dispense sum increment Q may be on the order of 100. Subtracting a value Q of 100 from target value 120,000 results in a dispense sum of 119,900. As the dispensing mechanism <b>43</b> accelerates and continues to operate, further sequential subtracting of each newly-determined dispense sum increment Q from the dispense sum results in attaining a zero value, typically in about 0.6 seconds, at which time micro-controller <b>511</b> de-powers motor <b>267</b>. The values of Q resulting from measurements of V<sub>s </sub>and V<sub>curr </sub>fluctuate widely as the motor <b>267</b> RPM changes during a dispense cycle and as the power source voltage changes.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The instructions compensate for fluctuations in power source voltage V<sub>s </sub>to provide consistency in the lengths of sheet material dispensed from dispenser <b>10</b>. For example, battery voltage V<sub>s </sub>will decrease over the life cycle of the batteries. As battery voltage V<sub>s </sub>decreases, motor <b>267</b> is driven at lower RPM and thus the value of each dispense sum increment Q is decreased. As the value of dispense sum increments Q decrease, the number of operations required to reach the target value increases, and a relatively greater time duration is required to complete the calculation to reach the target value, thereby compensating for the voltage decrease by powering the motor <b>267</b> for an increased time duration.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The remaining steps of dispensing state <b>633</b>, including an optional coasting compensation feature, are now described with respect to the remainder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref>. After the calculation of dispense sum increment Q in step <b>667</b>, the dispense sum is tested in decision step <b>669</b> to see if it has been decreased below dispense sum threshold T<sub>1</sub>. If the result is NO decision <b>669</b>N, the dispense sum is decremented by dispense sum increment Q. If the result is YES decision <b>669</b>Y, then dispense sum increment Q is tested in decision step <b>673</b> to see if it is equal to or below inertia threshold T<sub>2</sub>. If the result of this test of Q (step <b>673</b>) is NO decision <b>673</b>N, the dispense sum is decremented by two times the dispense sum increment Q in step <b>675</b>. If the result of this test of Q (step <b>673</b>) is YES decision <b>673</b>Y, the dispense sum is decremented by 0.75 times the dispense sum increment Q in step <b>677</b>. The higher multiplying factor (e.g., 2 versus 0.75) means that motor <b>267</b> will be de-powered sooner since more coasting will occur after motor <b>267</b> is de-powered.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As further explanation, for most of the period of time in which drive motor <b>267</b> is powered (dispensing towel), the dispense sum is reduced by dispense sum increment Q. When the dispense cycle approaches its completion as indicated by dispense sum threshold T<sub>1</sub>, dispense sum increment Q is tested against inertia threshold T<sub>2 </sub>as a quick estimate of the amount of coasting which will occur when drive motor <b>267</b> is turned off in step <b>681</b>. Higher values of Q (above inertia threshold T<sub>2</sub>) trigger a faster decrementing of the dispense sum to turn off the motor a bit sooner than values of Q below inertia threshold T<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Following the decrementing of the dispense sum in steps <b>671</b>, <b>675</b>, or <b>677</b>, the dispense sum is tested to see if it has been lowered below zero (step <b>679</b>). If the result of decision step <b>679</b> is NO decision <b>679</b>N, the controller <b>511</b> proceeds to step <b>639</b> which returns the controller to main loop <b>627</b>, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop <b>627</b> with the dispensing cycle still underway (micro-controller <b>511</b> in “Dispensing” state <b>633</b>). If the result of decision step <b>679</b> is YES decision <b>679</b>Y, drive motor <b>267</b> is turned off in step <b>681</b>, the dispense delay counter is set to its initial value in step <b>683</b>, the controller is set to “Ready” state <b>631</b>, and step <b>639</b> returns the controller to main loop <b>627</b>, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In step <b>669</b>, the dispense sum is calculated by sequentially decrementing the dispense sum increments Q from the current value of the dispense sum. Mathematically, the term “dispense sum” refers to the total accumulation of dispense sum increments Q. The verbs “sum” or “summed” as used herein are defined as the process of mathematically accumulating the increments. The accumulation may consist of either sequential additions or subtractions (as is the case in the embodiment described above). For example, the dispense sum can also be determined by sequentially adding up the individual values of Q to reach a predetermined target value. Naturally, persons of skill in the art will appreciate that the important feature is the size of the accumulated dispense sum and not the specific numerical values associated with the initial and target values</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Irrespective of the form of the operation performed, the target value corresponding to each sheet length is a constant selected such that the accumulation of estimated dispense sum increments Q results in sheets of the proper length being dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The coasting compensation feature described above is preferred but not required. If the optional coasting control is not used, decision step <b>669</b> is eliminated and every cycle through the dispensing state logic flows through step <b>671</b> such that dispense sum increment Q is subtracted from the dispense sum in each cycle through the logic. The dispenser <b>10</b> then proceeds through steps <b>679</b> through <b>685</b> as described above until the motor <b>267</b> is de-powered by the dispense sum reaching a target value in step <b>679</b>. (In this example, the target value for the dispense sum is zero, with the dispense sum being decremented from an initial value representing requested towel length.)</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19F</figref> is a block diagram depicting the logic of the instructions executed in main loop <b>627</b> when the controller is in “Losing-power” state <b>635</b>. Since batteries are able to recover to some degree from low values of voltage V<sub>s</sub>, the unloaded (motor de-powered) voltage of the batteries is tested (step <b>687</b>) during each pass through main loop <b>627</b> while micro-controller <b>511</b> is in “Losing-power” state <b>635</b> to see if V<sub>s </sub>has risen above T<sub>H</sub>, indicating that there is still useful life in the batteries. A NO decision <b>687</b>N sets internal LED <b>581</b> to blink slowly and returns via step <b>639</b> to main loop <b>627</b>. A YES decision <b>687</b>Y results in external LED <b>583</b> to be set to normal blinking (step <b>691</b>) and micro-controller <b>511</b> to be set to “Ready” state <b>631</b> prior to being returned in step <b>639</b> to await the next interrupt to trigger main loop <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Operation of exemplary automatic dispenser <b>10</b> and an exemplary method of dispensing will now be described. The method of dispensing will be adapted to the specific type of automatic dispenser apparatus utilized with the proximity detector.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The first step of the dispensing method involves loading the dispenser with product to be dispensed. For the sheet material dispenser <b>10</b>, such loading is accomplished with respect to dispenser <b>10</b> in the following manner. The dispenser cover <b>17</b> is initially opened causing roller frame assembly <b>173</b> to rotate outwardly about axially aligned pivot openings positioned in frame sidewall <b>53</b>, <b>59</b>, one of which is identified by reference number <b>189</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The rotational movement of frame assembly <b>173</b> positions tension roller <b>141</b> and transfer assembly <b>227</b> away from drive roller <b>139</b> providing unobstructed access to housing interior <b>15</b> and space <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When dispenser <b>10</b> is first placed in operation, a roll <b>41</b> of sheet material, such as paper toweling or tissue, may be placed on yoke <b>125</b> by spreading arms <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> apart to locate the central portions of holders <b>135</b>, <b>137</b> into roll core <b>117</b>. The sheet material <b>111</b> is positioned over drive roller <b>139</b> in contact with drive roller segments <b>143</b>-<b>147</b>. A roll could be stored on cradle <b>119</b> awaiting use. Further, cradle <b>119</b> could be removed to insert fresh batteries into battery box <b>311</b>. Thereafter, cover <b>17</b> is closed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Movement of cover <b>17</b> to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> causes the leaf springs <b>213</b>, <b>215</b> mounted on the roller frame assembly <b>173</b> to come in contact with the inside of cover <b>17</b> resiliently to urge the tension roller <b>141</b> into contact with sheet material <b>111</b> from roll <b>39</b> thereby ensuring frictional contact between the sheet material <b>111</b> and the drive roller <b>139</b> and, more particularly, drive roller segments <b>143</b>-<b>147</b>. The dispenser <b>10</b> is now loaded and ready for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Subsequent steps involve the electrical components of the proximity detector and control apparatus <b>49</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">At power up, the dispenser micro-controller <b>511</b> initializes (step <b>625</b>) and loops through the “Power Up” and “Ready” states <b>637</b>, <b>631</b> and to the main loop <b>627</b> awaiting setting of a detector flag <b>603</b> upon recognition of a user by proximity detector <b>49</b>. When a person approaches dispenser <b>10</b>, the instructions proceed through the detection logic in the series of steps <b>601</b> resulting in setting of the detection flag in step <b>603</b>. In “Ready” state <b>631</b>, the motor <b>267</b> is turned on in step <b>661</b>. Rotation of drive roller <b>139</b> by motor <b>267</b> draws sheet material <b>111</b> through the nip <b>157</b> and out of the dispenser <b>10</b> through discharge opening <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the “Dispensing” state <b>633</b>, when the dispense sum reaches or drops below 0, the motor <b>267</b> is de-powered and any optional coasting of drive roller <b>139</b> results in dispensing of the desired length of sheet material to the user. Dispenser <b>10</b> returns to the main loop <b>639</b> and will not dispense again until the dispense delay counter=0 in step <b>653</b>. The user may then separate sheet <b>111</b> into a discrete sheet by lifting sheet <b>111</b> up and into contact with tear bar <b>71</b> serrated edge <b>207</b>, tearing the sheet <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">After repeated automatic dispensing cycles, cover <b>17</b> is removed to permit replenishment of the sheet material. At this time, a portion of stub roll <b>39</b> may remain and a reserve roll <b>41</b> of sheet material can be moved into position. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, partially dispensed stub roll <b>39</b> (preferably having a diameter of about 2.75 inches or less) is now moved onto cradle <b>119</b> arcuate surfaces <b>121</b>, <b>123</b>. Sheet material <b>111</b> extending from stub roll <b>39</b> continues to pass over drive roller <b>139</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">After stub roll <b>39</b> is moved to the position in frame <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a fresh reserve roll <b>41</b> can be loaded onto yoke <b>125</b>. Sheet material <b>113</b> is then threaded onto the transfer assembly <b>227</b>. More specifically, sheet material <b>113</b> is urged onto catch <b>256</b> which pierces through the sheet material <b>113</b>. Sheet material <b>113</b> is further led under pins <b>259</b>, <b>261</b> to hold sheet material <b>113</b> in place on the transfer assembly <b>227</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Transfer assembly surface <b>250</b> rests against sheet material <b>111</b>. Surface <b>250</b> will ride along sheet material <b>111</b> without tearing or damaging material <b>111</b> as it is dispensed. The cover <b>17</b> is then closed to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">After further automatic dispensing cycles, sheet material <b>111</b> from stub roll <b>39</b> will be depleted. Upon passage of a final portion of sheet material <b>111</b> through nip <b>157</b>, transfer surface <b>250</b> will come into direct contact with arcuate surface <b>257</b> of drive roller <b>139</b>. Frictional engagement of drive roller segment <b>145</b> and surface <b>250</b> causes transfer assembly <b>227</b> to pivot rearwardly and slide up along slots <b>237</b>, <b>239</b>. Movement of transfer assembly <b>227</b> as described brings teeth <b>253</b> along arcuate surface <b>251</b> into engagement with drive roller segment <b>145</b>. Engagement of teeth <b>253</b> with the frictional surface of segment <b>145</b> forcefully urges sheet material <b>113</b> held on catch <b>256</b> into contact with drive roller surface <b>257</b> causing sheet material <b>113</b> to be urged into nip <b>157</b> resulting in transfer to roll <b>41</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Following the transfer event, transfer assembly <b>227</b> falls back to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

For example, there is no requirement for the dispenser to dispense from plural rolls of sheet material, and there is no requirement for any transfer mechanism as described herein. The sheet material need not be in the form of a web wound into a roll as described above. The novel proximity detector <b>49</b> and control apparatus <b>50</b> will operate to control the dispensing mechanism <b>43</b> of virtually any type of automatic sheet material dispenser, including dispensers for paper towel, wipes and tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The novel proximity detector <b>49</b> will also operate with automatic dispensers other than sheet material dispensers. For example, the proximity detector will operate to control automatic personal care product dispensers, such as liquid soap dispensers. An automatic soap dispenser embodiment <b>10</b>′ is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In soap dispenser embodiment <b>10</b>′, the power supply apparatus <b>47</b>, proximity detector <b>49</b> and control apparatus <b>50</b> components may be housed in an automatic soap dispenser apparatus housing <b>11</b>. Dispensing mechanism <b>43</b> may be a solenoid or other mechanical actuator. An appropriate fluid reservoir <b>421</b> in communication with the solenoid or actuator (i.e., dispensing mechanism <b>43</b>) is provided to hold the liquid soap. The solenoid or other actuator discharges soap from the dispenser through a fluid-discharge port. The detection zone <b>400</b> is generated below the soap dispenser adjacent the fluid-discharge port <b>423</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Operation of the soap dispenser <b>10</b>′ may include steps/states <b>601</b> (including steps <b>577</b>-<b>603</b>), <b>623</b>, <b>625</b>, <b>626</b>, <b>627</b> together with “Power up” state <b>637</b>, “Ready” state <b>631</b>, “Dispensing” state <b>633</b>, and “Losing power” state <b>635</b> and the corresponding apparatus described with respect to the dispenser <b>10</b>. (Steps <b>667</b> through <b>679</b> would not be relevant for the soap dispenser.) In the soap dispenser embodiment <b>10</b>′, turning the motor on in step <b>661</b> is available to power the solenoid or other actuator in a manner identical to the manner in which the drive signal is generated in the dispenser embodiment <b>10</b>. Powering of the solenoid or other actuator to dispense a unit volume of soap from the soap dispenser port <b>423</b> into the user's hand. The programmed instructions in micro-controller <b>511</b> will be tailored to the specific type of soap dispenser being used, for example to limit the number of dispensing cycles per detection event and to limit the dwell time between dispensing cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The dispenser apparatus may be made of any suitable material or combination of materials as stated above. Selection of the materials will be made based on many factors including, for example, specific purchaser requirements, price, aesthetics, the intended use of the dispenser, and the environment in which the dispenser will be used.</p>
