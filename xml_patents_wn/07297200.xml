<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention describes new water-soluble yellow azo dyes, processes for preparing them and their use as recording fluids, especially for the ink-jet printing process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The ink-jet process is a contactless printing process, where generally a distinction is made between two printing techniques: drop on demand and continuous stream. The drop-on-demand principle is that the ink in the form of a droplet from a nozzle is placed—under electronic control—in the right place at the right time, whereas in continuous stream printing the ink is delivered continuously and then, likewise after electronic charging, either impinges on the receiving medium (paper for example) or is diverted into a collecting vessel. To obtain prints of high definition and resolution the recording fluids and the dyes present in them have to meet corresponding requirements, particularly with regard to lightfastness and waterfastness. High lightfastness is of great importance in particular for exterior ink-jet applications and in the production of ink-jet prints of photographic quality.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The most important part in all this is played by the dyes used in the inks. Despite the development of a large number of dyes there are only a few which meet the requirements imposed on them in a modern-day printing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Initially water-soluble reactive dyes based on the 1,3,5-triazine structural unit, which are used for dyeing or printing cotton fibers (textile printing), were employed. Their usefulness for producing ink-jet inks for ink-jet printing, however, is only limited, since the storage stability of the resultant inks is low and the lightfastnesses of the prints obtained are poor. If the possibility is exploited of allowing targeted reaction of the reactive anchor of such dyes with nucleophiles, the result, for example, is yellow compounds of the formula (1) in accordance with EP-A-0 755 984:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002">
<img id="EMI-C00002" he="43.43mm" wi="74.51mm" file="US07297200-20071120-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">These dyes are distinguished by high lightfastness; a drawback found, however, has been the sensitivity to hydrolysis and, consequently, a low stability on storage.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">There is therefore a need for improved colorants which are superior to the existing yellow dyes, in particular in storage stability, and at the same time have the other properties required for the ink-jet sector.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">It has been found that the azo compounds of the formula (2) and their tautomeric forms possess a high storage stability in conjunction with excellent waterfastness and good lightfastness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The present invention accordingly provides dyes of the formula (2)</p>

The temperature ought to be between 60 and 130° C.; if desired, heating is carried out under superatmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">The dyes of the invention can be isolated from the as-obtained, preferably aqueous reaction mixtures by salting out, filtration or spray drying, with or without partial or complete prior desalting by means of membrane filtration. However, an isolation step may also be omitted and the reaction mixtures comprising the dyes of the invention may be converted directly into concentrated dye solutions by adding organic and/or inorganic bases and/or humectants and, if desired, after partial or complete desalting by means of membrane filtration. Alternatively the complex dyes may also be used as presscakes (in flushing processes as well, if appropriate) or as powders. For further purification, the dyes in the form of their aqueous solutions can be passed over an ion exchange resin.</p>
