<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application incorporates patent application titled “Interface for Rapid Prototyping System” by Curtis Settles, patent application Ser. No. 10/231,641, filed Aug. 30, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,212,961, by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Designers of integrated circuits, and especially application specific integrated circuits, are confronted with increased complexity as the number of functions provided by the circuits increase. Faster speeds, greater numbers of components, increased size of the circuit, routing issues, software development, and the like, have all contributed to the increase in integrated circuit complexity. However, as this complexity has increased, there has not been a corresponding increase in methods and systems designed to embrace this complexity. Rather designers are confronted with outdated methodologies that while sufficient for previous designs, may not take into account the issues experienced with the higher complexity devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, ASIC designs are typically late in design and therefore late to market. Much of this delay is caused by difficulty in testing the design in a system environment early enough, and the need to “spin” silicon because of inadequate system tests.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring generally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 10</figref>, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are shown. The development of integrated circuits, such as general purpose integrated circuits, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), and the like, has become more complicated as the functionality provided by the circuits increases. Faster speeds, greater numbers of components, increased size of the circuit, routing issues, software development, and the like, have all contributed to the increase in integrated circuit complexity. To address this complexity, the design process needs to become more efficient, since mechanisms and processes that may have been adequate in lower component count devices may not be sufficient when the count increases. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a system, method and apparatus for rapid prototyping.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">ASIC designs are typically late in design and therefore late to market. Much of this delay is caused by difficulty in testing the design in a system environment early enough, and the need to “spin” silicon because of inadequate system tests. However, though use of the present invention, a development system is provided which allows a design to be prototyped in FPGA and system software integrated prior to tape out of the first silicon, increasing the probably that the first silicon meets the desired requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For instance, when designing an integrated circuit, both hardware and software may be developed to provide the desired functionality. Because of this co-development, an interdependency may be created between such hardware and software development so that one process may not continue until a corresponding part of the other process is developed, such as the development of a software architecture in conjunction with register transfer level (RTL) development. For instance, previously, the development of an integrated circuit and corresponding software may go through a variety of stages, including testing, verification, and the like before a working product could be produced, an example of such a process is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, through use of the present invention, a rapid prototyping system and method is provided which enables the circuit to be designed in an efficient and timesaving manner with reduced revisions, which may result in a time saving of several months, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. For instance, the present invention may provide a rapid prototyping platform; ASIC emulation platform; provide early software debugging and system integration; and provide a customer demonstration platform.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Rapid Prototyping System</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown wherein a system <b>200</b> is suitable for providing a rapid prototyping platform. A rapid prototyping system <b>200</b> may include a central motherboard <b>202</b> with common memory <b>204</b>. Daughter cards, such as processor cards <b>206</b>, FPGA cards <b>208</b>, and the like may be connected to the motherboard <b>202</b>. For example, the daughter cards may be connected through an advanced microcontroller bus architecture (AMBA) advanced high-performance bus (AHB) to the motherboard to provide specific desired functionality. Additionally, the daughter cards may include mezzanine cards <b>210</b> &amp; <b>212</b> for physical I/O connectivity, i.e. physical interfaces, for the daughter cards. The daughter cards may utilize similar connects as utilized by the daughter card to the motherboard, and the like without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Preferably, the specifications are standardized to enable a user to design and interchange components of the system, thereby providing a modular development system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this way, a standardized advanced microcontroller bus architecture (AMBA) based rapid prototyping vehicle may be provided. The system may be a configurable FPGA-based system which is extendable to support multiple cores and interfaces.

In this example, an ASIC is desired having Ethernet functionality. A motherboard <b>1002</b> is provided with commonly used memory system, such as SRAM <b>1006</b>, SDRAM <b>1004</b>, and the like and peripherals <b>1008</b>, such as UARTS <b>1010</b>, <b>1012</b> &amp; <b>1014</b>, interrupt controllers <b>1016</b>, timers <b>1018</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To provide the processing for the prototype, three processor daughter cards <b>1020</b>, <b>1022</b> &amp; <b>1024</b> are utilized. Additional, a FPGA card is utilized to act as the Ethernet controller <b>1026</b>. The cards <b>1020</b>, <b>1022</b>, <b>1024</b> &amp; <b>1026</b> are communicatively coupled over a system bus, such as an advanced high performance bus (AHB) <b>1028</b> having an AHB arbiter <b>1030</b>. A peripherals bus <b>132</b>, such as an advanced peripherals bus, is provided for connecting the peripherals <b>1008</b>. A bridge <b>134</b> links the system bus <b>1028</b> to the peripherals bus <b>1032</b>. In this way, the system <b>1000</b> of the present invention may be utilized to prototype a design for an ASIC and thereby enable system software to be integrated prior to producing the design in silicon, thereby increasing the probability that the first silicon device produced will function as intended.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, the present invention provides for a variety of advantages over the prior art. Concurrent multi-processing allows for prototyping multi-processor system such as dual ARM, ARM and ZSP, and the like, including support for multi-core debugging. Multi-ported memory environment allows prototyping of more than one master device, processor or bus master DMA type controller, accessing memory at the same time. AMBA bus connections matching the ASIC methodology flow allows a designer to take the RTL directly from an ASIC design, add a library file for FPGA I/O and synthesize directly into a FPGA. Processors and peripherals may be prototyped using either test silicon or FPGA. Common AHB bus allows prototyping of system where the peripherals and non-multi-ported memory on the motherboard are shared by any or all masters in the system. Additionally, a system may be made application specific by providing a needed subset of the features previously mentioned in the discussion.</p>
