<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The invention relates to a rotary switch.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">When operating switches, it is sometimes comfortable for the user when related functions can be carried out by means of operating elements which are closely adjacent to each other. For example, an adjustment means for the illumination range, i.e. the angle of the headlights, is also to be provided in the immediate vicinity of a switch by which the various light functions of the vehicle are selected. In doing this, however, the available structural space must always be taken into account. This is extremely limited, particularly in vehicles for example on the instrument panel of a passenger car.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The invention provides a rotary switch with a central handle which is rotatable about a central axis, a ring-shaped shield surrounding the handle, a rotary button which is arranged on the shield and is rotatable about an axis offset from and parallel to the central axis, and a potentiometer which is adjustable by means of the rotary button. The potentiometer is arranged radially spaced from the offset axis and is coupled with the rotary button by means of a gear. In this way, the total space required for the rotary switch with the additional rotary button can be distinctly reduced and the available installation space can be utilized better.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">In particular, it is advantageous to offset the potentiometer radially inwards from the rotary button towards the central axis because then, due to the gear, only the radial space requirement of the rotary button, but not also that of the potentiometer connected therewith, has to be taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The rotary button is advantageously associated with an illumination range regulator of a vehicle. In a preferred embodiment, the rotary button is mounted to be axially shiftable between a position retracted in the shield and a position projecting from the shield, yet remaining coupled with a ratchet of the gear for joint rotation. The arrangement of the rotary button so as to be able to be retracted is advantageous when a function only has to be utilized occasionally; the adjustment of the headlight range is an example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The handle may be another rotary button and may serve, for example, as a light switch in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the gear is a step-up gear. In this way, a small amount of rotation may suffice for adjustment over a large range.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">The rotary button may be coupled with a pin element which is fixedly connected with a first ratchet of the gear, thereby reducing the number of components. Moreover, the radial distance of the potentiometer from the rotary button can be bridged in a simple manner via the diameter of the first ratchet of the gear.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The potentiometer may be fixedly connected with a second ratchet of the gear. Of course, it is possible to use additional ratchet wheels or other suitable structural elements to achieve the desired transmission or bridging of the distance between the potentiometer and the rotary button.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">In an embodiment where the rotary switch comprises a printed circuit board, the rotary button is arranged above and the potentiometer is arranged underneath the printed circuit board. Not only a radial, but also an axial staggering between the potentiometer and the rotary button is achieved through this, whereby the small amount of available space can be utilized even better.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The resistance track of the potentiometer may have a coding which maps discrete rotational positions of the rotary button with respective angular ranges of the resistance track in which the resistance value remains substantially constant.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">The rotary switch <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> operates light functions in a passenger car, although it is not limited to this application.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">The rotary switch <b>10</b> comprises a central handle <b>12</b>, here a rotary button, which is rotatable about a central axis Z into various discrete predetermined positions which are marked with the corresponding symbols <b>14</b> for the various settings of the vehicle lighting. The symbols <b>14</b> are applied onto a ring-shaped shield <b>16</b> surrounding the central handle <b>12</b>, the shield <b>16</b> likewise being part of the rotary switch <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">A rotary button <b>18</b> projects through the shield <b>16</b>, the radial extent of the rotary button <b>18</b> being smaller than the radial dimension of the shield <b>16</b>, so that the rotary button <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can be placed on the shield <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">The rotary button <b>18</b> is mounted so as to be able to be retracted in a known manner. On axial pressure (into the plane of the drawing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a lock, e.g. similar to a ballpoint pen mechanism, is released, whereupon the rotary button <b>18</b> is raised from the plane of the shield <b>16</b> by means of elastic force. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The rotary button <b>18</b> can then be rotated about its axis, which is designated here as offset axis V. In response to an axial pressure, it engages in a retracted position, its top end lying approximately flush with the surface of the shield <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">In the rotary switch <b>10</b> which is shown, the illumination range of the headlights, i.e. their inclination, is adjusted by means of the rotary button <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">To this end, the rotary button <b>18</b> is connected with a potentiometer <b>28</b> via a sleeve <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">The potentiometer <b>28</b> has a substantially greater dimension in the radial direction r than the rotary button <b>18</b>, and particularly also a greater dimension than the space available on the shield <b>16</b>. However, the potentiometer <b>28</b> is offset radially by a distance with respect to the rotary button <b>18</b> and accordingly with respect to the offset axis V, radially inwards towards the central axis, so that the radial extent of the potentiometer <b>28</b> is non-critical and the potentiometer <b>28</b> does not project radially over the outer periphery of the shield <b>16</b>. A rotary button <b>18</b> must merely be used, which fits with the shield <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">The rotary switch <b>10</b> also includes a printed circuit board <b>30</b> which holds various electronic components and, for example, passes the value which is set at the potentiometer <b>28</b> on to a function unit which adjusts the inclination of the headlights. The potentiometer <b>28</b> is arranged in the axial direction A of the rotary switch <b>10</b> underneath the printed circuit board <b>30</b>, whereas the rotary button <b>18</b> is placed in the axial direction A above the printed circuit board <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the characteristic of the potentiometer <b>28</b> has various discrete plateaus each of which maps with a particular rotation angle range of the rotary button <b>18</b>. The resistance track of the potentiometer is coded so that discrete rotational positions over a rotation angle range have a substantially constant resistance value. The potentiometer therefore can provide different voltage values, which are then passed on to a control system for the illumination range of the headlights.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">The sleeve <b>20</b> which connects the rotary button <b>18</b> with the potentiometer <b>28</b> comprises a step-up gear <b>22</b> with a first ratchet wheel <b>24</b> and a second ratchet wheel <b>26</b>. The rotary button <b>18</b> is coupled with the input shaft of the step-up gear <b>22</b> for joint rotation, but so as to be axially movable. In addition, the sleeve <b>20</b> comprises pin element <b>32</b> which runs axially, which is also here a part of the retraction mechanism <b>34</b> for the rotary button <b>18</b>. The pin element <b>32</b> (e.g. a rod or a tube) is connected at one end with the rotary button <b>18</b> for joint rotation, and is fixedly connected at the other end with the first ratchet wheel <b>24</b>. The first ratchet wheel <b>24</b> meshes with the second ratchet wheel <b>26</b> which is fixedly connected with the axis of the potentiometer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">The sensitivity of the rotary movement of the rotary button <b>18</b> is set by selecting the size and the number of teeth of the ratchet wheels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">The rotary button <b>18</b>, the pin element <b>32</b> and the ratchet wheel <b>24</b> may be made from plastic, just as most other parts of the switch.</p>
