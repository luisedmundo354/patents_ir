<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention is related to a coating delivery system that includes at least one pressure vessel operable in sealed and unsealed conditions, a deliverable substance including a coating component interspersed with at least one of liquefied carbon dioxide and supercritical carbon dioxide, and a pressurizing fluid. The deliverable substance is disposed in a first pressure vessel of the at least one pressure vessel, and the pressurizing fluid directly exerts a pressure on the deliverable substance to effect transport thereof when the pressure vessel is in the unsealed condition. The deliverable substance may be spray discharged.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention is related to an apparatus and method for dispensing coatings. In particular, the invention is related to a delivery system that includes at least one pressure vessel within which is stored a deliverable substance having a coating component interspersed with a fluid component.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of volatile organic compounds as carriers for the delivery of coatings is well-known. However, increasingly there is a need for environmentally friendly carriers which minimize the use of organic carriers such as organic solvents. Supercritical fluids have emerged as such a viable carrier in coating applications, particularly in applications requiring the delivery of a substance in spray form. While supercritical fluids are known to have solvating powers similar to organic solvents, they also present advantages over organic solvents because of their higher diffusivities, lower viscosities, and lower surface tensions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A supercritical carrier may be considered any compound at a temperature and pressure above certain critical values of temperature and pressure. The critical temperature of a compound is the temperature above which the pure compound in gaseous state cannot be converted to a liquid, while a compound's critical pressure is the vapor pressure of the pure compound in gaseous state at the critical temperature. The critical point of the compound occurs at the temperature and pressure at which the gas and liquid phases are no longer separately defined, but instead a fluid exists in a state that is considered neither liquid nor gas. In the supercritical state, a fluid confers the carrier properties expected from a liquid while at the same time providing transport characteristics expected from gases.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various compounds are known to exist as supercritical fluids, including ethylene, carbon dioxide, ethane, nitrous oxide, propane, and even methanol and water. The low cost and ready availability of supercritical carbon dioxide have made it a popular choice for a variety of applications. Also, with its critical temperature of 31.1° C., critical pressure of about 73 atm, and critical density of about 470 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, supercritical carbon dioxide has properties amenable to applications using standard pressure vessel technology.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various applications have been explored for supercritical carriers, including use in the delivery of protective coatings to various commercial building substrates such as marble, stone, cast stone, architectural terra cotta, concrete, and concrete block. The degradation of such materials due to pollution, acid rain, and other destructive forces can be substantially decreased if a relatively thin protective coating is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Several supercritical fluid technologies have been disclosed by investigators. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,720 to Lee et al. is directed to the use of supercritical fluids as diluents in the liquid spray application of coatings. A process and apparatus for coating substrates is provided in which a supercritical fluid, such as supercritical carbon dioxide fluid, is used as a viscosity reduction diluent for coating formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, prior art methods and devices for applying coatings using supercritical fluids suffer from complexity and concomitant bulky equipment, rendering the technology inconvenient to use and inaccessible to many potential customers. Commercial and laboratory equipment for applying coatings using supercritical fluids generally fall into two classes, batch and continuous. Typically, the main storage element of prior art batch systems is a floating piston accumulator. The coating material and supercritical fluid are held captive on one side of the piston, while the pressurization fluid is stored on the other. In such systems, the coating material and CO<sub>2 </sub>are added at a pressure typically above 1000 psi so that the CO<sub>2 </sub>remains in a liquid state. Such an arrangement requires high-pressure pumps. After the desired amounts of coating material and CO<sub>2 </sub>have been added, the two components must be mixed. Mixing usually is effected by circulating material in and out of the piston accumulator. The pressurizing fluid, disposed on the other side of the piston accumulator, is used to effect transport of the deliverable substance through a hose to a spray nozzle. Such batch systems are heavy due to the weight of the piston accumulator, high-pressure pumps, and associated controls. The weight of commercial units ranges between about 3000 lbs and about 1500 lbs. for equipment capable of delivering 6 kgs per batch, not including the CO<sub>2 </sub>supply bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Continuous systems typically require two or three high-pressure pumps, along with complex flow meters and controls for accurately metering and mixing the coating material and supercritical fluid components. Multiple control loops and a programmable logic controller may be required. Such systems are less common, due to the required level of sophistication of controls. Further, although the commercial, continuous systems are capable of supplying about 100 grams to about 300 grams per minute of deliverable product, they are heavy, typically weighing between about 180 lbs. and 1000 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above-described batch and continuous systems are heavy, bulky, require multiple high-pressure pumps, and require heavy CO<sub>2 </sub>cylinders with high stored energies. These systems also require significant equipment maintenance, as well as an additional energy source to power pumps and controls.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, there exists a need for an improved apparatus and an improved method for dispensing coatings using supercritical fluids. There also exists a need for an apparatus with simplicity in design, compactness, and portability so that the device may be manually transported. Moreover, there exists a need for methods and devices that can deliver coatings with controllable composition and thickness.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention is related to a coating delivery system including a first pressure vessel operable in sealed and unsealed conditions, a deliverable substance having a coating component interspersed with at least one of liquefied carbon dioxide and supercritical carbon dioxide, and a pressurizing fluid. The deliverable substance is disposed in the first pressure vessel. The pressurizing fluid is provided (1) at a pressure greater than the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide if the deliverable substance includes liquefied carbon dioxide, or (2) at a pressure greater than the critical pressure of carbon dioxide if the deliverable substance includes supercritical carbon dioxide. In addition, the pressurizing fluid directly exerts a pressure on the deliverable substance to effect transport thereof when the first pressure vessel is in the unsealed condition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first pressure vessel may include a dip tube, a head region, and a deliverable substance region, with the dip tube being disposed in the first pressure vessel and having an inlet proximate the deliverable substance region. The head region of the first pressure vessel may serve as an accumulator for accommodating changes in volume. In some embodiments, a second pressure vessel may be provided, with the pressurizing fluid being disposed in the second pressure vessel in communication with a head region of the first pressure vessel. A regulator may be provided for regulating the transport of pressurizing fluid from the second pressure vessel to the first pressure vessel, and a temperature control system may be provided for changing the temperature of the deliverable substance. The temperature control system may include induction coils, resistive heating coils, or fluid circulation coils.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The coating delivery system optionally may include a circulation loop for recirculating the deliverable substance. The circulation loop may include a pump and a check valve, with the check valve permitting flow of deliverable substance in one direction in the circulation loop. The circulation loop may terminate inside the first pressure vessel remote from the head region. A temperature control system also may be included for changing the temperature of the deliverable substance exiting the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, at least one agitation component such as a magnetic stirrer or at least one mixing ball may be provided for agitating the deliverable substance. The coating delivery system also may include a heated dispensing hose communicating with the first pressure vessel, with the hose having an orifice, spray attachment, or other nozzle attachment for dispensing the deliverable substance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coating component may be a polymeric compound. In some embodiments, the coating component may be an enamel, an alkylsilicone resin, or a fluorinated resin. The deliverable substance may include a vapor component, and the pressurizing fluid may be substantially less dense than the vapor component. The pressurizing fluid may be a gas selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, air, oxygen, argon, and methane. In some embodiments, the pressurizing fluid may be a gas selected from the group consisting of helium or hydrogen. The first pressure vessel may have a pressure between about 200 psi and about 4500 psi. A circulation loop may be provided for recirculating deliverable substance, with the circulation loop terminating inside the first pressure vessel remote from a head region thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention also is related to a method of applying a coating to a substrate including: providing a deliverable substance in a first pressure vessel, the deliverable substance comprising a coating component interspersed with at least one of liquefied carbon dioxide and supercritical carbon dioxide; providing a first fluid capable of applying pressure to the deliverable substance; allowing the first fluid to directly apply pressure to the deliverable substance (1) at a pressure at least the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide if the deliverable substance comprises liquefied carbon dioxide, or (2) at a pressure at least the critical pressure of carbon dioxide if the deliverable substance comprises supercritical carbon dioxide; delivering the deliverable substance to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the first fluid may be provided in a second pressure vessel that communicates with the first pressure vessel. The method may additionally include heating the deliverable substance prior to spray discharge, pumping the deliverable substance, agitating the deliverable substance, and/or recirculating a portion of the deliverable substance. When the deliverable substance is delivered to the substrate, fluid in a head space of the pressure vessel may remain substantially undisturbed. In addition, the method may include heating the deliverable substance in the first pressure vessel to cause a change in composition of the deliverable substance.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown an exemplary delivery system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Delivery system <b>10</b> includes a pressure vessel <b>12</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>14</b>, a dip tube <b>16</b>, and a cylinder valve <b>18</b>. Dip tube <b>16</b> has an inlet through which a deliverable substance <b>20</b> flows. Preferably, cylinder valve <b>18</b> controls the flow of deliverable substance <b>20</b>, and is connected to a regulator and additional dispensing components (not shown) such as a flexible hose with a suitably sized orifice to permit spraying of deliverable substance <b>20</b>. Pressure vessel <b>12</b> stores a quantity of a deliverable substance <b>20</b>, which preferably includes a desired coating component interspersed with a fluid component. The coating component preferably is chosen to suit a desired application, and in the preferred embodiment is a paint or resin suitable for application to commercial building substrates. Among the coating components contemplated are acrylics, alkylsilicone resins, and fluorinated resins, however the present invention also may apply to other organics, inorganics, hydrocarbons, and silicones. Both monomers and polymers may be used. The fluid component preferably is chosen from compounds suitable for use in supercritical condition, including CO<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, n-C<sub>5</sub>, n-C<sub>4</sub>, CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, and most preferably is CO<sub>2</sub>. Head space <b>22</b> of pressure vessel <b>12</b> preferably is filled with a pressurizing gas such as helium or hydrogen. In the preferred embodiment, the pressurizing gas has a density less than the density of the vapor phase of deliverable substance <b>20</b>. High pressure rated rigid cylinders are preferably used, permitting safe storage of fluids such as liquid carbon dioxide at ambient temperatures. Such cylinders should preferably be rated for use over a pressure range of about 200 psi to about 4500 psi. To prevent cylinder rupture due to over-pressurization, a frangible disk, relief valve, or other safety mechanism may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The prior art suggests that a substantial quantity of carbon dioxide would be expected to be found in head space <b>22</b>. From such indication, it would be expected that the composition of deliverable substance <b>20</b> would vary as deliverable substance <b>20</b> is emptied from pressure vessel <b>12</b>, due to the transport of some carbon dioxide from deliverable substance <b>20</b> to head space <b>22</b>. Some embodiments of the present invention advantageously permit a generally constant composition of deliverable substance <b>20</b> to be delivered, for example by spray, while other embodiments advantageously permit controlled variation in composition to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, changes in the composition of deliverable substance <b>20</b> may be obtained by selectively heating or cooling the contents of cylinder <b>12</b>. Preferably, thermoelectric heaters or coolers are employed, such as sock-type devices which may be disposed around cylinder <b>12</b>. For example, a 4.5% by weight change in composition was experimentally determined using an exemplar formulated composition and CO<sub>2 </sub>between 20° C. and 40° C. The formulated composition included a fluorinated resin, as described below. The use of thermal devices, of course, is more effective with metallic cylinders (i.e., aluminum) than non-metallic cylinders (ie., carbon fiber) which do not conduct heat as well. Alternatively, cylinder <b>20</b> may be surrounded with another liquid, such as in the form of a water bath, in order to control temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown. Similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, delivery system <b>30</b> includes a pressure vessel <b>32</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>34</b>, a dip tube <b>36</b>, and a mixture valve <b>38</b>. In addition, a second pressure vessel <b>40</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>41</b> is provided. Cylinders <b>32</b> and <b>40</b> communicate through a suitable line such as a hose <b>42</b>. In particular, a head space valve <b>44</b>, regulator <b>46</b>, and pressurizing gas valve <b>48</b> are connected between cylinders <b>32</b> and <b>40</b>. Pressure vessel <b>32</b> stores a quantity of a deliverable substance <b>50</b>, as described above, while constant pressure is maintained in head space <b>52</b> by regulator <b>46</b>. Head space <b>52</b> thus acts as an accumulator, compensating for volume changes occurring, for example, due to changes in temperature. Advantageously, use of delivery system <b>30</b> with two pressure vessels <b>32</b> and <b>40</b> permits a constant spray pressure to be achieved for substance <b>50</b> exiting mixture valve <b>38</b>. In one non-limiting exemplary arrangement, cylinder <b>40</b> may be filled to an initial pressure of 3000 psi with helium gas, while head space <b>52</b> of cylinder <b>32</b> may be pressurized with the helium gas at a generally constant pressure of 1500 psi using regulator <b>46</b>. Further, such a two-cylinder system facilitates pressure regulation, because it is generally easier to regulate the pressure of a gas than a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Experimentation was performed to determine whether a substantial variation in composition of deliverable substance <b>50</b> occurs during delivery using delivery system <b>30</b>. Unexpectedly, no substantial variation in coating composition was found when delivery occurred without mixing of the head space during delivery. Several coating components were tested in a manner as described below. Sherwin Williams Industrial Enamel HS #B54TZ404, listed below as Exemplar A, was tested as an exemplar paint for application with the present invention. In addition, a high performance all-purpose solvent reducible water repellent for mineral substrates, product designation BS 290 supplied by Wacker Silicones Corporation (Adrian, Mich.), listed below as Exemplar B, was also tested as an exemplar coating for application with the present invention. BS 290 is an alkylsilicone resin with alkoxy groups. Furthermore, a formulated composition whose main ingredient is a fluorinated resin with molecular weight less than 15,000, listed below as Exemplar C, was also tested as another exemplar resin for application with the present invention. The carbon dioxide was commercial grade CO<sub>2 </sub>supplied in 50 lb. bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Testing was conducted by filling a 4.7 liter internal volume carbon fiber pressure bottle with coating component and carbon dioxide by weight. For example, 3000 g of Exemplar C composition and 1500 g of CO<sub>2 </sub>were used in a test run having a Exemplar C composition:CO<sub>2 </sub>ratio of 2:1. A pressure vessel with dip tube was used, as arranged with pressure vessel <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. After the coating component and CO<sub>2 </sub>were added, the pressure vessel was shaken gently until the coating component and CO<sub>2 </sub>were thoroughly mixed. Pressurizing gas was supplied from a large nitrogen or helium bottle at 2500 psig, arranged as pressure vessel <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A regulator was used with the nitrogen/helium bottle for supplying pressurizing gas to the coating component bottle. The pressurizing gas was supplied at about 1250 psig during testing for Exemplars A, B and about 500 psig during testing for Exemplar C. The regulated pressures were chosen because they represent nominal pressures for supercritical CO<sub>2 </sub>spraying applications. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a valve <b>38</b> communicated with dip tube <b>36</b>, and a flexible hose was connected from the valve to a mass flow corrolis meter for measuring flow rate and density. Pressure vessel <b>32</b> was submersed in a water bath with the water temperature regulated by a temperature control system. The content of pressure vessel <b>32</b> was slowly metered out with a pressure valve and capillary to simulate typical spray rates (approximately 4.5 kg/h). Temperature, flow, pressure, and density were measured every 5 seconds for the duration of the run and recorded using Allen Bradley data acquisition software.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Changes in composition of deliverable substance <b>50</b> were determined from variations in the density measurements. Because there is a large difference in the density of the coating component and the density of liquid CO<sub>2 </sub>(approximately 0.8 g/cc), changes in density could accurately be related to changes in composition. Table I below lists exemplar test data:</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The measured density during emptying may be used as an indication of change, or lack thereof, in the composition of the discharged mixture. For example, the density of each pure coating component was measured at 20° C. and at the spray pressure in order to determine accurate density at elevated pressure. The density of the discharged mixture, ρ(mixture), was measured at ambient temperature for comparison. Using Eq. 1, the density of the discharged mixture is related to the mass percents of the coating component and CO<sub>2 </sub>in the mixture, the density of the coating component, ρ(coating), and the density of the CO<sub>2</sub>, ρ(CO<sub>2</sub>):

Thus, Eq. 1 may be used to determine estimates of the relative changes in composition, particularly if the density of the coating component is significantly different from the density of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, because Eq. 1 does not account for the effects of dissolved pressurizing gas or the effective densities of the components in the mixture, only relative changes may be estimated. For example, it is estimated that for Test No. 5, as the cylinder was emptied, less than one percent by weight change in composition occurred.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown. Delivery system <b>60</b> includes a pressure vessel <b>62</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>64</b>, a dip tube <b>66</b>, and a vessel isolation valve <b>68</b>. In addition, a second pressurizing gas vessel <b>70</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>71</b> is provided. Vessels <b>62</b> and <b>70</b> communicate through a suitable line such as a hose <b>72</b>. A circulation loop A is provided, and deliverable substance <b>76</b> is circulated by a pump <b>78</b>. Heater <b>80</b>, such as temperature-controlled coils, permits the temperature of deliverable substance <b>76</b> exiting from pump <b>78</b> to be changed, and loop A is completed with a check valve <b>82</b> and a vessel isolation valve <b>84</b>. Check valve <b>82</b> prevents backflow in a direction opposite from that indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, while vessel isolation valves <b>68</b> and <b>84</b> permit pressure vessel <b>62</b> to be removed and exchanged with another pressure vessel. When deliverable substance <b>76</b> is returned by loop A to pressure vessel <b>62</b>, it is released remote from head space <b>86</b> via a dip tube <b>94</b>, so as not to directly mix head space <b>86</b> during discharge of deliverable substance <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to permit a constant spray pressure to be achieved, a regulator <b>88</b> is provided between pressure vessels <b>62</b> and <b>70</b>. Check valve <b>90</b> is provided to ensure that circulating fluid in loop A cannot flow to regulator <b>88</b> or vessel <b>70</b>. In addition, a vessel isolation valve <b>92</b> is provided so that pressure vessel <b>70</b> may be changed. Deliverable substance <b>76</b> is expelled from valve <b>93</b> to an orifice, spray hose, or other discharge component.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Advantageously, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is particularly suitable for delivering deliverable substance <b>76</b> at selectable compositions. Thus, if a thin or thick mixture is required for a given application, the density of the mixture may be varied by changing the temperature of deliverable substance <b>76</b> and thus changing the ratio of carbon dioxide to coating component. Increasing the temperature of deliverable substance <b>76</b> results in a decrease in carbon dioxide content in deliverable substance <b>76</b>, whereas decreasing the temperature of deliverable substance <b>76</b> results in an increase in carbon dioxide content in deliverable substance <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Delivery system <b>100</b> includes a pressure vessel <b>102</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>104</b>, a dip tube <b>106</b>, and a mixture valve <b>108</b>. In addition, a second pressurizing gas vessel <b>110</b> with a cylinder fitting <b>111</b> is provided. Vessels <b>102</b> and <b>110</b> communicate through a suitable line such as a hose <b>112</b>. In particular, a head space valve <b>114</b>, regulator <b>116</b>, and pressurizing cylinder valve <b>118</b> are connected between cylinders <b>102</b> and <b>110</b>. Pressure vessel <b>102</b> stores a quantity of a deliverable substance <b>120</b>, as described above, while constant pressure is maintained in head space <b>122</b> by regulator <b>116</b>. Coils <b>124</b>, preferably induction coils, are provided proximate the outer wall of pressure vessel <b>102</b>, and may be selectively energized to change the temperature of deliverable substance <b>120</b> and thus the ratio of carbon dioxide to coating component for its composition. In alternate embodiments of delivery system <b>100</b>, coils <b>124</b> may be resistive heating coils or heating/cooling fluid circulation coils. A thermocouple <b>126</b> is preferably run into vessel <b>102</b> to measure the temperature of deliverable substance <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The delivery system of the present invention may be supplied “turnkey,” so that a user need only unpack the system and attach a suitable spray hose with an orifice to the cylinder valve. The cylinder initially may be provided with suitable pressurizing gas and deliverable substance. The head space of the cylinder may serve as an accumulator, compensating for volume changes occurring, for example, due to changes in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a heated hose is connected to the delivery system. The heated hose, for example, permits a desired coating component intermixed with liquid/supercritical carbon dioxide, to be delivered with desired spray characteristics such as droplet size. In addition, heating may permit the deliverable substance to be discharged without solidification proximate the nozzle, and thus plugging of the delivery system can be averted. In one preferred embodiment, a substance enters the final delivery hose at a temperature of 20° C. and is heated to a temperature of 50° C. at the exit of the hose proximate the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, pressure vessels <b>12</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>110</b> are provided as cylinders or other suitably rigid tanks. Although carbon fiber cylinders are preferred, other cylinders such as fiberglass, aramid, aluminum or steel cylinders may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, pressure vessels disclosed in the present invention may be provided with means for producing agitation, such as magnetic stirrers, one or more mixing balls, or other agitation arrangements. Such agitation is advantageous because when pressurizing gas is applied to the head space, it causes some of the gaseous CO<sub>2 </sub>to be liquefied due to the increase in pressure. The CO<sub>2 </sub>is less dense than the coating component, and thus stratifies above the coating component/CO<sub>2 </sub>mixture creating a non-homogenous mixture. Further, homogenous systems also may develop density gradients, over time, due to the vastly different densities of the mixture components (coating component and CO<sub>2</sub>). Preferably, mixing is undertaken after pressurization. However, care should be taken to minimize mixing of the head space of the pressure vessel, so that it remains undisturbed during emptying and the density gradient remains largely unchanged. As discussed above, testing conducted under the conditions listed in Table I for Test Nos. 10, 11 and 12 included mixing in head space <b>52</b> in pressure vessel <b>32</b>. Fluid in head space <b>52</b> was disturbed by pumping a stream of recirculated mixture (deliverable substance <b>50</b>) into the top of pressure vessel <b>32</b>. The recirculation occurred at a flow rate of approximately 700 cc/min. Because the recycled flow significantly disturbed the density gradient in the head space, an increase in CO<sub>2 </sub>transfer to the head space occurred. This resulted in a substantial change in mixture density while the pressure vessel was emptied from an initially full condition. A comparison of the results of Test No. 5 (no mixing), identified as data <b>130</b>, and Test No. 12 (mixing), identified as data <b>140</b>, described above in Table I, is depicted graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In addition, the results for Test No. 1 (no mixing), identified as data <b>150</b>, and Test No. 3 (no mixing), identified as data <b>160</b>, are shown for further comparison. The density of the deliverable substance (in g/cc) is shown as a function of the percent of the pressure vessel that has been emptied.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one exemplary, preferred embodiment of the present invention, the delivery system is provided in compact, lightweight form to permit transport in a midsize automobile and single-person handling. Such an embodiment, for example, may have two pressure vessels, an overall size of 26″×12″×48″, and an overall weight of about 70 lbs. Cylinders are preferably pre-filled, requiring minimal preparation by users, and the delivery system may be used in a batch process. In addition, due to the size and weight, and concomitantly the nature of the materials that are used, the delivery systems may be shipped by common carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Advantageously, some of the embodiments of the present invention may be operated without the used of external energy sources, which for example, are typically required with prior art delivery systems which employ one or more pumps and control systems. Pumps, in particular, require significant energy. Moreover, some of the embodiments of the present invention preferably only require an energy source for the heated-discharge hose. Such an energy source may be provided in a small battery pack, which may be directly attached to the delivery system or connected to the heated discharge hose yet carried, for example, on the waist belt of a workman using the system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While various descriptions of the present invention are described above, it should be understood that the various features can be used singly or in any combination thereof. Therefore, this invention is not to be limited to only the specifically preferred embodiments depicted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, it should be understood that variations and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention may occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. For example, the delivery systems of the present invention may be used in supercritical fluid extraction and supercritical fluid chromatography. Furthermore, the delivery systems of the present invention may be used in industrial painting applications, such as automotive painting. In addition, each of the delivery systems may be configured to be portable, for example, as a back-pack unit. Also, other embodiments may include more than two pressure vessels. For example, a coating delivery system may include two pressure vessels for storing and selectively delivering different deliverable substances, while a third pressure vessel may be included for storing pressure conveying fluid. Alternatively, a coating delivery system may include several pressure vessels of a standardized size which contain the same deliverable substance, thereby in the aggregate providing greater volume of available deliverable substance when a coating is being applied. Accordingly, all expedient modifications readily attainable by one versed in the art from the disclosure set forth herein that are within the scope and spirit of the present invention are to be included as further embodiments of the present invention. The scope of the present invention is accordingly defined as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
