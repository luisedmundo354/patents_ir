<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to a modular heat sink assembly, and more particularly, to a heat sink assembly for cooling electronic components oriented in a stacked configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern electronic devices typically include numerous components or packages therein. However, there is an increasing demand to reduce the size of the components within the electronic devices in order to reduce the overall size of the device itself or to provide more components within the device. As such, the size and weight requirements for components within electronic devices are constantly decreasing. However, in today's devices, there is a continuously increasing demand for signal and power output by components within the devices. As such, the components function at a higher output, thus producing more heat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is well known to use a heat sink to cool a heat generating integrated circuit (IC) component or package. Typically, a heat sink is arranged in close contact with heat generating components of the package. Heat generated by the component is transferred to the heat sink and then dissipated from the heat sink to the surrounding air.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At least some known heat sink arrangements include multiple heat sinks oriented on opposite sides of stacked components. For instance, one heat sink is employed to cool a first heat generating component from above, and another heat sink is employed to cool a second heat generating component from below when the first and second components are stacked upon one another, or when the first and second components are mounted on opposing sides of a common circuit board. Such arrangements are commonly found, for example, in electronic assemblies including a processor and a voltage regulator module which are mounted to a circuit board. Because the voltage regulator module overlies and generally conceals the processor in use, one heat sink assembly is provided to cool the voltage regulator module on one side of the board and another heat sink is provided to cool the processor from the opposite side of the board. Multiple heat sinks in different locations in relation to stacked components, however, can be problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, assembly of the heat sinks to the stacked components can be difficult, especially as the size of the IC packages or components decreases. Also, the heat sinks sandwiching stacked IC components can interfere with clearance requirements when multiple circuit boards or components are employed in close relation to one another. It would be desirable to provide a more compact and lower cost heat sink assembly for stacked IC components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an exemplary embodiment, a heat sink assembly includes a circuit board, a first integrated circuit package and a second integrated circuit package mounted to the circuit board in a stacked relation to one another. A first heat sink is engaged to and is in thermal communication with the first integrated circuit package, and a second heat sink is engaged to and is in thermal communication with the second integrated circuit package, wherein each of the first and second heat sinks are positioned over the first and second integrated circuit packages on a single side of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Optionally, the first integrated circuit package may be a central processing unit, and the second integrated circuit package may be a voltage regulator module. At least one power connector may be positioned between the first and second integrated circuit packages such that the first integrated circuit package, the at least one power connector, and the second integrated circuit package are vertically stacked over the same side of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another exemplary embodiment, a heat sink assembly includes a first heat sink having a thermal interface configured to be in thermal communication with a first integrated circuit package. A second heat sink is surrounded by the first heat sink and includes a thermal interface configured to be in thermal communication with a second integrated circuit package, wherein the first and second integrated circuit packages are vertically stacked with respect to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to yet another embodiment, a heat sink assembly includes a circuit board, a central processing unit mounted to the circuit board, and a voltage regulator module mounted to the central processing unit, wherein the central processing unit and the voltage regulator are mounted in a stacked relation to one another on a common side of the circuit board. A first heat sink is engaged to and is in thermal communication with the central processing unit, and a second heat sink is surrounded by the first heat sink. The second heat sink is engaged to and is in thermal communication with the voltage regulator module.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrates top and bottom perspective views, respectively, of an electronic assembly <b>10</b> formed in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The assembly <b>10</b> includes a compact heat sink assembly <b>12</b> capable of cooling stacked integrated circuit (IC) components or packages <b>14</b>. The IC components <b>14</b> may be loaded onto a socket or connector <b>16</b> that is mounted on a circuit board <b>18</b>. The assembly <b>10</b> is coupled together using a plurality of fasteners <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an exemplary embodiment, the assembly <b>10</b> may effectively cool power consuming devices such as, central processing units, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), or the like, together with peripheral and/or auxiliary devices such as, voltage regulator modules, monitoring devices, and the like. In particular, the IC components may be cooled from only one, as opposed to both, sides of the board <b>18</b>, and may be rather easily assembled in the manner explained below. While the invention will be described in terms of specific IC components, it is to be understood that the following description is for illustrative purposes only and is but one potential application of the inventive concepts herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the circuit board <b>18</b> has a first or upper side <b>22</b> and a second or lower side <b>24</b> opposite the upper side <b>22</b>. The connector <b>16</b> and the IC components <b>14</b> are mounted to the first or upper side <b>22</b> of the circuit board <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the connector <b>16</b> is a land grid array (LGA) connector. However, in alternative embodiments, other commonly used connector formats such as a pin grid array (PGA) or ball grid array (BGA) may be employed. The IC components <b>14</b> are positioned and aligned with respect to the connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an exemplary embodiment, an IC component <b>14</b>, such as, a central processing unit (CPU) <b>32</b> engages the connector <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the CPU <b>32</b> includes an integrated heat sink <b>34</b> extending from an outer surface <b>36</b> of the CPU <b>32</b>. The integrated heat sink <b>34</b> is in thermal communication with the CPU <b>32</b> for dissipating heat from the CPU <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an exemplary embodiment, another IC component <b>14</b> such as, a voltage regulator (VR) module <b>38</b> is mounted to and generally overlies the CPU <b>32</b> in a stacked relation on the circuit board <b>18</b>. In a further embodiment, another IC component <b>14</b> such as, by way of example only, another CPU may be mounted to the circuit board <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the VR module <b>38</b> includes an opening <b>40</b> extending therethrough. The opening <b>40</b> provides access from above to the CPU <b>32</b> positioned below the VR module <b>38</b>. The opening <b>40</b> may be positioned such that a portion of the CPU <b>32</b> is exposed through the opening <b>40</b>. Specifically, the integrated heat sink <b>34</b> is exposed through the opening <b>40</b> when the VR module <b>38</b> is assembled. Alternatively, the electronic assembly <b>10</b> may include two VR modules <b>38</b> positioned proximate one another such that a gap (not shown) is defined therebetween to expose a portion of the CPU <b>32</b> between the VR modules.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Multiple connectors <b>42</b>, such as, for example, power connectors, may be mounted between the CPU <b>32</b> and the VR module <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, each connector <b>42</b> is soldered to the VR module <b>38</b> prior to mounting the VR module <b>38</b> onto the CPU <b>32</b>. In another embodiment, each connector <b>42</b> is secured using a frame or clip <b>43</b>. Additionally, power connectors <b>42</b> may be mounted between the CPU <b>32</b> and the connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of the CPU <b>32</b>, the VR module <b>38</b>, and the connectors <b>42</b> are substantially aligned with one another such that the components have a vertically stacked arrangement. Moreover, each of the CPU <b>32</b>, the VR module <b>38</b>, and the connectors <b>42</b> are arranged on the same side of the circuit board <b>18</b> such that each of the components are substantially aligned in the direction of arrow A. Furthermore, each of the CPU <b>32</b>, the VR module <b>38</b>, and the connectors <b>42</b> may include fastening bores <b>44</b> extending therethrough and/or therefrom such that a fastener <b>46</b>, such as, for example, a screw or pin, may couple the components to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an exemplary embodiment, the heat sink assembly <b>12</b> includes a first, or outer, heat sink <b>48</b> and a second, or inner, heat sink <b>50</b>. In alternative embodiments, more heat sinks may be provided. The outer heat sink <b>48</b> has a lower surface <b>52</b> that receives heat generated from an upper surface of the VR module <b>38</b>. Specifically, when assembled, the lower surface <b>52</b> is in abutting contact and in thermal communication with the VR module <b>38</b>. Moreover, the inner heat sink <b>50</b> has a lower surface <b>54</b> that receives heat generated from the CPU <b>32</b>, or more specifically, the heat sink <b>34</b> of the CPU <b>32</b> that is exposed through the VR module <b>38</b>. The inner heat sink <b>50</b> may also receive heat generated from the VR module <b>38</b>. When assembled, the lower surface <b>54</b> is in abutting contact and in thermal communication with the CPU heat sink <b>34</b>. Additionally, when assembled, outer surfaces <b>55</b> of the inner heat sink <b>50</b> are in abutting contact and in thermal communication with the outer heat sink <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an exemplary embodiment, each heat sink <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> may include a base and a plurality of fins for dissipating the heat from the corresponding IC component <b>14</b>. The heat sink base and the fins are typically fabricated from metal such as aluminum or copper, and further, may be fabricated from the same or different metals. For instance, in one embodiment the heat sink base may be fabricated from copper while the fins may be fabricated from aluminum. In another embodiment, each heat sink <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> may include a solid metallic body for dissipating the heat from the corresponding IC component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The outer heat sink <b>48</b> includes an opening, or bore, <b>56</b> extending therethrough. The opening <b>56</b> extends between an upper surface <b>58</b> and the lower surface <b>52</b> of the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. The opening <b>56</b> may be positioned such that the CPU <b>32</b> is accessible through the opening <b>56</b> and through the VR module opening <b>40</b> when the outer heat sink <b>48</b> is installed. The integrated heat sink <b>34</b> is exposed through the opening <b>56</b> and the VR module opening <b>40</b>. The VR module <b>38</b> may also be partially exposed through the opening <b>56</b>. The outer heat sink <b>48</b> includes a plurality of fastening bores <b>62</b> extending from the upper surface <b>58</b> to the lower surface <b>52</b>. In another embodiment, the fastening bores <b>62</b> extend from one of the upper surface <b>58</b> or the lower surface <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inner heat sink <b>50</b> is sized and shaped to fit within the opening <b>56</b> defined in the outer heat sink <b>48</b> such that the inner heat sink <b>50</b> is surrounded by, or encapsulated by, the outer heat sink <b>48</b> when the inner heat sink <b>50</b> is received in the outer heat sink opening <b>56</b>. In one embodiment, inner heat sink <b>50</b> substantially fills the opening <b>56</b> and includes a lower portion <b>64</b> sized and shaped to fit within the opening <b>40</b> defined in the VR module <b>38</b> and to engage the heat sink <b>34</b> of the CPU <b>32</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A thermal interface material <b>86</b> may be positioned between the lower surface <b>52</b> of the outer heat sink <b>48</b> and the interface surface <b>80</b> of the VR module <b>38</b>. More specifically, a thermal interface material <b>88</b> may be positioned between the lower surface <b>54</b> of the inner heat sink <b>50</b> and the interface surface <b>82</b> of the CPU <b>32</b>. As those in the art would appreciate, the thermal interface material <b>86</b> or <b>88</b> enhances the heat conductivity between the heat sinks <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> and the respective IC components <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An exemplary method of assembly is described below. However, it is to be understood that the following description is for illustrative purposes only and is but one potential method of assembly of the electronic assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Prior to assembly, the outer heat sink <b>48</b> is oriented with respect to the VR module <b>38</b>. The thermal interface material <b>86</b> may be mounted onto the lower surface <b>54</b> of the outer heat sink <b>50</b>. The VR module <b>38</b> is positioned such that the interface surface <b>80</b> of the VR module <b>38</b> engages the thermal interface material <b>86</b> and/or the lower surface <b>54</b>. The VR module <b>38</b> may be rigidly attached to the outer heat sink <b>50</b> with fasteners (not shown). The connectors <b>42</b> may be pre-mounted to the VR module <b>38</b> prior to mounting the VR module <b>38</b> onto the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. The CPU <b>32</b> is positioned onto the connectors <b>42</b> such that the integrated heat sink <b>34</b> is substantially aligned with the opening <b>40</b> in the VR module <b>38</b>. The fasteners <b>46</b> are then placed through the fastening bores <b>44</b>. As the fasteners <b>46</b> are tightened, the CPU <b>32</b> and the connectors <b>42</b> are seated and/or tightened to one another. In one embodiment, the CPU <b>32</b> may include a clamp plate (not shown) for applying an even normal force along the CPU <b>32</b> during tightening. Additionally, the tightening of the fasteners <b>46</b> engages the VR module <b>38</b> with the outer heat sink <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The above assembly is then positioned on the socket <b>16</b>. The fasteners <b>20</b> are then placed through the circuit board <b>18</b> and the fastening bores <b>62</b> of the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. The fasteners are tightened to achieve full compression of the socket contacts (not shown) with the CPU <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The inner heat sink <b>50</b> is then positioned within the opening <b>56</b> of the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. The thermal interface material <b>88</b> may be loaded onto the lower surface <b>54</b> of the inner heat sink <b>50</b> prior to positioning the inner heat sink <b>50</b> within the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. Once loaded, the inner heat sink <b>50</b> is surrounded by the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. In one embodiment, the load plate <b>68</b> and biasing members <b>72</b> are pre-attached to the inner heat sink <b>50</b>. When the inner heat sink <b>50</b> is inserted into the opening <b>56</b>, the load plate <b>68</b> is aligned with the fastening bores <b>62</b> of the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. Alternatively, the load plate <b>68</b> may be attached to the inner heat sink <b>50</b> after the inner heat sink <b>50</b> is loaded into the outer heat sink <b>48</b>. Once the load plate <b>68</b> is positioned with respect to the outer and inner heat sinks <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, the fasteners <b>70</b> are tightened until the desired normal forces between the components are achieved, and the inner heat sink <b>50</b> engages the integrated heat sink <b>34</b> of the CPU <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an alternative electronic assembly <b>100</b> in an assembled state. The electronic assembly <b>100</b> includes similar components to the embodiments described above. Like reference numerals are numbered the same as those described and shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The electronic assembly <b>100</b> includes an outer heat sink <b>102</b> and an inner heat sink <b>104</b>. The outer and inner heat sinks <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively, engage and are in thermal communication with the VR module <b>38</b> and the CPU <b>32</b>, respectively. Additionally, the outer and inner heat sinks <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively, engage and are in thermal communication with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The outer heat sink <b>102</b> includes a ledge or shoulder <b>106</b> extending substantially parallel to and spaced apart from the lower surface <b>52</b> of the outer heat sink <b>102</b>. Additionally, the inner heat sink <b>104</b> includes a ledge or shoulder <b>108</b> extending substantially parallel to and spaced apart from the lower surface <b>54</b> of the inner heat sink <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, each of the ledges <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> of the outer and inner heat sinks <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively, are in abutting contact with one another. In the exemplary embodiment, a plurality of biasing members <b>110</b>, such as, for example, springs, are positioned between the ledges <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> to provide a biasing force from the inner heat sink <b>104</b> to the outer heat sink <b>102</b>. The biasing members <b>110</b> provide a biasing force on the outer heat sink <b>102</b> to keep the outer heat sink <b>102</b> in thermal communication with the VR module <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The embodiments thus described provide an electronic assembly <b>10</b> including a heat sink assembly <b>12</b> for cooling multiple stacked IC components <b>14</b>. The heat sink assembly <b>12</b> includes an inner heat sink <b>50</b> that is encapsulated by an outer heat sink <b>48</b>. The heat sinks <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> are moveable with respect to one another and are oriented such that the lower surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> of the heat sinks <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> are vertically displaced from one another. As such, the heat sinks <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> may be in thermal communication with IC components <b>14</b> provided on multiple levels above a common side of a circuit board <b>18</b>. Specifically, the IC components may be vertically stacked with respect to one another wherein the IC components <b>14</b> at the higher level include access openings <b>40</b> that allow a heat sink <b>50</b> to extend through to engage the IC components <b>14</b> at a lower level. Accordingly, the overall size of the electronic assembly <b>10</b> may be reduced and the footprint defined by the electronic assembly <b>10</b> may also be reduced. Because the assembly <b>10</b> extends above only one side of the board <b>18</b>, and further because the inner heat sink <b>50</b> is received within the outer heat sink <b>48</b>, the assembly <b>10</b> has a lower vertical profile, measured perpendicularly from the surface of the board <b>18</b>, than known heat sink assemblies, thereby avoiding clearance issues when multiple circuit boards and components are utilized.</p>
