<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and a method of suppressing outstanding degradation of decoded audio quality due to a transmission error of audio coded data are provided without feedback information from a receiver, thereby reducing the increase of the number of necessary transmission bands and the arithmetic complexity on the receiving side. A code conversion and transmission apparatus <b>100</b> for inputting audio coded data includes first to N-th code conversion and transmission units <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to <b>106</b> for converting audio data to N pieces of coded data, and transmitting the data at predetermined or adaptively variable time intervals to M transmission lines <b>130</b>. The second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission units <b>104</b> to <b>106</b> codes a frame at a compression rate equal to or higher than the rate of input coded data. The code conversion and reception apparatus <b>120</b> selects a transmission line using a selection unit <b>107</b>, and selecting data from correctly received coded data in a frame or packet unit, thereby reconfiguring the coded data using a coded data reconfiguration unit <b>112. </b></p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional application of application Ser. No. 10/512,648 filed on Oct. 25, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,180,434.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an audio coded data transmission technology, and more specifically to a code conversion and transmission method for transmitting audio coded data, a code conversion and reception method for receiving coded and converted audio data, a system, an audio code conversion and transmission apparatus and a code conversion and reception apparatus, and a program executed by a computer for performing audio code conversion and transmission/audio code conversion and reception processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, a method for transmitting high-efficiency compression coded data based on a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) has been widely used as a method for efficiently transmitting audio data. In this method, an audio signal is divided into frames, the MDCT is performed on the frames, the number of quantization bits are assigned to an MDCT coefficient based on a psychological audio model, the MDCT coefficient is quantized and transmitted. Thus, audio data can be transmitted using a small number of transmission bands by efficiently compressing and coding data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical example is the MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group)-4 AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the conventional audio transmitting method, when a transmitted data error having long burst or a loss of a transmitted packet which are irrecoverable even by using an error-correcting code occurs, a receiver cannot correctly decode the audio data in the frame in which an error has occurred. A countermeasure of the receiver can be an error concealment method in which an error is replaced with an audio signal in a past frame for which data has been correctly decoded. However, in this case, the degradation of the sound quality cannot be avoided. When a coding efficiency is enhanced through intra-frame prediction of an MDCT coefficient, there occurs the problem that once arising degradation is propagated to the subsequent frames.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the multicast/broadcast information distribution, a receiver cannot transmit to a transmitter the information about an error of transmitted data or a loss of a transmitted packet. When a receiver feeds back error information to a transmitter, the bands are occupied by the feedback information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been developed to solve the above-mentioned problems, and first aims at providing an audio data code conversion and transmission method, reception method, apparatus, system, and program capable of suppressing the outstanding degradation of a decoded audio signal caused by a transmission error of audio coded data and received by the receiver down to an audibly tolerable level.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention second aims at providing an audio data code conversion and transmission method, reception method, apparatus, system, and program allowing a user to set the trade-off of the transmission band available in the transmission of audio data and audio quality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention third aims at providing an audio data code conversion and transmission method, reception method, apparatus, system, and program capable of preventing an increase in the arithmetic complexity required in decoding compressed audio coded data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention fourth aims at providing a method, apparatus, system, and program for attaining the first objective without transmitting the feedback information from a receiver to a transmitter.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the coded data reconfiguring procedure by the coded data reconfiguration unit <b>310</b>, in step S<b>406</b>, when a transmission error or a packet loss is detected in the coded data received in the third reception packet buffer, that is, when a transmission error or a packet loss has occurred in all the first to third coded data, the coded data reconfiguration unit <b>310</b> can take any other countermeasures.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the present embodiment, control is passed to step S<b>403</b>, and the first coded data is output as coded data to be decoded. However, for example, the output of the n-th frame can be suppressed, and the audio data in the (n−1)th frame which is output immediately before can be output as the n-th frame, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In a preferred practical example of the embodiment of the present invention, the code conversion and reception apparatus is connected to an Internet communications network, receives packet data transmitted using an RTP/UDP/IP protocol from the code conversion and transmission apparatus connected to the Internet communications network at another point, converts the audio coded data contained in the received UDP datagram, and outputs the result to a decoder. The audio coded data is in accordance with the MPEG-4 AAC system. The first error/packet loss detection unit <b>303</b>, the second error/packet loss detection unit <b>306</b>, and the third error/packet loss detection unit <b>309</b> can detect a transmission error by calculating the checksum included in the UDP datagram.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Furthermore, since the code conversion and reception apparatus only has to decode at least one piece of data in the three pieces of received coded data, the necessary arithmetic complexity does not greatly increase as compared with the normal audio coding apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(1.D) Transmission Mode of Coded Packet Data</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">According to the present invention, the first to second coded packet data can be transmitted in any method from the code conversion and transmission apparatus to the code conversion and reception apparatus. However, to enhance the effect of the present invention, a method in which the relation between a bit error and a packet loss occurring in the first coded packet data and a bit error and a packet loss occurring in the second coded packet data obtained by coding the same frame can be minimized is preferable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a preferable mode of transmitting coded packet data.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the reference numeral <b>501</b> denotes an audio code conversion apparatus which has been explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Delay addition units <b>502</b> and <b>503</b> add predetermined or adaptively variable delay time to the second and third coded packet data output from the audio code conversion apparatus <b>501</b>. A multiplexing unit <b>504</b> multiplexes the first coded data output from the audio code conversion apparatus <b>501</b> with the second coded data output from the delay addition unit <b>502</b> and the third coded data output from the delay addition unit <b>503</b>, and transmits the result to a transmission line. A transmission line <b>505</b> transmits the data multiplexed by the delay addition unit <b>503</b> from the transmission apparatus to the reception apparatus. Similarly, a multiplexing unit <b>508</b> and a transmission line <b>509</b> transmit the data to the second transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the delay addition units <b>502</b> and <b>503</b>, the delay time added to the second and third coded data depends on the maximum burst time of a bit error and a packet loss occurring in the transmission line <b>505</b>. The delay amount depends on the bit rate, the buffer size, etc. taken into account. Thus, even when a burst error occurs in the transmission line <b>505</b>, the probability that the first to third coded data can be affected by an influence of an error. Therefore, the outstanding degradation of sound quality due to a loss of frame coded data can be reduced. The longest burst time due to a packet loss depends on the actual measurement, etc., and the delay set by the delay addition unit is set based on the buffer size of a reception apparatus and a transfer rate (bit rate) of a transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Similarly, the delay time applied to the second to third coded data by delay addition units <b>506</b> and <b>507</b> depends on the maximum burst time of a bit error and a packet loss occurring in the transmission line <b>509</b>. Thus, even if a burst error occurs in the transmission line <b>509</b>, there is a small probability that the first to third coded data obtained by coding data in the same frame have an influence of the error. Therefore, the occurrence of outstanding degradation in audio quality due to a loss of frame coded data can be suppressed. The delay addition unit, or the delay addition unit and the multiplexing unit can be provided in the audio code conversion apparatus <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(1.E) Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">According to the first embodiment, the audio code conversion and transmission apparatus converts the same audio data into N pieces (N=3 in this example) of coded data, and transmits the resultant data at predetermined or adaptively variable time intervals. The first audio code conversion and transmission unit outputs input audio data frame by adaptively selecting depending on the characteristic of audio data or according to a predetermined rule. The second audio code conversion and transmission unit decodes input audio data, and outputs the decoded data by coding the data at a compression rate equal to or higher than the rate of the input data. The third audio code conversion and transmission unit codes a frame coded by the second audio code conversion and transmission unit.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The code conversion and reception apparatus receives data from at least one transmission line in the M units of transmission lines, selects coded data having a low compression rate and high audio quality frame by frame from the correctly received coded data, and outputs the selected data.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As a result, even when a less reliable transmission line in which high burst transmission error and packet loss frequently occur is used, the probability that N pieces of coded data are transmitted with errors can be reduced, and the outstanding degradation can be prevented from being generated in decoded audio quality after transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Furthermore, by enhancing the compression rate of the second to third coded data, the increase of transmission bands during the transmission of coded data can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Additionally, depending on the available band, the first to third coded data can be transmitted to a plurality of transmission lines having different bands, and the influence of an error in the transmission line can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to the present embodiment, the code conversion and transmission apparatus and the code conversion and reception apparatus are combined, but they can be independently used. The order of the packets of the first to N-th code converted data can be shuffled for multiplexing by an interleave method or the like.</p>

The second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means codes input frames, and the code conversion and reception apparatus selects the coded data having the lowest compression rate and enhanced audio quality from correctly received coded data from the M transmission lines in a frame or a packet unit, and then decoded.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">According to the present invention, the status of a transmission line or the transmission based on the intention of audio data transmitter can be reflected in the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">The reason is that, according to the present invention, using the first to M-th transmission lines, the compression rate of the first to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means can be selected depending on the band available in the transmission of audio data in each transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the increase of transmission rate by a plurality of coded data transmission processes can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Since, according to the present invention, second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means codes data at a compression rate equal to or higher than the rate of the first audio code conversion and transmission means. The transmission of coded data by the second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means can be performed only on the frame coded by the first audio code conversion and transmission means.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the increase of arithmetic complexity, which is required by a receiver, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">The reason is that the code conversion and transmission apparatus generates coded data including the same frames, and the code conversion and reception apparatus selects and decodes only one piece of data in a frame or a packet unit from plural pieces of received coded data. Therefore, it is not necessary for the code conversion and reception apparatus to decode plural pieces of received coded data.</p>
