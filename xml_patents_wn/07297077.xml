<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An exercise, practice, and training device has a transition piece adjustably connected to a distal end of a handle. An action receiving element is bendably connected to a distal portion of the transition piece and extends distally therefrom. The action receiving element is also connected to the transition piece by a biasing element that biases the action receiving element into alignment with the transition piece and enables bending during exercise, practice, and training by the user.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/529,054, flied Dec. 12, 2003 and entitled BAT EXERCISE, PRACTICE, AND TRAINING DEVICE, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention generally relates to an exercise, practice, and training device, and particularly to a bat exercise device that can be used for practice and training that can be used to improve bat swinging and hitting skills.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several devices have been devised for a variety of purposes including bat adjustability, increased hitting force, providing an audible sound during bat swinging, and other functions. However, the bat devices of the past appear to be deficient in providing a bat device that has a range of adjustability in bending of the bat for the purpose of exercise, practice, and training. The bat devices of the past appear to focus on a relatively narrow aspect of swinging or hitting, and are deficient in providing a practice device that adequately enables the method of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention overcomes these deficiencies and provides an exercise, practice, and training device that allows a more robust practice and training. For example, the bat device of the present invention has a range of adjustability in bending of the bat so that a user may selectively adjust the device to suit his or her needs. The adjustment may depend on a frequency of repeated actuations or swings. The user may also adjust the training device based on the swing weight of a non practice bat or other instrument, which he or she is preparing to use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exercise, practice, and training device in accordance with the present invention may have a handle for grasping by a user. A transition piece may be adjustably connected to the handle and extend distally therefrom. An action receiving element may be bendably connected to a distal portion of the transition piece and extend distally therefrom. The action receiving element may further be connected to the transition piece by at least one biasing element that generally biases the action receiving element into alignment with the transition piece yet that enables bending during exercise, practice, and training by the user. In one aspect, the exercise, practice, and training device is a bat device that has a range of adjustability in bending so that a user may selectively adjust the device to suit his or her needs. The device may also include a weight position adjustment mechanism and a handle length adjustment mechanism. Adjustments may be made depending on a frequency of repeated actuations or swings. The user may also adjust the training device based on a desired swing weight.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present invention relates to a bat exercise device. In a simple form, the bat exercise device of the present invention may include a handle having a knob at a proximal end of the handle. The handle may be adjustably connected to a transition piece. The transition piece may be pivotally connected to a barrel piece. A butt end of the device may be connected to a distal end of the barrel piece. The transition piece may also be connected to the barrel piece by at least one biasing element that urges the handle, the transition piece, and the barrel into generally longitudinally aligned orientations relative to each other. The at least one biasing element may include a plurality of tension/compression adjustable springs connected to the transition piece and to the barrel piece.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the present invention includes a method of teaching proper form, rhythm, and accuracy in using an instrument. The method may include the step of adjusting a spring tension of a spring connecting a transition piece to an action receiving element in a practice instrument. The method also may include repeatedly actuating the practice instrument by repeatedly bending the action receiving element relative to the transition piece. Use and repetition aid in an additional step of memorizing a feel associated with actuation of the practice instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">By repeatedly swinging the practice instrument user may create mind muscle memory (MMM), especially through high repetitions. For example, repetitions may be implemented in a range from approximately one repetition per one and a half second to approximately eight repetitions per second. Another narrower range of repetitions per second may be from approximately one repetition to approximately six repetitions per second. Although the frequency of repetitions may depend on the characteristics of the biasing element and the location of the center of gravity of the instrument and its components, a user may control the frequency of strokes as desired. A user may repeatedly and rhythmically swing the instrument to an ideal or “the ultimate” striking position. The user may stop the instrument at that point. Doing so causes a deceleration and forces corresponding to the magnitude of deceleration. Due to the bendability of the instrument, the distal end of the instrument moves by a whipping action into a flexed state. The user's mind and muscles experience the associated forces during this action. Exceedingly high forces can be generated by this action and high repetitions may be implemented both of which advantageously aid in development of the user's mind muscle memory. During this action the user experiences a unique whip feel. At the same time, the resistance that a user applies in order to stop the instrument at the ultimate striking position may result in transmission of the sensation of the resultant forces to the user's mind muscle memory. Stopping the instrument at the ultimate striking position works and strengthens the muscles in a first direction. Furthermore, by repeated swinging and returning the instrument to an initial position before a swing, the user may create the mind muscle memory and a unique balance of whip strength, fluidity, speed, timing and rhythm. By repeatedly returning the instrument from the ultimate striking position to an initial position, the muscles may be strengthened in a second opposite direction to provide greater muscle balance and integrity. By developing the mind muscle memory in this way a unique kind of muscle fiber and nerve response may be created, which is more balanced and has a more stable physical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Using a bat swing practice instrument, for example, may be used to strengthen and build a user's forearm muscles to an exceedingly great strength. However, using the instrument also may be used to develop the mind muscle memory of the user to provide proper firing sequences in the muscle systems throughout the body from the feet, up through the legs, hips, torso, shoulders, and arms. Thus, the instrument may be used to facilitate blending or bonding of correct form, balance, timing, rhythm, correct firing sequence, whip strength, fluid muscle action, ultimate strike position location, and accuracy into one homogenized mind muscle memory so that an excellent swing becomes simple and natural. As can be appreciated, repetitions and high repetitions are advantageous in this process. It is to be understood that such mind muscle memory and strengthening may be applied to other instruments and actions in a variety of athletic and other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The step of repeatedly actuating the practice instrument may further include practicing proper balance and mechanical form at selected frequencies of repetitions and developing control that may be applied to a non practice instrument. Furthermore, the step of repeatedly actuating the practice instrument may include building up quick twitch macro and micro muscle control and teaching a user's body a proper firing sequence for actuation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The step of adjusting the spring tension may include adjusting a resistance to bending of the action receiving element relative to the transition piece. The bat exercise device may include a weight adjustably mounted on the barrel piece for selective longitudinal positioning of the weight along the barrel piece. With a device including an adjustable weight, the method may include adjusting a position of a weight along a length of the action receiving element to simulate a particular non practice instrument. Alternatively, the device and method may include adjusting the size of the weight in addition or in place of adjusting its position. Additionally, the method may include adjusting a position of the handle relative to the transition piece to simulate a particular non practice instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an even more general aspect, the bat exercise device need not be configured to necessarily define the customary elements of a bat, such as a knob and/or transition piece. Rather, the bat exercise device of the present invention may simply be a device that is movable between a quiescent state and a flexed state and having a handle, a barrel piece, and a tension adjustable biasing element connecting the handle and the barrel piece that tends to maintain the handle and the barrel piece generally in the quiescent state. In this case, a tension varying force is necessary to transition from the quiescent state to a flexed state. This force may be provided by swinging the bat exercise device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is to be understood that the tension adjustable biasing element may comprise a single tension adjustable spring connected to the handle and to the barrel piece. Alternatively, the tension adjustable spring may be one of a plurality of tension adjustable springs and the biasing element may include the plurality of tension adjustable springs connected to the handle to the barrel piece.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this aspect, a weight may be mounted on the barrel piece. The weight may be adjustably mounted on the barrel piece for selective and advantageous longitudinal positioning of the weight along the barrel piece. The weight possibilities set forth with regard to other aspects above may be applied equally well to this simplified aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, the adjustable biasing element may provide an adjustable resistance to bending from the quiescent state to the flexed state in a range from approximately one half foot pound to approximately 500 foot pounds of torque. Alternatively, the adjustable resistance may be kept to a narrower range from approximately one half foot pound to approximately 20 foot pounds of torque. These ranges may be for the initial force required to begin moving the instrument into the flexed state. This initial force corresponds to the initial deflection of the spring from its position when the instrument is in its quiescent state. Springs typically require more force as they are further deflected. Thus, the forces present in and required for further deflection once in the flexed state may be much greater than those of the ranges set forth above. These forces are dependent, in part, on the spring characteristics of the particular springs of the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this aspect, the handle may be a length adjustable handle for enabling a user to selectively adjust a length of the handle. With regard to the handle and all other elements of the invention in this simplified aspect, the above described method may be applied. In this regard, the transition piece may be considered to be part of the handle so that the steps of the method may be carried out by applying a swinging force to the handle, which actuates the biasing element and flexes the barrel piece relative to the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a simple form, the method of teaching proper form, rhythm, and accuracy in using an instrument may include the step of adjusting a torque requirement for moving a first portion of the instrument from a quiescent state to a flexed state relative to a second portion thereof. The method may further include repeatedly actuating the practice instrument by repeatedly flexing the second portion relative to the first portion. The step of adjusting the torque requirement may be achieved by adjusting a resistance to bending in a third portion of the instrument between the first portion and the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The foregoing and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the particular embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed above, embodiments of the present invention relate to bat exercise, practice, and training device. In accordance with an example of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a bat device <b>10</b> having a handle <b>15</b>, a transition piece <b>20</b>, and a barrel piece <b>25</b>. The handle has a knob <b>30</b> fixed at a proximal end thereof, and the barrel piece <b>25</b> has a butt end <b>35</b> at a distal end thereof. The transition piece <b>20</b> connects the handle <b>15</b> to the barrel piece <b>25</b>. Thus, the bat device <b>10</b> has a handle <b>15</b>, transition piece <b>20</b>, and barrel piece <b>25</b> corresponding to those elements found on a conventional bat. Therefore, the bat device <b>10</b> may be grasped and swung as an exercise, practice, and/or training device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The handle <b>15</b> is adjustably mounted on the transition piece <b>20</b> by a handle nut <b>40</b>. In order to adjust the handle, a user loosens the nut <b>40</b> and slides the handle <b>15</b> axially relative to the transition piece <b>20</b>. Then the user tightens the handle nut <b>40</b> to secure the handle <b>15</b> relative to the transition piece <b>20</b>. As may be appreciated, a distal end of the handle <b>15</b> may have slots. These slots may be surrounded by the handle nut <b>40</b> in order to enable the material at the distal end of the handle <b>15</b> to be resiliently collapsed to engage the transition piece <b>20</b> when the handle nut <b>40</b> is tightened. This tightening may be accomplished by threads on the interior of the handle nut <b>40</b> and on the exterior of the handle <b>15</b>, which engage each other during tightening and loosening of the nut <b>40</b> on the handle <b>15</b>. Alternatively, spring biased pins or detents may be provided on one of the handle <b>15</b> and the transition piece <b>20</b>, and apertures or receivers may be provided on the other of the handle <b>15</b> and the transition piece in order to receive the pins or detents and provide a locking mechanism that holds the handle <b>15</b> in one of a plurality of discrete positions relative to the transition piece <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The transition piece <b>20</b> is pivotally or bendably connected to the barrel piece <b>25</b> by a bending or pivot connection <b>45</b>. The barrel piece <b>25</b> is held in a generally aligned position relative to a longitudinal axis <b>47</b> of the handle and the transition piece <b>20</b> by a pair of biasing elements <b>50</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the biasing elements <b>50</b> are shown as a pair of helical compression springs. However, it is to be understood that the biasing elements may be provided by any of a variety of compression, tension, or torsion springs. For example, the biasing elements <b>50</b> could be replaced by one or more polymeric material elements. The springs could be provided by one or more helical tension springs. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention may include adjustment bolts <b>55</b> operably associated with the compression springs <b>50</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adjustment bolts <b>55</b> may be tightened or loosened in order to adjust the amount of tension or compressive force is stored in the springs <b>50</b>. It is to be understood that the term tension as used herein refers generally to tension, compression, or torsional forces of springs that have been moved out of their quiescent state of minimum potential energy. By adjusting the tension in the springs <b>50</b>, a resistance to bending or pivotal movement of the barrel <b>25</b> out of alignment with the longitudinal axis <b>47</b> may be adjusted. That is, as the stiffness in the springs <b>50</b> is increased, the resistance against movement out of alignment with the longitudinal axis <b>47</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A weight <b>60</b> may be adjustably mounted on the barrel piece <b>25</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the weight <b>60</b> is slidably mounted on the barrel piece <b>25</b>. A weight bolt <b>65</b> may extend through the weight and hold the weight at a selected longitudinal position on the barrel piece <b>25</b>. In this way, a user may selectively adjust the swing weight of the bat device. Generally, the swing weight is increased as the weight <b>60</b> is moved distally along the barrel piece <b>25</b>. As may be appreciated, a greater swing weight will tend to cause a greater reaction in the biasing elements <b>50</b> during swinging. Thus, a desired response in the device <b>10</b> may be achieved by adjusting both the tension in the biasing elements <b>50</b> and the position of the weight <b>60</b> along the barrel piece <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Adjustment of the biasing elements <b>50</b> provides a resistance to bending in a range that is useful for exercise, practice, and training with the device <b>10</b> of the present invention. The biasing elements <b>50</b> may be adjustable to provide resistance in a full range from approximately ½ foot pound of torque to approximately 200 foot pounds of torque about a pivot point of the pivot connection <b>45</b>. For the bat device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the resistance may be adjusted in a smaller range from approximately ½ foot pound to approximately 20 foot pounds of torque about the pivot axis of the pivot connection <b>45</b>. A range from ¼ foot pound to approximately 500 foot pounds is also within the spirit and scope of the present invention. It is to be understood that the resistance referred to herein is an initial resistance when the bat device <b>10</b> is in a quiescent state with the handle <b>15</b> and the barrel piece <b>25</b> in generally longitudinally aligned positions relative to each other. It is further to be understood that as the barrel piece <b>25</b> is moved out of alignment relative to the handle <b>15</b>, the resistance will generally grow progressively greater as the biasing elements <b>50</b> are tensioned to a greater degree. By pretensioning the biasing elements <b>50</b>, the progression of resistance may be selectively adjusted. Alternatively or additionally, a variety of interchangeable biasing element having a variety of spring characteristics may be provided for selectively replacing the biasing elements <b>50</b>. It is to be understood that one of the biasing elements <b>50</b> may be pretensioned to a greater or lesser degree or may be replaced so that the barrel piece may be moved out of the quiescent state more easily in one direction than the other. This configuration could be effectuated in order to advantageously work and strengthen a targeted set of muscles in a user. To do this may be desirable when the user needs to strengthen the muscles that move the bat device <b>10</b> in one direction more than he/she needs to strengthen the muscles that move the bat device in the other direction along a swing path, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Other devices or practice instruments may be provided with similar biasing mechanisms. Depending on a particular application of the practice instrument, the range of resistance may be selectively chosen. For example, with an instrument configured to practice a tennis swing, a range of smaller torque resistances may be provided. On the other hand, a biasing mechanism in accordance with the present invention as applied to a bow practice instrument may be provided with torque resistances in a range including higher values of torque. Other applications for the biasing mechanism of the present invention may include golf and hockey practice instruments. The adjustability of the handle relative to a transition piece and/or the adjustability of a weight may be applied similarly to any of the applications in which the present invention may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view taken along line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows some features of the bat device in greater detail. For example, a telescoping relationship between the handle <b>15</b> and the transition piece <b>20</b> is clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At a distal end of the handle <b>15</b>, the handle nut <b>40</b> may force portions of the handle <b>15</b> radially inward to engage the transition piece <b>20</b> when the nut <b>40</b> is tighten. At a proximal end of the transition piece <b>20</b> a spacer <b>70</b> may be provided to take up slack between an inner dimension of the handle <b>15</b> and an outer dimension of the transition piece <b>20</b>. As may be appreciated, by loosening the nut <b>40</b> the handle <b>15</b> may be slidably adjusted along the transition piece <b>20</b> in a longitudinal direction. Then the handle <b>15</b> may be tightened in a desired relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows the biasing elements <b>50</b> and housings <b>75</b> in which the biasing elements are retained in greater detail. A distal end of each of the housings <b>75</b> provides a fixed stop <b>80</b> for each of the biasing elements <b>50</b>. Respective washers or other plug elements positioned generally toward a proximal end of the housings <b>75</b> form respective adjustable spring stops <b>85</b>. Respective cables <b>90</b> may be fixed to the adjustable spring stops <b>85</b> at a proximal end of the cables <b>90</b> and fixed to respective adjustment bolts <b>55</b> at distal ends of the cables <b>90</b>. The adjustment bolts <b>55</b> may be mounted on the barrel piece <b>25</b> by guide studs <b>95</b>. The adjustment bolts <b>55</b> may be moved axially relative to the guide studs <b>95</b>. However, threaded studs <b>100</b> may be fixed either to the guide studs <b>95</b> or directly to the barrel piece <b>25</b>. Thus, adjustment of the guide bolts <b>55</b> relative to the threaded studs <b>100</b> and the barrel piece <b>25</b> may be implemented to cause adjustment of the cable <b>90</b> and the adjustable spring stops <b>85</b>. In this way, the housings <b>75</b> may act as cylindrical spring housings. The stops <b>80</b> at distal end of the housings may act as fixed spring stops and the adjustable spring stops <b>85</b> may be moved axially within the spring housings <b>75</b> to provide a desired compression in the springs <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, movement of the adjustment bolts <b>55</b> in a distal direction causes compression of the biasing elements <b>50</b> via the cables <b>90</b>. Thus, resistance to bending at the pivot connection <b>47</b><i>a </i>may be increased or decreased as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the weight bolt <b>65</b> and a weight fixing element <b>105</b>. As may be appreciated, tightening of the weight bolt <b>65</b> may be implemented to cause the weight fixing element <b>105</b> to be canted relative to the barrel piece <b>25</b>. In this canted position, the weight fixing element <b>105</b> engages or bites into a surface of the barrel piece and fixes the weight <b>60</b> on the barrel piece <b>25</b>. This fixing may be provided by a friction force or an actual mechanical interference between the weight fixing element <b>105</b> and the barrel piece <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of the bat device <b>10</b> taken along lines <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the pivot connection <b>47</b><i>a </i>in greater detail. In particular, a bracket <b>110</b> may be integrally formed with the transition piece. This bracket <b>110</b> may have through holes for receiving a pin <b>115</b>. A nose piece <b>120</b> may be integrally formed with the barrel piece <b>25</b>. The nose piece <b>120</b> may also have a through hole pivotally engaged by the pin <b>115</b>. As may be appreciated, the positions of the bracket <b>110</b> and the nose piece <b>120</b> may be interchanged without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the pivot connection may be located more proximally for a different feel in the practice instrument during use.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a diagrammatic side view of another embodiment of a bat device <b>122</b> in accordance with the present invention. A pivot connection may be provided by a pin <b>125</b>. Adjustment bolts <b>130</b>, cables <b>135</b>, biasing elements <b>140</b>, and housings <b>145</b> may be provided as shown to function similarly to analogous elements shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. Similarly, a weight <b>150</b> may be adjustably mounted on the barrel piece <b>155</b>. The barrel piece may include a general tension adjustment mechanism <b>158</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> as including a threaded portion <b>160</b>. An adjustable collar <b>165</b> may be adjustably supported on the threaded portion <b>160</b>. The collar <b>165</b> may support a bracket <b>170</b> that in turn supports distal ends of the cables <b>135</b> on the barrel piece <b>155</b>. Thus, the general adjustment mechanism <b>158</b> permits adjustment of both cables <b>135</b> simultaneously, while the adjustment bolts <b>130</b> enable selective adjustment of the cables <b>135</b> individually. It is to be understood that a handle <b>175</b> may be a non-adjustable handle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, or it may be provided as an adjustable handle as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a diagrammatic side view of another embodiment of a bat device <b>180</b> in accordance with the present invention. Like the previously described embodiments, the bat device <b>180</b> may include a weight <b>150</b> that is adjustable along a barrel piece <b>185</b> and a handle <b>190</b>. The handle <b>190</b> may be connected to the barrel piece <b>185</b> by a plurality of biasing elements <b>195</b> and cables <b>197</b>. As shown, the biasing elements may be disposed on opposite sides of a central longitudinal axis of the device <b>180</b>, and may comprise two or more biasing elements <b>195</b> generally spaced around the central axis. An additional biasing element <b>200</b> and an additional cable <b>203</b> may be centered on the central longitudinal axis. Notably, there may be no discrete pivot axis provided by the connection of the handle <b>190</b> to the barrel piece <b>185</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Rather, the biasing elements <b>195</b>, <b>200</b> and the cables <b>197</b>, <b>203</b> may provide the only connection as a flexible connection that will bend about a constructive pivot axis that is a function of the spring characteristics of the biasing elements <b>195</b> and/or <b>200</b>, the placement and orientation of the biasing elements <b>195</b> and/or <b>200</b>, and the structure that holds the biasing elements to the barrel piece <b>185</b> and the handle <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown, a handle bracket <b>206</b> may have seats for receiving proximal ends of the biasing elements <b>195</b> and/or <b>200</b>. The device <b>180</b> may include a general adjustment mechanism <b>209</b> similar to that shown and described with regard to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. An adjustable bracket <b>212</b> may be adjustably supported on a threaded portion <b>215</b> of the barrel <b>185</b> by a collar <b>218</b> similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> described above. The adjustable bracket <b>212</b> may have seats for receiving distal ends of the biasing elements <b>195</b> and/or <b>200</b>. When the bat device <b>180</b> does not have a discrete pivot axis, provided by a pivot pin for example, adjustment of the collar <b>218</b> and adjustable bracket <b>212</b> along the threaded portion <b>215</b> will result in moving the barrel piece <b>185</b> along the longitudinal axis in a lengthening or shortening direction. When the additional biasing element <b>200</b> is included, adjustment of the adjustable bracket <b>212</b> will also adjust a tension in the additional biasing element <b>200</b>, which will cause a more or less stiff response to bending. Similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the bat device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> may include adjustment bolts <b>221</b> connected to distal ends of the cables <b>197</b> for individual adjustment of the biasing elements <b>195</b>. Thus, the adjustable bracket <b>212</b> may have internal threads that receive the adjustment bolts <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C-4D</figref> show another embodiment of a bat device <b>224</b> in accordance with the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a first diagrammatic side view of the bat device <b>224</b> and shows a weight <b>227</b>, an adjustment mechanism <b>230</b>, biasing elements <b>233</b> in housings <b>236</b> similar to features shown and described in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4B</figref> above. The device <b>224</b> has a pivot mechanism <b>239</b> having pivot pins <b>242</b> and pivot arms <b>245</b> pivotally mounted on the pivot pins <b>242</b> and defining a pivot axis <b>246</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a front diagrammatic view of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The pivot mechanism <b>239</b>, and the pivot arms <b>245</b> in particular, connect a handle <b>248</b> to a barrel piece <b>251</b>. The pivot arms <b>245</b> are much longer than analogous parts of the bat device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The longer arms <b>245</b> and the more proximally located pivot pins <b>242</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref> have the advantage of enabling a larger range of motion for the barrel piece during use. Relatedly, the mechanical advantage is shifted toward the distal end so that the barrel piece <b>251</b> and the associated weight have a much greater influence on the motion during back and forth movement than when a pivot axis is more distally located. The distal ends of the pivot arms <b>245</b> may be fixed to the barrel piece <b>251</b> to move therewith during use.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As with the previously described embodiments, cables <b>254</b> are connected at distal ends thereof to an adjustable bracket <b>257</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>230</b> and to adjustable stops <b>269</b> at proximal ends thereof to help control the movement of the device. As described with regard to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the device <b>224</b> has an adjustment collar <b>263</b> that adjustably supports the adjustable bracket on a threaded portion <b>266</b> of the barrel piece <b>251</b> for threadedly adjusting a position of the adjustable bracket <b>257</b> along the barrel piece <b>251</b>. This adjustment is a general adjustment that affects both of the biasing elements <b>233</b> at the same time. A specific adjustment mechanism may be separately applied to each of the cables <b>254</b> for selective adjustment of each of the cables <b>254</b> and associated biasing elements <b>233</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, rollers or other friction reducing elements may be provided at distal ends of the housings <b>236</b> on opposite sides of the cables <b>254</b> to reduce friction on the cables <b>254</b> as the barrel piece <b>251</b> is moved back and forth. As may be appreciated, the forward cable <b>254</b>, forward housing <b>236</b>, and associated connections have been omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> for clarity. As shown in dashed lines at <b>272</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the cable <b>254</b> may be moved to a greater or lesser degree corresponding to a particular range of motion of the barrel piece <b>251</b> during a particular use. Furthermore, the housings <b>236</b> may be angled to a greater or lesser degree to provide a variety of “feels” that may be suited to a particular user and/or exercise. In this regard, the housings may lie at an angle in a range from zero to thirty degrees relative to a central longitudinal axis <b>275</b>. A more narrow range of angles at which the housings <b>236</b> may lie may be from ten to twenty degrees relative to the central longitudinal axis <b>275</b>. The housings could be made adjustable so that a user can selectively move the housings to desired positions and lock them therein by a detent or other locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The bat device <b>224</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref> may also include a resilient weight biasing element <b>278</b> that urges the weight <b>227</b> into a quiescent weight position on the barrel piece <b>251</b>. However, when the bat device is swung, the weight <b>227</b> will dynamically move distally and/or proximally. The weight controlled by the weight biasing element <b>278</b> moves to increase or decrease a swing weight commensurate with a centrifugal force applied to the bat device <b>224</b>. This arrangement may be applied to any of the embodiments herein and may have the advantage of increasing the force required to effectively move the bat back and forth commensurate with the speed of the swing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view of a bat device <b>281</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The device <b>281</b> has a handle <b>284</b>, a barrel piece <b>287</b>, a biasing element <b>290</b>, and a cable <b>293</b> that function generally analogously to the embodiments shown and described above. The bat device <b>281</b> is particularly similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The biasing element <b>290</b> and the cable <b>293</b> may connect the barrel piece <b>287</b> to the handle <b>284</b> and may help to control relative movement between the handle <b>284</b> and the barrel piece <b>287</b> during use. As with the other embodiments, the bat device <b>281</b> may be swung back and forth through a selected portion of a full swing. When a direction of the swing is reversed, the biasing element <b>290</b> bends under the force of momentum of the barrel piece <b>287</b>. The result is that the barrel piece <b>287</b> may be moved back and forth through a range of motion relative to the handle <b>284</b> as indicated by positions of the barrel piece <b>287</b> shown in the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A weight <b>296</b> similar to any of those shown and described above may be supported on the barrel piece to adjustably or variably provide different swing weights.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view taken along lines <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing additional details. For example, a distal end of the cable may be anchored in the barrel piece <b>287</b> by a retaining block <b>299</b> that may be slidably received and secured inside the barrel piece <b>287</b> by an anchor bolt <b>302</b>. As shown, a variety of pairs of bolt holes through the barrel piece may enable selective positioning of the retaining block <b>299</b>. The securing block may have a reentrant recess <b>307</b> for receiving a cable nut or other stop element <b>308</b> fixed to a distal end of the cable <b>293</b>. The retaining block <b>299</b> with its reentrant structure and the stop element <b>308</b> may form a positive stop that prevents movement of the cable in a proximal direction when the stop element <b>308</b> is in the recess <b>307</b>. The retaining block may also include a slit <b>314</b> through which the cable <b>293</b> may be slid to easily remove the stop element <b>308</b> from the reentrant recess <b>307</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, this slit <b>314</b> only opens out through a surface that is unobstructed when the retaining block <b>299</b> is removed from the interior of the barrel piece <b>287</b>. Thus, an anchor structure for a distal end of the cable <b>293</b> may be exceedingly secure when the retaining block <b>299</b> is bolted in position within the barrel piece <b>287</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a proximal end of the cable <b>293</b> may be adjustably secured in the handle <b>284</b> by a tension adjustment mechanism <b>316</b> having an adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> that adjustably engages a retaining sleeve <b>320</b>. A proximal cable nut or stopping element <b>324</b> may be fixed to a proximal end of the cable <b>293</b> for positive stopping engagement on a proximal end of the retaining sleeve <b>320</b> to secure the proximal end of the cable <b>293</b> in the handle at an adjusted position against movement in a distal direction. The retaining sleeve <b>320</b> may have external threads <b>330</b> and one or more flats <b>333</b> on an outer surface thereof, as shown in the detailed perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> may be fixed to a knob <b>327</b> by a knob screw <b>329</b> or other fixing mechanism. The adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> may have internal threads <b>336</b> for adjustable engagement by the retaining sleeve <b>320</b>. One or more holding screws <b>339</b> may be received through the handle <b>284</b> and lightly engage or be slightly spaced from respective flats <b>333</b> on the retaining sleeve <b>320</b>. In this way, the holding screws <b>339</b> may prevent the retaining screw from turning while the knob <b>327</b> and the adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> are being rotated during adjustment. Thus, the knob <b>327</b> may be rotated to cause the retaining sleeve to threadedly advance in proximal or distal directions within the handle <b>284</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cable <b>293</b> may extend through the biasing element <b>290</b> and hold the biasing element against radial movement from between the handle <b>284</b> and the barrel piece <b>287</b>. A first biasing element seat <b>342</b> may be received in a proximal end of the barrel piece <b>287</b> and a second biasing element seat <b>345</b> may be received in a distal end of the handle <b>284</b>. The first biasing element seat <b>342</b> may include a first biasing element sleeve <b>348</b> and a first blocking element <b>351</b> that rests on a step of the first biasing element sleeve <b>348</b>. Likewise, the second biasing element seat <b>345</b> may include a second biasing element sleeve <b>354</b> and a second blocking element <b>357</b> that rests on a step of the second biasing element sleeve <b>354</b>. The biasing element may thus be received at least partially into the respective biasing element sleeves <b>348</b> and <b>354</b>, and held against distal and proximal movement by the blocking members <b>351</b> and <b>357</b>. With the bat device <b>281</b> assembled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the user may exercise, practice, and/or train by moving the device <b>281</b> back and forth along segments of a full swing path. For a more stiff bending response to swinging, the user may either tighten the assembly by rotating the adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> and the knob <b>327</b> to draw the retaining sleeve <b>320</b> distally and to compress the biasing element <b>290</b>, replace the biasing element <b>290</b> with a stiffer biasing element, or both. Likewise, a more flexible or easily bendable response may be achieved by adjusting the bat device in the opposite direction and/or by replacing the biasing element with a softer biasing element. It is to be understood that one or more bearings may be placed between the adjuster sleeve and the handle to reduce friction for greater ease of adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a side sectional view of another embodiment of a bat device <b>390</b> in accordance with the present invention. The side sectional view of the bat device <b>390</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is similar to the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The bat device <b>390</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may also include pivot arms <b>391</b> and a pivot connection <b>392</b> similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>. Hence, a front view of the bat device <b>390</b> showing the pivot arms <b>391</b> and pivot connection has been omitted for efficiency. On the other hand, the bat device <b>390</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may have a housing <b>393</b> for surrounding a biasing element <b>396</b>. The housing <b>393</b> may be provided by a portion of a barrel piece <b>399</b>. Furthermore, a spring tension adjustment mechanism <b>400</b> may be provided in a handle <b>401</b> by structure similar to the tension adjustment mechanism <b>316</b> shown and described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In fact, the tension adjustment mechanism <b>400</b> may have an adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> that adjustably engages a retaining sleeve <b>320</b>. A proximal cable nut or stopping element <b>324</b> may be fixed to a proximal end of a cable <b>404</b> for positive stopping engagement on a proximal end of the retaining sleeve <b>320</b> to secure the proximal end of the cable <b>293</b> in the handle at an adjusted position against movement in a distal direction. The retaining sleeve <b>320</b> may have external threads <b>330</b> and one or more flats <b>333</b> on an outer surface thereof, as shown in the detailed perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> may be fixed to a knob <b>327</b> by a knob screw <b>329</b> or other fixing mechanism and may have internal threads <b>336</b> for adjustable engagement by the retaining sleeve <b>320</b>. One or more holding screws <b>339</b> may be received through the handle <b>284</b> and lightly engage or be slightly spaced from respective flats <b>333</b> on the retaining sleeve <b>320</b>. In this way, the holding screws <b>339</b> may prevent the retaining screw from turning while the knob <b>327</b> and the adjuster sleeve <b>317</b> are being rotated during adjustment. Thus, the knob <b>327</b> may be rotated to cause the retaining sleeve to threadedly advance in proximal or distal directions within the handle <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A positive stop for the biasing element <b>396</b> may be positioned within the barrel piece <b>399</b> at a proximal end of the biasing element <b>396</b> for limiting movement of the biasing element in a proximal direction. The positive stop may include one or more pins <b>407</b> and/or a washer element <b>410</b> for holding the biasing element <b>396</b> in the housing <b>393</b>. The cable <b>404</b> may extend from the stopping element <b>324</b> on its proximal end, through the retaining sleeve <b>320</b> and a distal portion of the handle <b>401</b>, out of the handle <b>401</b> and into the barrel piece <b>399</b>, through the positive stop and the biasing element <b>396</b> in the housing <b>393</b>. The cable may be slidably disposed in the positive stop. A distal end of the cable <b>404</b> may be retained against a distal end of the biasing element <b>396</b> by a distal cable stopping element <b>413</b>. The pivot connection may be located on the handle at a position proximal to a distal end of the handle <b>401</b> at which the cable <b>404</b> exits the handle <b>401</b>. Thus, as the barrel piece <b>399</b> and the pivot arms <b>391</b> are pivoted relative to the handle <b>401</b>, tension in the cable <b>404</b> is increased, and a distal end of the cable <b>404</b> is drawn proximally along the barrel piece against the bias of the biasing element <b>396</b>. The distal stopping element <b>413</b> compresses the biasing element <b>396</b> during such bending of the bat device. Rollers <b>419</b> or other friction reducing elements may be placed at exit and entry ends of the handle <b>401</b> and barrel piece <b>399</b> to slidably or rollably engage the cable <b>404</b> and provide a smooth action during back and forth movement of the barrel piece <b>399</b>. As shown by arrow <b>416</b>, the bat device <b>390</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may thus be used in the same way as the other embodiments described herein for smooth resilient back and forth movement during practice, exercise, and/or training. As described above, a weight <b>422</b> may be adjustably or resiliently provided on the barrel piece.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown and described in U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/529,054, flied Dec. 12, 2003 and entitled BAT EXERCISE, PRACTICE, AND TRAINING DEVICE the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety, the various embodiments of the present invention may include any of a variety of mechanisms for creating an audible click at the ultimate striking position. The mechanism may be configured so that when the user decelerates the instrument, the mechanism produces the audible sound. Thus, the user may strengthen the muscles that control the instrument and memorize the position at which a ball will strike the instrument, for example. Therefore, the audible click devices of the present invention may provide an audio sensory system that may help to embed another mind muscle memory into the user. That is, the audible click at the ultimate striking position may be implemented to help the user develop and memorize proper timing, rhythm, and feel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also shown and described in the provisional application, the embodiments of the present invention may include slidably or otherwise longitudinally adjustable hinge elements. As may be appreciated, these hinge elements may be slid in channels on the barrel and handle portions of a bat swing practice instrument, for example, to provide for positioning of the hinge with respect to the rest of the instrument. Adjustment of the hinge elements may also be implemented to provide a greater or lesser range of motion for the hinge. This in turn may provide a selectively variable angular feel during repeated forward and rearward motion or whipping of the instrument. Lengthening or shortening the handle/transition and/or barrel piece relative to the pivot axis may effectively increase or decrease resistance of the swing motion. This may be useful, for example, in providing a user with a longer or a shorter swing motion respectively for practicing different swings and different frequencies of back and forth movement of the instrument along the swing path.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further shown and described in the provisional application to which this application claims priority, cable stabilizers that may extend transverse to the longitudinal axis of the instruments through the pivot points thereof may be applied to any of the embodiments of the present invention. These cable stabilizers help maintain cable line integrity. These stabilizers may be fixedly or rotatably connected to a pivot pins at the pivot axes of the hinges. The stabilizers may help to improve the flex feel that the user experiences. The cable stabilizers may also reduce the change in length of the springs by constraining the path of the cables. This path constraint by the cable stabilizers may also improve angles at which the cables enter the spring cylinders. That is, the entry angle of the cable may be kept straighter, which may provide a smoother feel to the user. Pulleys or other friction reducing elements may be used in the cable stabilizers and/or at other locations to further improve the smoothness with which the cables travel along their respective paths.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagrammatic perspective view of a user <b>360</b> practicing a method in accordance with the present invention. The user <b>360</b> may use a device <b>281</b> or any other embodiment as desired. The user may then stand in a batting posture as shown. The user may select a segment of the full swing that he/she desires to practice and move the bat back and forth along the swing path in the selected segment. For example, the user may select a segment corresponding to the ultimate striking position. By generating a fluid back and forth motion which maintaining a perfect strike form, the muscles, nerves, and brain all repeatedly experience the forces and responses associated with the perfect striking form. Mind muscle memory is thus built up and reinforced and the user <b>360</b> has the opportunity to strengthen the muscles for greater strength and a more powerful swing and striking force. The method may include adjusting weight magnitudes and/or positions on the device. The method may also include selecting and/or adjusting the spring stiffness of a biasing element in the device. These steps may help to establish a metronomic flex frequency. Different metronomic flex frequencies may be used to improve hitting skills and strength for a variety of different pitches including fast balls and curve balls. The method may be used to practice different strokes for different pitches and to establish or improve sweet spot hitting for different strokes of portions of a stroke in swinging a bat. The method may include practicing in a segment of a full swing for the purpose of developing a “snap” feel of a good power stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the method entails actuating a practice, exercise, or training device such as device <b>281</b> in a back and forth motion. During the “forth” portion of the motion certain muscles may be predominantly flexed while opposite muscles may be flexed in the “back” portion of the motion. For example, in the “forth” portion of the motion, regions <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> on the right hand side of the may be actuated in sequence to produce the desired stroke. Corresponding regions on the opposite side of the body may be sequentially actuated during the “back” portion of the motion. Precisely which muscles that are actuated in these regions and to what extent may depend on the particular stance or position of the body and the stroke being implemented. However generally, the sequence will be from the feet, up through the trunk, through the arms, and to the hands. The region labeled <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> may represent the actuation of the foot, ankle, and calf. Region <b>2</b> may represent the actuation of the knee, thigh, and hamstring. Region <b>3</b> may represent actuation of the buttocks and hip. Region <b>4</b> may represent actuation of the latisimus dorsi and the trunk muscles in general. Region <b>5</b> may represent actuation of the shoulder. Region <b>6</b> may represent the actuation of the triceps and biceps muscles. Region <b>7</b> may represent the actuation of the fore arm and the wrist. A user practicing the method may feel the sequence of muscle actuation in his or her own body from region <b>1</b> through region <b>7</b> during each half stroke in the segment of the swing path being trained. Advantageously, the user may select a target on which to focus to emulate focusing during actual hitting. The resulting exercise is holistic because the back and forth motion exercises the muscles in both push and pull mode of actuation for the segment of the full swing being practiced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The method with back and forth motions as described, also encompasses strengthening micro and macro muscle mind memory. The micro muscle and mind memory may be considered to include joint, tendon, and muscle connections and fibers, and deals with quick twitch muscle fibers. The method entrains the mind and muscle memory of a perfect stroke form through high repetitions. When combined with the macro aspects of the stroke, the method may entrain rhythm skill in muscle and mind memory. On the micro and macro levels, the method of the present invention may facilitate entraining exact timing and firing sequences for the perfect deployment of power to a specific position in space at a specific moment in time by repeating the motion over and over. With the method of the present invention, all the right muscles of the body become aligned as one to execute the strokes and repeatedly actuate in their proper sequence. The method may also include a balanced combination of power, rhythm, timing, and precision.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11D</figref> are diagrammatical top views of the user taken in a direction of arrow <b>363</b> showing a swing path and back and forth motions or strokes in a variety of segments along the swing path. It is to be understood that a back and forth motion may be implemented along any segment of any swing path in accordance with the methods of the present invention. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a full swing as indicated by arcuate arrow <b>366</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows a segment from a starting position of a swing to a slightly dropped position in the early part of a swing. The small double headed arrow <b>369</b> represents the back and forth motion of the device under control of the user <b>360</b>. The larger arrows <b>372</b> and <b>375</b> represent the amplified back and forth motion of a barrel piece during practice of the present method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> shows back and forth motions at a generally intermediate segment of the full swing. The smaller double headed arrow <b>378</b> represents the back and forth motion of the device caused by the user <b>360</b> practicing the method. The larger double headed arrow <b>381</b> represents the amplified back and forth motion of the barrel piece. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> shows a user <b>360</b> practicing his stroke in a segment near an end of his swing. Once again, the smaller double headed arrow <b>384</b> represents the motion imparted to a device by the user <b>360</b>. The larger double headed arrow <b>387</b> represents the amplified motion of the barrel piece. Amplifying the motion of the barrel piece and associated components also amplifies the forces experienced by the user. By repeated back and forth motion, the user is required to control these amplified motions. The result is an increased sensory experience that enhances the process of building muscle and mind memory in accordance with the method of the present invention.</p>
