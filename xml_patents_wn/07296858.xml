<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Italian Patent Application Number T02004A 000815, filed on Nov. 19, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an armrest assembly for a vehicle, e.g. bus, seat.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An armrest assembly comprises a fastening plate connected laterally to a bus seat; and a rotary armrest hinged to the fastening plate and movable between a work position, in which the armrest supports the passenger's arm, and a collapsed position, in which the armrest is rotated towards a seat portion of the seat to allow the passenger to exit easily.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Armrest assemblies are normally formed in one piece and specially designed for a given bus interior, so that each new interior design calls for redesigning and high-cost retooling of new production lines. For the same reason, replacement of any damaged parts is relatively expensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide an armrest assembly designed to eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks, and which is cheap and easy to produce.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided an armrest assembly as claimed in attached claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Number <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicates as a whole an armrest assembly comprising a flat fastening plate <b>2</b> which is fitted removably to a lateral portion of a bus seat <b>3</b>; a hinge device <b>4</b> connected removably to plate <b>2</b>; and an armrest <b>5</b> having an end portion <b>6</b> connected to hinge device <b>4</b> and rotating about an axis A perpendicular to plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The armrest assembly also comprises a lateral cover plate <b>7</b> fitted removably to plate <b>2</b> and housing a control block <b>8</b> for adjusting the tilt of a backrest <b>9</b> of seat <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More specifically (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), plate <b>2</b> is elongated in shape, and comprises a number of holes <b>2</b><i>a </i>for connection to seat <b>3</b>, and a first and second curved end portion <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> substantially forming an S with a rectangular central reinforcing plate <b>12</b> having a straight longitudinal edge <b>13</b> substantially parallel, in use, to a seat portion <b>14</b> of seat <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">First curved portion <b>10</b> projects with respect to longitudinal edge <b>13</b>, and has two holes <b>15</b> for connection to hinge device <b>4</b>; and second curved portion <b>11</b> defines, with central reinforcing plate <b>12</b>, a recess <b>16</b> open on the opposite side to longitudinal edge <b>13</b> and housing a bracket portion <b>17</b> projecting from cover plate <b>7</b> in a direction substantially parallel to longitudinal edge <b>13</b> and resting on second curved portion <b>11</b>, on the opposite side of plate <b>2</b> to cover plate <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In actual use, bracket portion <b>17</b> projects with respect to plate <b>2</b>, presses laterally against seat portion <b>14</b>, and is supported by second curved portion <b>11</b> to retain an upholstery fabric of seat <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hinge device <b>4</b> connected to first curved portion <b>10</b> comprises a fixed, cup-shaped casing <b>18</b> connected to plate <b>2</b>; and a supporting disk <b>19</b> rotating about axis A and connected to armrest <b>5</b>, which comprises a straight hollow arm <b>20</b> made of extruded aluminium, having a rectangular internal cross section and supporting end portion <b>6</b>, and comprises a supporting member <b>21</b> connected transversely to an end portion <b>22</b> of arm <b>20</b> opposite to end portion <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Disk <b>19</b> comprises a radial projection <b>23</b> having a rectangular cross section shaped to fit inside end portion <b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and fixed radially by a transverse screw <b>24</b> parallel to axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Disk <b>19</b> is connected to cup-shaped casing <b>18</b> by a known cam mechanism movable between a work position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), in which arm <b>20</b> slopes with respect to longitudinal edge <b>13</b> of plate <b>2</b> and supporting member <b>21</b> is substantially parallel to longitudinal edge <b>13</b>, and a collapsed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), in which arm <b>20</b> is parallel to longitudinal edge <b>13</b> and supporting member <b>21</b> is housed in a concave portion <b>25</b> of cover plate <b>7</b>, which also comprises a contoured arc-shaped portion <b>26</b> located at the opposite end to concave portion <b>25</b> and radially housing a portion of cup-shaped casing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At the opposite end of arm <b>20</b>, supporting member <b>21</b> comprises a bottom shell <b>27</b> having an opening <b>28</b> housing end portion <b>22</b>; and a top supporting shell <b>29</b> connected to opposite ends of bottom shell <b>27</b> by a joint <b>30</b> at one end and by a screw at the opposite end.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The advantages of the armrest assembly according to the present invention will be clear from the foregoing description.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In particular, being connected removably, preferably using screws, hinge device <b>4</b>, arm <b>20</b>, supporting member <b>21</b>, and plate <b>2</b> can be replaced independently to reconfigure and achieve greater versatility of the assembly. For example, the length of armrest <b>5</b> may be changed by simply changing arm <b>20</b>, or, in the event of damage, supporting member <b>21</b> may be changed, while preserving the other component parts of armrest assembly <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Using a metal extrusion and a form fit with disk <b>19</b> provides for achieving a high degree of strength cheaply and easily.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, using a metal extrusion, different looks can be achieved easily to better adapt to different vehicle interiors.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The joint connecting top and bottom shells <b>29</b>, <b>27</b> of supporting member <b>21</b> provides for easy, low-cost assembly and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Clearly, changes may be made to the assembly as described and illustrated herein without, however, departing from the scope of the present invention, as defined in the accompanying Claims.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In particular (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), plate <b>2</b> may have a number of additional, equally spaced fastening holes <b>31</b> to adapt plate <b>2</b> easily to any arrangement of screws <b>32</b> for connection to seat <b>3</b>, in addition to fastening holes <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
