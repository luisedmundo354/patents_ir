<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a composite switch that is used mainly in an input operation section, and the like, of a mobile communication device such as a portable telephone and a pager, and various kinds of small-sized and multifunctional electronic devices such as a remote control, an audio device, a game device, a car navigation system, and a digital camera, and operates in two stages by tilting operation of an operation section.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional composite switch operating in two stages by tilting operation is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an external perspective view showing a conventional composite switch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> an exploded perspective view showing a conventional composite switch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a sectional view taken along line <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a sectional view taken along line <b>14</b>-<b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 14</figref>, box-like case <b>1</b>, made of an insulating resin, has a square shape seen from the upper surface. In case <b>1</b>, first push switch <b>2</b> to fourth push switch <b>5</b> (hereinafter, referred to as first switch <b>2</b> to fourth switch <b>5</b>) are disposed in the vicinities of the four corners on the bottom surface. Furthermore, support holes <b>1</b>A for swingably supporting the below-mentioned operation body <b>7</b> are respectively provided in the centers of the walls of the two opposing sides.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fixed contact <b>8</b> includes peripheral contact <b>8</b>A and central contact <b>8</b>B. Fixed contact <b>9</b> includes peripheral contact <b>9</b>A and central contact <b>9</b>B. Fixed contact <b>10</b> includes peripheral contact <b>10</b>A central contact <b>10</b>B. Fixed contact <b>11</b> includes peripheral contact <b>11</b>A and central contact <b>11</b>B. Fixed contacts <b>8</b> to <b>11</b> are insert-molded and fixed in four recessed portions. The four recessed portions are provided two by two symmetrically with respect to a line, which is a swing center shaft of operation body <b>7</b>, connecting two support holes <b>1</b>A of case <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the peripheral portions of the lower surfaces of circular dome-like movable contacts <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, and <b>5</b>A made of an elastic metal thin plate are brought into contact with peripheral contacts <b>8</b>A, <b>9</b>A, <b>10</b>A and <b>11</b>A, respectively. The central portions of the lower surfaces of movable contacts <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, and <b>5</b>A face central contacts <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>B, <b>10</b>B and <b>11</b>B, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such a configuration, contact portions of first switch <b>2</b> to fourth switch <b>5</b> are turned ON when they are pressed from the upper part of operation body <b>7</b> and turned OFF when pressing is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Note here that the above-mentioned four movable contacts <b>2</b>A to <b>5</b>A have the same diameters and heights. However, the thickness of an elastic metal thin plate as a material is larger in movable contacts <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>A at the left side (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) than in movable contacts <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A at the right side (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Therefore, the operation force at the time of being pressed is larger in movable contacts <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>A than in movable contacts <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the upper parts of movable contacts <b>2</b>A to <b>5</b>A of the contact portions of first switch <b>2</b> to fourth switch <b>5</b>, driving bodies <b>2</b>B to <b>5</b>B, made of an elastic insulating material such as rubber, are mounted. When movable contacts <b>2</b>A to <b>5</b>A of the contact portions are pressed via driving bodies <b>2</b>B to <b>5</b>B, first switch <b>2</b> to fourth switch <b>5</b> operate in a large pressing operation stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, driving bodies <b>2</b>B to <b>5</b>B are disposed in a manner in which two each of the driving bodies symmetric with respect to the swing center shaft of case <b>1</b>, that is, driving bodies <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>B and driving bodies <b>4</b>B and <b>5</b>B are connected and integrated with each other. Thus, connected driving bodies <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are formed of the same elastic insulating material and having the same shape and dimension. Each of driving bodies <b>2</b>B to <b>5</b>B can be elastically deformed independently.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Then, the upper surface of case <b>1</b> housing switches <b>2</b> to <b>5</b> is covered with metal cover <b>16</b> having four holes <b>16</b>A into which the upper parts of driving bodies <b>2</b>B to <b>5</b>B are inserted. Above cover <b>16</b>, operation body <b>7</b> made of an insulating resin is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Two columnar portions <b>7</b>B are inserted into two support holes <b>1</b>A of case <b>1</b>. Columnar portions <b>7</b>B are provided on the lower parts of the opposing two sides of plate portion <b>7</b>A having a square shape seen from the upper surface of operation body <b>7</b>. Operation body <b>7</b> is swingably supported around a line connecting two support holes <b>1</b>A as a swing center shaft. Spherical shaped top parts of four driving bodies <b>2</b>B and <b>5</b>B are brought into contact with the lower surface of plate portion <b>7</b>A of operation body <b>7</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, an operation of a conventional composite switch configured as mentioned above is described.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a normal state, any contact portions of first switch <b>2</b> to fourth switch <b>5</b> of the composite switch are in an OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this state, a force for tilting operation body <b>7</b> in the front down direction is applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Then, operation body <b>7</b> swings around a line, connecting two columnar portions <b>7</b>B at the lower part of operation body <b>7</b> supported by two support holes <b>1</b>A of case <b>1</b>, as a center shaft, and tilts in the front down direction. As operation body <b>7</b> moves in the front down direction, each of the spherical-shaped top ends of driving bodies <b>2</b>B and <b>4</b>B, which are brought into contact with the front side lower surface of plate portion <b>7</b>A, is depressed. Driving bodies <b>2</b>B and <b>4</b>B themselves are compressed and deformed, and at the same time, they depress movable contacts <b>2</b>A and <b>4</b>A of first switch <b>2</b> and third switch <b>4</b> disposed in the lower part.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, as mentioned above, the thickness of an elastic metal thin plate forming movable contact <b>4</b>A is larger than that forming movable contact <b>2</b>A. Therefore, when the tilting amount of operation body <b>7</b> is larger than a predetermined value, firstly, a dome-like portion of movable contact <b>2</b>A elastically bends with comfortableness. Thus, peripheral contact <b>8</b>A and central contact <b>8</b>B of fixed contact <b>8</b> are short-circuited via movable contact <b>2</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, first switch <b>2</b> is operated and its signal is transmitted to a circuit of an electronic device using this composite switch via a leading terminal (not shown) connected to each contact. At this time, as mentioned above, the operation force of movable contact <b>4</b>A of third switch <b>4</b> is larger than that of movable contact <b>2</b>A of first switch <b>2</b> since the thickness of material of the operation force of movable contact <b>4</b>A of third switch <b>4</b> is larger than that of movable contact <b>2</b>A of third switch <b>2</b>. At this time, only first switch <b>2</b> having a small operation force of movable contact <b>2</b>A to be bent is operated and third switch <b>4</b> is not operated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the force applied to operation body <b>7</b> is increased from this state, the top ends of driving bodies <b>2</b>B and <b>4</b>B are further depressed and driving body <b>2</b>B of first switch <b>2</b> is compressed and deformed in a state in which movable contact <b>2</b>A is pressed onto central contact <b>8</b>B. Driving body <b>4</b>B of third switch <b>4</b> is also further compressed and deformed. When the amount becomes a predetermined amount or more, and the pressing force toward movable contact <b>4</b>A is beyond the operation force for bending movable contact <b>4</b>A, movable contact <b>4</b>A elastically bends with comfortableness. Peripheral contact <b>10</b>A and central contact <b>10</b>B of fixed contact <b>10</b> are short-circuited via movable contact <b>4</b>A. Thus, third switch <b>4</b> is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Then, when the force applied to operation body <b>7</b> is removed, in the reverse order with respect to that of the pressing operation, movable contacts <b>2</b>A and <b>4</b>A and driving bodies <b>2</b>B and <b>4</b>B restore the original shape by the restoring force. That is to say, operation body <b>7</b> is returned to the original position and first switch <b>2</b> and third switch <b>4</b> are returned to the original normal state, that is, an OFF state again.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Similarly, when a force for tilting operation body <b>7</b> in the rear down direction is applied, second switch <b>3</b> firstly operates. When the pressing force is further increased, fourth switch <b>5</b> also operates. When this pressing force is removed, fourth switch <b>5</b> and second switch <b>3</b> are turned OFF in the reverse order with respect to the above-mentioned order.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As mentioned above, by tilting operation body <b>7</b>, the composite switch can operate first switch <b>2</b> and third switch <b>4</b> or second switch <b>3</b> and fourth switch <b>5</b> in two stages with different operation strokes and operation forces.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An example of prior art information related to the invention of this application includes Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2002-203460.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, in accordance with recent diversification of various electronic devices, switches having a short tilting operation stroke or generating less operation click at the time of operation have been demanded. However, in the above-mentioned conventional composite switch, since driving bodies <b>2</b>B to <b>5</b>B are formed of an elastic insulating material such as rubber, there is limitation to shortening the tilting operation stroke. Furthermore, as mentioned above, when an elastic insulating material is used, sound generated when movable contacts <b>2</b>A to <b>5</b>A elastically bend is large, thus making it difficult to suppress the generation of noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention provides a composite switch in which an operation stroke is short and the generation of noise is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention relates to a composite switch including an operation body, made of an inelastic material, having a square shape seen from an upper surface and being swingably supported by a case around a middle point between two opposing sides as a fulcrum; two pairs of push switches disposed at a lower side in both tilting directions at the time of tilting of the operation body in a manner in which the push switches are disposed two by two symmetrically with respect to a line that is a swing center shaft of the case, wherein the two push switches in one of the pairs at one side have different operation forces; two driving bodies, made of an inelastic material, disposed in contact with each upper surface of one pair of push switches located in parallel to the swing center shaft of the case; and a cover allowing the two driving bodies to be housed in and fixed to the case and having windows from which upper parts of the two driving bodies protrude. When the operation body is tilted in one direction, an upper surface position of the driving body that is a center between the one pair of push switches at a lower side in the tilting direction is pressed and the one pair of push switches operate by different operation forces.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the operation body and the driving body are formed of an inelastic material, it is possible to realize a composite switch in which a tilting operation stroke is short, and noise generated when movable contact bends is small, that is, the generation of noise is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the two pairs of push switches have a circular shape and are disposed in a manner in which they are displaced from each other in a range of the one pair of push switches in a direction parallel to the swing center shaft of the case. Such a configuration can reduce the outer size in the tilting direction of the composite switch and contribute to miniaturization of various electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the two pairs of push switches are operated by a same operation force and a contact position of the operation body pressing an upper surface of the driving body at the time of tilting operation is a position displaced from the center between the pair of push switches at a lower side in the tilting direction. With such a configuration, it is possible to realize a composite switch capable of operating in two stages by tilting operation of an operation body by using push switches having the same operation force. Thus, excellent productivity can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, according to the present invention, a portion that is brought into contact with the driving body at the time of tilting of the operation body has a spherical protruding shape. With such a configuration, the rotation operation of the operation body at the time of tilting operation can be converted into the operation in the vertical direction of the driving body smoothly so as to be transmitted. Therefore, a composite switch that is excellent in operation property can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, according to the present invention, the operation body is always brought into contact with the two driving bodies in a normal state in which the operation body is not tilted. With such a configuration, wobble in the operation body and driving body can be suppressed and the quality when an operating knob at the side of an electronic device is installed to the operation body is improved.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, case <b>21</b>, made of an insulating resin, has a box-like shape that is square seen from the upper surface. In the vicinities of four corners on the bottom surface of case <b>21</b>, circular first switch <b>22</b> to fourth switch <b>25</b> are disposed. In the centers of the walls of the two opposing sides, support holes <b>21</b>A for swingably supporting the below-mentioned operation body <b>28</b> are provided, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Peripheral contacts <b>29</b>A to <b>32</b>A and central contacts <b>29</b>B to <b>32</b>B are insert-molded and fixed in four recessed portions. The recessed portions are provided two by two in positions symmetric with respect to a line, which is a swing center shaft of operation body <b>28</b>, connecting two support holes <b>21</b>A. Fixed contacts <b>29</b> to <b>32</b> are configured by pairs of peripheral contacts <b>29</b>A to <b>32</b>A and central contacts <b>29</b>B and <b>32</b>B, respectively. Furthermore, on peripheral contacts <b>29</b>A to <b>32</b>A, circular dome-like movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A made of an elastic metal thin plate are mounted in a state in which the peripheral lower ends thereof are brought into contact with <b>29</b>A to <b>32</b>A. Contact portions of circular first switch <b>22</b> to fourth switch <b>25</b> are configured in which the centers of the lower surfaces of movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A face central contacts <b>29</b>B to <b>32</b>B, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the centers of movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A are pressed from the upper part, the dome-like portions elastically bend and the centers of the lower surface are brought into contact with central contacts <b>29</b>B to <b>32</b>B so as to be turned ON. When the pressing force is removed, the dome-like portions of movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A restore the original shape by the restoring force so as to be turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, the above-mentioned four movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A have the same diameter and height. However, an elastic metal thin plate as a material has a larger thickness in movable contacts <b>24</b>A and <b>25</b>A, located at the left side (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), i.e., at one side with respect to the swing center shaft, than in rest movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>23</b>A. The operation force at the time of being pressed is larger in movable contacts <b>24</b>A and <b>25</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the upper part of movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A of a pair of first and third switches <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at the front side, driving body <b>26</b> having a rectangular shape seen from the upper surface is mounted in such a manner as to be parallel to the swing center shaft. Similarly, also on the upper part of movable contacts <b>23</b>A and <b>25</b>A of a pair of second and fourth switches <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> at the rear side, driving body <b>27</b> having a rectangular shape seen from the upper surface is mounted in such a manner as to be parallel to the swing center shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Driving body <b>26</b> at the front side has two pressing portions <b>26</b>A, the lower end of which has a spherical surface and which protrude from the lower surface of driving body <b>26</b>. Two pressing portion <b>26</b>A are brought into contact with the upper surfaces of the center of movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A. At the same time, driving body <b>27</b> at the rear side has two pressing portions <b>27</b>A, the lower end of which has a spherical surface and which protrude from the lower surface of driving body <b>27</b>. Two pressing portion <b>27</b>A are brought into contact with the upper surfaces of the centers of movable contacts <b>23</b>A and <b>25</b>A. That is to say, driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are placed in a state in which they keep symmetrical position parallel to the swing center shaft. Movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A of first switch <b>22</b> and third switch <b>24</b> are pressed by driving body <b>26</b>. Movable contacts <b>23</b>A and <b>25</b>A of second switch <b>23</b> and fourth switch <b>25</b> are pressed by driving body <b>27</b>. Thus, first switch <b>22</b> to fourth switch <b>25</b> can be operated.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The upper surface of case <b>21</b> housing first switch <b>22</b> to fourth switch <b>25</b> is covered with cover <b>33</b> made of a metal plate. Cover <b>33</b> has two long holes <b>33</b>A. From respective holes <b>33</b>A, upper protruding portions <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>B of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> having a rectangular shape seen from the upper surface protrude. Furthermore, cover <b>33</b> is fixed to case <b>21</b> in a manner in which L-shaped locking portions <b>33</b>B, which are provided in the corners of a pair of opposing side surfaces folded downward, are locked on the lower positions of side surface protruding portion <b>21</b>B of case <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Operation body <b>28</b> made of an inelastic insulating resin has plate portion <b>28</b>A having substantially a square shape seen from the upper surface and two columnar portions <b>28</b>B provided on the lower part of two opposing sides thereof. Two columnar portions <b>28</b>B are inserted into two support holes <b>21</b>A of case <b>21</b>. Operation body <b>28</b> is swingably supported around a line connecting two support holes <b>21</b>A as a swing center shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Plate portion <b>28</b>A of operation body <b>28</b> has engaging holes <b>28</b>D in which an operating knob of an electronic device (not shown) is placed. On the lower surface of plate portion <b>28</b>A, two spherical protruding portions <b>28</b>C each having a spherical-shaped lower end are provided corresponding to each of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Two spherical protruding portions <b>28</b>C are brought into contact with the upper surfaces of upper protruding portions <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>B of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively. The contact portions are shown by black circle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Two spherical protruding portions <b>28</b>C are disposed corresponding to the center between two pressing portions <b>26</b>A of front side driving body <b>26</b> and to the center between two pressing portions <b>27</b>A of rear side driving body <b>27</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In accordance with recent demands for small and thin devices, electronic components to be reflow mounted on a wiring board of a device have been used more frequently. The composite switch may be also a switch corresponding to reflow mounting. In this case, for example, driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and operation body <b>28</b> may be formed of an inelastic material such as polyamide, a liquid crystal polymer, and the like, and case <b>21</b> may be formed of PPA (polyphthalamide), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, an operation of the composite switch is described.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Firstly, in a normal state in which a pressing force is not applied to operation body <b>28</b>, two spherical protruding portions <b>28</b>C of operation body <b>28</b> are brought into contact with the upper surfaces of upper protruding portions <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>B of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. First switch <b>22</b> to fourth switch <b>25</b> in which pressing portions <b>26</b>A and <b>27</b>A on the lower surfaces of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are brought into contact with movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A are in an OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">From the above-mentioned normal state, when a force for tilting operation body <b>28</b> in the front down direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is applied, operation body <b>28</b> swings around a line connecting two columnar portions <b>28</b>B provided at both ends of operation body <b>28</b> supported by two support holes <b>21</b>A of case <b>21</b>, and tilts in the front down direction. Then, with the tilting operation, the pressing force is applied to driving body <b>26</b> that is brought into contact with spherical protruding portion <b>28</b>C at the front side of operation body <b>28</b>, and the centers of the upper surfaces of movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A of first switch <b>22</b> and third switch <b>24</b> with which pressing portion <b>26</b>A located at the lower surface of driving body <b>26</b> are brought into contact.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When a tilting operation angle of operation body <b>28</b> is increased and the pressing force to the above-mentioned movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A is beyond a predetermined elastic deformation force, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, firstly, the dome-like portion of movable contact <b>22</b>A of first switch <b>22</b> whose elastic metal thin plate as a material is thin bends with comfortableness and light operation click. Then, the center of the lower surface of movable contact <b>22</b>A is brought into contact with central contact <b>29</b>B. Thus, peripheral contacts <b>29</b>A and central contact <b>29</b>B are short-circuited via movable contact <b>22</b>A, and first switch <b>22</b> is turned ON. A signal passing through first switch <b>22</b> is transmitted to a circuit of an electronic device using this composite switch via a lead terminal (not shown) connected to each contact. At this time, movable contact <b>24</b>A of third switch <b>24</b> does not yet bend and driving body <b>26</b> is in a tilting state in which the side of movable contact <b>22</b>A is somewhat lower.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">From the state, when the force applied to operation body <b>28</b> is further increased so as to increase the pressing force to driving body <b>26</b> in spherical protruding portion <b>28</b>C of the front side of operation body <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the dome-like portion of movable contact <b>24</b>A of third switch <b>24</b> bends with comfotableness and light operation click. Thus, the center of the lower surface of movable contact <b>24</b>A is brought into contact with central contact <b>31</b>B so as to establish continuity between peripheral contact <b>31</b>A and central contact <b>31</b>B. Thus, third switch <b>24</b> is also turned ON in addition to first switch <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, in accordance with this embodiment, since driving body <b>26</b> and operation body <b>28</b> are made of an inelastic insulating resin, driving body <b>26</b> and operation body <b>28</b> themselves do not elastically shrink. As a result, a tilting operation stroke before first switch <b>22</b> starts to operate and a tilting operation stroke before third switch <b>24</b> starts to operate can be shortened. Furthermore, light operation click generated when movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A bend is kept small, and the generation of noise can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the tilting pressing force applied to operation body <b>28</b> is removed, in the reverse order with respect to the order at the time of tilting operation, firstly, movable contact <b>24</b>A restores the original dome shape by its restoring force with comfortableness and light operation click, and driving body <b>26</b> is pushed back to the upper part. Then, movable contact <b>22</b>A restores the original dome shape by its restoring force with comfortableness and light operation click, and driving body <b>26</b> is pushed back to the upper part. With these sequential operation, operation body <b>28</b> is returned to the original position, so that first switch <b>22</b> and third switch <b>24</b> are turned to an OFF state, that is, a normal state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Also in the series of restoring operations, movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>24</b>A do not make light operation click, and thus the generation of noise can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the contrary, when a force for tilting operation body <b>28</b> in the rear down direction is applied, operation body <b>28</b> tilts in the rear down direction around the swing center shaft as a center. Driving body <b>27</b> with which spherical protruding portion <b>28</b>C of the rear side of operation body <b>28</b> is brought into contact is depressed, so that a pressing force is applied to the center of the upper part of movable contacts <b>23</b>A and <b>25</b>A of second switch <b>23</b> and fourth switch <b>25</b> with which pressing portion <b>27</b>A on the lower surface of driving body <b>27</b> is brought into contact.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the pressing force to the above-mentioned movable contacts <b>23</b>A and <b>25</b>A is beyond a predetermined elastic deformation force, firstly, movable contact <b>23</b>A of first switch <b>23</b> bends with comfortableness and light operation click. Then, continuity between peripheral contact <b>30</b>A and central contact <b>30</b>B is established via movable contact <b>23</b>A, and second switch <b>23</b> is turned ON.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, movable contact <b>25</b>A of fourth switch <b>25</b> bends with comfortableness and light operation click. Then, continuity between peripheral contact <b>32</b>A and central contact <b>32</b>B is established via movable contact <b>25</b>A, and fourth switch <b>25</b> is turned ON in addition to first switch <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the tilting pressing force applied to operation body <b>28</b> is removed, in the reverse order with respect to the above-mentioned order, firstly, movable contact <b>25</b>A restores the original shape by its restoring force with comfortableness and light operation click. Subsequently, movable contact <b>23</b>A similarly restores the original shape by its restoring force with comfortableness and light operation click. Second switch <b>23</b> and fourth switch <b>25</b> are returned to an OFF state, and driving body <b>27</b> and operation body <b>28</b> are pushed back to the original position.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, in the composite switch in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, operation body <b>28</b> rotates and driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> operate vertically. Since the lower end of operation body <b>28</b> that is brought into contact with upper protruding portions <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>B of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> includes spherical protruding portion <b>28</b>C, even if a tilting operation angle of operation body <b>28</b> is changing, the contact to driving body <b>26</b> or <b>27</b> is stable, so that the tilting operation of operation body <b>28</b> can be smoothly done. Therefore, driving body <b>26</b> carries out a vertical operation reliably. Furthermore, with such a configuration, even in a state in which driving body <b>26</b> or <b>27</b> tilts when a switch at one side is turned ON, spherical protruding portion <b>28</b>C is brought into contact with upper protruding portion <b>26</b>B or <b>27</b>B stably. Thus, the following operation is carried out smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, in the normal state in which a tilting force is not applied to operation body <b>28</b>, spherical protruding portions <b>28</b>C of operation body <b>28</b> are brought into contact with upper protruding portions <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>B of two driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, and pressing portions <b>26</b>A and <b>27</b>A of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are brought into contact with the upper surfaces of the center of movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A which are located below, respectively. Therefore, wobble in driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and operation body <b>28</b> can be suppressed, and the quality when an operating knob at the side of an electronic device to be used is placed on operation body <b>28</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Note here that the above-mentioned composite switch may have a configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the composite switch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an operation force with respect to four movable contacts <b>34</b> are the same. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is different from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in that spherical protruding portions <b>35</b>A of operation body <b>35</b> for pressing driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are brought into contact with the positions that are displaced to one of the pressing portions from respective center portions between two pressing portions <b>26</b>A and between two pressing portions <b>27</b>A located at the lower surfaces of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, for example, a portion displaced to the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The other configuration is the same as mentioned above and therefore the description therefor is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, firstly, when a pressing force for tilting operation body <b>35</b> in the front direction is applied so as to be tilted, the force is applied to driving body <b>26</b> with which spherical protruding portion <b>35</b>A on the lower surface of operation body <b>35</b> is brought into contact. At this time, spherical protruding portion <b>35</b>A presses the position displaced to the left side from the center between two pressing portions <b>26</b>A on the lower surface of driving body <b>26</b>. As a result, a difference is generated in the pressing force pressed by driving body <b>26</b> between movable contact <b>34</b> located at the right side and movable contact <b>34</b> located at the left side. That is to say, a larger pressing force is applied to left movable contact <b>34</b> than to right movable contact <b>34</b>. Therefore, firstly, left movable contact <b>34</b> elastically bends with comfortableness and light operation click, and third switch <b>39</b> is turned ON. When operation body <b>35</b> is further tilted, right movable contact <b>34</b> elastically bends with comfortableness and light operation click, and third switch <b>37</b> is also turned ON.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the pressing force applied to operation body <b>35</b> is removed, in the reverse order with respect to the above-mentioned order, movable contact <b>34</b> sequentially restores the original dome shape and driving body <b>26</b> and the like is pushed back to the original position and first switch <b>37</b> and third switch <b>39</b> are returned to an OFF state, that is, a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. An operation for tilting operation body <b>35</b> in the opposite side is the same, and so the description therefor is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Also in such a configuration, since driving body <b>26</b> is made of an inelastic insulating resin material, driving body <b>26</b> does not shrink at the time of operation and is depressed corresponding to the tilting operation. Therefore, an operation stroke is short. Furthermore, the generation of noise at the time of bending operation of movable contact <b>34</b> is suppressed. Furthermore, with such a configuration, movable contacts <b>34</b> for four push switches can be formed of one kind. Thus, the production efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The distance in which spherical protruding portion <b>35</b>A of operation body <b>35</b> is displaced may be appropriately set by considering the difference between the operation force of a push switch to operate first and the pressing force to operate secondarily when a tilting operation is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, a configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view showing a composite switch with an operation body and a cover being removed. Main difference between a configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the configuration mentioned above is in the arrangement of four switches. That is to say, two pairs of push switches are disposed in a staggered state and one pair of switches are displaced from the other pair in the parallel direction to the swing center shaft in which one switch of one pair is located between two switches of the other pair.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the composite switch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, second switch <b>23</b> at the upper right side is located between third switch <b>24</b> at the lower left side and first switch <b>22</b> at the lower right side, which are located at the lower side and upper side with the swing center shaft connecting the centers of the left and right opposing sides sandwiched therebetween. Between fourth switch <b>25</b> at upper left side and second switch <b>23</b>, third switch <b>24</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and an operation body made of an inelastic material as mentioned above and a cover are disposed corresponding to the positions in which two pairs of push switches <b>22</b> to <b>25</b> are disposed. Positions in which spherical protruding portions (not shown) of the operation body are brought into contact with upper protruding portions <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>B of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are positions shown by black circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The positions of the black circles are the centers between two pressing portions <b>26</b>A and between pressing portions <b>27</b>A, which are not shown, of driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. Furthermore, in movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A, as compared with movable contacts <b>22</b>A and <b>23</b>A, movable contacts <b>24</b>A and <b>25</b>A have a thicker elastic metal thin plate as a material and have a larger operation force.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When two pairs of push switches <b>22</b> to <b>25</b> are disposed in this configuration, as compared with the configuration mentioned with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>, case <b>41</b> can have a smaller size in the tilting direction perpendicular to the swing center shaft although the size of the swing center shaft becomes slightly longer. Therefore, this configuration is useful for cases where the mounting space is limited and can contribute to miniaturization of various electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The operation state of the composite switch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is the same as that described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Since driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are made of an inelastic insulating resin material, an operation stroke is short. Furthermore, when movable contacts <b>22</b>A to <b>25</b>A bend, comfortableness and light operation click are not generated, so that the generation of noise can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, with respect to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, four movable contacts are allowed to have the same operation forces and may be combined with the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A composite switch having such a configuration is shown in a sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, spherical protruding portion <b>36</b>A of operation body <b>36</b> is brought into contact with driving body <b>26</b> in the position that is displaced from the center in the direction parallel to the swing center shaft between two pressing portions <b>26</b>A. Although not shown, the side of driving body <b>27</b> also has the same configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since pressing protruding portions <b>36</b>A at the lower surface of operation body <b>36</b> are provided on the lower surface of center between the left and right directions of case <b>41</b> but driving body <b>26</b> is disposed in the position displaced in the right direction of case <b>41</b>, when operation body <b>36</b> is tilted to the front side in the drawing, spherical protruding portion <b>36</b>A presses the position displaced to the left side from the center portion between two pressing portions <b>26</b>A of driving body <b>26</b>. Therefore, movable contacts <b>34</b> at the left side firstly bend with comfortableness and light operation click. When the pressing force is further applied, remaining pair of movable contacts <b>34</b> at the right side bend with comfortableness and light operation click.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the pressing force for the tilting operation is removed, in the reverse order, two movable contacts <b>34</b> restore the original state by the restoring force so as to be returned to a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The operation for allowing operation body <b>36</b> to tilt in the opposite direction is the same as the operation mentioned above, the description therefor is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, also with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, movable contacts <b>34</b> of the four push switches are one kind, thus achieving the efficient production efficiency. Furthermore, driving bodies <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> made of an inelastic insulating resin material do not elastically shrink and are depressed corresponding to the tilting operation. Therefore, a tilting operation stroke can be short. Furthermore, the generation of noise at the time of bending operation of movable contact <b>34</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, the composite switch in accordance with the present invention operates in two stages by a tilting operation. In the operation, the tilting operation stroke is short and the generation of noise at the time of bending operation of the movable contact is small. Therefore, the composite switch is useful in an input operation section, and the like, of a mobile communication device such as a portable telephone and a pager, and various kinds of small-sized and multifunctional electronic devices such as a remote control, an audio device, a game device, a car navigation system, and a digital camera.</p>
