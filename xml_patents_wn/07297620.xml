<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In methods of forming an oxide layer and an oxynitride layer, a substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber having a first pressure and a first temperature. The oxide layer is formed on the substrate using a reaction gas while increasing a temperature of the reaction chamber from the first temperature to a second temperature under a second pressure. Additionally, the oxide layer is nitrified in the reaction chamber to form the oxynitride layer on the substrate. When the oxide layer and/or the oxynitride layer are formed on the substrate, minute patterns of a semiconductor device, for example a DRAM device, an SRAM device or an LOGIC device may be easily formed on the oxide layer or the oxynitride layer.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC § 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 2003-29446, filed on May 9, 2003, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of forming an oxide layer and a method of forming an oxynitride layer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of forming a very thin oxide layer having excellent uniformity and characteristics on a substrate using a batch type apparatus, and a method of forming a very thin oxynitride layer by nitrifying the oxide layer on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As information processing systems such as computers have been widely utilized, semiconductor devices also have been rapidly developed. Thus, semiconductor manufacturing technologies have improved to produce semiconductor devices having large storage capacity, high response speed, high integration degree, good reliability, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the design rule of the semiconductor device decreases, the sizes of patterns of the semiconductor device also greatly decrease. For example, in a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor, a gate insulation layer between a gate electrode and a substrate has exceedingly reduced thickness and width. Various semiconductor devices such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices, static random access memory (SRAM) devices, or flash memory devices demand an oxide layer having a thickness of several tens of angstroms (Å) as a gate insulation layer. In particular, a logic device for driving a memory circuit requires an extremely thin oxide layer of about 10 Å as the gate insulation layer. Therefore, it is required to form a very thin oxide layer on a substrate as the gate insulation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the gate insulation layer of the semiconductor device is very thin, impurities doped in the gate electrode may diffuse into the substrate through the thin gate insulation layer. Hence, before forming the gate electrode on the gate insulation layer, an oxynitride layer may be formed on the gate insulation layer to prevent the impurities in the gate electrode from diffusing into the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a conventional semiconductor manufacturing method, the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer is formed using a single type apparatus such as a rapid thermal processing (RTP) apparatus since the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer may not have a precisely controlled thickness and may have poor uniformity and quality when a batch type apparatus is used. Additionally, a native oxide layer may be formed on the very thin oxide layer when the oxide layer is formed using the batch type apparatus. On the other hand, the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer formed in the single type apparatus may have poor electrical characteristics because thermal damage may occur to the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a method of forming a very thin oxide layer having greatly improved uniformity and electrical characteristics by oxidizing a substrate in a reaction chamber at a low pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention also provides a method of forming an oxynitride layer for effectively preventing impurities from diffusing into the substrate using a batch type apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention also provides a method of forming an oxynitride layer for effectively preventing impurities from diffusing into the substrate using an RTN apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of forming an oxide layer on a substrate. In accordance with the method, a substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber having a first pressure and a first temperature. The substrate is primarily oxidized by providing a reaction gas onto the substrate while increasing temperature of the reaction chamber from the first temperature to a second temperature under a second pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The primarily oxidized substrate can be secondarily oxidized in the reaction chamber when the reaction chamber is at the second temperature and the second pressure. The secondarily oxidized substrate can be from the reaction chamber when the reaction chamber is at a third pressure and the second temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The secondarily oxidized substrate can be cooled in the reaction chamber while decreasing the temperature of the reaction chamber from the second temperature to a third temperature under the second pressure, and the substrate can be unloaded from the reaction chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, the primarily oxidized substrate can be cooled while decreasing the temperature of the reaction chamber from the second temperature to a third temperature under a third pressure, and the substrate can be unloaded from the reaction chamber. The third pressure can be greater than the second pressure. The third temperature can be greater than the first temperature. The temperature of the reaction chamber can be decreased from the second temperature to the third temperature at a rate of about 2 to about 15° C./minute. 12. The primarily oxidized substrate can be unloaded from the reaction chamber at the second temperature and a third pressure. The second temperature can be in a range of about 600 to about 750° C.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the first pressure can be in a range of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr, and the first temperature can be in a range of about 300 to about 550° C. In addition, the second pressure can be in a range of about 0.3 to about 20 Torr, and the second temperature can be in a range of about 550 to about 950° C. The temperature of the reaction chamber can be increased from the first temperature to the second temperature at a rate of about 2 to about 15° C./minute. The reaction gas can include an oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>), and further include a hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) or a hydrogen chloride gas (HCl).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The primarily oxidized substrate can be nitrified in the reaction chamber when the reaction chamber is at the second pressure and the second temperature. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of forming an oxide layer on a substrate. In accordance with the method, a substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber having a first temperature. The substrate is primarily oxidized by providing a reaction gas onto the substrate while increasing a temperature of the reaction chamber from the first temperature to a second temperature under a pressure of about 0.3 to about 20 Torr. The primarily oxidized substrate can be secondarily oxidized in the reaction chamber when the reaction chamber is at the second temperature and the pressure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the following detailed description, it will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being “on” or “onto” another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">U.S. Patent Application Publication number 2002-3258 discloses a method of forming a gate insulation layer including a silicon oxynitride layer that is converted from a hydroxy-silicate layer by a nitration process after forming the hydroxy-silicate layer on a substrate. In this approach, the nitration process is carried out at a temperature of about 200 to about 500° C. and a pressure of about 1 to about 5 Torr to form the silicon oxynitride layer having a thickness of about 7 Å. However, since the nitration process is performed in a single type apparatus such as a rapid thermal nitration (RTN) apparatus, the throughput of the nitration process may be reduced and the characteristics of the silicon oxynitride layer may be deteriorated due to a thermal damage thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">U.S. Patent Application Publication number 2001-6842 discloses a method of forming a tantalum oxynitride (TaON) layer as a gate insulation layer instead of the silicon oxynitride layer. This tantalum oxynitride layer has several advantages such as improved stability, relatively high breakdown voltage, low leakage current, etc. Particularly, after a silicon nitride layer or a silicon oxynitride layer is formed on a substrate including a field oxide layer at a temperature of about 200 to about 0.600° C. under a pressure of about 0.2 to about 10 Torr, a tantalum oxynitride layer is formed on the silicon nitride or a silicon oxynitride layer so as to form the gate insulation layer on the substrate. Here, the silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride layer is formed using an NH<sub>3 </sub>gas, an O<sub>2 </sub>gas or NO<sub>2 </sub>gas. In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,713 discloses a method of forming an oxynitride layer having a thickness of about 6 to about 10 Å using a reaction gas excited by U.V. light. This oxynitride layer is formed at a temperature of about 800° C. and at a pressure of about 0.5 to about 500 Torr. However, the above-mentioned methods have poor throughput because the oxynitride layers are formed using a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of forming an oxide layer on a substrate in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in step S<b>110</b>, a substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber having a first temperature and a first pressure. The substrate is primarily oxidized while the first temperature of the reaction chamber is increased to a second temperature in step S<b>120</b>. Thus, a uniform primary oxide layer having a thickness of about 10 Å is formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step S<b>130</b>, the primary oxidized substrate may be secondarily oxidized when the reaction chamber is at the second temperature and a second pressure larger than the first pressure. As a result, the primary oxide layer on the substrate is grown to form a secondary oxide layer having a desired thickness on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After forming the primary oxide layer or forming the secondary oxide layer, the substrate may be cooled in step S<b>140</b> by decreasing the temperature of the reaction chamber. The cooled substrate is unloaded from the reaction chamber in step S<b>150</b>. In addition, the substrate may be unloaded from the reaction chamber in step S<b>150</b> when the reaction chamber is at the second temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating the method of forming the oxide layer on the substrate in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber of a batch type apparatus in step I-<b>1</b> (step S<b>110</b>). Here, the reaction chamber has a first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>and a first pressure P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a reaction chamber for forming an oxide layer in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, a substrate <b>10</b> on which an oxide layer is formed is disposed on a boat <b>37</b> supported by a boat loader <b>35</b> of a load-lock chamber <b>30</b>. The substrate <b>10</b> is placed on the boat <b>37</b> using a transferring member <b>20</b> such as a handler. The boat <b>37</b> may simultaneously load more than about 100 substrates <b>10</b> to improve the throughput of the process for forming the oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step I-<b>1</b> (step S<b>110</b>), the pressure of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> and the load-lock chamber <b>30</b> is reduced to about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr using a pressure control member <b>150</b> such as a vacuum pump. After a shutter <b>50</b> is opened, the boat <b>37</b> including the substrate <b>10</b> is loaded into the reaction chamber <b>100</b> in accordance with the movement of the boat loader <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although the load-lock chamber <b>30</b> is separated from the reaction chamber <b>100</b>, the load-lock chamber <b>30</b> has a constant pressure of about 0.03 to 3.0 Torr while the shutter <b>50</b> is opened and the substrate <b>10</b> is transferred into the reaction chamber <b>100</b> because the pressure control member <b>150</b> maintains the pressure of the load-lock chamber <b>30</b> and the reaction chamber <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Before oxidizing the substrate <b>10</b>, the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is at the first pressure P<b>1</b> about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr and the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>of about 300 to about 500° C. When the reaction chamber <b>100</b> has the first pressure P<b>1</b> of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr before oxidizing the substrate <b>10</b>, a native oxide layer may not be formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. It is difficult to reduce the pressure of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> to below about 0.03 Torr. In addition, before forming an oxide layer having a thickness of about 10 Å on the substrate <b>10</b>, the reaction chamber <b>100</b> having the first pressure P<b>1</b> of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr is effective. On the other hand, when the reaction chamber <b>100</b> has a pressure of above about 3.0 Torr before oxidizing the substrate <b>10</b>, a native oxide layer may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. If the native oxide layer is previously formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, a desired oxide layer having the thickness of about 10 Å may not be formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. For example, since a native oxide layer of about 20 Å may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> under atmospheric pressure, a very thin oxide layer of about 10 Å may not be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> when the native oxide layer is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present invention, the pressure of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is adjusted using the pressure control member <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is below about 300° C., the oxide layer formed on the substrate <b>10</b> may be disadvantageously thick because the time for increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> from the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>to a second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>is exceedingly increased. On the other hand, when the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is above about 550° C., the native oxide layer may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> before forming the desired oxide layer on the substrate <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is advantageously selected so as to form a desired thin oxide layer on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step I-<b>2</b> (step S<b>120</b>), a reaction gas is provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> while the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased. As a result, the substrate <b>10</b> is primarily oxidized to form a thin oxide layer having a thickness of below about 10 Å on the substrate <b>10</b>. Particularly, after the pressure of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased to about 0.3 to about 20 Torr, the reaction gas is introduced into the reaction chamber <b>100</b> to primarily oxidize the substrate <b>10</b> while the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased. Alternatively, after the reaction gas may be provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> just before the pressure of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased to about 0.3 to about 20 Torr, the substrate <b>10</b> is primarily oxidized to form the thin oxide layer on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased using an energy supply member <b>120</b> such as a heater. Here, the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased from the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>to the second temperature T<sub>2</sub>. The difference between the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>and the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>may be advantageously adjusted so as to control the thickness of the thin oxide layer formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is in a range of about 550 to about 950° C.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is below about 550° C., the difference between the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>and the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>is relatively small so that the oxide layer may have an insufficient thickness. Additionally, the reaction gas may be excessively provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> to form the oxide layer having a desired thickness. On the other hand, when the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is above about 950° C., the difference between the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>and the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>is too large so that the oxide layer may be disadvantageously thick. In addition, the characteristics of the oxide layer may be deteriorated because of a thermal effect due to a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">However, in the case in which an oxide layer having a relatively thick thickness of above about 10 Å is required, the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> may exceed about 950° C.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> can be increased at a rate of about 2 to about 15° C./minute. When the rate of increase in the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is below about 2° C./minute, the time for increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> may be greatly extended to thereby reduce the throughput of the process for forming the oxide layer. On the other hand, when the rate of increase in the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is above about 15° C./minute, the uniformity of the oxide layer may be deteriorated because of the rapid increase in the temperature although the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> may be rapidly increased to the second temperature T<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the thickness of the oxide layer may not be precisely controlled due to the rapid increase in the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, the second pressure P<b>2</b> of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is in a range of about 0.3 to about 20 Torr while the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased from the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>to the second temperature T<sub>2</sub>. When the second pressure P<b>2</b> of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is below about 0.3 Torr, the oxide layer may not be sufficiently grown on the substrate <b>10</b>. However, when the second pressure P<b>2</b> of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is above about 20 Torr, the oxide layer may have an undesired thick thickness while the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased from the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>to the second temperature T<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the uniformity of the oxide layer may be deteriorated relative to an entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b>. As a result, the thickness difference among portions of the oxide layer positioned on the substrate <b>10</b> may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is increased from the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>to the second temperature T<sub>2</sub>, the reaction gas for oxidizing the substrate <b>10</b> is provided into the reaction chamber <b>100</b> through a gas supply line <b>140</b>. The reaction gas may be varied in accordance with the kind of oxide layer formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. For example, when an oxide layer has a high breakdown voltage, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) and a hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) is provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> to form the oxide layer of the high breakdown voltage by a wet oxidation process. Here, the volume ratio between the oxygen gas and the hydrogen gas is about 2:3. For example, the reaction gas includes oxygen gas of about 0.62 liter and hydrogen gas of about 0.9 liter when the first temperature T<sub>1 </sub>is about 550° C., the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>is about 950° C., and the rate of increase in the temperature is about 7° C./minute.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When an amount of the reaction gas is increased, the oxide layer may be more rapidly grown on the substrate <b>10</b>. Thus, the amount of the reaction gas is advantageously adjusted considering the first temperature T<sub>1</sub>, the second temperature T<sub>2</sub>, the rate of increase in the temperature, the desired thickness of the oxide layer, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment of the present invention, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas is provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> by a dry oxidation process to form a buffer oxide layer on the substrate <b>10</b>. In another embodiment of the present invention, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas and a hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas is provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> by a clean oxidation process to form another oxide layer on the substrate <b>10</b>. Although the oxide layer may not have excellent characteristics using the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process, the oxide layer may be rapidly grown on the substrate <b>10</b> so that the oxide layer has the desired thickness for a very short time. Additionally, in the clean oxidation process, impurities may be completely removed from the oxide layer and the substrate <b>10</b> during the formation of the oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment of the present invention, an oxide layer may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> using a combination process of a wet oxidation process, a dry oxidation process and a clean oxidation process. For example, the wet oxidation process is carried out at a temperature of about 800 to about 900° C. whereas the dry and clean oxidation processes are performed at a temperature of about 850 to about 1,000° C. Hence, after the oxide layer may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> at relatively low temperature using the wet oxidation process, the oxide layer is completely formed on the substrate <b>10</b> at a relatively high temperature using the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, after the substrate <b>10</b> is primarily oxidized in step I-<b>2</b> (step S<b>120</b>), the primarily oxidized substrate <b>10</b> may be additionally cooled in the reaction chamber <b>100</b> while the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is decreased from the second temperature T<sub>2 </sub>to a third temperature T<sub>3 </sub>under a third pressure P<b>3</b> in step I-<b>4</b> (step S<b>140</b>). Here, the temperature of the reaction chamber <b>100</b> is reduced using a cooling member <b>160</b>. Additionally, the cooled substrate <b>10</b> may be unloaded from the reaction chamber <b>100</b> under the third pressure P<b>3</b> in step I-<b>5</b> (step S<b>150</b>).

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this embodiment, the substrate is oxidized and nitrified while increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber. The oxynitride layer is formed in a reaction chamber of the batch type apparatus so that the throughput of the process for forming the oxynitride layer may be greatly increased.

<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of forming an oxynitride layer on a substrate in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, an oxide layer is formed on a substrate in a first reaction chamber of the batch type apparatus, whereas an oxynitride layer is formed on the substrate in a second reaction chamber of the single type apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the substrate is loaded into the first reaction chamber of the batch type apparatus after the reaction chamber has a first pressure and a first temperature in step S<b>810</b>. In steps S<b>820</b> and S<b>830</b>, the substrate is oxidized in the first reaction chamber while increasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber from the first temperature to a third temperature under a second pressure. Alternatively, the substrate is primarily oxidized in the first reaction chamber while increasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber from the first temperature to a second temperature under a second pressure in step S<b>820</b>. Then, the primarily oxidized substrate is secondarily oxidized in the first reaction chamber while the temperature of the first reaction chamber is increased from the second temperature to the third temperature under a second pressure in step S<b>830</b>. In addition, the secondarily oxidized substrate may be tertiarily oxidized in the first reaction chamber when the first reaction chamber is at the third temperature under the second pressure in step S<b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The oxidized substrate is cooled in the first reaction chamber while decreasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber from the third temperature to a fourth temperature under a third pressure in step S<b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">After the cooled substrate is unloaded from the first reaction chamber in step S<b>860</b>, the substrate is loaded into the second reaction chamber of the RTN apparatus in step S<b>870</b>. The oxidized substrate is nitrified in the second reaction chamber to form the oxynitride layer on the substrate in step S<b>880</b>. Here, the substrate is nitrified using a reaction gas including an ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) gas. The RTN apparatus may include a lamp heating device, a laser heating device, an electron beam heating device, an ion beam heating device, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Particularly, the substrate is loaded into the first reaction chamber after the first reaction chamber has the first pressure and the first temperature in step S<b>810</b>. The first pressure is about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr, and the first temperature is about 300 to about 550° C.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">While increasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber from the first temperature to the third temperature via the second temperature under the second pressure, a reaction gas is provided onto the substrate to thereby form an oxide layer of about 10 Å on the substrate in steps S<b>820</b> and S<b>830</b>. The difference between the first temperature and the third temperature may be advantageously adjusted to properly control the thickness of the oxide layer. For example, the third temperature is about 550 to about 950° C., and the temperature of the first reaction chamber is increased from the first temperature to the third temperature at a rate of about 2 to about 15° C./minute. While increasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber, the second pressure of the first reaction chamber is maintained at about 0.3 to about 20 Torr. The reaction gas may vary in accordance with the characteristics of the oxide layer formed on the substrate. For example, to form an oxide layer having high quality, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas and a hydrogen gas is provided onto the substrate by a wet oxidation process. Alternatively, to form a buffer oxide layer, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas or an oxygen gas and a hydrogen chloride is provided onto the substrate by a dry oxidation process or a clean oxidation process.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">However, the oxide layer may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> by a combination process of the wet, the dry or the clean oxidation process. For example, the substrate is primarily oxidized using the reaction gas including the oxygen gas and the hydrogen gas while increasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber from the first temperature to the second temperature under the second pressure in step S<b>820</b>. Subsequently, the primarily oxidized substrate is secondarily oxidized while increasing the temperature of the first reaction chamber from the second temperature to the third temperature under the second pressure in step S<b>830</b>. Additionally, the secondarily oxidized substrate may be tertiarily oxidized in the first reaction chamber after the first reaction chamber has the third temperature in step S<b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The oxidized substrate is cooled in the first reaction chamber while decreasing the temperature of the reaction chamber from the third temperature to the fourth temperature under the third pressure in step S<b>850</b>. Here, the temperature of the reaction chamber is reduced at a rate of about 2 to about 15° C./minute. The third pressure is more than the second pressure, and the fourth temperature is between the first temperature and the third temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In step S<b>860</b>, the substrate including the oxide layer thereon is unloaded from the first reaction chamber. The substrate is loaded into the second chamber using a transferring device in step S<b>870</b>. The substrate is nitrified in the second reaction chamber to form the oxynitride layer on the substrate in step S<b>880</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a rapid thermal nitration apparatus for forming the oxynitride layer on the substrate in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the RTN apparatus <b>200</b> includes a substrate holder <b>210</b> for supporting a substrate <b>10</b>, an energy supply member <b>220</b> for providing an energy to the substrate <b>10</b> to form an oxynitride layer thereon, a gas supply line <b>240</b> for providing a reaction gas onto the substrate <b>10</b>, a mass flow controller <b>245</b> for controlling the flow rate of the reaction gas, and a gas discharging line <b>250</b> for exhausting the reaction gas after forming the oxynitride layer.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Although the RTN apparatus <b>200</b> is the single type apparatus and has a relatively low throughput relative to that of the batch type apparatus, the maintenance of the RTN apparatus <b>200</b> is relatively simple and the process of forming the oxynitride layer may be carried out under various conditions using the RTN apparatus <b>200</b>. The RTN apparatus <b>200</b> may include the energy supply member <b>220</b> such as a halogen lamp, a laser beam generator, an electron beam generator, an ion beam generator, etc. When the energy supply member <b>220</b> is the halogen lamp, the substrate <b>10</b> is disposed on the substrate holder <b>210</b> of quartz, and lamps <b>220</b> placed over the substrate <b>10</b> provide heat to the substrate <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a plurality of circular lamps may be employed for uniformly heating a substrate having a large size.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">A reaction gas including an ammonia gas is provided onto the substrate <b>10</b> through the gas supply line <b>240</b>, thereby forming the oxynitride layer on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">As described above, the oxide layer is formed on the substrate <b>10</b> using the batch type apparatus, and then the oxynitride layer is formed on the substrate <b>10</b> using the RTN apparatus. Thus, the throughput of the process for forming the oxynitride layer may be increased and the oxynitride layer having a precise thickness may be obtained. In addition, when the oxide layer and/or the oxynitride layer are formed on the substrate, minute patterns of a semiconductor device, for example a DRAM device, an SRAM device or an LOGIC device may be easily formed on the oxide layer or the oxynitride layer. Further, the oxynitride layer prevents the diffusion of the impurities doped in the conductive layer of the semiconductor device, thereby improving the reliability of the semiconductor device.</p>
