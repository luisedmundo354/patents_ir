<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A three-axis antenna positioner has an X-Y over azimuth configuration, and includes an azimuth drive assembly, an X-axis drive assembly, and a Y-axis drive assembly. Each drive assembly is independently operable. The azimuth drive assembly imparts 540° azimuthal rotational motion to an antenna about an azimuth axis. The X-axis drive assembly rotates the antenna about a horizontal X-axis at elevation angles between −90° and +90°. The Y-axis drive assembly rotates the antenna about a Y-axis at elevation complement angles between −2° and +105°. The azimuth axis, the X-axis, and the Y-axis all intersect at a common intersection point, and are mutually orthogonal. A controller operates each drive assembly so as to minimize antenna tracking velocity and acceleration.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Satellite communications systems may be used to facilitate global exchange of information. In particular, significant growth is expected in the future for satellite communications in the higher transmission frequencies range (Ka-Band at 20-30 GHz), and at higher data rates. As one example, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites typically require high transmission frequencies. These LEO satellites may be linked to each other and to ground based stations to provide wireless access over the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to communicate with the LEO satellites and other high frequency satellites by tracking them with an antenna, rigorous tracking requirements may have to be met. As a first step, the positioner for the antenna may have to be capable of precise, full-hemispherical tracking.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional two-axis full-motion antenna positioners may have operational keyholes, or cones of silence, when tracking Low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. Although some three-axis designs may overcome many of the keyhole issues, they may still require relatively high velocity and acceleration capabilities. Some configurations may also be operationally constrained by the ground station latitude and satellite inclination angle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need for an antenna positioner system that can provide full hemispherical coverage without keyholes, for any satellite inclination angle and for any ground station latitude location, while minimizing the tracking velocity and acceleration requirements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An antenna positioner system for positioning an antenna to track a moving object may include an azimuth drive assembly configured to impart azimuthal rotational motion to an antenna about an azimuth axis. The antenna positioner system may further include an X-axis drive assembly configured to impart rotational motion to the antenna about a horizontal X-axis that is orthogonal to the azimuth axis. The antenna positioner system may further include a Y-axis drive assembly configured to impart rotational motion to the antenna about a Y-axis orthogonal to both the X-axis and the azimuth axis. The antenna positioner may further include a controller configured to control operation of the azimuth drive assembly, the X-axis drive assembly, and the Y-axis drive assembly so as to optimize tracking velocity and acceleration. The azimuth axis, the X-axis, and the Y-axis may all intersect at an intersection point.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of tracking a moving object with an antenna assembly may include imparting rotational motion to the antenna assembly about an azimuthal axis.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A three-axis antenna positioner system is described that has an XY over azimuth configuration. The XY over azimuth configuration provides full horizon-to-horizon hemispherical coverage, with no operational keyholes, for any satellite inclination angle and for any ground station latitude location. The XY over azimuth design may allow for three independent modes of operation in a single unit, and may also minimize the tracking velocity and acceleration requirements along each axis. The antenna positioner system may use two drives per axis to generate a bias drive mode that provides for zero backlash and maximum pointing and tracking accuracies. A controller for the antenna positioner may automatically select between two optimized dual-axis tracking modes, to configure the positioner system for minimum tracking dynamics.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a three-axis antenna positioner system <b>100</b> having an X-Y over azimuth configuration with all three axes intersecting at a single point. In overview, the antenna positioner system <b>100</b> may include: a pedestal base <b>105</b>; an azimuth drive assembly <b>300</b> mounted on the pedestal base; a riser weldment <b>115</b>; an X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b> attached to the riser weldment <b>115</b>; a Y-axis drive assembly <b>500</b> attached to the X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b>; and reflector support arms <b>135</b> that attach the reflector of the antenna to the positioner system <b>100</b>. A controller (e.g. an Antenna Control Unit or ACU <b>140</b>) may control the operation of the azimuth drive assembly <b>300</b>, the X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b>, and the Y-axis drive assembly <b>500</b> so as to optimize the antenna tracking dynamics. Each of the three drive assemblies may be operated independently from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the antenna positioner system <b>100</b> that supports, positions, and moves an antenna assembly <b>200</b> to point at and/or track a moving object. The moving object may include, but is not limited to, satellites, other spacecraft (e.g. the Space Shuttle or the Space Station), launch vehicles, missiles, and aircraft. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the antenna assembly <b>200</b> includes a parabolic reflector <b>210</b> and a feed <b>220</b>. It should of course be understood that the positioner system <b>100</b> may be used with antenna assemblies other than the illustrated parabolic antenna with reflector, including but not limited to sectoral antennas, flat panel antennas, and yagi antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the X-Y over azimuth configuration used in the antenna positioner <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> results in the same swept volume as a conventional two-axis EL/AZ (elevation-over-azimuth) configuration, while eliminating operational keyholes or cones of silence that typically occur when two-axis configurations such as EL/AZ and X-over-Y are used. Operational keyholes or cones of silence are angular coverage areas where unusually high values of axis angular dynamics are required in order to accurately point an antenna at a dynamic target such as a LEO satellite.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When a two-axis EL/AZ configuration is used for an antenna positioner, the antenna may track a satellite by rotating the reflector about two rotational axes, namely an azimuth axis for tracking its azimuth angle, and an elevation axis for tracking the satellite's elevation with respect to the horizon. With this configuration, the reflector may move up to 360 degrees in azimuth, and 0-90 degrees in elevation. In a two-axis X-Y tracking configuration, the independently operable X- and the Y-axis drives may be mounted on top of each other, and at 90 degrees with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Two-axis designs such as EL/AZ and XY may exhibit operational keyholes, depending on the inclination angle of the satellite orbit, resulting in the loss of critical data. Use of the EL/AZ design may result in a vertical cone of silence at or near the zenith of an overhead pass, i.e. at very high elevation angles. Very high slew rates may have to be used in order to minimize the operational keyholes. Use of the XY design may substantially overcome the zenith pass keyhole problem, but operational keyholes may occur at elevation angles near the horizon. This is because the XY tracking configuration may require high tracking dynamics at low elevation angles.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the illustrated embodiment of the antenna positioner system <b>100</b>, the azimuth drive assembly <b>300</b> may be mounted on the pedestal base <b>105</b>, and may impart azimuthal rotational motion to the antenna assembly about an azimuth axis. The X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b> may impart rotational motion to the antenna about a horizontal X-axis orthogonal to the azimuth axis. The rotation about the X-axis varies the elevation angle of the antenna, as measured with respect to the horizon. The Y-axis drive assembly <b>500</b> may impart cross-axis rotational motion to the antenna assembly about a Y-axis. The rotation about the Y-axis varies the elevation complement angle of the antenna. The Y-axis is orthogonal to both the X-axis and the azimuth axis. The X-axis, the Y-axis, and the azimuth axis all intersect at a common intersection point.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Because the X- and Y-axis drive assemblies are mounted on the azimuth drive assembly <b>300</b> in such a way that all three axes intersect at a common point, as is typical of an EL/AZ positioner, a minimal swept volume for the antenna may result. The XY over azimuth configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and described above combines the optimal capabilities of each of the two-axis configurations, into an integrated 3-axis design within a single unit.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b>. In overview, the X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b> may include: an X-axis drive shaft <b>405</b>; an X-axis motion encoder <b>410</b>; limit switches <b>417</b>; X-axis bull gear <b>420</b>; two X-axis drive trains <b>440</b>; and an X-axis drive housing <b>450</b>. The X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b> may be configured to impart to the antenna ±90° horizontal rotation about the X-axis, thereby varying the elevation angle of the antenna. This may be accomplished using the dual drive trains <b>440</b> coupled to the bull gear <b>420</b>. Each drive train <b>440</b> may include a servo motor/gearbox assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The X-axis drive shaft <b>405</b> may be a cylindrical steel weldment, and may be supported by precision ball bearings at two points of contact, in one exemplary embodiment.

In one embodiment, the X-axis motion encoder <b>410</b> may be a 16-bit encoder, although other types of encoders may be used in different embodiments of the drive assembly <b>400</b>. The limit switches <b>417</b> may be located above the bull gear <b>420</b>. The limit switches <b>417</b> combined with bull gear mounted elastomer stops may provide over-travel protection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a Y-axis drive assembly <b>500</b>. In overview, the Y-axis drive assembly <b>500</b> may include: a Y-axis shaft and housing <b>505</b>; a Y-axis motion encoder <b>510</b>; Y-axis bull gear <b>520</b>; and two Y-axis drive trains <b>540</b>. The Y-axis drive assembly <b>500</b> may be configured to impart −2° to +105° cross-axis rotary motion to the antenna assembly, thereby varying the elevation complement angle of the antenna assembly. By analogy to the X-axis drive assembly <b>400</b>, this may be accomplished using the dual drive trains <b>540</b> (i.e. motor/gearbox assemblies) coupled to the bull gear <b>520</b>. The encoder <b>510</b> may be located at one end of the Y-axis shaft <b>505</b>, and may be used to detect Y-axis motion.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The positioner system <b>100</b> may operate in a pure EL/AZ mode, or as a pure X-Y mode, depending on the satellite track. This is because the above-described X-Y over azimuth configuration, which has a common intersection point for all three axes, provides for both X-Y and EL/AZ tracking capabilities. This dual operating mode capability eliminates the need for full motion (180 degrees) Y-axis travel. The ACU <b>140</b> may thus be configured to limit the rotational motion around the Y-axis to between about −2° and about +105° in elevation complement angle. The limitation of Y-axis rotation motion may lower the volume swept by the rotating antenna, and may simplify the mounting of the antenna reflector. Also, it may also make it easier to counterweight the reflector, and may lower the cost of the positioner system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">All rotating mass may be balanced at the axes intersection point. Reflector support arms <b>135</b> may be provided, to counter balance the antenna reflector. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates a reflector support arm <b>135</b> for the antenna assembly <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In one embodiment of the antenna positioner system <b>100</b>, a pair of identical reflector support arms <b>135</b> may be mounted to the ends of the Y-axis shaft <b>505</b>. The support arms <b>135</b> may attach the reflector <b>210</b> of the antenna assembly <b>200</b> to the positioner system <b>100</b>. The support arms <b>135</b> may also be configured to provide counter-balancing for the reflector <b>210</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the reflector support arm <b>135</b> is a steel weldment constructed from standard structural shapes. In an exemplary embodiment, the left support arm may be bolted to the Y-axis bull gear, while the right support arm may be attached to the Y-axis shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The controller for the X-Y over azimuth positioner, e.g. the ACU <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> as being located at the base of the azimuth axis, may provide real-time control of the drive assemblies along all three axes. The ACU <b>140</b> may automatically configure the positioner system <b>100</b> for minimum tracking dynamics, and eliminate all keyholes for full hemispherical coverage. In particular, the ACU <b>140</b> may automatically select between two optimized dual-axis tracking modes so that the tracking velocities are always near their theoretical minimum, as described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ACU <b>140</b> may implement a servo control loop, together with the internal servo controllers embedded within the drive trains. The drive trains along each axis may be configured to close an internal velocity or positioning control loop, using feedback from the motor encoders at the respective axes. The ACU <b>140</b> may be configured to close the positioner velocity and positioning control loops by integrating feedback from the motion encoders. The ACU <b>140</b> may use a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) interface for status, control, and monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ACU <b>140</b> may be configured to automatically select between two optimized dual-axis tracking modes, and to configure the positioner system <b>100</b> for minimum tracking dynamics. In other words, the ACU <b>140</b> may operate the positioner system <b>100</b> in a pure EL/AZ mode, or as a pure X-Y mode, depending on the satellite track. This is because the X-Y over azimuth configuration described above, with a common intersection point for all three axes, provides for both X-Y and EL/AZ tracking capabilities, which enables the positioner system <b>100</b> to minimize the required tracking velocities and accelerations for any given pass. This may increase tracking performance and accuracy, while minimizing power consumption and wear and tear on mechanical components, thus extending the system lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the ACU <b>140</b> may be configured to implement mode optimization by calculating the azimuth and elevation at the highest elevation angle for any given pass, and using this information to select the optimum mode for tracking. If the ACU <b>140</b> determines that the highest expected elevation angle during the pass is greater than or equal to 45 degrees, the ACU <b>140</b> may select the X-Y mode and may lock the active azimuth axis to an angle which minimizes the tracking velocities and accelerations through out the pass. The ACU <b>140</b> may then support the pass by effecting rotational motions along the X-axis and the Y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the ACU <b>140</b> determines that the highest expected elevation angle during the pass will be less than 45 degrees, the ACU <b>140</b> may select the Y over Azimuth mode, similar to a pure Elevation-over-Azimuth system. Again, the ACU <b>140</b> may optimize this mode to minimize required tracking velocities and accelerations for the pass. The ACU <b>140</b> may statically set and locks the X-axis to zero elevation angle (i.e. “zenith”), then supports the pass by effecting rotational motions along the active azimuth axis and the Y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This capability of operating in either mode may eliminate keyhole effects at both the horizon and the zenith positions. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which illustrates a graph of the angular velocities about the optimized x-axis, the optimized y-axis, the azimuth axis, and the elevation axis, as a function of the maximum elevation angle during a pass. As shown by the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, operational keyholes are eliminated for all elevation angles ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, i.e. from zenith to horizon. For all elevation angles, the angular velocities about all axes are under about 0.7 radians per sec.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The above-described dual mode operation may significantly reduce tracking velocities and acceleration, and may result in an optimal tracking performance. By minimizing tracking dynamics, power requirements and stress on all drive components may be greatly reduced, resulting in longer life and lower lifecycle costs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In sum, an antenna positioner system with an X-Y over active azimuth configuration has been described. The antenna positioner system provides full hemispherical coverage at all elevations above the horizon, unconstrained by satellite inclination angle and ground station latitude, eliminating all operational keyholes. The operation of the positioner system may be controlled by a controller so as to substantially eliminate backlash, minimize tracking dynamics, and maximize pointing accuracy.</p>
