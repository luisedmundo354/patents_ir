<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to a display apparatus, and more particularly, to a display apparatus having a connecting port for an external TV tuner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a display apparatus displays a video signal received from signal sources, such as a video card and a TV card of a computer. Recently, a display apparatus has been developed with improved utility, which can display a video signal received from various external signal sources, such as a videotape recorder (VTR) and a camcorder, and the display apparatus is out on the market. Further, a display apparatus has been developed which has an internal TV tuner and displays a TV signal processed by itself, and the display apparatus is out on the market.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the display apparatus including the TV tuner, a user cannot separate a TV function from a monitor function. That is, the display apparatus having the TV tuner may only be employed for both the TV and monitor functions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above-described shortcomings and user's need, and an object of the present invention is to provide a display apparatus to which a TV tuner is selectively added at a user's option, and a method of controlling the TV tuner through an OSD (on screen display).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention may be accomplished by providing a display apparatus having a signal source connecting port through which a video signal source is connected, the display apparatus including: a TV tuner connecting port to connect to a TV tuner; a selection part to select one of a video signal, transmitted from the signal source connecting port, and a TV signal, transmitted from the TV tuner connecting port to be displayed, to control the TV tuner; and a micro controller displaying the one of the video signal and the TV signal according to the selection from the selection part, displaying a TV tuner control OSD when the TV signal is selected, and transmitting a control signal from the selection part to the TV tuner through the TV tuner connecting port based on the TV tuner control OSD.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The micro controller displays a signal selection OSD to select the one of the video signal and the TV signal to be displayed when the selection part is activated and the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The display apparatus further includes an OSD control button to display the TV tuner control OSD and to control the TV tuner based on the TV tuner control OSD. The micro controller displays the TV tuner control OSD when the OSD control button is pushed and the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus. The TV tuner control OSD includes channel icons to select a channel of the TV tuner. The display apparatus further includes a selection button, and a touch screen, wherein the TV tuner control OSD is selected by at least one of the selection button and the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The display apparatus further includes a TV tuner sensor detecting whether the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus through the TV tuner connecting port. When the TV tuner sensor does not detect the TV tuner, the micro controller displays an OSD indicating that the TV tuner is not connected to the display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The TV tuner sensor includes a transistor, wherein when the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus, the transistor is turned on, outputting a first signal of a first state, and when the TV tuner is disconnected from the display apparatus, the transistor is turned off, outputting a second signal of a second state opposite to the first state, and a resistor connected to the transistor</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention provides a method of controlling a display apparatus including signal source connecting ports and a TV tuner connecting port to connect to a TV tuner, the method including: detecting whether the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus; displaying a signal selection OSD when the TV tuner is detected; selecting a TV signal through the signal selection OSD; displaying a TV tuner control OSD when the TV signal is selected; and transmitting a control signal to the TV tuner through the TV tuner connecting port in response to the selection of the TV signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The signal selection OSD includes icons to select a video signal outputted from the TV tuner to be displayed on a video card of a computer and/or a VTR. The TV tuner control OSD includes channel icons to select a channel of the TV tuner. The method further includes displaying an OSD indicating that the TV tuner is not connected to the display apparatus when the TV tuner is not detected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention provides a display apparatus including a signal source connecting port through which a video signal source is connected, including: a TV tuner connecting port to connect to a TV tuner; a selection part selecting a video signal from the video signal source or a TV signal from the TV tuner connecting port to control the TV tuner; and a micro controller displaying the video signal or the TV signal according to the selection from the selection part, displaying a TV tuner control OSD when the TV signal is selected, and transmitting an OSD control signal selected based on the TV tuner control OSD to the TV tuner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention provides a display apparatus connectable to a VTR, a TV tuner, and a computer and including a signal source connecting port through which a video signal source is connected, the display apparatus including: a TV tuner sensor detecting whether the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus; a video decoder converting a video signal transmitted from the VTR or the TV tuner into a digital video signal; a video signal processing part processing a video signal from the computer and/or the digital video signal from the video decoder; a selection part selecting the video signal from the computer and/or the digital video signal from the VTR or the TV tuner to be displayed and outputting a selected video signal indicative thereof; a display part; and a micro controller controlling the video decoder and the video signal processing part so as to display the selected video signal from the selection part in the display part.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention provides a method of controlling a display apparatus including signal source connecting ports and a TV tuner connecting port to connect to a TV tuner, the method including: detecting whether the TV tuner is connected to the display apparatus to prevent a signal selection OSD from being displayed when the TV tuner is not connected to the display apparatus; displaying the signal selection OSD when the TV tuner is detected; selecting a TV signal through the signal selection OSD; displaying a TV tuner control OSD when the TV signal is selected; and transmitting a control signal to the TV tuner through the TV tuner connecting port in response to the selection of the TV signal, allowing a user to selectively add a TV function through the connecting port for the TV tuner.</p>
