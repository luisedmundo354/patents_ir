<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a defective product inspection apparatus (probe apparatus), a probe positioning method and a probe moving method, for measuring an electric characteristic of a microscopic area of an electronic element.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A defective product inspection apparatus is well known as the prior art, in which a probe contacts an area of a specimen (an electronic element) at which an electric characteristic needs to be inspected. An electric current-voltage characteristic or the like of the electronic element can be measured through the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">JP-A-9-326425 discloses that a probe is arranged in a specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to measure a minute electric potential characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP-A-2000-147070 discloses a probe apparatus in which a probe information image showing an information for operating desirably a probe is formed on a display, a specimen and the probe are shown in the probe information image on the display, a probe operating image area for moving the probe is formed on the display, the probe is moved through a probe controller in accordance with an operating signal from the probe operating image area, and a movement amount from an actual current position of a front end of the probe to a target position thereof is calculated by designating each of the actual current position of the front and of the probe and the target position of the front and of the probe on the probe information image so that the probe controller operates in accordance with the movement amount to move the probe to the target position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">JP-A-2000-181898 discloses a probe apparatus including a charged particle beam projection device, a specimen stage for holding a specimen holder with a specimen thereon, a specimen chamber containing the specimen stage, a probe driving mechanism for moving the probe to contact the specimen in the specimen chamber, a specimen antechamber including a first stocker connected through a valve to the specimen chamber to store temporarily the specimen holder, and a first transfer device for moving the specimen holder at least between the specimen antechamber and the specimen chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">JP-A-2002-523784 discloses that an optical microscope slides on a microscope bridge to move to a position on a wafer chuck, and is rotated to a position for preventing from standing in the way of enabling the probe to firstly be positioned in an area of the specimen to which an user's attention is drawn.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a defective product inspection apparatus and method for adjusting a positional relationship between a specimen and a probe, by which apparatus and method an electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently (with making a time period needed for the inspection as small as possible) while the specimen is restrained from being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the invention, a defective product inspection apparatus for measuring an electric characteristic of a specimen through (or with) a contact between a probe and the specimen (so that the measured electric characteristic is compared with a predetermined electric characteristic to judge whether the specimen as a product is defective or not), comprises, a specimen table for holding the specimen thereon, a probe holder for holding the probe thereon, a first measuring device for measuring a positional relationship between the probe and the specimen, and a second measuring device for measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen, wherein (a measuring accuracy (resolution capability, magnification or the like) of the second measuring device is superior to a measuring accuracy (resolution capability, magnification or the like) of the first measuring device,) the apparatus further includes a base table holding thereon the specimen table and the probe holder in such a manner that the specimen table and the probe holder are movable with respect to each other on the base table to adjust the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen on the base table so that a contact area of the probe and a desired area of the specimen are capable of being brought into contact with each other, and the base table is movable between (or from) a first position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the first measuring device and (or to) a second position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the second measuring device. Incidentally, the specimen table is movable with respect to the base table, and the probe holder is movable with respect to the base table, so that a positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and a positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table are adjustable independent of each other, and one of the positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and the positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table is adjustable when the other one the positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and the positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table is stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since (the measuring accuracy of the second measuring device is superior to the measuring accuracy of the first measuring device, and) the a base table holding thereon the specimen table and the probe holder in such a manner that the specimen table and the probe holder are movable with respect to each other on the base table to adjust the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen on the base table so that a contact area of the probe and the desired area of the specimen are capable of being brought into contact with each other, and the base table is movable between (or from) the first position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the first measuring device and (or to) the second position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the second measuring device, a time period which is needed for measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position with the measuring accuracy superior to the measuring accuracy at the first position can be decreased by the measurement at the first position, so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently. If the probe and the specimen are brought into contact with each other at the second position, a time period which is needed for bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position can be minimized, so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently. The base table may be movable with respect to at least one (or each) of the first and second measuring devices.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">If the first measuring device is capable of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen when the specimen is prevented from being irradiated with at least one of an ion beam and an electron beam, the specimen is prevented from being damaged by the at least one of the ion beam and the electron beam. If the second measuring device is capable of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen by irradiating the specimen with at least one of an ion beam and an electron beam, the specimen is restrained from being damaged by the at least one of the ion beam and the electron beam, by the decrease of the time period for at least one of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position and bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first measuring device may be capable of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen in each of first and second directions perpendicular to each other, so that the distance between the probe and the specimen in each of first and second directions perpendicular to each other can be measured to increase the accuracy for measuring the positional relationship. If the first direction is parallel to a thickness direction of the specimen, the first measuring device has a first magnification for magnifying an image corresponding to the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen in the first direction and a second magnification for magnifying another image corresponding to the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen in the second direction, and the first magnification is higher than the second magnification so that a contact or distance between the probe and specimen in the first direction is measurable more accurately in comparison with an overlap or distance between the probe and specimen in the second direction, the time period for at least one of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position and bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position can be decreased so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The defective product inspection apparatus may further comprises a specimen chamber being capable of being kept in vacuumed condition and containing therein the first and second positions (more preferably also a third position as described below) in such a manner that the probe and the specimen are kept (continuously) in the vacuum environment of the specimen chamber (to prevent the probe and the specimen from taken out from the vacuum environment, that is, the specimen chamber of vacuumed condition containing therein the first, second and third positions), while the base table is moved between (or from) the first position and (or to) the second position, so that the specimen is prevented completely by the vacuumed condition of the specimen chamber from being damaged by an environment matter surrounding the specimen chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The apparatus further may comprise a third position at which the probe is replaced by another probe, and the base table may be movable among the first, second and third positions in the specimen chamber, so that the specimen is prevented completely by the vacuumed condition of the specimen chamber from being damaged by the replacement or exchange of the probe. It is preferable for increasing the efficiency for measuring the electric characteristic of the specimen that a distance between the first and second positions is shorter than a distance between the second and third positions.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferable for decreasing the time period for at least one of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position and bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position that the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is fixed while the base table moves from the first position to the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is preferable for correctly bringing the contact area of the probe and the desired area of the specimen into contact with each other that the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is a positional relationship between the contact area of the probe and the desired area of the specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, in a method for adjusting a positional relationship between a specimen and a probe to measure an electric characteristic of the specimen through (or with) a contact between the probe and the specimen (so that the measured electric characteristic is compared with a predetermined electric characteristic to judge whether the specimen as a product is defective or not), comprises the steps of: positioning a base table holding thereon a specimen table holding the specimen and a probe holder holding the probe, at a first position to measure the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the first position, and subsequently positioning the base table at a second position to measure the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position so that a contact area (preferably a front end) of the probe and a desired area of the specimen are capable of contacting each other at the second position,</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">the base table holds the specimen table and the probe holder at each of the first and second positions in such a manner that the specimen table and the probe holder are movable with respect to each other on the base table to adjust the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen, and a measuring accuracy (resolution capability, magnification or the like) at the second position is superior to a measuring accuracy (resolution capability, magnification or the like) at the first position. Incidentally, the specimen table is movable with respect to the base table, and the probe holder is movable with respect to the base table, so that a positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and a positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table are adjustable independent of each other, and one of the positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and the positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table is adjustable when the other one the positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and the positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table is stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the base table holds the specimen table and the probe holder at each of the first and second positions in such a manner that the specimen table and the probe holder are movable with respect to each other on the base table to adjust the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen, and the measuring accuracy (resolution capability) at the second position is superior to a measuring accuracy (resolution capability) at the first position, a time period which is needed for measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position with the measuring accuracy (resolution capability) superior to the measuring accuracy (resolution capability) at the first position can be decreased by the measurement at the first position, so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If at the first position, the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measured when the specimen is prevented from being irradiated with at least one of an ion beam and an electron beam, the specimen is prevented from being damaged by the at least one of the ion beam and the electron beam. If at the second position, the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measured while irradiating the specimen with at least one of an ion beam and an electron beam, the specimen is restrained from being damaged by the at least one of the ion beam and the electron beam, by the decrease of the time period for at least one of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position and bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If at the first position, the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen in each of first and second directions perpendicular to each other is measured, the first direction is parallel to a thickness direction of the specimen, and a first magnification for magnifying an image corresponding to the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen in the first direction is higher than a second magnification for magnifying another image corresponding to the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen in the second direction (so that a contact or distance between the probe and specimen in the first direction is measurable more accurately in comparison with an overlap or distance between the probe and specimen in the second direction), a contact or distance between the probe and specimen in the first direction is measurable more accurately in comparison with an overlap or distance between the probe and specimen in the second direction, and the time period for at least one of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position and bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position can be decreased so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a defective product inspection device <b>1</b> has a specimen chamber <b>7</b> containing a specimen stage including a specimen holder <b>2</b> on which a specimen is to be held, and a specimen holder receiver <b>17</b> holding the specimen holder <b>2</b>, and a probe stage <b>6</b> including a probe unit <b>33</b>. An electronic optical device <b>4</b> (a charged particle apparatus) such as an SEM (scanning electron microscope), a focused ion beam (FIB) device or the like including an ion pump <b>44</b> is arranged on a frame of the specimen chamber <b>7</b> to opposite to the specimen holder <b>2</b>. Further, a probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> is arranged in the vicinity of the electronic optical device <b>4</b>. A charged particle beam (electron beam or ion beam) is projected from the electronic optical device <b>4</b> toward the specimen holder to monitor movements of the specimen and a probe <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> arranged in the vicinity of the electronic optical device <b>4</b> on an upper surface of the frame of the specimen chamber <b>7</b> has a probe rough-approaching optical microscope and a CCD camera for obtaining an image so that a condition in rough approach of the probe <b>3</b> with respect to the specimen is monitored by obtaining its image. Further, the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> has a probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>a </i>for monitoring in a vertical direction and a probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>b </i>for monitoring in a horizontal direction, so that the condition in rough approaching between the prove and the specimen can be monitored securely in two directions perpendicular to each other. In this case, a magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>b </i>for magnifying the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching as seen in the horizontal direction is made higher than a magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>a </i>for magnifying the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching as seen in the vertical direction, because the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching obtained by the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>a </i>needs to include a plurality of the probes <b>3</b> which need to be approached each other and horizontally positioned over respective areas of the specimen so that at least one electric characteristic of the specimen is detected from the areas of the specimen after the probes <b>3</b> are brought into contact with the areas of the specimen respectively. Each of the probes is moved downwardly to a position adjacent to the specimen while monitoring the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching as seen in the horizontal direction, and the probes are moved to be adjacent to each other and be separated from each other with a slight distance therebetween or thereamong as seen in the vertical direction. Subsequently, each of the probes is brought into contact with the respective one of the areas of the specimen by moving downwardly each of the probes while monitoring a difference between a focusing condition of each of the probes and a focusing condition of the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen to be decreased in an image as seen in the vertical direction formed by the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, that is, while monitoring a focusing position of the electronic optical device <b>4</b> at which each of the probes is focused and a focusing position of the electronic optical device <b>4</b> at which the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen or an area closely adjacent to the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen is focused. If a distance between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen is made as small as possible before the downward movement of each of the probes on the basis of the image formed by the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, a time period for the downward movement of each of the probes for the contact between each of the probe and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen on the basis of the image formed by the electronic optical device <b>4</b> can be small to decrease an amount of the charged particle beam with which the specimen is irradiated by the electronic optical device <b>4</b>. Therefore, the magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>b </i>is made higher than the magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b><i>a </i>to improve an accuracy for measuring a positional relationship between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A stage includes a base table <b>49</b> on which a specimen stage <b>50</b> on which the specimen holder <b>2</b> for holding the specimen is mounted and the probe unit <b>33</b> are mounted, and a base plate <b>48</b> on which the base table <b>49</b> is guided linearly and moved horizontally to position a combination of a set of the probes and the specimen at desired one of a fine or finish positioning position just under the electronic optical device <b>4</b> for measuring extremely accurately the positional relationship between each of the probes (preferably the front end contacting areas of the probes) and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen and bringing each of the probes into contact with corresponding desired electrode of the specimen by moving each of the probes (preferably with an extremely slight adjustment of the positional relationship between each of the probes and the corresponding desired electrode of the specimen as seen in the thickness direction of the specimen), a rough-approaching positioning position just under the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> for measuring the positional relationship between or among the probes and the positional relationship between each of the probes and the specimen and positioning each of the probes or the set of the probes with respect to the specimen to make a distance between or among the probes to be included by an area as seen in the direction parallel to the thickness direction not more than a visible or measurable scope of the electronic optical device <b>4</b> and to make a distance between each of the probes and the specimen or a distance between the set of the probes and the specimen as seen in another direction perpendicular to the thickness direction not more than a predetermined value and more than zero so that each of the proves and the set of the probes are separated slightly (as shortly as possible while keeping a minimum distance or clearance therebetween) from the specimen as seen in another direction perpendicular to the thickness direction of the specimen, and a probe exchange position just under a probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> for removing desired one of the prove holders <b>31</b> including the respective probes <b>3</b> from corresponding one of the probe units <b>33</b> to be withdrawn into the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> and subsequently bringing a substitute one of the probe holders <b>31</b> from the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> to be set onto the corresponding one of the probe units <b>33</b>.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(a) specimen stage <b>50</b></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The specimen stage <b>50</b> includes the y table <b>62</b>, x table <b>61</b> and z table <b>63</b>, <b>63</b><i>a </i>to be driven respective driving mechanisms to be moved in respective y, x and z directions to align the area of the specimen within the visible or measurable scope of the electronic optical device <b>4</b>. Incidentally, the positional relationship among the probes is adjusted by the x and y tables of the prove units <b>33</b> in accordance with the positional relationship among the electrodes on the area of the specimen to align the probes respectively with the electrodes on the area of the specimen in the thickness direction of the specimen under the electronic optical device <b>4</b> after the positional relationship between or among the probes is adjusted under the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> so that the probes are included by an area as seen in the thickness direction of the specimen not more than the visible or measurable scope of the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, and each of the probes is driven in the thickness direction of the specimen by corresponding one of the z tables of the prove units <b>33</b> to be brought into contact with the corresponding one of the electrodes under the electronic optical device <b>4</b>. Under the electrodes under the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, each of the probes is moved by the y and x tables of the corresponding one of the prove units <b>33</b> to make each of the probes and the corresponding one of the electrodes overlap each other as seen in the thickness direction. The x and y tables of the prove units <b>33</b> are used to adjust the positional relationship among the probes in accordance with the positional relationship among the desired electrodes of the specimen as seen in the thickness direction of the specimen, and the z tables of the prove units <b>33</b> are used to bring each of the probes into contact with the corresponding one of the desired electrodes of the specimen. The x and y tables of the specimen stage <b>50</b> are used to align the area including the desired electrodes of the specimen with the visible or measurable scope of the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, and the z table of the specimen stage <b>50</b> may be used to make a distance between the area including the desired electrodes of the specimen and the set of probes (the set of the contact areas of the probes to be positioned in accordance with the positional relationship among the desired electrodes of the specimen) as small as possible under the probe rough-approaching image forming device before bringing each of the probes into contact with the corresponding one of the desired electrodes of the specimen by the z tables of the prove units <b>33</b> under the electronic optical device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The y and x tables <b>62</b> and <b>61</b> are driven by the respective DC motors through respective ball-screws in the specimen chamber and guided by cross-roller guides. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the z table <b>63</b> is moved by driving a ball screw <b>63</b><i>e </i>by the DC motor <b>63</b><i>b </i>mounted on the z table body <b>63</b><i>a </i>through bevel gears <b>63</b><i>g</i>, <b>63</b><i>h </i>and shafts <b>63</b><i>c</i>, <b>63</b><i>d</i>. The z table is guided linearly by a cross-roller guide. The specimen holder <b>2</b> for holding a specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the specimen holder receiver <b>17</b> mounted on the z table <b>63</b>. Therefore, the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is movable with respect to an electron beam <b>69</b> in x, y and z directions. The specimen holder <b>2</b> on the z table <b>63</b> is movable among a measuring position, a specimen exchange position and a probe exchange position. The measuring position is a position at which a distance between the probe and the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is decreased to be made as small as possible under the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> and the probe is brought into contact with the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>under the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, the specimen exchange position is a position lower than the measuring position, and the probe exchange position is a position lower than the specimen exchange position, so that an undesirable contact between the probe <b>3</b> and the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is prevented during each of the probe exchange operation and the specimen exchange operation. The stage <b>50</b> may includes a positional sensor such as a linear scale, an encoder or the like to measure quantitatively the position of each of the tables of the stage <b>50</b> during the operations, so that an accuracy and repeatability of the movement is obtainable. Examples of arrangement of the positional sensors are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The positional condition of the z table is measurable by the encoder <b>63</b><i>f </i>connected to the shaft <b>63</b><i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The positional conditions of the e table <b>61</b> and y table <b>62</b> are measurable by the linear scales mounted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The linear scale has mirrors <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>a </i>mounted on the x table <b>61</b> and y table <b>62</b> and sensor elements <b>61</b><i>b</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>. In this case, the encoder for measuring the rotary angle of the DC motor is used for the z table, and the linear scales are used for the x table <b>61</b> and y table <b>62</b>, but the encoders, linear scales or combinations thereof may be used for all of the tables.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">During the monitoring by the SEM, the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>mounted on the specimen stage <b>50</b> is electrically grounded through the specimen stage <b>50</b> and the specimen chamber <b>7</b> to prevent an effect by a charging up. When an electric characteristic of the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is measured, the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is preferably isolated electrically from the specimen stage <b>50</b> and the specimen chamber <b>7</b>. Further, for preventing the effect of the charging up, a beam blanking is effective. For the electrical insulation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an insulating member <b>18</b> is arranged between the specimen holder receiver <b>17</b> and the z table <b>63</b>, the specimen holder receiver <b>17</b> with the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>thereon is connected to a cable <b>20</b>, and the cable <b>20</b> extends from the fixing member <b>47</b> through the plate <b>71</b> to an outside of the vacuumed environment so that the cable <b>20</b> is connected to a grounded terminal through a switch <b>19</b>. By this structure, during the SEM monitoring, the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is grounded by operating the switch <b>19</b> to prevent the effect caused by the noise. Further, by connecting the cable <b>20</b> through the switch <b>19</b> not to the ground but to an electric characteristic measuring device, the electric characteristic of the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>such as absorption current or the like is measurable without the effect of the noise from the specimen stage <b>50</b> and the specimen chamber <b>7</b>. Further, the specimen holder receiver <b>17</b> may includes a guard electrode and a grounded electrode similarly to the probe units <b>33</b> and the probe holders <b>31</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, so that the cable is connected through the three phase coaxial cable to the outside of the vacuumed environment. Therefore, the electric isolation for the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is improved.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(b) base table <b>49</b></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With making reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a process for positioning the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the probes <b>3</b> in the specimen chamber is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the base table <b>49</b> includes the Y table <b>64</b> and X table <b>65</b> to be positioned in y and x directions respectively. The stage <b>50</b> and each of the prove holders <b>31</b> are mounted on the base table <b>49</b> to adjust and fix the positional relationship between the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>and each of the probes on the base table <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the base table <b>49</b>, the probe units <b>33</b> forming the probe stage <b>6</b>, the probe unit base <b>34</b> for supporting the probe units <b>33</b> and the probe unit bracket <b>35</b> are mounted. Each of the prove units <b>33</b> can position the probe in y, x and z directions through the prove holder <b>31</b> supported by each of the prove units <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the base table <b>49</b> is moved on the base plate <b>48</b> along a linear guide by a ball-screw and a servo motor to position briefly a combination of the specimen and the set of the probes with respect to each of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b>, the electronic optical device <b>4</b> and the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b>. The Y table <b>64</b> and X table <b>65</b> of the base table <b>49</b> position accurately the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes with respect to each of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b>, the electronic optical device <b>4</b> and the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes are positioned to each of A position under the electronic optical device <b>4</b>, B position under the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> and C position under the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> while the vacuumed environment surrounding the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes is being kept during the movement of the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes among the A, B and C positions within the specimen chamber.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(3) SEM</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The SEM arranged on the upper portion of the specimen chamber is an example of the electronic optical device <b>4</b> for monitoring the positional relationship between each of the probes (each of the contact areas of the proves) and the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen to bring each of the probes in contact with the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen. The vacuuming operation for the SEM is performed by the ion pump <b>44</b>. On the other hand, the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> including the optical microscope monitors the positional relationship between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen without irradiating the specimen to bring each of the probes to a position close to the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen with making a distance (more than zero) between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen as small as possible.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(4) Specimen Chamber <b>7</b></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The specimen chamber <b>4</b> includes an upper cover and a specimen chamber case as the frame, the base <b>48</b> is attached to the plate <b>71</b> through the fixing member <b>47</b> at the side surface of the specimen chamber case, the probe units <b>33</b> are mounted on the base table <b>49</b> in the specimen chamber, and the specimen exchange chamber <b>8</b> is attached to another side surface of the specimen chamber case. The probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b>, the electronic optical device <b>4</b> and the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> are mounted on the upper cover. The specimen chamber <b>7</b> is fixed to a bearing plate mounted on a vibration absorbing mount on the bracket <b>25</b>. The specimen chamber <b>7</b> is vacuumed by the turbo molecular pump (TMP) <b>11</b> and the dry pump (DP) <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(5) Optical Microscope for Rough-Approaching, CCD Camera and Rough-Approaching Image Forming Device</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>whose electrical characteristic needs to be measured is a semiconductor including plugs generally connected a gate, a source, a drain and a well respectively to be connected by the probes respectively. The plug may have a minimum diameter of tens of nanometers, so that a SEM with high resolution is necessary for bringing the probe into contact with the plug. However, by irradiating the semiconductor specimen with the electron and/or ion beam, there is a probability of that the semiconductor specimen is damaged, so that it is preferable for a time period of irradiating the semiconductor specimen with the electron and/or ion beam to be made as short as possible. Therefore, on the basis of the image of the probe rough-approaching image forming device <b>10</b> displayed on the image display part <b>15</b>, a distance between each of the probes and corresponding one of the plugs (electrodes) of the specimen as seen in the thickness direction of the semiconductor specimen is made as small as possible or preferably zero, and a gap or clearance therebetween as seen in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction is made as small as possible but is prevented from being zero. This operation is performed while an image showing the positional relationship between the probes and the specimen surface as obtained by the probe rough-approaching optical microscope and the CCD camera attached thereto and displayed on the image display portion <b>15</b> is monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The magnification on the image display portion <b>15</b> is tens to form an image including the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the probes <b>3</b> adjacent to each other as close as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A light source is arranged in the vicinity of the probe rough-approaching optical microscope. The monitoring by the probe rough-approaching optical microscope and CCD camera and the light supply from the light source into the specimen chamber is performed through a window aperture <b>39</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(6) Specimen Exchange Chamber <b>8</b></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The specimen exchange chamber <b>8</b> is arranged to exchange the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>while keeping the environment vacuum condition surrounding the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>in the specimen chamber <b>7</b> and vacuumed by the dry pump <b>52</b>. The specimen exchange chamber <b>8</b> can be isolated fluidly from the specimen chamber <b>7</b> by the gate valve <b>21</b>. When the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is introduced into the specimen chamber <b>7</b>, a male screw of a front end of an exchange bar <b>29</b> as a transfer member for the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the specimen holder <b>2</b> is screwed into a female screw of the specimen holder <b>2</b> with the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>thereon, the gate valve <b>21</b> is opened, and the specimen holder <b>2</b> is inserted onto the specimen holder receiver <b>17</b> attached to an upper end of the z table <b>63</b> of the specimen stage <b>50</b>. When the specimen <b>2</b><i>a </i>is taken out of the specimen chamber, a reverse operation is performed. Therefore, a time period for the specimen exchange can be decreased.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(7) Probe Exchange Chamber <b>9</b></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> is arranged to exchange the probe <b>3</b> while keeping the environment vacuum condition surrounding the probe <b>3</b> in the specimen chamber <b>7</b> so that a time period for the probe exchange is decreased.

The probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> is vacuumed by the turbo molecular pump <b>51</b> and the dry pump <b>52</b>. The turbo molecular pump <b>51</b> is used to accelerate a vacuuming operation for the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b>, because if the vacuuming operation for the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> is brought about by the dry pump <b>52</b> without the turbo molecular pump <b>51</b>, a great volume of the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b> in which a pressure cannot be decreased sufficiently within a short time period by the dry pump <b>52</b> without the turbo molecular pump <b>51</b> causes a great increase of the inner pressure of the specimen chamber <b>7</b> when the gate valve <b>23</b> is opened to exchange the probe <b>3</b> so that a time period for making the pressure in the specimen chamber <b>7</b> at the same value as the previous pressure before opening the gate valve <b>23</b> becomes long.</p>

The stocker including the used probe holders <b>31</b> is taken out of the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b>, and unused ones of the probe holders <b>31</b> are inserted onto the stocker to be introduced into the probe exchange chamber <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the probe holder <b>31</b> is transferred from the stocker to the probe unit <b>33</b>, the latch key <b>96</b> of the probe exchange rod <b>94</b> is engaged with the latch receiver <b>95</b> on the probe holder <b>31</b>, and the probe exchange bar <b>92</b> is moved upward by a rack-and-pinion mechanism to withdraw the probe holder <b>31</b> from the stocker. The gate valve <b>23</b> is opened and the probe exchange bar <b>92</b> is moved downward to introduce the probe holder <b>31</b> into the specimen chamber. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the holder receiver is arranged on the z table <b>83</b> of the probe unit <b>33</b>. The base table <b>49</b> is driven to move the holder receiver below the transferred probe holder <b>31</b>, the probe exchange bar <b>92</b> is rotated to make orientations of the holder receiver and the probe holder <b>31</b> consistent with each other, and the exchange bar <b>92</b> is moved downward to insert the probe holder <b>31</b> into the holder receiver.
