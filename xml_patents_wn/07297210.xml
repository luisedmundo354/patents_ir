<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This invention relates to a plating apparatus, and more particularly, to an electroless plating apparatus useful for forming an embedded interconnects that an electric conductor, such as copper or silver, is imbedded in fine recesses for interconnects formed in the surface of a substrate like a semiconductor substrate, and for forming a protective layer for protecting the surface of the interconnects.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">As an electroless plating apparatus, there has been generally known an apparatus comprising a plating bath for holding an electroless plating solution which overflows during a plating process, and a vertically movable holding portion disposed above the plating bath for holding a workpiece to be plated, such as a substrate, with a plating surface facing downwardly (facedown), whereby the workpiece held by the holding portion is dipped into the plating solution in the plating bath. Further, there has been also generally known a plating apparatus comprising a holding portion for holding a workpiece, such as a substrate, with the plating surface facing upwardly (faceup), and a plating solution supply portion (nozzle) for supplying a plating solution to an upper surface (plating surface) of the workpiece held by the holding portion, whereby the plating solution flows along the upper surface of the workpiece held by the holding portion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">In recent years, as the processing speed and integration of a semiconductor chip becomes higher, there has been a growing tendency to replace aluminum or aluminum alloy with copper having a low electric resistivity and a high electromigration resistance as metallic materials for forming interconnection circuits on the semiconductor substrate. These kind of copper interconnects are generally formed by filling fine recesses formed in the surface of the substrate with copper. As a method for forming the copper interconnects, CVD, sputtering, and plating are known, but plating is generally used. In any case, after a copper film is deposited on the surface of the substrate, the surface of the substrate is polished to a flat finish by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">In the case of interconnects formed by such a process, the embedded interconnects have an exposed surface after the flattening processing. When an additional embedded interconnect structure is formed on such an exposed surface of interconnects of a semiconductor substrate, the following problems may be encountered. For example, during the formation of a new SiO<sub>2 </sub>interlevel dielectric, the exposed surface of the pre-formed interconnects is likely to be oxidized. Further, upon etching of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer for the formation of contact holes, the pre-formed interconnects exposed at the bottoms of the contact holes can be contaminated with an etchant, a peeled resist, etc. Moreover, in the case of copper interconnects, there is a fear of copper diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In view of this, in the case of copper interconnects, for example, it may be considered to selectively cover the surface of copper interconnects with a protective layer (plated film) of a Ni—B alloy or the like, having a good adhesion to copper and a low resistivity (ρ). A Ni—B alloy layer can be formed on the surface of e.g. copper selectively by using an electroless plating solution which contains nickel ions, a complexing agent for nickel ions and an alkylamine borane or a borohydride compound as a reducing agent for nickel ions and by immersing the surface of the substrate in the electroless plating solution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">An electroless plating is applied to main filling materials (Cu) for the copper interconnects, the formation of the seed layer on the barrier metal, or the reinforcement of the seed (Cu), further the formation of the barrier metal itself, or the formation of cap material for the copper interconnect (in any case, Ni—P, Ni—B, Co—P, Ni—W—P, Ni—Co—P, Co—W—P, Co—W—B), or the like. In any electroless plating process, uniformity of the film thickness over an entire surface of the substrate is required.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In the case of an electroless plating apparatus that employs a face-up system, the amount of a plating solution used in one plating treatment is relatively small. Accordingly, the plating treatment has generally been practiced in a so-called one-path (throwaway) manner in which the plating solution is thrown away after every plating treatment. This manner, however, increases the consumption of plating solution, leading to a high running cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">It is therefore considered to employ a so-called circulatory manner in which a plating solution is circulated to recover and reuse it. A circulation/regeneration system for carrying out a circulatory manner of plating solution generally comprises a circulation tank for collecting a plating solution and circulating the plating solution. Thus, the plating solution in a predetermined amount, heated to a predetermined temperature in the circulation tank, is supplied to the plating surface of a workpiece to carry out plating, and the plating solution remaining on the plated surface of the workpiece after the plating is recovered and returned to the circulation tank.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Such a circulation/regeneration system, however, involves the following drawbacks:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">In the production of a semiconductor device, for example, it is desired to use a plating solution containing a sodium-free reducing agent in order to avoid contamination with the alkali metal of the semiconductor device. A sodium-free reducing agent is generally unstable and susceptible to decomposition, especially when it is kept at a high temperature. Accordingly, a plating solution containing such a reducing agent, when collected and heated to a high temperature in the circulation tank which generally has a large volume, is likely to decompose, leading to a large consumption of the plating solution. Further, when the return plating solution recovered after plating is returned to the circulation tank in a batch-wise manner, the temperature of the plating solution held in the circulation tank changes, leading to production of plated films with various film thickness. Moreover, since the surface of the plating solution held in the circulation tank is in contact with air, oxygen in the air is taken in the plating solution to increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plating solution, which would suppress the reduction action of the reducing agent, leading to poor deposition of the plating. Contact of the plating solution with air can also promote the decomposition of the plating solution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">In order to reduce the consumption of a plating solution due to its decomposition at a high temperature, it may be considered to employ a so-called in-line heating according to which the plating solution is not heated in the circulation tank, but heated on its way to a workpiece only in an amount necessary for one plating treatment. With such in-line heating, however, control of the plating solution temperature is generally difficult and, in addition, a relatively large heating apparatus, such as a heater, is needed for heating the plating solution, leading to a large-sized apparatus. In case a small heating apparatus, such as a heater, is used to down size the apparatus, it becomes necessary to increase the temperature difference between the temperature of the surface of the heat source and the temperature of plating solution. This can lead to formation of products on the surface of the heat source, and also to decomposition of the plating solution by excessive heating of the plating solution locally in the vicinity of the heat source.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The present invention has been made in view of the above situation in the related art. It is therefore an object of the present invention to a provide a plating apparatus which can keep a plating solution always in its optimal condition while minimizing the amount of plating solution used, and which can easily form a uniform plated film on the plating surface of a workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a plating apparatus comprising: a plating solution supply system for constantly circulating a plating solution while heating the plating solution in a circulation tank provided with a heating apparatus, and supplying a predetermined amount of plating solution to a plating treatment section when carrying out plating treatment; a plating solution recovery system for recovering the plating solution after the plating treatment in the plating treatment section, heating the plating solution and returning the heated plating solution to the circulation tank; and a plating solution replenishment system for replenishing the circulation tank with a fresh plating solution or a plating solution component.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">According to the plating apparatus, while the plating solution heated in the circulation tank is kept circulated in a non-plating time, the plating solution at a lowered temperature remaining in the plating treatment section after plating is recovered and heated, and returned to the circulation tank. Further, the circulation tank is replenished with a fresh plating solution or a component (components) of plating solution through the plating solution replenishment system. A plating solution circulation/regeneration system, which uses a minimum amount of plating solution, is thus established. The system can minimize the consumption of a plating solution due to its decomposition at a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">The plating solution supply system may include a plating solution storage tank for allowing the plating solution to pass therethrough midway of its circulation and storing a predetermined amount of plating solution, and supplying the predetermined amount of plating solution to the plating treatment section when carrying out plating treatment. When carrying out e.g. electroless nickel or cobalt alloy plating for the formation of a protective film on the surface of a wafer, the necessary amount of plating solution is about 100-200 cc for a wafer with a diameter of 200 mm, and about 200-400 cc for a wafer with a diameter of 300 mm. By the provision of the storage tank, such a necessary amount (predetermined amount) of plating solution at a constant temperature can be supplied to the plating treatment section without lowering of the plating solution temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">According to a preferred embodiment, the plating solution supply system includes a main flow path that allows the plating solution to pass through the plating solution storage tank, and then either returns the plating solution to the circulation tank for circulation or supplies the plating solution to the plating treatment section, and a bypass flow path that branches off from the main flow path upstream of the plating solution storage tank, bypasses the plating solution storage tank and joins the main flow path. Further, the plating solution stored in the plating solution storage tank is supplied by free fall (the force of gravity) to the plating treatment section. When carrying out plating treatment, a predetermined amount (e.g. 350 cc) of plating solution stored in the plating solution storage tank can be supplied by free fall, i.e. by its own weight (gravity), in a moment of time (e.g. 1-5 seconds).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">It is preferred that the circulation tank be connected to an inert gas introduction section for introducing an inert gas into the circulation tank and purging the inside of the circulation tank. This can effectively prevent air from contacting the surface of the plating solution in the circulation tank. In this regard, if air contacts the surface of the plating solution, oxygen in the air is taken in the plating solution to increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plating solution, which would suppress the reduction action of a reducing agent, leading to poor deposition of the plating. Such a drawback can be obviated by purging the inside of the circulation tank with an inert gas. The inert gas may, for example, be N<sub>2 </sub>gas.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">The plating solution recovery system may include an intermediary tank for temporarily storing and heating the recovered plating solution. The recovered plating solution can be heated to a predetermined temperature in the intermediary tank, and the thus heated plating solution can be returned to the circulation tank.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0022">According to the plating apparatus of the present invention, the total amount of the plating solution held in the plating solution supply system and the plating solution recovery system is preferably set at 0.1 to 1.0 times the amount of plating solution used in plating per hour. The use of such a small amount of plating solution makes it possible to use a circulation tank of a small volume, and can lower the running cost.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">It is also preferred that 5 to 50% of the total amount of the plating solution held in the plating solution supply system and the plating solution recovery system be thrown away periodically or at an arbitrary time, and the shortage be replenished with the fresh plating solution from the plating solution replenishment system. This makes it possible to control the metal ion concentration of the plating solution, while is held in the circulation tank and kept circulated, within a predetermined range and also control the amount of decomposition products at a certain level, leading to a stable quality of the plated film and a lowering of the running cost.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0033">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, which in no way limit the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</figref> illustrate, in sequence of process steps, an example of the formation of copper interconnects in a semiconductor device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an insulating film <b>2</b> of e.g. SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited on a conductive layer <b>1</b><i>a </i>in which semiconductor devices are provided, which is formed on a semiconductor base <b>1</b>. Contact holes <b>3</b> and trenches <b>4</b> for interconnects are formed in the insulating film <b>2</b> by the lithography/etching technique. Thereafter, a barrier layer <b>5</b> of TaN or the like is formed on the entire surface, and a copper seed layer <b>6</b> as an electric supply layer for electroplating is formed on the barrier layer <b>5</b>, for example, by sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, copper plating is carried out onto the surface of the semiconductor substrate W to fill the contact holes <b>3</b> and the trenches <b>4</b> with copper and, at the same time, deposit a copper film <b>7</b> on the insulating film <b>2</b>. Thereafter, the copper film <b>7</b> on the insulating film <b>2</b> is removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) so as to make the surface of the copper film <b>7</b> filled in the contact holes <b>3</b> and the trenches <b>4</b> for interconnects and the surface of the insulating film <b>2</b> lie substantially on the same plane. Interconnects <b>8</b> composed of the copper seed layer <b>6</b> and the copper film <b>7</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, are thus formed in the insulating layer <b>2</b>. Next, electroless Ni—B plating, for example, is carried out onto the surface of the substrate W to form a protective layer (plated film) <b>9</b> composed of a Ni—B alloy selectively on the exposed surface of copper interconnects <b>8</b> to protect the interconnects <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> show an electroless plating apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. The electroless plating apparatus can be used, for example, for the formation of the barrier layer <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reinforcement of the copper seed layer <b>6</b> and the deposition of the copper film <b>7</b>, and also for the formation of the protective layer (plated film) <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">The electroless plating apparatus includes a substrate holder <b>10</b> for holding a substrate (to-be-processed workpiece) W, such as a semiconductor wafer, with its front surface (to-be-plated surface) facing upward. The substrate holder <b>10</b> is composed mainly of a treatment bath <b>12</b> having a heated fluid holding portion <b>26</b> that holds a heated fluid for heating the substrate W, as described below, and of a cylindrical housing <b>14</b> that surrounds the treatment bath <b>12</b>. A hollow disk-shaped supporting plate <b>16</b> is mounted on the upper end of the housing <b>14</b>. A seal ring <b>18</b> that protrudes downwardly is supported to an inner peripheral surface of the supporting plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">A ring-shaped substrate stage <b>20</b> for supporting a peripheral portion of the substrate W and a guide ring <b>22</b>, which is positioned at the periphery of the substrate W and prevents misalignment of the substrate W, are mounted on a peripheral portion of the upper surface of the treatment bath <b>12</b>. The treatment bath <b>12</b> can move up and down relative to the housing <b>14</b>. A substrate W is inserted into the housing <b>14</b> when the treatment bath <b>12</b> is in a lowered position relative to the housing <b>14</b>, and the substrate W is placed and held on the upper surface of the substrate stage <b>20</b>. Thereafter, the treatment bath <b>12</b> is raised relative to the housing <b>14</b> so as to bring the seal ring <b>18</b> into pressure contact with a peripheral portion of the upper surface of the substrate W to thereby seal the peripheral portion of the upper surface of the substrate and hold the substrate W, whereby a plating treatment section <b>24</b> is formed which is surrounded by the upper surface of the substrate W and by the seal ring <b>18</b> and which is open upwardly. Release of the holding of the substrate W can be made by the adverse operation. With the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b>, the treatment bath <b>12</b> and the housing <b>14</b> can rotate together by the actuation of a motor (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">In the upper surface of the treatment bath <b>12</b>, there is provided a heated fluid holding portion <b>26</b> for holding a heated fluid, e.g. a heated water, alcohol or organic solution, and allowing the heated fluid to contact the lower surface of the substrate W to heat the substrate W. The heated fluid holding portion <b>26</b> is composed of a flow channel which is open upwardly and in the shape of a bugle in section, and is connected to a fluid supply pipe which has on its way e.g. a pure water heating section (heater) for heating pure water to e.g. 70° C. The heated fluid overflowing the heated fluid holding portion <b>26</b> passes between the treatment bath <b>12</b> and the housing <b>14</b> and flows out to the outside. Further, a scattering-proof cover <b>140</b> for preventing scattering of the heated fluid is provided around the housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">Positioned above the substrate holder <b>10</b>, there is provided a plating solution supply section <b>30</b> for supplying a plating solution (electroless plating solution) Q heated to a predetermined temperature, e.g. 70° C., into the plating treatment section <b>24</b> formed by the upper surface of the substrate W and the seal ring <b>18</b>. The plating solution supply section <b>30</b> has a vertically-movable, pivotable pivot arm <b>32</b>, and a disk-shaped head section <b>34</b>, which almost covers the opening of the plating treatment section <b>24</b> and is mounted on the free end of the pivot arm <b>32</b>. By the pivoting of the pivot arm <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the head section <b>34</b> moves between the position covering the substrate holder <b>10</b> and the retreat position. Thus, the head section <b>34</b> is located in the position covering the upper surface of the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> while the plating treatment is carried out, and is moved to the retreat position after the plating treatment, thereby preventing the head section <b>34</b> from impeding transfer of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">In the central portion of the head section <b>34</b>, there are provided a downwardly-opened plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> and, positioned above the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>, a plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> having such a volume that can store a predetermined amount of plating solution necessary for one plating treatment. The plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> and the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> are connected to each other by a plating solution pipe <b>40</b>. A plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b> and a plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b> are connected to the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>. In a non-plating time, as described below, the plating solution is circulated into the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> so as to store a predetermined amount of plating solution at a constant temperature in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>. At the time of plating, the plating solution held in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> is supplied, by its own weight (the force of gravity), through the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> into the plating treatment section <b>24</b>, formed by the upper surface of the substrate W and the seal ring <b>18</b>, in a moment of time (e.g. 1-10 seconds).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">Positioned above the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>, there is also provided a pre-plating treatment liquid storage tank <b>46</b> for storing a pre-plating treatment liquid, such as a cleaning liquid for carrying out a pre-plating cleaning or a catalyst-imparting liquid for carrying out a catalyst-imparting treatment. The pre-plating treatment liquid storage tank <b>46</b> and the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> are connected to each other by a pre-plating treatment liquid pipe <b>48</b>. A pre-plating treatment liquid supply pipe <b>50</b> and a pre-plating treatment liquid discharge pipe <b>52</b> are connected to the pre-plating treatment liquid storage tank <b>46</b>. As in the case of the plating solution, a predetermined amount of pre-plating treatment liquid at a constant temperature is stored in the pre-plating treatment storage tank <b>46</b> in a non-pretreatment time, and at the time of pre-plating treatment, the pre-plating treatment liquid stored in the pre-plating treatment storage tank <b>46</b> is supplied, by its own weight (gravity), through the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> into the plating treatment section <b>24</b>, formed by the upper surface of the substrate W and the seal ring <b>18</b>, in a moment of time (e.g. 1-10 seconds). Though in this embodiment the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> is used also as a pre-plating treatment liquid supply nozzle, it is possible to separately provide such nozzles. In the case where a plurality of pre-plating treatments are carried out, it is of course possible to provide a plurality of pre-plating treatment liquid storage tanks, and sequentially supply pre-plating treatment liquids stored in the respective tanks to the plating surface of a substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">The above construction of the electroless plating apparatus makes it possible to carry out the pretreatment, such as cleaning or a catalyst-imparting treatment, and the plating treatment successively in the single bath onto the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b>. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HF, HCl, NH<sub>3</sub>, DMAB (dimethylamine borane), oxalic acid, etc. may be used as a cleaning liquid for carrying out the pre-plating cleaning, and PdSO<sub>4</sub>, PdCl<sub>2</sub>, etc. may be used as a catalyst-imparting liquid for carrying out the catalyst-imparting treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">The head section <b>34</b> is provided with a pure water supply nozzle <b>54</b> for supplying pure water to the upper surface (plated surface) of the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b>. By supplying pure water from the pure water supply nozzle <b>54</b> to the surface of the substrate after the plating treatment, the plating treatment of the substrate and rinsing of the plated substrate with pure water can be carried out successively in the single bath.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">The head section <b>34</b> is provided with a plating solution recovery nozzle <b>56</b> for recovering the plating solution which has been supplied to the plating surface of the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b>. The plating solution remaining in the plating treatment section <b>24</b>, after plating treatment, is recovered by the plating solution recovery nozzle <b>56</b> and reused, as described bellow. The head section <b>34</b> is also provided with a pre-plating treatment liquid recovery nozzle <b>58</b> for recovering the pre-plating treatment liquid which has been supplied to the plated surface of the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b>. The pre-plating treatment liquid is recovered by the pre-plating treatment liquid recovery nozzle <b>58</b>, and is reused according to necessity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">An inert gas introduction line (inert gas introduction section) <b>60</b> for introducing a heated inert gas, e.g. N<sub>2 </sub>gas, is connected to the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>. The heated inert gas introduced from the inert gas introducing line <b>60</b> into the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>, after purging the inside of the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>, is jetted toward the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b>. Thus, the inert gas is introduced into the space between the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> and the head section <b>34</b> which is in the position covering the upper surface of the substrate W, whereby the space is brought to the inert gas atmosphere at a predetermined temperature. This can effectively prevent air from contacting the surface of the plating solution. In this regard, if air contacts the surface of the plating solution, oxygen in the air is taken in by the plating solution to increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plating solution, which would restrain the reduction action of a reducing agent, leading to poor deposition of the plating. Such a drawback can be obviated by bringing the above space to an inert gas atmosphere. Further, by keeping the space under the atmosphere of heated inert gas, the temperature of the plating solution can be prevented from being lowered during plating. When the temperature of the plating solution is 70° C., for example, the temperature of the inert gas, such as N<sub>2 </sub>gas, is generally 60 to 70° C. (temperature of plating solution −10° C. to temperature of plating solution), preferably 65 to 70° C. (temperature of plating solution −5° C. to temperature of plating solution).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">A cleaning liquid introduction line (cleaning liquid introduction section) <b>62</b><i>a </i>is connected to the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, and a cleaning liquid introduction line (cleaning liquid introduction section) <b>62</b><i>b </i>is connected to the pre-plating treatment liquid storage tank <b>46</b>. A cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid introduction line <b>62</b><i>a </i>flows through the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, the plating solution pipe <b>40</b> and the plating solution nozzle <b>36</b> in this order; and a cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid introduction line <b>62</b><i>b </i>flows through the pre-plating treatment liquid storage tank <b>46</b>, the pre-plating treatment liquid pipe <b>48</b> and the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> in this order. Extraneous matter adhering to the inner wall surfaces of these tanks, pipes and nozzles can thus be cleaned off. The cleaning may be practiced periodically or at an arbitrary time. Pure water or a cleaning chemical, such as HNO<sub>3</sub>, aqua regia or HF, may be used as the cleaning liquid. According to this embodiment, the head section <b>34</b> has a built-in heater <b>64</b> for keeping the heat-retaining space between the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> and the head section <b>34</b> nearly at the temperature of the plating solution.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the general construction of a plating solution circulation/regeneration system of the electroless plating apparatus. The plating solution circulation/regeneration system is composed mainly of a plating solution circulation system which consists of a plating solution supply system <b>70</b> and a plating solution recovery system <b>72</b> and which circulates a plating solution, and a plating solution replenishment system <b>74</b> which replenishes the plating solution circulation system with a fresh solution (plating solution).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">The plating solution supply system <b>70</b> includes the above-described plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, a plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b> and a plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b>, both connected to the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, and a plating solution pipe <b>40</b>. The plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b> and the plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b> are connected to a circulation tank <b>80</b> which is provided with a heating apparatus (heater) <b>78</b><i>a </i>having e.g. a hot-water heat exchanger <b>76</b><i>a</i>. A circulation pump <b>82</b> is provided in the plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b>. A main flow path <b>84</b> is thus provided which, by the actuation of the circulation pump <b>82</b>, introduces the plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b> into the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> through the plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b>, and then either returns the plating solution to the circulation tank <b>80</b> for circulation through the plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b> or supplies the plating solution in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> to the plating treatment section <b>24</b> through the plating solution pipe <b>40</b>. The plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b> is heated by the heating apparatus <b>78</b><i>a </i>to a predetermined temperature, e.g. 70° C.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">On the upstream and downstream sides of the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, there are interposed open/close valves <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>b </i>respectively in the plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b> and in the plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b>. Further, an open/close valve <b>86</b><i>c </i>is interposed in the plating solution pipe <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">The plating solution supply system <b>70</b> also includes a bypass flow path <b>88</b> that branches off from the main flow path <b>84</b> upstream of the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>a </i>disposed upstream of the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, bypasses the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> and joins the main flow path <b>84</b> downstream of the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>b </i>disposed downstream of the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>. An open/close valve <b>86</b><i>d </i>is interposed in the bypass flow path <b>88</b>. An air vent pipe <b>90</b>, in which an open/close valve <b>86</b><i>e </i>is interposed, is connected to the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">In a non-plating time, the open/close valves <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>b </i>are opened, and the other open/close valves <b>86</b><i>c</i>, <b>86</b><i>d</i>, <b>86</b><i>e </i>are closed, thereby circulating the plating solution heated to a predetermined temperature through the plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b>, the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> and the plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b>. Immediately before supplying the plating solution to the plating treatment section <b>24</b>, only the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>d </i>is opened and the other open/close valves <b>86</b><i>a</i>-<b>86</b><i>c</i>, <b>86</b><i>e </i>are closed, thereby bypassing the plating solution through the bypass flow path <b>88</b> and storing a predetermined amount of plating solution in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>. By opening then the open/close valves <b>86</b><i>c</i>, <b>86</b><i>e</i>, the predetermined amount of plating solution stored in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> is supplied by free fall, i.e. by its own weight (gravity), through the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the plating solution treatment section <b>24</b> in a moment of time (e.g. 1-10 seconds).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">The plating solution recovery system <b>72</b> includes a plating solution recovery pipe <b>92</b> which is connected to the above-described plating solution recovery nozzle <b>56</b>. The plating solution recovery pipe <b>92</b> is connected to the circulation tank <b>80</b>. In the plating solution recovery pipe <b>92</b> are disposed, in the order of return of the plating solution, a vapor-liquid separator <b>96</b> which can evacuate by a vacuum pump <b>94</b>, an intermediary tank <b>98</b> provided with a heating apparatus (heater) <b>78</b><i>b </i>having e.g. a hot-water heat exchanger <b>76</b><i>b </i>and an open/close valve <b>86</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">Accordingly, by the actuation of the vacuum pump <b>94</b>, the plating solution remaining in the plating treatment section <b>24</b> after plating enters the vapor-liquid separator <b>96</b>, and the separated liquid (plating solution) enters the intermediary tank <b>98</b>. The plating solution in the intermediary tank <b>98</b> is heated to the same predetermined temperature as the plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b>, e.g. 70° C., and is returned to the circulation tank <b>80</b> by opening the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>f</i>. By thus heating the return plating solution before returning it to the circulation tank <b>80</b>, the temperature of the plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b> can be prevented from being changed (lowered) upon return of the plating solution.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">The plating solution replenishment system <b>74</b> includes a plurality of plating solution component supply tanks <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>. . . and a preparation tank <b>102</b> provided with a heating apparatus (heater) <b>78</b><i>c </i>having e.g. a hot-water heat exchanger <b>76</b><i>c</i>. The respective plating solution component supply tanks <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>. . . and the preparation tank <b>102</b> are connected by plating solution component supply pipes <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>. . . having supply pumps <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Further, the preparation tank <b>102</b> and the circulation tank <b>80</b> are connected by a fresh solution supply pipe <b>110</b> having a fresh solution supply pump <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">The plating solution component supply tanks <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>. . . comprise at least three tanks respectively holding a reducing agent solution, a pH adjustment agent solution and a solution containing a metal material and other components. In the case of Ni—B electroless plating, for example, the plating solution component supply tank <b>100</b><i>a </i>holds a solution containing DMAB (dimethylamine borane) as a reducing agent for nickel ions, the plating solution component supply tank <b>100</b><i>b </i>holds a solution containing TMAH (tetramethylammoniumhydroxide) as a pH adjusting agent, and the plating solution component supply tank <b>100</b><i>c </i>holds a solution containing Ni ions and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057">The respective plating solution components held in the plating solution component supply tanks <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>. . . are supplied to the preparation tank <b>102</b>, where the components are mixed to prepare a fresh solution (plating solution). The fresh solution is heated to a predetermined temperature, e.g. 70° C., and the heated fresh solution is supplied to the circulation tank <b>80</b> to replenish the plating solution. By thus heating the fresh solution to a predetermined temperature before adding it to the plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b>, the temperature of the plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b> can be prevented from being charged (lowered) upon addition of the fresh solution.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">By carrying out the replenishment of the fresh solution periodically or at an arbitrary time, the concentration of a metal ion, e.g. Ni ion, can be controlled within a certain management range. Consider now as an example a case of depositing 70 nm-thick Ni on the entire surface of a wafer, with the condition that the total amount of plating solution in the plating solution circulation system is one liter. In this case, though depending on the Ni concentration of the plating solution, the Ni concentration is assumed to be lowered by about 20% (from 100% to 80%) after plating treatment of 20 wafers without replenishment of the plating solution. In such a case, a fresh plating solution (replenisher) having a certain Ni concentration, which is higher than the basic concentration, is prepared. A certain amount (e.g. 0.4 L) of the one-liter plating solution in the circulation system is thrown away periodically, i.e. in this case every time <b>20</b> wafers have been treated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At the same time, the plating solution circulation system is replenished with the fresh plating solution in a amount corresponding to the total of the amount of the plating solution thrown away and the amount of the plating solution consumed in the plating treatment. This makes it possible to control the Ni concentration of the plating solution within a certain management range (within 20% in this case). It is preferred that 5 to 50% of the total amount of the plating solution in the plating solution circulation system be thrown away periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0059">The above-described circulation tank <b>80</b>, intermediary tank <b>98</b> and preparation tank <b>102</b> are respectively connected to inert gas introduction lines (inert gas introduction sections) <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>112</b><i>c </i>for purging the insides of the tanks <b>80</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> by inert gas. This can effectively prevent air contacting the surface of the plating solution in the tank <b>80</b>, <b>98</b> or <b>102</b>. If air contacts the surface of the plating solution, oxygen in the air is taken in by the plating solution to increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plating solution, which would suppress the reduction action of a reducing agent, leading to poor deposition of the plating. Such a drawback can be obviated by bringing the above tanks to an inert gas atmosphere. The inert gas may, for example, be N<sub>2 </sub>gas.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0060">According to the plating solution circulation/regeneration system, while the plating solution heated in the circulation tank <b>80</b> is kept circulated in a non-plating time, the plating solution at a lowered temperature remaining in the plating treatment section <b>24</b> after plating is recovered and heated, and returned to the circulation tank <b>80</b>. Further, the circulation tank <b>80</b> is replenished with a fresh plating solution or a component (components) of plating solution from the plating solution replenishment system <b>74</b>. The plating solution circulation/regeneration system thus uses a minimum amount of plating solution, and can minimize the consumption of a plating solution due to its decomposition at a high temperature. Moreover, the plating solution circulation/regeneration system, which uses a minimum amount of plating solution, makes it possible to set the total amount of the plating solution held in the plating solution circulation system, consisting of the plating solution supply system <b>70</b> and the plating solution recovery system <b>72</b>, at e.g. 0.1-1.0 times the amount of plating solution used in plating per hour, and use a circulation tank <b>80</b> having a small volume that meets such a small amount of plating solution. This can reduce the consumption of plating solution and can downsize the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0061">A description will now be given of the plating treatment by the electroless plating apparatus of this embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. First, a substrate W is inserted into the housing <b>14</b> when the treatment bath <b>12</b> is in a lowered position relative to the housing <b>14</b>, and the substrate W is placed and held on the upper surface of the substrate stage <b>20</b>. At this time, the head section <b>34</b> is located at the retreat position. Thereafter, the treatment bath <b>12</b> is raised relative to the housing <b>14</b> so as to bring the seal ring <b>18</b> into pressure contact with a peripheral portion of the upper surface of the substrate W to thereby seal the peripheral portion of the upper surface of the substrate W and hold the substrate W, whereby a plating treatment section <b>24</b> is formed which is surrounded by the upper surface of the substrate W and by the seal ring <b>18</b> and which is open upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0062">Next, the head section <b>34</b> is moved to the position right above the substrate holder <b>10</b>, and is then lowered. Thereafter, a predetermined amount of pre-plating treatment liquid, such as a cleaning liquid or a catalyst-imparting liquid, held in the pre-plating treatment liquid storage tank <b>46</b> is supplied, by its own weight (gravity), through the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>, which is used also as a pre-plating treatment liquid supply nozzle, to the plating surface of the substrate held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> in a moment of time, thereby carrying out pre-plating treatment. After completion of the pre-plating treatment, the pre-plating treatment liquid remaining on the plating surface of the substrate W is recovered by the pre-plating treatment liquid recovery nozzle <b>58</b>, and is reused according to necessity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0063">Next, a heated fluid, such as a hot water, heated to the same temperature as the plating solution, e.g. 70° C., is introduced into the heated fluid holding portion <b>26</b> of the treatment bath <b>12</b>, and the heated fluid is allowed to contact the lower surface of the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> and then overflow. When the substrate W is heated by the heated fluid to reach the same temperature as the heated fluid, e.g. 70° C., a predetermined amount of plating solution (e.g. about 100-200 cc for a wafer with 200-mm diameter, and about 200-400 cc for a wafer with 300-mm diameter) at a predetermined temperature, held in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>, is supplied, by its own weight (gravity), through the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> to the plating surface of the substrate held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> in a moment of time, thereby carrying out plating treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0064">Before the supply of the plating solution, as described above, the open/close valves <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>b </i>are opened, and the other open/close valves <b>86</b><i>c</i>, <b>86</b><i>d</i>, <b>86</b><i>e </i>are closed, thereby circulating the plating solution heated to a predetermined temperature through the plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b>, the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> and the plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b>. Immediately before supplying the plating solution to the plating treatment section <b>24</b>, only the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>d </i>is opened and the other open/close valves <b>86</b><i>a</i>-<b>86</b><i>c</i>, <b>86</b><i>e </i>are closed, thereby bypassing the plating solution through the bypass flow path <b>88</b> and storing the predetermined amount of plating solution in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b>. By then opening the open/close valves <b>86</b><i>c</i>, <b>86</b><i>e</i>, the predetermined amount of plating solution stored in the plating solution storage tank <b>38</b> is supplied by free fall, i.e. by its own weight (gravity), through the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the plating solution treatment section <b>24</b> in a moment of time (e.g. 1-10 seconds).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">Upon the plating treatment, a heated inert gas is introduced from the inert gas introduction line <b>60</b> into the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>. The heated inert gas, after purging the inside of the plating solution supply nozzle <b>36</b>, is introduced into the space between the substrate W held by the substrate holder <b>10</b> and the head section <b>34</b> in the position covering the upper surface of the substrate W so as to keep the space under the inert gas atmosphere at a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">Further, as necessary, the plating solution is heated by the heater <b>64</b> to prevent lowering of the temperature of the plating solution during plating. During the plating treatment, the substrate W is thus kept at the temperature of the heated fluid over the entire surface, whereby a plated film having a uniform film thickness is allowed to grow. Moreover, since the peripheral portion of the substrate W is also kept immersed in the heated fluid, the temperature of the peripheral portion also is not lowered. During the plating, it is possible to rotate the substrate W so as to make the release of hydrogen gas and the concentration of dissolved oxygen uniform over the plating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">After completion of the plating treatment, the introduction of the heated fluid into the heated fluid holding portion <b>26</b> is stopped and the heated fluid is discharged from the introduction side, and the plating solution remaining in the plating treatment section <b>24</b>, surrounded by the seal ring <b>18</b> and the upper surface of the substrate W, is recovered, e.g. by suction, through the plating solution recovery nozzle <b>56</b>. Thus, the substrate W is rotated to gather on its peripheral portion the plating solution remaining in the plating treatment section <b>24</b> after plating, and the gathered plating solution is sucked by the plating solution recovery nozzle <b>56</b>. The plating solution containing a gas enters the gas-liquid separator <b>96</b>, and only the separated liquid (plating solution) enters the intermediary tank <b>98</b>. The plating solution in the intermediary tank <b>98</b> is heated to the same temperature as the plating solution in the circulation tank <b>80</b>, e.g. 70° C. By opening the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>f</i>, the heated plating solution is returned to the circulation tank <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">The introduction of the inert gas from the inert gas introduction line <b>60</b> is stopped. Thereafter, while rotating the substrate W, pure water is jetted from the pure water supply nozzle <b>54</b> toward the plated surface of the substrate W to cool the plated surface and, at the same time, dilute and clean the plated surface, thereby terminating the electroless plating reaction. The substrate W is then rotated at a high speed for draining.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069">Thereafter, the head section <b>34</b> is raised and retreated to the retreat position, and then the treatment bath <b>12</b> is lowered relative to the housing <b>14</b> to thereby release the holding of the substrate W. Thereafter, the plated substrate is sent, e.g. by a hand of a robot, to the next process step.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">According to the plating apparatus of this embodiment, plating treatment is carried out to one substrate in the above-described manner. When the number of the treated substrates W has reached a given number (e.g. 20), as described above, a given amount (e.g. 0.4 L) of plating solution is thrown away from the plating solution circulation system, and the system is replenished with a fresh plating solution having a certain concentration of metal ion, e.g. Ni ion, in an amount corresponding to the total of the amount of the plating solution thrown away and the amount of the plating solution consumed in the plating treatment, to thereby control the concentration of metal ion, e.g. Ni ion, within a desired management range. This makes it possible to carry out plating treatment in a continuous manner.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0072">According to this embodiment, in a non-plating time, the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>g </i>is opened and the open/close valve <b>86</b><i>h </i>is closed, thereby circulating the plating solution through the plating solution supply pipe <b>42</b> and the plating solution discharge pipe <b>44</b>.
