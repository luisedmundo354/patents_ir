<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to an electron tube having a linear member, such as a cathode filament, a linear grid, a linear damper for the cathode filament or for the linear grid, and a linear spacer for the cathode filament or for the linear grid. More particularly, the present invention relates to a fixing structure of the linear member in a fluorescent luminous tube, such as a fluorescent display tube in which the linear member is mounted under tension.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A fluorescent display tube, as a kind of a conventional electron tube shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-245925, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) is a cross-sectional view illustrating a fluorescent display tube taken along the line X<b>2</b>-X<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) looking in the directions of the arrow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross-sectional view illustrating the fluorescent display tube taken along the line X<b>1</b>-X<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fluorescent display tube has a hermetic container formed of substrates <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> to be opposite to each other, and side plates <b>121</b> to <b>124</b>. The hermetic container contains filaments <b>23</b>, a grid <b>33</b>, and an anode electrode <b>31</b> therein. Electrons emitted from the filaments <b>23</b> are controlled by the grid <b>33</b> to reach the anode electrode <b>31</b>, and the reached electrons excite fluorescent material on the anode electrode <b>31</b> to make the fluorescent material emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A pair of aluminum (Al) thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> for use as a cathode electrode is formed on the substrate <b>111</b>. The ends of the filament <b>23</b> are held between the Al thin film <b>211</b> and an Al wire <b>251</b>, and the Al thin film <b>212</b> and the Al wire <b>252</b>, and bonded to the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> and the Al wires <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> by ultrasonic bonding. Spacers <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> made of an Al wire sustain the filament <b>23</b> at a predetermined elevated height.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conventional fluorescent display tube shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>) requires to dispose therein the filament <b>23</b> having both side ends thereof fixed between the Al thin film <b>211</b> and the Al wire <b>251</b> and the Al thin film <b>212</b> and the Al wire <b>252</b> respectively, as well as the spacers <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> for sustaining the filament <b>23</b> at the predetermined elevated height. This results in increasing dead space in the fluorescent display tube, and is obstructive to reduce the size of the fluorescent display tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the filament <b>23</b> merely touches the spacers <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> and are not fixed to the spacers <b>261</b> and <b>262</b>. Thus, the filament <b>23</b> is liable to sideslip in the lengthwise directions of the spacers <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> while the fluorescent display tube is being assembled or being used. The sideslip changes the light emission of the fluorescent material on the anode electrodes <b>31</b> and deteriorates the display quality of the fluorescent display tube.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The conventional fluorescent display tube separately arranges the Al wires <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> for fixing the filaments <b>23</b>, and the spacers <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> for sustaining the filaments <b>23</b> at the predetermined elevated height. In other words, the conventional fluorescent display tube requires the Al wires <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> for fixing the filaments <b>23</b>, and the Al spacer wires <b>261</b> and <b>262</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an electron tube in which Al wires for fixing ends of linear filament and spacers are integrated so as to reduce dead space of the electron tube and to decrease the number of the Al wires for fixing the linear filament and the spacers for sustaining the filament.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the present invention, an electron tube comprises a container for containing electrodes therein; a linear member mounted inside the container; conductive spacers for keeping the linear member at a predetermined height in the container, the linear member being held by the conductive spacers to have at least one end of the linear member fixed to each of the conductive spacers; and conductive layers formed inside the container for fixing the conductive spacers thereon, wherein both ends of the linear member are fixed to a fixing portion of the conductive spacers along stepped surfaces of the fixing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect of the present invention, an electron tube comprises a container for containing electrodes therein; a linear member mounted inside the container; conductive spacers for keeping the linear member at a predetermined height in the container, the linear member being held by the conductive spacers to have at least one end of the linear member fixed to each of the conductive spacers; and conductive layers formed inside the container for fixing the conductive spacers thereon, wherein the conductive spacers each include a stepped fixing portion to which the linear member is fixed along the stepped surfaces of the fixing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, the linear member comprises a cathode filament, a linear damper, a linear spacer, a linear grid or a linear getter. The linear member is bonded to the fixing portion along the stepped surface thereof by ultrasonic bonding. Furthermore, the liner member is fixed to the fixing portion in a state in which at least a part of the linear member is embedded in the fixing portion.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A fluorescent display tube, as an example of an electron tube, according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, will be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>). Same reference numerals are used to show the common constituent elements. When there is a plurality of the same constituent elements, a typical element is indicated by the reference numeral.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are cross sectional views showing a fluorescent display tube according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) is a cross sectional view illustrating the fluorescent display tube taken along the line Y<b>2</b>-Y<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross sectional view illustrating the fluorescent display tube of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), taken along the line Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fluorescent display tube shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>) includes a hermetic container provided with at least a first and second insulating substrates <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, which are opposed to each other and are made of glass, a ceramic or the like. The substrates <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are sealed by insulating side plates <b>121</b> to <b>124</b> made of glass, a ceramic or the like, using a frit glass (not shown) to form the hermetic container. The hermetic container may be fabricated by sealing the substrates <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> using only the frit glass without using the side plates <b>121</b> to <b>124</b>. Accordingly, the side plates <b>121</b> to <b>124</b> including the frit glass are referred to as a side member.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Inside the hermetic container, there are linear thermionic cathode filaments <b>23</b>, a grid <b>33</b> formed of a metal mesh, metal wires or the like, and an anode electrode <b>31</b> made of a metal, the surface of which a fluorescent material is coated. Electrons emitted from the filaments <b>23</b> are controlled by the grid <b>33</b> to reach the anode electrode <b>31</b>, and excite the fluorescent material on the anode electrode <b>31</b> to emit light. In the fluorescent display tube shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>), a transparent or translucent glass plate is used as at least at one of the substrates <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> from which light emission of the fluorescent material on the anode electrodes <b>31</b> is viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A pair of Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> for use in the cathode electrode is formed on the substrate <b>111</b> common to four filaments <b>23</b>. The pair of the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> may be separately formed in each filament. A nesa electrode (not shown) is formed between the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> in the hermetic container.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> acting as a conductive spacer are fixed to the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> by ultrasonic bonding. An end of the filaments <b>23</b> is bonded to the Al wire <b>221</b> by the ultrasonic bonding. Similarly, the other end of the filaments is bonded to the Al wire <b>222</b> by ultrasonic bonding. In this structure, the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> are arranged in such a manner that their longitudinal directions intersect the longitudinal direction of the filaments <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For fixing the filaments <b>23</b> in the fluorescent display tube, the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> are fixed on the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, respectively, by ultrasonic bonding at first. Next, the filaments <b>23</b> stretched across a frame of a jig (not shown) in advance are placed on the fixed Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>. Then, an ultrasonic bonding tool is made to press a part of one of the filaments <b>23</b> and one of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> to form stepped fixing portions <b>223</b> at an offset position of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> on which the filaments <b>23</b> are fixed as it will be described later. Both ends of the filaments <b>23</b> are embedded in the fixing portions <b>223</b> of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> along the horizontal and vertical walls thereof, and are bent to have a shape of a letter L or an inverted letter L as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>). The filaments <b>23</b> are sustained at a predetermined height on the peripheral surfaces of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> where the fixing portions <b>223</b> are not formed. That is, each of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> includes areas for fixing the filaments <b>23</b> and for sustaining the filament <b>23</b> at the predetermined height. Accordingly, the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> act as a spacer and also a fixing member of the filaments <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ends of the filaments <b>23</b> are bent in the shape of the letter L or the inverted letter L on the fixing portions <b>223</b> of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>, and are bent at the tops of the peripheral surfaces of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> in the direction of stretching the filament <b>23</b>. In other words, the ends of the filaments <b>23</b> are bent into a shape of a letter Z or an inverted letter Z at the fixing portions <b>223</b> of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>, and extend in the direction of stretching the filaments <b>23</b>. As a result, the filaments <b>23</b> are hooked at the fixing portions <b>223</b> so as to prevent the filaments <b>23</b> from coming out of the fixing portions <b>223</b>, as it will be described later. Furthermore, because the contacting areas of the filaments <b>23</b> to the fixing portions <b>223</b> increase at the bent portions, a fixing strength of the filaments <b>23</b> in the stretched direction is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In place of the grids <b>33</b>, an intermediate substrate having electron passing apertures and grid electrodes formed in the substrate adjacent to the apertures may be mounted within the hermetic container, and the filaments <b>23</b> may be fixed to the intermediate substrate. Furthermore, in place of the filaments <b>23</b>, a field emission type linear cathode made by coating a carbon nanotube on a metal wire may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment of the present invention, the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> were formed to have a thickness of 0.1 μm or more by sputtering or the like. The Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> having a diameter of about 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm can be used. However, the Al wires having a diameter of 0.4 mm were used in this embodiment. The width of the horizontal wall of the fixing portions <b>223</b> of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> in the stretching direction of the filaments <b>23</b> was about 0.2 mm, and the width of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> where the fixing portions <b>223</b> was not formed was about 0.3 mm. The Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> having the diameters of 0.4 mm were crushed flat to have width of about 0.5 mm to 0.6 mm at the time of forming the fixing portions <b>223</b>. Furthermore, the difference of the height between the horizontal walls of the fixing portions <b>223</b> and the peripheral surfaces of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> was about 0.2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A ternary carbonate (Ba, Sr, Ca), as an electron emission material, coated on a core, such as a tungsten wire or a tungsten alloy wire made of rhenium and tungsten or the like, was used for the filament <b>23</b>. A tungsten core having the thickness of 0.3 MG (or about 10 μm in diameters) to 7.53 MG (or about 50 μm in diameters) can be used as a core of the filament <b>23</b>. However, the tungsten core having the thickness of 0.64 MG (or about 15 μm in diameters) was used in this embodiment. The diameter of the tungsten core after coating the electron emitting material was 30 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The spacing between the filament <b>23</b> and the substrate <b>111</b> was set to about 0.3 mm. The spacing between each of the filaments <b>23</b> was set to about 0.8 mm to 3 mm. Although the spacing between the filament <b>23</b> and the substrate <b>111</b> is determined by the height of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> after being fixed to the substrate, the spacing can be set to be an appropriate value by changing the output of ultrasonic waves from the ultrasonic bonding apparatus, a joining time, and the load of the ultrasonic boding tool, as long as the thickness of the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> before ultrasonic bonding are the same. In place of the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>222</b>, thick films having a thickness of 10 μm or more may be formed on the substrate <b>111</b> by thick film printing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> are the fixing member of the filament <b>23</b>, as well as the spacer for sustaining the filament <b>23</b> at the predetermined height. Thus, it is unnecessary to provide the fixing member and the spacer member for the filament <b>23</b> separately, as in the prior art fluorescent display tube. According to the present invention, the fixing member and the spacer member for the filament <b>23</b> are integrated so as to eliminate the space for placing the conventional spacer in the fluorescent display tube. Thus, the dead space in the fluorescent display tube can be reduced so that a compact fluorescent display tube can be obtained. More specifically, the interval between the Al wire <b>221</b> and the side plate <b>122</b>, and the interval between the Al wire <b>222</b> and the side plate <b>124</b> can be set to about 1 mm. Furthermore, the fixing member for the filament <b>23</b> and the spacer member for the filament <b>23</b> are integrated, which results in reduction of the number of components, and the manufacturing costs of the fluorescent display tube.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>), the conventional fluorescent display tube is provided with two Al wires <b>251</b> and <b>261</b> or <b>252</b> and <b>262</b> at each end of the filaments <b>23</b> for fixing and spacing the filaments <b>23</b>. As a result, the end of the filament <b>23</b> generates heat due to the provision of the two Al wires. On the other hand, the fluorescent display tube of the present invention is provided with only one Al wire <b>221</b> or <b>223</b> at each end of the filaments <b>23</b>. Thus, the heat to be generated from the ends of the filaments <b>23</b> will be reduced to half. As a result, the range of the end cool of the fluorescent display tube can be smaller, and the effective display area of the fluorescent display tube can be larger than that of the conventional fluorescent display tube. Also, the power consumption can be smaller than that of the conventional fluorescent display tube.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>2</b>(<i>f</i>) illustrate ultrasonic bonding of the filament <b>23</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>2</b>(<i>f</i>) show fragmental views of the fluorescent display tube corresponding to the Al thin film <b>211</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b> taken along the line Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>). The Al thin film <b>212</b> and the Al wire <b>222</b> (not shown) are bonded in the same manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>2</b>(<i>f</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>f</i>) are cross sectional views taken along the line Y<b>3</b>-Y<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>e</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), the Al wire <b>221</b> is placed on the Al thin film <b>211</b> on the substrate <b>111</b>. A recessed portion <b>511</b> of an ultrasonic bonding tool (a wedge tool) <b>51</b> is pressed against the Al wire <b>221</b>, and an ultrasonic wave is applied to the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>51</b> to bond the Al wire <b>221</b> to the Al thin film <b>221</b>. Next, the filament <b>23</b> is placed on the Al wire <b>221</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>) so that a flat end surface of an ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> may be pressed against the filament <b>23</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b>. Then, an ultrasonic wave is applied to the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> to fix the filament <b>23</b> to the Al wire <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cross section of the filament <b>23</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b> is of a shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>e</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>f</i>). The filament <b>23</b> is embedded in a horizontal wall <b>2231</b> and a vertical wall <b>2232</b> of the stepped fixing portion <b>223</b> of the Al wire <b>221</b>. The filament <b>23</b> is bent in a letter Z or in an inverted letter Z at the end thereof, and extends in the direction of stretching the filament <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The filament <b>23</b> is completely embedded in the horizontal wall <b>2231</b> and the vertical wall <b>2232</b>. It is to be noted that the fixing strength equal to or more than the breaking down strength of the filament <b>23</b> can be obtained, even if a part of the embedded portion of the filament <b>23</b> is exposed. The filament is embedded in the fixing portion in three modes. First, the filament <b>23</b> located in the fixing portion <b>223</b> having the horizontal wall <b>2231</b> and the vertical wall <b>2232</b> is completely embedded in the fixing portion <b>223</b> and the filament <b>23</b> located in the fixing portion is not exposed at all. Second, the filament <b>23</b> located in the fixing portion <b>223</b> is partially embedded in the fixing portion <b>23</b> and a part of the filament is exposed from the fixing portion <b>223</b>. Third, a part the filament <b>23</b> located in the fixing portion <b>223</b> is completely embedded not to be exposed from the fixing portion <b>223</b> at all and the other part of the filament <b>23</b> located in the fixing portion <b>223</b> is partially embedded in the fixing portion <b>223</b> so that a part of the filament is exposed from the fixing portion <b>223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is to be noted that the filament <b>23</b> is bent at substantially the right angle at the upper edge of the vertical wall <b>2232</b> in the direction of stretching the filament <b>23</b>. Thus, the bent portion is hooked at the upper edge of the vertical wall <b>2232</b>, which makes it difficult for the filament <b>23</b> to come out from the fixing portion <b>223</b>, and the fixing strength of the filament <b>23</b> against pulling force in the direction of the filament <b>23</b> is significantly enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>2</b>(<i>f</i>), two different kinds of ultrasonic bonding tools <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are used at the time of fixing the Al wire <b>221</b> to the Al thin film <b>211</b> and fixing the filament <b>23</b> to the Al wire <b>221</b>. However, it is possible to perform the fixing of the Al wire <b>221</b> and the filament <b>23</b> by using the same ultrasonic bonding tool <b>51</b> using the flat portion of the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>51</b> at which the recessed portion <b>511</b> is not formed at the time of fixing the filaments <b>23</b> to the Al wire <b>221</b>. The ultrasonic bonding tools <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are driven to shift from one filament to other filament <b>23</b> in order. However, an ultrasonic bonding tool having a structure for bonding a plurality of the filaments <b>23</b> at the same time may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the filament <b>23</b>, the ternary carbonate is coated on the core thereof. However, the ternary carbonate may be removed in advance or may not be removed, because it is easily rubbed off upon bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>2</b>(<i>f</i>), the output of the ultrasonic bonding apparatus was 15 watts. The load applied by the ultrasonic bonding tools <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> was 1,100 g, and the bonding time was 250 milliseconds. Each of the ultrasonic bonding apparatuses of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>) may be operated in the same condition or operated in a different condition. The bonding strength between the Al thin film <b>211</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b> was about 20 N, and the bonding strength between the filament <b>23</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b> was equal to or more 0.5 N of the wire breaking strength of the filament <b>23</b>. Thus, the bonding strength between the filament <b>23</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b> is larger than the wire breaking strength of the filament <b>23</b>, and the bonding strength is sufficient for fixing the filament <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>) show an embodiment for fixing the Al wires <b>221</b> and the fixing of the filaments <b>23</b> at the same time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>) are cross sectional views taken along the lines Y<b>3</b>-Y<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, the Al wire <b>221</b> is placed on the Al thin film <b>211</b> on the substrate <b>111</b>, and the filament <b>23</b> is placed on the Al wire <b>221</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>). The flat end surface of the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> is pressed against a part of the filament <b>23</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b> corresponding to the filament <b>23</b>. Then, an ultrasonic wave is applied to the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> to fix the Al wire <b>221</b> to the Al thin film <b>211</b> and the filament <b>23</b> to the Al wire <b>221</b> at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The cross section of the fixed filament <b>23</b> and the fixed Al wire <b>221</b> is of a shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>). The filament <b>23</b> is embedded in the fixing portion <b>223</b> of the Al wire <b>221</b>, and the end of the filament <b>23</b> is bent in a letter Z or in an inverted letter Z.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, the Al wire <b>221</b> not pressed by the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> is not fixed to the Al thin film <b>211</b>. Thus, the fixing area of the Al wire <b>221</b> is smaller than the area where the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> is pressed against the entire Al wire <b>221</b>, and the fixing strength of the Al wire <b>221</b> is reduced. However, the fixing strength of the Al wire <b>221</b> to the Al thin film <b>211</b> is still larger than the wire breaking strength of the filament <b>23</b>. Accordingly, no problem is occurred in fixing the filament <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>3</b>(<i>d</i>), the fixing of the Al wire <b>221</b> and the fixing of the filament <b>23</b> is performed at the same time so as to simplify the fixing process of the Al wire <b>221</b> and the filament <b>23</b>. In addition, the Al wire <b>221</b> not fixed to the Al thin film <b>211</b> is not crushed by the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> so that the filament <b>23</b> is supported at a height equivalent to the diameter of the Al wire <b>221</b> before the bonding. In other words, the height of the spacer of the filament <b>23</b> is determined by the diameter of the Al wire <b>221</b> before bonding, which makes it easy to decide the height of the spacer.</p>

The recessed portion <b>511</b> of the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>51</b> is pressed against the Al wire <b>221</b>, and an ultrasonic wave is applied to the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>51</b>. Then, the Al wire <b>211</b> is fixed to the Al thin film <b>221</b>. Subsequently, the filament <b>23</b> is placed on the Al wire <b>221</b> in order that the filament <b>23</b> may be parallel to the lengthwise direction of the Al wire <b>221</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>d</i>), and the flat end surface of the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> is pressed against the filament <b>23</b> and the Al wire <b>221</b>. Then, an ultrasonic wave is applied to the ultrasonic bonding tool <b>52</b> to fix the filament <b>23</b> to the Al wire <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The cross section of the fixed Al wire <b>221</b> and the fixed filament <b>23</b> is of a shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>e</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>f</i>). The filament <b>23</b> is embedded in the fixing portion <b>223</b> of the Al wire <b>221</b>, and the end of the filament <b>23</b> is bent in a letter Z or in an inverted letter Z.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>5</b>(<i>f</i>), the Al wire <b>221</b> and the filament <b>23</b> are arranged in such a manner that their lengthwise directions are oriented in the same directions (in parallel). Thus, each of the Al wires <b>221</b> can be arranged more closely to each other. As a result, the filaments <b>23</b> can be arranged in a fine pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>6</b>(<i>d</i>) show a detailed structure of the filament <b>23</b> for use in the fluorescent display tube of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>). The filament <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) is formed in a coil shape along the entire length wound at the same pitch. The filament <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) is formed in a coil shape along the entire length wound at partially different pitch. The filament <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>c</i>) is formed of coil sections and a straight section. The filament <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>d</i>) is formed of a straight section over the length.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>6</b>(<i>c</i>), the coil section is formed on the linear member such as the filament <b>23</b> to apply tension to the linear member. In the case where the linear member is, for example, a cathode filament, even if the filament extends when the filament is electrically heated, the extension is absorbed by the coil section. Consequently, the filament is prevented from relaxing and contacting with electrodes such as the grid. This is applicable to the case where the linear member is a wire grid. When the linear member is used as a filament damper, the coil section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>6</b>(<i>c</i>) is not required, because of no need of electric heating in the filament damper. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>d</i>), the straight filament along the entire length may be used for the filament damper.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the straight filament <b>23</b> to be tightly stretched on the jig is used, there is no need to provide the coil part in the filament. In stead of the coil part, a liner damper may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>) are cross sectional views showing a fluorescent display tube according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) is a cross sectional view of the fluorescent display tube taken along the line Y<b>5</b>-Y<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross sectional view of the fluorescent display tube taken along the line Y<b>4</b>-Y<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) looking in the direction of the arrow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>) show an embodiment of the fluorescent display tube using the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> which are different in length from the Al wires <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the fluorescent tube shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>), both ends of the filaments <b>23</b> are fixed to common Al spacer wires <b>2211</b> and <b>2221</b>. The Al wires <b>2211</b> and <b>2221</b> are fixed on the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> on the substrate <b>111</b>. The ends of the filaments <b>23</b> are fitted in the Al wires <b>2211</b> and <b>2221</b> at the positions where the filaments <b>23</b> are fixed. Then, the ends of the filaments <b>23</b> are bonded thereto by ultrasonic bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this case, the Al wires <b>2211</b> and <b>2221</b> are not required to be cut separately. Accordingly, when a lot of the filaments <b>23</b> are arranged in parallel at a fine pitch, the operation time for arranging the filament can be shortened. Further, the Al wires <b>2211</b> and <b>2221</b> can be used as a cathode electrode to compensate the current capacities of the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, which makes it possible to use the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> of narrow width and decrease the spaces for forming the Al thin films <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>. This is also applicable to the wire grid or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this embodiment, the Al wires <b>2211</b> and <b>2221</b> are formed in common to all of the filaments <b>23</b>. However, the Al wires may be divided into several segments, each of which a plurality of filaments <b>23</b> are fixed. For example, it is possible to divide four filaments <b>23</b> into upper and lower two groups each including two filaments <b>23</b>, for which the Al wire is formed to each group of the filaments <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the embodiments explained hereinabove, the descriptions have been given to the fixing portion for the filaments having stepped surfaces having the horizontal wall and the vertical wall formed on the Al spacer wire. However, the stepped portions may be of a sawtooth shape, an uneven shape, a stairstep shape, a curved shape or the like. Further, the fixing portion for the filament is not necessarily formed at one or several positions of the end of the Al spacer wire. The fixing portions of the filaments may be formed at one or several positions of an intermediate position of the Al spacer wire. Also, the filament is not necessarily fixed to the Al wire bonded to the Al thin film. Any metals, such as Cu, Au, Ag, N<b>1</b>, Pt, V, or an alloy, which is easily processed and bonded, may be used instead of the Al wire and Al thin film. Further, the Al wire is not necessarily in the shape of wire. Any conductive blocks capable of sustaining the filament at a predetermined height can be used. According to the present invention, the conductive block and the Al wire are referred to as a conductive spacer. Also, the Al thin film is not limited to a thin film. The film may be a metal layer including the thin film and thick film. The metal layer is referred to as a conductive layer in the present invention. The conductive layer can be formed on electronic components of the electron tube disposed inside the hermetic container via an insulating layer. The electronic component may be made of the same material as the conductive layers. The conductive spacer and the conductive layer are made of the same kind of metal, such as Al or Al alloy, in view of the bonding strength. However, it is most preferable to use the same metal, such as Al alloy, for the conductive spacers and for the conductive layers.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the embodiments explained hereinabove, descriptions have been given to the method of fixing the filament by ultrasonic bonding. However, the filament is not limited to fixing by ultrasonic bonding. Also, it is possible to fix not only the filament but also the linear member to be sustained at a predetermined height, such as, a liner grid, a linear damper and a linear spacer for preventing vibration of the filament or the linear grid, and linear getter. Further, the present invention is not limited to the fluorescent display tube having a triode tube structure. The fluorescent display tube may have a diode tube structure having no grid or a multi-electrode tube structure having two grids or more. According to the present invention, the linear member is not limited to mounting on the first substrate. The liner member may be fixed to the second substrate or side plates inside the fluorescent display tube. It is to be understood that the linear member is not necessarily disposed in alignment with the outer end of the conductive spacer. The end of the linear member may be protruded out from the conductive spacer or may be positioned on the inside of the conductive spacer as long as the linear member can be fixed. The linear member is not limited to fix at the end of the conductive spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to the fluorescent display tube. The present invention is applicable to electron tubes, such as a fluorescent luminous tube having fluorescent luminous elements with a large screen, a display tube such as a cathode-ray tube, a discharge tube such as a thermionic cathode discharge tube, and a vacuum electron tube which is provided with the linear members, such as filaments, linear grids, linear spacers, linear dampers, or linear getters, sustained in a predetermined height.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the electron tube of the present invention, the linear member is bent and embedded in the fixing portions of the conductive spacer when the linear member is fixed to the conductive spacer. Consequently, the bent portion of the linear member is hooked at the edge of the fixing portion, which makes it difficult for the linear member to come out from the fixing portion. Furthermore, contacting areas of the fixing portion increase due to the bending. As a result, the fixing strength of the linear member against a pulling force in the stretched direction of the linear member is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the electron tube of the present invention, the linear member can be sustained at the predetermined height while the linear member is fixed to the conductive spacer fixed on the conductive layer, such as, the Al thin film. This structure makes it unnecessary to dispose the holding member for sustaining the linear member at the predetermined height and the fixing member separately, which are required in the conventional electron tube. According to the present invention, a single conductive spacer works as both the height level holding member and the fixing member. Thus, the smaller space for disposing the height level holding member and the fixing member is required in the electron tube, thereby, the smaller size electron tube can be provided. According to the present invention, the height holding member and the fixing member can be made of a single conductive spacer, which decreases the fixing steps and the number of components and reduce the fabrication costs of the electron tube. Also, the same ultrasonic bonding machine can be used to bond the linear member and the conductive spacer in a single step. This permits the linear member and the conductive spacer to be fixed effectively and easily and the fixing work time can be shortened. According to the present invention, the conductive spacer and the liner member are arranged in order that their lengthwise directions may become the same directions. Accordingly, the interval between adjoining linear member can be decreased, and the linear member can be arranged at a fine pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In an alternative embodiment, the conductive material and the linear member are arranged in order that their lengthwise directions may be intersected with each other. In this instance, it is not required to cut the conductive spacer in pieces, and a large number of the linear member can be arranged in a fine pitch in a shorter working time. Further, ultrasonic bonding used to bond the conductive spacer does not generate heat at the bonding. Therefore, the electron tube of the present invention is free from the problem of damaging electric element in the electron tube due to the heat generated during the manufacture of the electron tube. According to the present invention, only one conductive spacer is provided at the end of the linear member. Thus, the quantity of radiant heat at the end of the linear member is small, which results in reducing the range of the end cool, enlarging the regions effective for display, and reducing the power consumption of the fluorescent display tube.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
