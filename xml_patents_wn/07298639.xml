<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to fuses included within semiconductor structures. More particularly, the present invention provides an electrical fuse that can be reprogrammed using a reverse electro-migration effect.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is known in the art, many modern semiconductor integrated circuits include fuses to protect sensitive parts during the manufacturing process, and for the activation of redundant circuits, such as redundant memory cells in the case of Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs). There are typically two types of fuses, a laser-blowable fuse, and an electrically (e.g., current) blowable-fuse. Electrically blowable fuses provide an advantage over laser-blowable fuses in terms of size.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With laser blowable fuses, the fuses are typically formed at or near the surface of the integrated circuit. A laser beam striking the fuse material renders the fuse non-conductive, thereby inhibiting current from flowing through the fuse. Although laser blowable fuses are relatively simple to fabricate, there are disadvantages associated with them. For example, laser blowable fuses tend to be surface oriented, which places a limitation on the design of the integrated circuit. Further, laser blowable fuses tend to occupy a large amount of space on the surface of an integrated circuit, since adjacent fuses or devices must not be placed too close to the fuse or risk being inadvertently damaged by the laser beam during the fuse blowing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electrically blowable fuses, on the other hand, do not have to be placed at or near the surface of the integrated circuit. Accordingly, they give designers greater latitude in fuse placement. In general, electrically blowable fuses tend to be smaller than laser blowable fuses, which render them highly suitable for use in modern high density integrated circuits. Further, electrically blowable fuses have a high programming speed compared to conventional laser blowable fuses.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various means have been used in the past to blow electrically blowable fuses. One recently used technique for opening the connection at the fuse employs the electro-migration effect, which has long been identified as a major metal failure mechanism. Electro-migration is the process whereby the ions of a metal conductor move in response to the passage of a high density current flow though the conductor. Such motion can lead to the formation of “voids” in the conductor, which can grow to a size where the conductor is unable to pass current. One can take advantage of the electro-migration effect to selectively open up metal connections (e.g., fuses) at desired locations within an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One limitation of such electrically blowable fuses is they can be programmed only once (e.g., from a state “1” (conducting) to a state “0” (non-conducting)). In other words, once an electrically blowable fuse has been opened using the electro-migration effect it can not be closed again. Therefore, to reprogram or reconfigure an integrated circuit, redundant electrically blowable fuses and complicated supporting circuitry would be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Studies have been made regarding the healing of electro-migration related damage using a current reversal method. Evidence of such healing has been reported by E. Castano, et al, in a paper entitled “In Situ Observation of DC and AC Electro-migration in Passivated Al Lines,” Applied Physics Letters, Volume 59, Issue 1, Jul. 1, 1991, pp. 129-131. In this paper, it was shown that void size could be decreased by applying current stress in a reverse direction. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, it was found that the average void size was reduced from 5.0 μm<sup>2 </sup>(point A) to 1.5 μm<sup>2 </sup>(point B) in less than one hour. A similar study was presented by J. Tao, et al. in a paper entitled, “An Electro-migration Failure Model for Interconnects under Pulsed and Bi-directional Current Stressing,” IEEE Trans on Electron Devices, Vol. 41, No. 4, April 1994, pp. 539-545. In this paper, it was shown that the resistance of a conductor made of Al/Si could be altered back and forth during forward and reverse current stressing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These and other such studies, however, have not provided a solution to the “programming only” nature of electrically blowable fuses that are programmed using the phenomenon of electro-migration.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides an electrical fuse that can be reprogrammed using a reverse electro-migration effect. Electro-migration is used to open a connection in the electrical fuse, while reverse electro-migration is used to subsequently close the opened connection. A programming/reprogramming circuit is provided to enable the use of such a reprogrammable electrical fuse.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The drawings are merely schematic representations, not intended to portray specific parameters of the invention. The drawings are intended to depict only typical embodiments of the invention, and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention. In the drawings, like numbering represents like elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The general operation of a reprogrammable electrical fuse <b>10</b>, hereafter referred to as an “e-fuse <b>10</b>” in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. In this example, the e-fuse <b>10</b> has a “dog-bone” shape to facilitate programming and reprogramming operations. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the e-fuse <b>10</b> includes a first conductive body region <b>12</b>, a second conductive body region <b>14</b>, and a conductive neck region <b>16</b> extending between the first and second body regions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. During programming, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a void <b>18</b> forms in the neck region <b>16</b> of the e-fuse <b>10</b> in response to the application of a current <b>1</b>. This occurs because of the so-called “crowding effect,” which is caused by the flow of electrons from a larger cross-sectional area (e.g., body region <b>12</b>) into a smaller cross-sectional area (e.g., neck region <b>16</b>). This leads to a large temperature gradient, which expedites the electromagnetic effect. The formation of the void <b>18</b> causes the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> to increase significantly. It should be noted that the neck region <b>16</b> must remain conductive to allow a reverse current flow required for reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">During reprogramming, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the void <b>18</b> is refilled and pushed toward the larger cross-sectional area of the body region <b>12</b> in response to the application of an oppositely directed current I, thereby restoring the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b>. This occurs because of a so-called current “de-crowding effect.” If too much current stress is applied in the reverse direction, however, the void <b>18</b> may start to increase in size again at a different location. To this extent, to make the e-fuse <b>10</b> of the present invention reprogrammable, one must:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">(1) Provide a structure that allows metal to migrate in a controllable manner in both forward and reverse current flow directions;</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(2) Create a large resistive ratio change; and</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(3) Provide a reference resistance R<sub>ref </sub>to determine the state of the e-fuse <b>10</b>. Prior to programming (and after reprogramming) the reference resistance R<sub>ref </sub>is higher than the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b>. After programming, the reference resistance R<sub>ref </sub>is much lower than the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Different voltages and currents may be applied to the e-fuse <b>10</b> to perform programming and reprogramming. During programming, the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> will rise higher than the reference resistance R<sub>ref</sub>, while during reprogramming the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> will drop lower than the reference resistance R<sub>ref</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention provides a sensor circuit (described in greater detail below) to sense the change of resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> and latch the results into a corresponding register. One reference resistance can be shared by a bank of e-fuses <b>10</b> to save power and area overhead. In this case, sensing can be done in sequential manner, for example, during a power-on sequence to read the bank of e-fuses <b>10</b>, and the results stored in one or more registers. The stored results can be used to provide information regarding programming state. The registers can comprise a small cache memory like that of DRAMs, or local registers.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an illustrative e-fuse <b>10</b> has a “dog-bone” shape with a taper angle θ of about 45 to 75 degrees and a neck region <b>16</b> with a width/body ratio from about 1/10 to ⅓, depending on the width of the body regions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. As will be presented in greater detail below, the taper facilitates the programming/reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cross-sectional views of the e-fuse <b>10</b> taken along line <b>4</b>B-<b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C-<b>4</b>C are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>, respectively. A uniform thickness of a barrier film formed of a material such as titanium (Ti), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), titanium nitride (TiN), or a combination thereof is deposited in a conventional manner at the bottom of the e-fuse <b>10</b> to form a barrier layer <b>20</b>. Due to the reduced surface area within the neck region <b>16</b>, the deposited barrier film will be much thicker in the neck region <b>16</b> as compared to the body regions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The thicker barrier layer <b>20</b> in the neck region <b>18</b> shrinks the cross-section of the neck region <b>16</b> in the third (i.e., Z) dimension. This increases the current density inside the neck region <b>16</b>, thereby enhancing the electro-migration effect in the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A metal material <b>22</b>, such as aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), aluminum-copper (Al/Cu) alloy, or other suitable metal material susceptible to electro-migration, is then deposited and planarized (e.g., using chemical-mechanical-polishing (CMP)). A depletion region d<b>1</b> is formed at the surface of the body regions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. A dielectric material (not shown) is deposited to cap the top surface of the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sidewall <b>24</b> of the e-fuse <b>10</b> comprises a barrier liner formed of a material such as Ti, Ta, W, TiN, or a combination thereof. Other conductive materials such as doped poly-silicon or a silicided diffusion region can also be used. The barrier liner can be used to provide the reference resistance R<sub>ref </sub>described above with regard to the programming/reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>. The material of the barrier liner is not sensitive to the electro-migration effect and has a resistance value higher than that of the e-fuse <b>10</b> prior to programming (and after reprogramming) and a resistance value much lower than that of the e-fuse <b>10</b> after programming. The material of the barrier liner is preferably compatible with back end of line (BEOL) metallization processes to limit processing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After programming, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>, a void <b>18</b> is created in the neck region <b>16</b> of the e-fuse <b>10</b> due to the electro-migration effect. As a result, the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> is drastically increased, even though the void <b>18</b> may only be located partially within the neck region <b>16</b>. Programming conditions (e.g., voltage, current, temperature, etc.) are controlled so that that a desired void <b>18</b> size is formed. If the void <b>18</b> size is too small, the e-fuse <b>10</b> will be under-programmed. If the void <b>18</b> size is too large, it may not be possible to reprogram the e-fuse <b>10</b>. Neither of these conditions is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, during the programming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>, metal migrates from the neck region <b>16</b> of the e-fuse <b>10</b> toward the body region <b>14</b> and accumulates to a depth d<b>2</b>. As a result, this area of the e-fuse <b>10</b> has a higher atomic density and is more stressed than before programming. The migration of the metal results in the creation of a void <b>18</b> located at least partially within the neck region <b>16</b> of the e-fuse <b>10</b>. Different degrees of programming can be used to create different sized voids <b>18</b>′, <b>18</b>″, etc., with different depths, resulting in different resistance values for the programmed e-fuse <b>10</b>. The resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> after programming is much greater than the reference resistance R<sub>ref</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">During the programming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>, high-voltage and high-current are applied to the e-fuse <b>10</b> at room or high temperature (e.g., 100 to 250° C.) to “open” the e-fuse <b>10</b> in a relatively short period of time. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that at least some of the metal material <b>22</b> remains within the neck region <b>16</b> to allow a reverse current to be applied during a subsequent reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>. As with programming, the reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b> is carried out under high-current, voltage and at room or high temperature, but in the opposite direction. As shown, excessive metal that accumulated on the body region <b>14</b> of the e-fuse <b>10</b> migrates toward the neck region <b>16</b> and at least partially fills the void <b>18</b>. It may be desirable to perform in-situ monitoring during reprogramming to minimize the depth of the void <b>18</b> inside the neck region <b>16</b>. The resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> after reprogramming is once again much lower than the reference resistance R<sub>ref</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another embodiment of the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>. As shown, a reprogrammable e-fuse <b>30</b> can be formed using a conductive double-layer metal structure <b>32</b>. In particular, a top metal layer <b>34</b> of the double-layer metal structure <b>32</b> can be formed using a metal material that is susceptible to electro-migration, while the bottom metal layer <b>36</b> of the double-layer metal structure <b>32</b> can be formed using a metal material that is much less susceptible (or not susceptible) to electro-migration. For example, since pure copper (Cu) is at least 2 to 4 times more susceptible to electro-migration than pure aluminum (Al) or certain alloys of Al, the top metal layer <b>34</b> can be formed of copper, while the bottom metal layer <b>36</b> can be formed of Al or an alloy thereof. In another embodiment of the present invention, the metal layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> can be reversed such that the metal material that is susceptible to electro-migration is located below the metal material that is much less susceptible (or not susceptible) to electro-migration. The metal material that is susceptible to electro-migration can also be sandwiched between layers of, or surrounded by, the metal material that is much less susceptible (or not susceptible) to electro-migration.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">During programming of the e-fuse <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a void <b>38</b> is formed in the top metal layer <b>34</b>, which increases the resistance of the reprogrammable e-fuse <b>30</b> such that it is much greater than a reference resistance R<sub>ref </sub>of the e-fuse <b>30</b>. During reprogramming, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the void <b>38</b> is at least partially refilled and the resistance of the e-fuse <b>30</b> is reduced. Any suitable bi-layer or multi-layer metal structure can be used to form the reprogrammable e-fuse <b>30</b>. The bottom metal layer <b>36</b> can also be used to provide the reference resistance R<sub>ref </sub>instead of using a barrier liner as detailed above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Illustrative programming and reprogramming circuitry <b>40</b> for a reprogrammable e-fuse <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. During programming, the control pin “F” is set to high, so that the two nMOS devices N<b>11</b> and N<b>12</b> are on, but the other two nMOS devices N<b>10</b> and N<b>13</b> are off. A programming current with a preset current pulse height and width is applied to the e-fuse <b>10</b> from net A to net B. Similarly, during reprogramming, the control pin “F” is set to low, so that the two nMOS devices N<b>11</b> and N<b>12</b> are off, but the other two nMOS devices N<b>10</b> and N<b>13</b> are on. A reprogramming current with another preset pulse height and width is applied to the e-fuse <b>10</b> element in the opposite direction, from net B to net A.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An illustrative sensing circuit <b>50</b> for a reprogrammable e-fuse <b>10</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown, the e-fuse <b>10</b> and a reference element R<sub>ref </sub>having a resistance R<sub>ref </sub>serve as the load for cross-coupled nMOS devices N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b>. A control pin “Sample” is used to activate the sensing operation. The “Sample” signal is tied to the gate of a pMOS device P<b>1</b> and a nMOS device N<b>3</b>. After programming, most of the current will flow through N<b>1</b> and cause node B to go “high,” since the resistance of e-fuse <b>10</b> after programming should be substantially higher than that of the reference element R<sub>ref</sub>. The final “high” state is latched in a latch register <b>52</b>. On the other hand, after reprogramming, the resistance of the e-fuse <b>10</b> should be substantially lower than that of the reference element R<sub>ref</sub>, and more current will flow through N<b>2</b> and cause node B to go “low.” The final “low” state is latched in the latch register <b>52</b>. During programming and reprogramming, the “Sample” signal is off, so that both node A and B will be at float. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, either N<b>12</b> (program) or N<b>13</b> (reprogram) is on and a path to ground is provided to allow current to flow only through the e-fuse <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sensing circuit <b>50</b> does not allow the reference element R<sub>ref </sub>to be shared among a plurality of e-fuses <b>10</b>. If the size of the reference element R<sub>ref </sub>is relative small this approach is acceptable—a separate reference element R<sub>ref </sub>can be provided for each e-fuse <b>10</b>. Otherwise, a sensing circuit <b>60</b> such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can be used, where a single reference element <b>62</b> in a reference unit <b>64</b> is shared by a plurality of e-fuse units <b>66</b> (only one is shown). In sensing circuit <b>60</b>, the reference unit <b>64</b> is used to generate a reference voltage equal to (Vdd-I*R<sub>ref</sub>), where I is the current flow through the reference path formed by pMOS device P<b>51</b> and nMOS devices N<b>51</b> and N<b>61</b>, and R<sub>ref </sub>is the resistance of the reference element R<sub>ref</sub>. The current I is mirrored by a shared current source <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each e-fuse unit <b>66</b> includes an e-fuse <b>70</b>. An identical amount of current I is mirrored via nMOS device N<b>62</b>. The output voltage at node B is Vdd-I*R<sub>f</sub>, where R<sub>f </sub>is the resistance of the e-fuse <b>70</b>. A comparator <b>72</b> is formed by two pMOS devices P<b>53</b> and P<b>54</b>, two nMOS devices N<b>52</b> and N<b>54</b>, and a tail device N<b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The output from the reference unit <b>64</b> (node C) is tied to the gate of the nMOS device N<b>53</b> and the output of the e-fuse path (node B) is tied to the gate of the nMOS device N<b>54</b>. After programming, R<sub>f</sub>&gt;R<sub>ref</sub>, and the voltage at node B is lower than at node C, so that output of the comparator <b>72</b> will go high and the high state will be latched by latch <b>74</b>. Otherwise, after reprogramming, a low state will be latched by latch <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An illustrative physical layout of a reprogrammable e-fuse system <b>80</b> in accordance with the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As shown, the physical layout of the e-fuse system <b>80</b> includes a programming power and timing generator <b>82</b>, a reprogramming power and timing generator <b>84</b>, and a plurality of e-fuse units <b>86</b>. Each e-fuse unit <b>86</b> further includes an e-fuse module <b>88</b>, a sensing element <b>90</b> and a latch <b>92</b>. The programming power and timing generator <b>82</b> and reprogramming power and timing generator <b>84</b> can be merged into a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned above, the use of a tapered neck region <b>16</b> facilitates the programming/reprogramming of the e-fuse <b>10</b>. An analytical model illustrating the predicted electro-migration behavior in a tapered structure is presented below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The tapered structure <b>100</b> used in this analysis is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As shown, the tapered structure <b>100</b> includes first and second body regions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and a neck region <b>106</b> that extends between the first and second body regions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The first and second body regions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> each have a thickness of 0.5 μm, while the thickness of the neck region <b>106</b> varies from a minimum of 0.14 μm to a maximum of 0.5 μm. The taper of the neck region <b>106</b> is specified by a taper angle β. Based on the tapered structure <b>100</b>, the following items were examined:</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(A) Growth of void during forward current stressing conditions and void shrinkage during reverse current stressing conditions;</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">(B) Effects of taper geometry (β)——vary length of tapered neck region <b>106</b>, keeping same minimum and maximum widths; and</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(C) Time required to form a void and remove the void for selected void sizes (e.g., 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 μm).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The following analytic modeling assumptions were used:</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">(A) Void growth emanates from the beginning (i.e., narrowest width region) of tapered neck region <b>106</b> (no incubation time);</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">(B) Metal (e.g., Cu) removed from void is deposited at the end of tapered neck region <b>106</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">(c) Metal is redeposited in the void during reverse current;</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">(D) Void growth kinetics from data on uncapped structures, T=225° C.;</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">(E) Growth velocity has exponential dependence on temperature; and</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">(F) Growth velocity has linear dependence on current density.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Based on these modeling assumptions, for a tapered neck region <b>106</b> with a length of 1.0 μm, the predicted void growth during forward current stressing (J<sub>0</sub>=70 mA/μm<sup>2 </sup>through 0.5 μm wide line) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The predicted void growth and shrinkage for a tapered neck region 1.0 μm long and with a taper angle β=10° is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The predicted void growth and shrinkage for a tapered neck region 106 0.5 μm long and with a taper angle β=20° is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The predicted void growth and shrinkage for a tapered neck region 2.0 μm long and with a taper angle β=5° is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">From the above graphs, it can be seen that:</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">(A) Predicted electro-migration behavior in the tapered structure <b>100</b> follows asymmetric void growth and shrinkage during forward and reverse current.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">(B) Taper Angle (β):</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(1) Larger taper angle β increases time required to reach equivalent void size and increases nonlinearity of void growth rate.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">(2) Total time for void growth and shrinkage is roughly equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">(C) Time to reach equal void size is roughly proportional to current density (J).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">(D) Strong dependence of temperature on void growth (activated process).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">(Joule heating not accounted for in analytical model).</p>
