<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a camera control apparatus and method and, more particularly to a camera control apparatus and method for remote-controlling a camera via a network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A camera control system for controlling a camera (e.g., panning, tilting and zooming of the camera) from a remote place is widely known.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this system, even though camera control is performed via a network, a device for camera control and a client device do not depend on common specification but on unique specifications (e.g., protocol and control information).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in recent years, the Internet has been becoming popular with rapidity, and there is an increasing need from end users to see video images sensed by a camera at a remote place via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One means to meet this requirement is to periodically store a video image sensed by a camera, in a file, into a storage device of a server connected to the camera, and transfer the file to a terminal (client) that has accessed the server. On the end-user side, a browser, for example, is activated so as to display the video image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, this merely displays the video image as sensed, but cannot meet requirements to see, e.g., the image in a view a little shifted to either side, the image in a wider view, or the image expanded within the view.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The conventional camera remote-control technique is based on particular specification, which cannot be applied to use on the Internet.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and has its object to provide a camera control apparatus and method which provides an end user with environment to easily remote-control a video camera via a general network such as the Internet.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the construction of a camera control apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>1001</b> denotes a camera control apparatus, basically comprising a personal computer, for example. Numeral <b>1003</b> denotes a video camera (hereinafter simply referred to as “camera”) as the object of the control by the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b>. The content of control includes control of image-sensing condition such as panning, tilting, exposure and the like as well as zooming. For the control, the camera <b>1003</b> has a panhead (not shown). The camera <b>1003</b> and the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> are connected to each other via, e.g., an RS232C interface generally used in a personal computer. Note that the video information obtained by the camera <b>1003</b> is outputted to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> via a dedicated cable which is specially provided.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> has the following construction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Numeral <b>1017</b> denotes a camera controller which outputs various control signals via the above interface; <b>1018</b>, a video-image input unit which inputs a video image sensed by the camera <b>1003</b> by using an image capture device or the like; <b>1011</b>, a communication interface unit for the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> to exchange information with another apparatus by using a network adapter or the like. Besides these resources, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> comprises a command interpreter <b>1012</b>, which is realized as a program or memory data utilizing the various resources such as a CPU, a storage device and an auxiliary storage device of a computer, an acceptance code generator <b>1013</b>, a timer <b>1015</b>, an image memory <b>1019</b>, and a reservation register <b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Numeral <b>1002</b> denotes an external device such as a WWW (World Wide Web) server or a WWW browser for communication by the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) protocol. That is, a WWW browser sends a request in accordance with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) indicating the storage destination of desired data to a WWW server, which is a storage of document data and image data. In response to the request, the WWW server returns corresponding document data or image data to the WWW browser.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses a method realized by the WWW servers. That is, communication is performed by the HTTP protocol, and the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> behaves as if it is a WWW server. This is possible by applying the WWW server's communication method to the present control apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, when image data is pasted in a WWW document, the request command is described as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0042">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/image001.gif”&gt;
<br/>
(A character string in quotation marks “” is described as single string without any line-feed/new paragraph mark.)
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">This means that it is requested to transfer image data stored in a file “image001.gif” in a WWW server “www.foo.co.jp”. The browser displays the image transferred from the WWW server on its display window image.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">The present embodiment performs remote camera control while utilizing the above specification.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">That is, in the present embodiment, a character string corresponding to the above file name is interpreted as a command. Specifically, camera-angle destination such as panning, tilting and zooming are represented by alphabets “P”, “T” and “Z” respectively, then, respective control amounts are represented by numerical values.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">Assuming that the camera <b>1003</b> has a pan angle from −50° to 50°, a tilt angle from −20° to 20° and 1 to 8 times zooming, when image sensing is performed with a pan angle of 20°, a tile angle of 5° and twice zooming, and the obtained image is pasted as “gif” format image data, the description is as follows (note that the network address of the present camera control apparatus is www.foo.co.jp):
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0047">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/P20T5Z2.gif”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The external device <b>1002</b>, which is a WWW server for the WWW browsers, outputs the above character string in HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) description to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b>, requiring the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">When this request enters the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b>, the command interpreter <b>1012</b> is activated to start interpretation of the request (the above HTML character string) and processing of a response to the request.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing an example of the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">First, at step S<b>101</b>, the command described as a file name is interpreted. That is, if the head of the request is “P”, the command is recognized as an image-sensing command, then process proceeds to step S<b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">At this step, the camera <b>1003</b> is controlled by the camera controller <b>1017</b> based on the designated pan, tilt and zoom values. The obtained image is captured by the video-image input unit <b>1018</b>, and converted into data of the designated image format, then sent to the external device <b>1002</b> requiring the image data, via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b>. The external device <b>1002</b> stores the image data, and transfers the image data to the initial request originator.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">At this time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data. Then, the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Thus, the obtained video image is displayed in the HTML document as if it is image data stored in a file in the WWW server.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In the command interpretation at step S<b>101</b>, if the head of the request is “R”, the command is recognized as a reservation command designating image-sensing time. Then, the process proceeds to step S<b>105</b> via the determination of image-sensing condition at step S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">The reservation command starts with “R”; then it continues with integers indicating year, month, day, hour, and minute, each terminated with a period, and with designation of panning, tilting and zooming as image-sensing condition; finally it ends with a name (an extension) indicating the image format. Note that if it has no image-sensing condition, the camera angle at the designated image-sensing time is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">For example, if video-image sensing is programmed with image-sensing time of 13:15 on Jul. 6, 1997, a pan angle of 25°, a tilt angle of 0° and a 3 times zooming, in gif format, the reservation is described as follows:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0058">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/R1996.7.6.13.15.P25T0Z3.gif”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">When the above reservation command is designated, a unique identification number is received as an acceptance code (code indicating that reservation is accepted) from the acceptance code generator <b>103</b> at step S<b>105</b>. The acceptance code may be a count value which is incremented by one (+1) at each request generated, or may be a numerical value indicating the designated time (year, month, date and time).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">Then, at step S<b>106</b>, the acceptance code and information on the designated time, the image-sensing condition and the image format are registered into a storage device (not shown) of the reservation register <b>1014</b>. At step S<b>107</b>, the acceptance code is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> which issued the reservation command, further, toward the end user.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">Note that at this time, to indicate that the response is an acceptance code, content-type information and status information are added to the head of the code. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">However, if an HTML document including such image-sensing reservation is simply generated but a general WWW browser is used to display the obtained image, the acceptance code instead of image data is returned and an image is not displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">However, if image-sensing is reserved with respect to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> by using a CGI program or the like of the WWW server, in the same manner as that in the WWW browser, and after an acceptance code has been obtained, an HTML document is generated with image-data description designating the acceptance code by an image read command to be described later, image sensing can be performed as programmed when the document is displayed by the WWW browser, and the image data can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">That is, when the designated time registered in the reservation register <b>1014</b> has come, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> controls the camera <b>1003</b> at the registered camera angle to perform the programmed image sensing, and stores the obtained image data in the designated format with an appropriate name, e.g., an acceptance code, as a file name, into the image memory <b>1019</b>. Thereafter, when an image read command (including an acceptance code) is sent from the external device <b>1002</b>, image data corresponding to the read command is read from the image memory <b>1019</b>, and transferred in the designated format to the external device <b>1002</b>, and the terminal of the end user (WWW browser).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">Note that the image read command starts with alphabet “G”, then continues with the acceptance code, and ends with the extension indicating the image format.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">The acceptance code is returned to the external device <b>1002</b> upon reservation. For example, if “12543” is returned as an acceptance code, to read the image obtained by programmed image sensing, the following description is used:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0067">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/G12543.gif”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">Various information is stored into the storage device of the reservation register <b>1014</b> in the format of a table, e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Note that in the present embodiment, the reservation register <b>1014</b> uses its own storage device, however, the reservation register <b>1014</b> may use the image memory <b>1019</b> of the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> or any other storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Note that the character string (“gif” in this case) meaning image formation, added to the end of the image read command must be basically the same as that of the reservation command. If different character string is used in the read command, however, it may be arranged such that the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> converts the image stored in the image memory <b>1019</b> with the reservation code into a newly designated format data and transfers the converted data.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the above reservation, the acceptance code is “12543”. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the reservation data indicates, first, image-sensing time, the acceptance code, image-sensing condition, and an image format.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The image memory <b>1019</b> is managed in the format as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where an acceptance code (issued in correspondence with a reservation command, having a meaning equivalent to a file name), an image format, and actual image data are stored. Note that the image memory <b>1019</b> may be a storage device of any format, preferably having a sufficient capacity; for example, the image memory <b>1019</b> may be a hard disk device, a magneto-optical disk device and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">Next, the process procedure of the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment when it has received an image read command will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">In the command interpretation at step S<b>101</b>, if the head of the command is “G”, the process proceeds to step S<b>104</b>, at which it is determined whether or not the command is a reservation command. Since the command is not a reservation command (NO at step S<b>104</b>) in this case, the process proceeds to step S<b>108</b>. As it is determined at step S<b>108</b> that the command is an image read command, the process proceeds to step S<b>109</b>, at which corresponding data stored in the image memory <b>1019</b> is searched based on the acceptance code included in the image read command.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">Then, at step S<b>110</b>, it is determined whether or not the data obtained by the above search has the same value of the acceptance code described as the image read command. If YES, the image data is read, and transferred via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">Also at this time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data (step S<b>111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">At step S<b>112</b>, data in the storage area of the image memory <b>1019</b>, from which the image data has been read out, is deleted. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">If it is determined at step S<b>110</b> that image data corresponding to the designated acceptance code is not stored, as the programmed image sensing has not been performed and corresponding image has not been obtained otherwise the image data has been already transferred and deleted from the image memory, error information is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">Further, if it determined at step S<b>108</b> that the head of the command from the external device <b>1002</b> is not “G”, error information indicating that the command is an undefined command is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">As described above, information exchange is performed between the external device <b>1002</b> and the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">Next, the timer <b>1015</b>, used for performing camera control and storing the result of image-sensing, based on reservation data registered in the reservation register <b>1014</b>, will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">In the timer <b>1015</b>, at intervals of a predetermined period, e.g., one minute, a timer program is activated. This program is realized by utilizing a timer of a computer or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">The operation of the timer program will be described with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0083">First, at step S<b>201</b>, the current time is read from a timer of the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b>, and the process proceeds to step S<b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">At step S<b>202</b>, reserved contents, i.e., items of programmed image sensing sequentially registered in a respective row of the table of the storage device are read from the reservation register <b>1014</b>. When it is determined at step S<b>203</b> that all the items of programmed image sensing have been read out, the process ends, otherwise, the process proceeds to step S<b>204</b>, at which it is determined whether or not the designated time in the reserved data is in the future. If it is determined that the current time is not the designated time yet, the processing at step S<b>202</b> and the subsequent steps is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">On the other hand, if it is determined at step S<b>204</b> that the current time is the designated time or past the designated time, the process proceeds to step S<b>205</b>, at which the camera <b>1003</b> is controlled to perform image sensing, by the camera controller <b>1017</b>, in accordance with the image-sensing condition of the items of the programmed image sensing read from the reservation register <b>1014</b>. Then, the obtained image is converted into image data of the image format designated by a corresponding item of the programmed image sensing. At step S<b>206</b>, the image data is stored, with an acceptance code and image format information, into the image memory <b>1019</b>. As a result, the image data in the format as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">Next, at step S<b>207</b>, the read items of programmed image sensing are deleted from the reservation register <b>1014</b>, and the process returns to step S<b>202</b> to repeat the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">As described above, image sensing is performed as programmed, and the result of the image sensing is stored, thereafter, when an image read command is sent from the external device <b>1002</b>, the image data is returned in response to the command.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">As described above, a live image obtained by controlling a remote camera can be easily pasted in a WWW document by connecting the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment to a network of the www system, and describing a URL where description of image-sensing condition is added to the address of the camera control apparatus, as the source of the image data. Note that if only pasting the image data in a WWW document is performed, the acceptance code generator <b>1013</b>, the timer <b>1015</b>, the image memory <b>1019</b> and the reservation register <b>1014</b> are unnecessary, and step S<b>104</b> and the subsequent steps of the processing by the command interpreter <b>1012</b> are unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">Further, by providing the timer <b>1015</b>, the image memory <b>1019</b> and the reservation register <b>1014</b>, programmed image sensing can be reserved, and later the result of image sensing can be taken into a WWW page and the image can be displayed in the WWW page, by utilizing a CGI program of a WWW server or the like. Especially, if image sensing is tried by controlling a remote camera when the network is overcrowded, image transfer takes much time and cannot smoothly provides image data. However, according to the present embodiment, image sensing in such time is programmed with specific camera angle for a necessary period, and the programmed image sensing is reserved, thereafter, stored image data can be read when the network becomes less crowded, e.g., at midnight.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">Especially, image sensing can be performed plural times with the same camera angle at short intervals regardless of the transmission capacity of the network.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">Note that the HTTP protocol is used as the interface between the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> and the external device <b>1002</b>, however, any other communication interface can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">Note that the acceptance code is used to identify sensed image data corresponding to the reservation of programmed image sensing, however, it may be arranged such that, instead of using the acceptance code generator, a unique request code is generated on the external device <b>1002</b> side (end user side) as a part of a reservation command, then the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> identifies the image data by the correspondence between the request code and the external device <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Further, it may be arranged such that upon notifying the above request code to the image-requesting side, a password is issued, and when the image data is read, the image data can be transferred to the image-requesting side by the reservation code with the password. This avoids at least the inconvenience that a third person sends an image transfer request with accidentally the same reservation code and the file is transferred to the third person then deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">Further, image-sensing time is designated in minute unit, however, it may be designated in second or millisecond unit.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">In the present embodiment, to indicate the image format, the extension “gif” is employed. It may be arranged such that the image format indicated by the extension “gif” is arbitrarily changed for a JPEG format indicated by an extension “jpg”.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">Further, the file name is regarded as a command, however, a parameter description of a URL can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">For example, panning, tilting, zooming and image format are respectively set to “25°”, “5°”, “twice” and “gif”, image sensing can be programmed by the following description:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">Further, a WWW server may be installed into the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment. In this case, for example, a name “camctl.exe” is given to the program of the command interpreter <b>1012</b> as a CGI program for the WWW server, and the image sensing can be programmed by the following description:
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">

</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, once the image data obtained by programmed image sensing has been transferred, the image data (file) is deleted, however, the image data is not necessarily deleted at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">That is, it may be arranged such that the image data, obtained by programmed image sensing and stored as a file, is held for an appropriate period, and when the period has elapsed, the image data is deleted even if the image data has not been transferred. This allows a plurality of end users to obtain the same image.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">Further, it may be arranged such that a password is issued to an end user according to circumstances, and the image data is transferred only when the password coincides with that of the image data.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">In the above first embodiment, programmed image sensing can be reserved for only one image.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">Next, a second embodiment will be described a an example where a plurality of reservation commands are combined into a single file name, and a file extension indicating the image format is added to the file name, so as to reserve programmed image sensing with a plurality of image-sensing times and/or a plurality of camera angles.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">For example, if image sensing is programmed with image-sensing times of 13:15, 13:30 and 13:45 on Jul. 6, 1997, a pan angle of 25°, a tilt angle of 0°, 3 times zoom ratio, with intention to read three images in “gif” format later, the reservation is described as follows:

    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0107">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/R1996.7.6.13.15P25T0Z3+R1996.7. 6.13.30P25T0Z3+R1996.7.6.13.45P25T0Z3.gif”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">Note that if the image sensing is performed plural times at the same time or on the same date or at the same camera angle, the corresponding information in the character string may be omitted. For example, the above reservation command may be described as follows:

    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0109">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/R1996.7.6.13.15P25T0Z3+R....30+R....45.gif”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0110">Note in the above description, each period means omission of the same numerical value as the initially set numerical value (in this case, year, month, day, hour and minute). This reduces the amount of information by omitting corresponding information such as date.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111">The basic construction of the second embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment except the following changes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112">That is, in the process procedure of the command interpreter <b>1012</b>, steps S<b>106</b>, S<b>111</b> and S<b>112</b> are executed in accordance with the command including the above description indicated by “+”.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113">In accordance with the command interpretation, image data are stored in accordance with acceptance codes “12543-1”, “12543-2” and “12543-3”, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, from the acceptance code in the reservation table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Note that the acceptance code transferred to the WWW browser is only “12543”. Thereafter, when an image read command is received, image data having the common part of the acceptance codes (“12543” in this case) are found. The image data are re-formatted in the order of the numerals after the hyphen of the common part of the acceptance codes, into a single image data indicating a plurality of images, and the image data is returned via the communication interface unit <b>101</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data. The above reformat of plural image data as a single image data is realized by, e.g., combining image data sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114">At this time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0115">At step S<b>112</b> according to the second embodiment, the data in the storage areas in the image memory <b>1019</b>, from which the plurality of image data have been read, are deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0116">The above construction enables to program image sensing, at a plurality of camera angles or image-sensing times at one time, and handles a plurality of image data obtained by the plurality of programmed image sensing as a single image data file comprising a plurality of images, thus unnecessitates management of a plurality of acceptance codes corresponding to the respective images.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0117">Further, if this technique is applied to interval image sensing such as a record of a plant's growth, an image file containing a series of images can be handled as a pseudo moving image.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0118">Note that in this case, the plurality of image data are not combined, but sequentially transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0119">It goes without saying that applications of the present embodiment is similar to the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0120">In the above second embodiment, in case of image sensing at fixed intervals, reservation commands must be combined corresponding to the number of image sensings.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0121">Next, a third embodiment will be described as an example where, in the reservation command, immediately after the designated time end time and interval time are added, and then image-sensing condition such as a camera angle and the image format are designated, to reduce the amount of information to be set. In this embodiment, the end time is designated by numerical values following alphabet “t”, and the interval time is designated by numerical values following alphabet “e” in minute unit.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0122">For example, in a case where image sensing is programmed with image-sensing time of 13:15 and 13:45 on Jul. 6, 1997, a pan angle of 25°, a tilt angle of 0° and 3 times zooming, with intention to read three images later, the reservation command is described as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0124">As described above, if the image-sensing date or time are the same, the description of these image-sensing date or time can be omitted. In such case, the reservation command is described as follows:

<p id="p-0119" num="0128">Further, in this case, the table format registered in the reservation register <b>1014</b> is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0129">That is, the end time and interval time of image sensing are added to the record in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0130">On the other hand, at step S<b>106</b> in the command interpretation, if the reservation command has end time and interval time, the reservation is registered as programmed image sensing with the end time, the interval time, with the time of reservation as image-sensing time, and the image format, into the reservation register <b>1014</b> with the acceptance code.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0131">Further, if the requested reservation command indicates simple reservation without end time and interval time, the image-sensing time is set as the end time, and the interval time is set to “1”.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0132">At step S<b>111</b>, a plurality of image data registered as “12543-1”, “12543-2” . . . , having the same common part of acceptance code, similar to the second embodiment, are read, then re-formatted as a single image data including a plurality of image data, and returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0133">At the time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format is added to the head of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0134">At step S<b>112</b>, data in the storage areas in the image memory <b>1019</b>, from which the plurality of image data have been read, are deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0135">On the other hand, at step S<b>207</b> in the timer program, the registered reservation information is updated with information obtained by adding the interval time in the read items of the programmed image sensing, and if the updated image-sensing time is behind the end time, the item of the image-sensing time is deleted from the reservation register <b>2014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0136">More specifically, the timer <b>1015</b> checks the contents of reservation at intervals of one minute. If the timer <b>1015</b> determines that the current time is the image-sensing time in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or the image-sensing time has passed (error is allowable within one minute), the image-sensing condition “P25T0Z3” is forwarded to the camera controller <b>1017</b> to perform image sensing. Then one of data as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is stored in the image memory <b>1019</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the interval time “15” is added to the image-sensing time “1996.7.6.13.15”, thus the image-sensing time is updated to “1996.7.6.13.30”, as preparation for the next image sensing. As a result, when the image-sensing time has passed the end time, the data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0137">The above construction enables to easily perform interval image sensing by a short reservation command.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0138">Especially, when interval image sensing is performed for a long period, the second embodiment cannot substantially perform the image sensing due to the lengthiness of the reservation command.

<p id="p-0133" num="0143">That is, a moving-image compressor <b>2021</b> such as an MPEG1 compressing unit is added, and the command interpreter <b>4012</b> which interprets the file extension “mpg” is provided in place of a command interpreter <b>1012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0144">In this embodiment, at step S<b>111</b> of the command interpretation process procedure, if the designated image format is a still image format such as “jpg” or “gif”, a plurality of image data registered with the same reservation code are read, then, they are reformatted into a single image data including a plurality of image data, and the image data is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0145">At step S<b>111</b>, if the designated image format is “mpg”, a plurality of image data registered with the same reservation code are read, then the images are compressed by the moving-image compressor <b>2021</b>, and the compressed moving image data are returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0146">At this time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0147">The above construction compresses image data by using the relation between image frames, and especially in interval image sensing with slight change, compresses image data by a large data amount.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0138" num="0148">In the third embodiment, the same camera angle is designated for interval image sensing.

<p id="p-0139" num="0149">The definition of the control variable is described as “$(definition main body)”. The definition main body is described by two ways of representation. One description is designating an initial value, an end value, and an increment. It is further divided into two descriptions depending on whether the increment is positive or negative. The other description is designating all the values of the control variable.

<p id="p-0140" num="0153">Note that &lt;control variable&gt;is a character string, comprising at least one alphabet letter, as an identifier of the control variable.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0154">The reference of the control variable is described as “$(reference main body)”. The reference main body is operation using the four arithmetic rules (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) including the control variable.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0163">Note that it is impossible to perform image sensing to obtain a plurality of video images at the same time. Actually, image sensing is performed at intervals depending on the operation speed of the camera panhead.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0164">Although the basic construction of the fifth embodiment is the same as that of the second embodiment, step S<b>106</b> in the processing procedure by the command interpretation <b>1012</b> is changed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Note that if the character subsequent to “R” is “$”, as the definition of a control variable is described, the reservation command is described in accordance with the fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0165">First, at step S<b>501</b>, one control variable definition which starts with “$(“and ends with”)” is obtained, and at step S<b>502</b>, it is determined whether or not all the definitions have been obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0167">At step S<b>504</b>, the rest of the command is scanned to find a control variable reference which starts with “$(“and ends with”)”, and previously initialized corresponding variable is replaced with the obtained control variable reference. When the replacement for the number of control variables has been completed, the process proceeds to step S<b>506</b>, at which the character string obtained by the above processing is interpreted as a reservation command for the above-described repetitive image sensing. Then the programmed image sensing is registered with the same reservation code generated at step S<b>105</b> and image format, and with designated image-sensing times and image-sensing conditions designated by the respective reservation commands, as a plurality of reservations, into the reservation register <b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0168">At step S<b>507</b>, the control variable at each repeated image sensing is updated to the next stage.

<p id="p-0153" num="0169">As a result, the reservation table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> by interpreting the reservation command is produced. Note that as described above, although the respective image-sensing times are the same, it is impossible to perform image sensings at the same time. Actually, the image sensing is sequentially performed in the order of the numerals added to the common part of the acceptance code (“12543”).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0170">Thus, the above construction enables to easily perform interval image sensing while changing the camera angle by a short command.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0171">Further, the present embodiment uses only one definition of control variable, however, a plurality of definitions can be described as nested definition.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0172">In the fifth embodiment, repetitive construction is introduced; similarly, other constructions such condition-judgment, definition of variable, substitution of variable, operation using for arithmetic rules and the like, can be introduced.</p>

<p id="p-0178" num="0195">The basic construction of the sixth embodiment is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In comparison with the fifth embodiment, difference is that a command interpreter <b>6012</b> interprets the above reservation command and the camera control apparatus is connected to a secondary external device (a server in which the file including the command character string is stored) <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0196">Next, the operation of the command interpreter <b>6012</b> will be described with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0197">At step S<b>621</b>, if the head of the command is “%23”, it is recognized as an external reference command, then process proceeds to step S<b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0198">At step S<b>622</b>, a bracketed description “( )” is regarded as a URL designating the stored file in which the command is described, and a file transfer request is issued in accordance with the URL. In the above case, as the file “camcon-a.ctl” is stored at “www.bar.co.jp”, the file transfer request is sent to the secondary external device <b>1004</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0199">At step S<b>623</b>, a response is awaited. As a result, a long reservation command as above is returned. The returned reservation command is developed by interpreting the external reference command and replacing it in the developed command, for use in the subsequent command interpretation (step S<b>624</b>). Then the process proceeds to step S<b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0200">Note that at step S<b>621</b>, if the command is not an external reference command, the process also proceeds to step S<b>101</b>. The processing at step S<b>101</b> and the subsequent steps is identical to that described in the first embodiment, therefore, explanation of those steps will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0201">Further, the processing at steps S<b>621</b> to S<b>624</b> can be applied to the second to fifth embodiments as well as the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0202">The above construction enables to easily perform interval image sensing programmed with complicated changes of time and camera angle by a short command.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0203">Especially, in accordance with the sixth embodiment, in a case where a plurality of camera control apparatuses (i.e., a plurality of cameras) are provided on the Internet, an image in the same image-sensing status can be obtained by the respective camera control apparatuses by using a file describing a reservation command of programmed image sensing which is stored into only one server.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0204">For example, even when a plurality of camera control apparatuses are provided at various places in various countries, images can be obtained by their own respective image-sensing conditions, and further, an image can be obtained in accordance with image-sensing condition registered by a third person.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0205">In the sixth embodiment, the camera control apparatus and the external apparatus holding the camera control file are described as separate apparatus, however, they may be integrated as a single apparatus. In this case, the URL is described as follows:
<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0206">“http://www.foo.co.jp/%23(http%3A//www.foo.co.jp/camcon-a.ctl)”</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0209">If the command is stored in the external device to which an image transfer request is issued, the address of the device can be used. In such case, the secondary external device is unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0210">Further, although not especially described in the present embodiment, if a plurality of camera-control right requests (i.e., request for right to the change camera angle and the like and transfer the obtained video image) have been issued by a plurality of end users at the same time, the camera control right is given to one of them. It is arranged, for example, such that the user whose request has been first stored in the queue of requests can obtain the camera control right. Otherwise, it may be arranged such that a specific user or the like can obtain the camera control right prior to other users.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0211">However, the camera control right is not directly related with the present invention, therefore, further explanation of the camera control right will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0212">As described above, according to the first to sixth embodiments, it is possible to provide an end user with environment to easily remote-control a video camera via a general network such as the Internet.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Seventh Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0194" num="0213">In the above first to sixth embodiments, reserved image sensing cannot always be performed as programmed depending on the contents of programming such as designation of time, camera angle and the like. For example, in a case where image sensing is programmed in different directions with the same image-sensing time, as a plurality of reservations, all the reserved image sensing cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0214">Further, to display a desired video image, it is necessary for an end user to generate an HTML document including an acceptance code by using a CGI program or input an acceptance code corresponding to the desired video image. However, it is difficult to prepare the CGI program, further, the end user may often make mistakes in inputting the acceptance code, which degrades operability and utility of the camera control apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0215">Then, a seventh embodiment has an object to provide a camera control apparatus and method, which is used in a system where camera image-sensing condition and the like can be remote-controlled on a predetermined network, and which notifies overlap of image-sensing programming if occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0216">Further, the seventh embodiment has another object to provide a camera control apparatus and method which unnecessitates inputting an acceptance code and dynamically generating an HTML document by a CGI program, and which enables to easily display a desired video image.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram showing the construction of the camera control apparatus according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention. In comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, difference is that an acceptance-code save instructor <b>1101</b> and an overlapped-programming judgment unit <b>1102</b> are added to the construction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Further, the connection among the elements is different from that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The functions of the elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> except the acceptance-code save instructor <b>1101</b> and the overlapped-programming judgment unit <b>1102</b> are the same as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0218">Further, the basic operation of the present embodiment corresponds to that in the first to sixth embodiment. Hereinafter, the characteristic processing of the seventh embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0219"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart the control process procedure by the command interpreter <b>1012</b> according to the seventh embodiment as the characteristic processing.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0220">First, at step S<b>2101</b>, a command described as a file name is interpreted. If the head of the request is “P”, the command is recognized as an image-sensing command, then process proceeds to step S<b>2102</b>. At step S<b>2102</b>, the camera <b>1003</b> is controlled with the designated pan, tilt and zoom values by the camera controller <b>1017</b>. At step S<b>2103</b>, the obtained image is converted into data of the designated image format, and the image data is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data. The external device <b>1002</b> stores the image data, and transfers it to the request originator. At this time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0221">This enables to paste a video image obtained by programmed image sensing in an HTML document as if it is image data stored in a file in a WWW server.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0222">At step S<b>2101</b>, if the head of the request is “R”, the command is recognized as a reservation command designating image-sensing time, then the process proceeds to step S<b>2701</b> via interpretation at step S<b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0223">Similar to the first embodiment, a reservation command starts with alphabet “R”, then it continues with integers indicating year, month, day, hour and minute, each terminated with a period, then with image-sensing condition such as designation of panning, tilting and zooming, and ends with an extension indicating the image format. Note that if there is no image-sensing condition, the camera angle at the programmed image-sensing time is adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0224">For example, if image sensing is programmed with respect to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> having a network address “www.foo.co.jp”, with image-sensing time of 13:15 on Jul. 6, 1996, a pan angle of 25°, a tilt angle of 0°, and 3 times zooming, and “gif” format, the reservation command is described as follows:
<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0225">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/R1996.7.6.13.15P25T0Z3.gif”&gt;</li>

<p id="p-0206" num="0226">(1)</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Note that this URL may be directly designated by the user, otherwise may be combined by an HTML form or a CGI program.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0227">When the reservation command as above has been designated with respect to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>2701</b>, at which it is determined by the overlapped-reservation determination unit <b>1102</b> whether or not there is overlap in designated image-sensing time (in this case 13:15 on Jul. 6, 1996). If the image-sensing time is overlapped with image-sensing time of another reserved programming, the process proceeds to step S<b>2703</b>, at which information indicating that the reservation cannot be accepted is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the reservation.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0228">If there is no overlapped reservation and it is possible to reserve the programmed image sensing with the designated time, the process proceeds to step S<b>2105</b>, at which a unique identification number is received as an acceptance code, from the acceptance code generator <b>1013</b>. The unique identification number may be generated by using a counter incremented by one (+1) at each generation request, otherwise, by using numerical values indicating requested date and time.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0229">At step S<b>2106</b>, the acceptance code and information on the designated time, the image-sensing condition and the image format are registered in the storage device (not shown) of the reservation register <b>1014</b>. At step S<b>2702</b>, the acceptance code (code notifying that the reservation has been accepted), and an acceptance-code save instruction to be described later, are returned by the acceptance-code save instructor <b>1101</b>, via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the reservation.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0230">As a result of reservation processing as above, various types of information are stored in table format as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the storage device of the reservation register <b>1014</b>. Note that in the present embodiment, the storage device of the reservation register <b>1014</b> is used for storing the above information, however, the image memory <b>1019</b> of the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> may be used for this purpose, and further, the image memory <b>1019</b> may be any type of memory. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the table contains the contents of programmed image sensing in accordance with the description in the first embodiment. In this embodiment, the acceptance code is “817b7abda9304a1a15d4546ca779bc16”, for example. The registered contents include the image-sensing date and time, the acceptance code, the image-sensing condition and image format. At the above overlapped-reservation judgment, the overlapped-reservation determination unit <b>1102</b> compares “image-sensing time” registered in the reservation register <b>1014</b> with “image-sensing time” designated by the current reservation command, and determines whether or not they overlap with each other. Note that the present embodiment can set zooming, panning and tilting of the camera <b>1003</b> in one minute intervals, therefore overlapped reservation is examined in minute unit.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0231">After the above reservation processing, when the image-sensing time registered in the reservation register <b>1014</b> has come, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> controls the camera <b>1003</b> at the designated camera angle to perform the programmed image sensing, and stored the obtained image with an appropriate file name such as an acceptance code, in the designated image format, into the image memory <b>1019</b>. Thereafter, when an image read command is received from the external device <b>1002</b>, image data corresponding to the image read command is read from the image memory <b>1019</b>, and the image data is transferred to the external device <b>1002</b> (corresponding to the terminal of an end user) in the designated format.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0232">Note that the image read command starts with its path name “G”, then it continues with an acceptance code, and ends with an extension indicating the image format. Note that this acceptance code has been returned to the external device <b>1002</b> at step S<b>2702</b> upon reservation. For example, if “817b7abda93043a1a15d4546ca779bc16” is returned as an acceptance code, to read an image resulted from the programmed image sensing, the image read command is described as follows:
<ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0233">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/G/817b7abda93043a1a15d4546ca77 9bc16.gif”&gt;(2)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0234">Note that the character string indicating image formation (the image format “gif”) at the end of the image read command must be the same as that in the reservation. However, it may be arranged such that if they are different, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> converts the corresponding image data stored in the image memory <b>1019</b> with the reservation code into image data in the designated image format and transfers the converted image data.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0235">The image memory <b>1019</b> manages image data in the table format as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example. The table contains an acceptance code (which corresponds to a reservation command, similar to a file name), an image format, and actual image data. Note that the image memory <b>1019</b> may be any type of storage device so far as it has a sufficient capacity. Specifically, the image memory <b>1019</b> is a hard disk device, a magneto-optical disk device or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0236">Next, returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the command interpretation process procedure in a case where an image read command has been actually received will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0237">At step S<b>2101</b>, if the path name of the command is “G”, the process proceeds to step S<b>2104</b>. As it is determined that the command is not a reservation command (NO at step S<b>2104</b>), the process proceeds to step S<b>2108</b>. As it is determined that the command is an image read command, the process proceeds to step S<b>2109</b>, at which the image memory <b>1019</b> is searched for corresponding image data, based on an acceptance code included in the image read command (although described later, the acceptance code is added as a “Cookie” header).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0238">Then at step S<b>2110</b>, it is determined whether or not the image data obtained from the above search is stored with the same acceptance code as that described in the image read command. If YES, the image data is read, and transferred via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data. At this time, as the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data (at step S<b>2111</b>). At step S<b>2112</b>, data stored in the storage area in the image memory <b>1019</b>, from which the image data has been read out, is deleted. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0239">If it is determined at step S<b>2110</b> that image data corresponding to the designated acceptance code is not stored, as the corresponding image data has not been image-sensed, otherwise the image data has already been transferred and deleted, error information is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b> requesting the image data. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0240">If it is determined at step S<b>2108</b> that the request from the external device <b>1002</b> is not an image read command, error information indicating that the command is an undefined command is returned via the communication interface unit <b>1011</b> to the external device <b>1002</b>. Then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0241">As described above, information exchange between the external device <b>1002</b> and the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> according to the present embodiment is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0242">Note that as the timer <b>1015</b>, used for camera control, image sensing and storing the result of image sensing, based on reservation data registered in the reservation register <b>1014</b>, is the same as that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, explanation of the timer <b>1015</b> will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0243">In the present embodiment, the instruction to save an acceptance code by the acceptance-code save instructor <b>1101</b> is made in the format of “Cookie”. That is, in the HTTP response header, “Set-Cookie” header is used to instruct to save the acceptance code as follows:
<ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0244">Set-Cookie: ID=817b7abda93043a1a15d4546ca779bc16; path=/G/; domain=www.foo.co.jp (3)
<br/>
This means that the acceptance code (ID) is “817b7abda93043a1a15d4546ca779bc16” and when accessing “http://www.foo.co.jp” in the format “http://domain/path”, the above acceptance code is to be added.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0245">Next, a control process procedure of the external device <b>1002</b> will be described with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows processing when an acceptance code has been received, and processing when accessing is performed by designating a URL. The external device <b>1002</b>, which has received an acceptance-code save instruction, stores the acceptance code (ID), domain and path (steps S<b>2301</b> and S<b>2303</b>) in case of displaying a video image, to be obtained by programmed image sensing, by a WWW browser as a client.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0246">When the obtained video image is displayed by the external device <b>1002</b>, a request is sent to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> by using a URL as follows:
<ul id="ul0020" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0247">http://www.foo.co.jp/G (4)
<br/>
When the user of the WWW browser designates the URL by the description (4), it is determined whether or not there are corresponding domain and/or path among the stored domains and paths (step S<b>2305</b>). If no corresponding domain nor path has been found, an HTML page is requested by the designated domain and path.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0248">On the other hand, if there are domain and path corresponding to the designated URL, an acceptance code (ID) corresponding to the domain and path is obtained. Then, upon requesting an HTML page by the designated URL, “Cookie” header is included in the request header, and the acceptance code is sent in the following format:
<ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0249">Cookie: ID=817b7abda93043a1a15d4546ca779bc16 (5)
<br/>
This means that the acceptance code is 817b7abda93043a1a15d4546ca779bc16.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0250">The URL (=http://www.foo.co.jp/G/) used for requesting the video image is uniquely designated to each acceptance code. As the external device <b>1002</b> automatically sends an acceptance code, the user does not have to input the acceptance code, nor dynamically generate an HTML document corresponding to the acceptance code.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0251">In the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b>, that has receives the request in the above format, it is determined at step S<b>2108</b>, as described above, that the request is a video-image read request, then the process proceeds to step S<b>2109</b>. The acceptance code is read from the request header, and the process proceeds to step S<b>2110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the contents of communication between the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> and the external device <b>1002</b> according to the seventh embodiment. When the external device <b>1002</b> issues a reservation URL as above description (1) to reserve programmed image sensing, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> determines whether or not there is overlap in the reservation (step S<b>2701</b>). If there is no overlap, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> returns an acceptance code and an acceptance-code save instruction (in, e.g., “Cookie” format) to the external device <b>1002</b> (step S<b>2702</b>). If the external device <b>1002</b> issues a reservation command designating programmed image sensing having an overlap with another programmed image sensing, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> detects the overlap in the reservation, and returns error information (step S<b>2703</b>). The external device <b>1002</b> displays the error information on, e.g., a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0253">After the reservation has been registered, if the URL for image display is designated by the external device <b>1002</b> before the designated time, error information is returned (step S<b>2113</b>).

<p id="p-0230" num="0254">On the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> side, the timer <b>1015</b> detects the designated time. When the designated image-sensing time has come, the camera controller <b>1017</b> starts to control the camera <b>1003</b> (in the present embodiment, panning, tilting and zooming). When the camera control has been completed, the video-image input unit <b>1018</b> starts to input the obtained image, then the image memory <b>1019</b> stores the input image.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0255">At or after the designated time, when the URL for image display is designated by the external device <b>1002</b>, the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> pastes the image into a designated HTML page, and sends the HTML page to the external device <b>1002</b> (step S<b>2111</b>). The external device <b>1002</b> displays the image as reserved by displaying the HTML page. Note that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it may be arranged such that when image sensing at the designated time has failed, error information is returned with respect to the image read command.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0256">Note that a validity expiration time may be designated by designating “expires”. In this case, the obtained image is stored by the validity expiration time, and when the validity expires, the stored image is deleted. Further, if image sensing has failed for some reason, the reservation of the image sensing is held by the validity expiration time, and as response, the content of error can be informed in detail with respect to image read request.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0257">At steps S<b>2702</b> and S<b>2703</b>, the content of the response to the external device <b>1002</b> may be only status information indicative of the completion of acceptance, however, an HTML document explaining the user the situation may be included in the response. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref> and <b>18</b> show such HTML documents. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an HTTP response issued to the external device <b>1002</b> at step S<b>2702</b> when the reservation has been successful, and the display status of the external device <b>1002</b> in accordance with the response. As described above, the response header includes “Set-Cookie” header. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an HTTP response issued to the external device <b>1002</b> at step S<b>2703</b> when the reservation has failed, and the display status of the external device <b>1002</b> in accordance with the response. Thus, as the content of reservation can be confirmed, operability can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0258">As described above, according to the seventh embodiment, live image obtained by controlling a remote camera can easily be pasted in a WWW document, by connecting the camera control apparatus to a WWW system network, and describing a URL including image-sensing condition, as image data source, in the address of the camera control apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0259">Further, it is possible to reserve programmed image sensing with respect to the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b>, read the result of the image sensing into a WWW page, and display the WWW page later. Especially, when the network is overcrowded, image data cannot be smoothly obtained by controlling a remote camera since image transfer takes much time, however, according to the present embodiment, programmed image sensing at a specific camera angle for a necessary time, in such time when the network is overcrowded, is reserved in advance, and when the network becomes less crowded, e.g., at midnight.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0260">Especially, it is greatly advantageous that a plurality of images can be image-sensed at short intervals with the same camera angle, regardless of the transmission capacity of the network.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0261">In the present embodiment, the interface between the camera control apparatus <b>1001</b> and the external device <b>1002</b> has been described as the HTTP protocol, however, any communication interface can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0262">Further, it may be arranged such that upon notifying an acceptance code to the reservation originator, a password is issued, and when image data obtained by programmed image sensing as reserved is read, the image data can be transferred with the password besides the reservation/acceptance code. This avoids at least the inconvenience that desired image data has been deleted since a third person issued a transfer request with the same acceptance code.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0263">Further, image-sensing time is designated in minute unit, however, it may be designated in second or millisecond unit. In this case, if image sensing cannot be performed at intervals of the maximum period or longer necessary for camera-angle control and image sensing, it is determined that image-sensing time is overlapped.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0264">In the present embodiment, to indicate the image format, the extension “gif” is employed; it may be arranged such that the image format indicated by the extension “gif” is arbitrarily changed to the JPEG format indicated by an extension “jpg”.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0265">Further, the file name is regarded as a command, however, a parameter description of a URL can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0266">For example, panning, tilting, zooming and image format are respectively set to “25°”, “5°”, “twice” and “gif”, image sensing can be programmed by the following description:
<ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0267">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/cameraimage?P=20,T=5,Z=2,F=gif ”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0268">Further, a WWW server may be installed into the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment. In this case, for example, a name “camctl.exe” is given to the program of the command interpreter <b>1012</b> as a CGI program for the WWW server, and the image sensing can be programmed by the following description:
<ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0269">&lt;img src=“http://www.foo.co.jp/cgibin/camctl.exe?P=20,T=5,Z=2,F=gif”&gt;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0270">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, once the image data obtained by programmed image sensing has been transferred, the image data (file) is deleted, however, the image data is not necessarily deleted at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0271">That is, it may be arranged such that the image data, obtained by reserved image sensing and stored as a file, is held for an appropriate period, and when the period has elapsed, the image data is deleted even if the image data has not been transferred. This allows a plurality of end users to obtain the same image.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0272">Further, it may be arranged such that a password is issued to the end user according to circumstances, and the image data is transferred only when the password coincides with that of the image data.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Eighth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0247" num="0273">In the seventh embodiment, the “Cookie” function is used for acceptance-code save instruction, however, this instruction is not limited to the above function. For example, a “Plug-in” for accepting an acceptance-code save instruction may be provided on the browser side. In this case, a URL including an acceptance code is saved in a bookmark, so that the browser (external device <b>1002</b>) can send a request to display a video image by selecting the URL from the bookmark even if it has no function to automatically transmit an acceptance code.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0274">As described above, according to the seventh and eighth embodiments, in a system for image-sensing a video image by controlling a camera via a network, overlap in reservation of programmed camera control and image sensing condition can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0275">Further, according to the above embodiments, upon displaying a video image obtained by programmed image sensing, it is unnecessary to input the acceptance code that has been notified when the programmed image sensing was reserved. Further, on the server side, it is unnecessary to dynamically generate an HTML document by a CGI program or the like. For this reason, the operability on the user side can be improved, and the construction on the server side can be simplified, which enables to easily display a video image obtained from programmed image sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0276">Note that the present invention can be applied to a system constituted by a plurality of devices or to an apparatus comprising a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0277">Further, the object of the present invention can be also achieved by providing a storage medium storing program codes for performing functions of the aforesaid first to eighth embodiments to a system or an apparatus, reading the program codes with a computer (e.g., CPU, MPU) of the system or apparatus from the storage medium, then executing the program.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0278">In this case, the program codes read from the storage medium realize the functions according to the embodiments, and the storage medium storing the program codes constitutes the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0279">Further, the storage medium, such as a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, CD-ROM, CD-R, a magnetic tape, a non-volatile type memory card, and ROM can be used for providing the program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0280">Furthermore, besides aforesaid functions according to the above embodiments are realized by executing the program codes which are read by a computer, the present invention includes a case where an OS (operating system) or the like working on the computer performs a part or entire processes in accordance with designations of the program codes and realizes functions according to the above embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0281">Furthermore, the present invention also includes a case where, after the program codes read from the storage medium are written in a function expansion card which is inserted into the computer or in a memory provided in a function expansion unit which is connected to the computer, CPU or the like contained in the function expansion card or unit performs a part or entire process in accordance with designations of the program codes and realizes functions of the above embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0282">As described above, according to the seventh and eighth embodiments, when overlap occurs in image-sensing reservation, it is possible to notify of the overlap, thus improves operability of reservation of programmed image sensing by a remote-controllable camera.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0283">Further, according to the seventh and eighth embodiments, upon displaying a video image obtained by programmed image sensing, as it is unnecessary to input an acceptance code or dynamically generate an HTML document by a CGI program, the desired video image can be easily displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0284">As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.</p>
