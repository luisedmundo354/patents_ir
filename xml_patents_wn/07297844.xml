<description id="description">
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a new and distinctive soybean cultivar, designated 3235020. All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single variety an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, and better agronomic quality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Choice of breeding or selection methods depends on the mode of plant reproduction, the heritability of the trait(s) being improved, and the type of cultivar used commercially (e.g., F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid cultivar, pureline cultivar, etc.). For highly heritable traits, a choice of superior individual plants evaluated at a single location will be effective, whereas for traits with low heritability, selection should be based on mean values obtained from replicated evaluations of families of related plants. Popular selection methods commonly include pedigree selection, modified pedigree selection, mass selection, and recurrent selection.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The complexity of inheritance influences choice of the breeding method. Backcross breeding is used to transfer one or a few favorable genes for a highly heritable trait into a desirable cultivar. This approach has been used extensively for breeding disease-resistant cultivars. Various recurrent selection techniques are used to improve quantitatively inherited traits controlled by numerous genes. The use of recurrent selection in self-pollinating crops depends on the ease of pollination, the frequency of successful hybrids from each pollination and the number of hybrid offspring from each successful cross.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each breeding program should include a periodic, objective evaluation of the efficiency of the breeding procedure. Evaluation criteria vary depending on the goal and objectives, but should include gain from selection per year based on comparisons to an appropriate standard, overall value of the advanced breeding lines, and number of successful cultivars produced per unit of input (e.g., per year, per dollar expended, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Promising advanced breeding lines are thoroughly tested and compared to appropriate standards in environments representative of the commercial target area(s) for three or more years. The best lines are candidates for new commercial cultivars; those still deficient in a few traits may be used as parents to produce new populations for further selection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, usually take from eight to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new cultivars is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A most difficult task is the identification of individuals that are genetically superior, because for most traits the true genotypic value is masked by other confounding plant traits or environmental factors. One method of identifying a superior plant is to observe its performance relative to other experimental plants and to a widely grown standard cultivar. If a single observation is inconclusive, replicated observations provide a better estimate of its genetic worth.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The goal of soybean plant breeding is to develop new, unique and superior soybean cultivars and hybrids. The breeder initially selects and crosses two or more parental lines, followed by repeated selfing and selection, producing many new genetic combinations. The breeder can theoretically generate billions of different genetic combinations via crossing, selfing and mutations. The breeder has no direct control at the cellular level. Therefore, two breeders will never develop the same line, or even very similar lines, having the same soybean traits.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Each year, the plant breeder selects the germplasm to advance to the next generation. This germplasm is grown under unique and different geographical, climatic and soil conditions and further selections are then made during and at the end of the growing season. The cultivars that are developed are unpredictable because the breeder's selection occurs in unique environments with no control at the DNA level (using conventional breeding procedures), and with millions of different possible genetic combinations being generated. A breeder of ordinary skill in the art cannot predict the final resulting lines he develops, except possibly in a very gross and general fashion. The same breeder cannot produce the same cultivar twice by using the same original parents and the same selection techniques. This unpredictability results in the expenditure of large amounts of research monies to develop superior new soybean cultivars.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The development of new soybean cultivars requires the development and selection of soybean varieties, the crossing of these varieties and selection of superior hybrid crosses. The hybrid seed is produced by manual crosses between selected male-fertile parents or by using male sterility systems. These hybrids are selected for certain single gene traits such as pod color, flower color, pubescence color or herbicide resistance which indicate that the seed is truly a hybrid. Additional data on parental lines, as well as the phenotype of the hybrid, influence the breeder's decision whether to continue with the specific hybrid cross.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods are used to develop cultivars from breeding populations. Breeding programs combine desirable traits from two or more cultivars or various broad-based sources into breeding pools from which cultivars are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. The new cultivars are evaluated to determine which have commercial potential.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Pedigree breeding is used commonly for the improvement of self-pollinating crops. Two parents that possess favorable, complementary traits are crossed to produce an F<sub>1</sub>. An F<sub>2 </sub>population is produced by selfing one or several F<sub>1</sub>s. Selection of the best individuals may begin in the F<sub>2 </sub>population; then, beginning in the F<sub>3</sub>, the best individuals in the best families are selected. Replicated testing of families can begin in the F<sub>4 </sub>generation to improve the effectiveness of selection for traits with low heritability. At an advanced stage of inbreeding (i.e., F<sub>6 </sub>and F<sub>7</sub>), the best lines or mixtures of phenotypically similar lines are tested for potential release as new cultivars.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Mass and recurrent selections can be used to improve populations of either self- or cross-pollinating crops. A genetically variable population of heterozygous individuals is either identified, or created, by intercrossing several different parents. The best plants are selected based on individual superiority, outstanding progeny, or excellent combining ability. The selected plants are intercrossed to produce a new population in which further cycles of selection are continued.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Backcross breeding has been used to transfer genes for a simply inherited, highly heritable trait into a desirable homozygous cultivar or inbred line which is the recurrent parent. The source of the trait to be transferred is called the donor parent. After the initial cross, individuals possessing the phenotype of the donor parent are selected and repeatedly crossed (backcrossed) to the recurrent parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., cultivar) and the desirable trait transferred from the donor parent.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The single-seed descent procedure in the strict sense refers to planting a segregating population, harvesting a sample of one seed per plant, and using the one-seed sample to plant the next generation. When the population has been advanced from the F<sub>2 </sub>to the desired level of inbreeding, the plants from which lines are derived will each trace to different F<sub>2 </sub>individuals. The number of plants in a population declines each generation due to failure of some seeds to germinate or some plants to produce at least one seed. As a result, not all of the F<sub>2 </sub>plants originally sampled in the population will be represented by a progeny when generation advance is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a multiple-seed procedure, soybean breeders commonly harvest one or more pods from each plant in a population and thresh them together to form a bulk. Part of the bulk is used to plant the next generation and part is put in reserve. The procedure has been referred to as modified single-seed descent or the pod-bulk technique.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The multiple-seed procedure has been used to save labor at harvest. It is considerably faster to thresh pods with a machine than to remove one seed from each by hand for the single-seed procedure. The multiple-seed procedure also makes it possible to plant the same number of seeds of a population each generation of inbreeding. Enough seeds are harvested to make up for those plants that did not germinate or produce seed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to phenotypic observations, the genotype of a plant can also be examined. There are many laboratory-based techniques available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant genotype; among these are Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs—which are also referred to as Microsatellites), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Isozyme Electrophoresis and RFLPs have been widely used to determine genetic composition. Shoemaker and Olsen, (Molecular Linkage Map of Soybean (<i>Glycine max </i>L. Merr.) p 6.131-6.138 in S. J. O'Brien (ed) <i>Genetic Maps: Locus Maps of Complex Genomes</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1993)) developed a molecular genetic linkage map that consisted of 25 linkage groups with about 365 RFLP, 11 RAPD, three classical markers and four isozyme loci. See also, Shoemaker, R. C., RFLP Map of Soybean, p 299-309, in Phillips, R. L. and Vasil, I. K., eds. <i>DNA</i>-<i>Based Markers in Plants</i>, Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, the Netherlands (1994).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">SSR technology is currently the most efficient and practical marker technology; more marker loci can be routinely used and more alleles per marker locus can be found using SSRs in comparison to RFLPs. For example, Diwan and Cregan described a highly polymorphic microsatellite locus in soybean with as many as 26 alleles. (Diwan, N. and Cregan, P. B., <i>Theor. Appl. Genet. </i>95:22-225, 1997.) SNPs may also be used to identify the unique genetic composition of the invention and progeny varieties retaining that unique genetic composition. Various molecular marker techniques may be used in combination to enhance overall resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Molecular markers, which includes markers identified through the use of techniques such as Isozyme Electrophoresis, RFLPs, RAPDs, AP-PCR, DAF, SCARs, AFLPs, SSRs, and SNPs, may be used in plant breeding. One use of molecular markers is Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping. QTL mapping is the use of markers which are known to be closely linked to alleles that have measurable effects on a quantitative trait. Selection in the breeding process is based upon the accumulation of markers linked to the positive effecting alleles and/or the elimination of the markers linked to the negative effecting alleles from the plant's genome.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers closely linked to alleles or markers containing sequences within the actual alleles of interest can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. For example, molecular markers are used in soybean breeding for selection of the trait of resistance to soybean cyst nematode, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,967. The markers can also be used to select toward the genome of the recurrent parent and against the markers of the donor parent. This procedure attempts to minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. It can also be used to reduce the number of crosses back to the recurrent parent needed in a backcrossing program. The use of molecular markers in the selection process is often called genetic marker enhanced selection or marker-assisted selection. Molecular markers may also be used to identify and exclude certain sources of germplasm as parental varieties or ancestors of a plant by providing a means of tracking genetic profiles through crosses.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Mutation breeding is another method of introducing new traits into soybean varieties. Mutations that occur spontaneously or are artificially induced can be useful sources of variability for a plant breeder. The goal of artificial mutagenesis is to increase the rate of mutation for a desired characteristic. Mutation rates can be increased by many different means including temperature, long-term seed storage, tissue culture conditions, radiation (such as X-rays, Gamma rays, neutrons, Beta radiation, or ultraviolet radiation), chemical mutagens (such as base analogues like 5-bromo-uracil), antibiotics, alkylating agents (such as sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, epoxides, ethyleneamines, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfones, or lactones), azide, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid or acridines. Once a desired trait is observed through mutagenesis the trait may then be incorporated into existing germplasm by traditional breeding techniques. Details of mutation breeding can be found in <i>Principles of Cultivar Development </i>by Fehr, Macmillan Publishing Company, 1993.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The production of double haploids can also be used for the development of homozygous varieties in a breeding program. Double haploids are produced by the doubling of a set of chromosomes from a heterozygous plant to produce a completely homozygous individual. For example, see Wan et al., <i>Theor. Appl. Genet., </i>77:889-892, 1989.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Descriptions of other breeding methods that are commonly used for different traits and crops can be found in one of several reference books (e.g., Allard, 1960; Simmonds, 1979; Sneep et al., 1979; Fehr, 1987).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Proper testing should detect any major faults and establish the level of superiority or improvement over current cultivars. In addition to showing superior performance, there must be a demand for a new cultivar that is compatible with industry standards or which creates a new market. The introduction of a new cultivar will incur additional costs to the seed producer, the grower, processor and consumer for special advertising and marketing, altered seed and commercial production practices, and new product utilization. The testing preceding release of a new cultivar should take into consideration research and development costs as well as technical superiority of the final cultivar. For seed-propagated cultivars, it must be feasible to produce seed easily and economically.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Soybean, <i>Glycine max </i>(L), is an important and valuable field crop. Thus, a continuing goal of soybean plant breeders is to develop stable, high yielding soybean cultivars that are agronomically sound. The reasons for this goal are obviously to maximize the amount of grain produced on the land used and to supply food for both animals and humans. To accomplish this goal, the soybean breeder must select and develop soybean plants that have traits that result in superior cultivars.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification.</p>

This invention thus relates to the seeds of soybean cultivar 3235020, to the plants of soybean cultivar 3235020 and to methods for producing a soybean plant produced by crossing the soybean cultivar 3235020 with itself or another soybean cultivar, and the creation of variants by mutagenesis or transformation of soybean cultivar 3235020.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, any such methods using the soybean cultivar 3235020 are part of this invention: selfing, backcrosses, hybrid production, crosses to populations, and the like. All plants produced using soybean cultivar 3235020 as at least one parent are within the scope of this invention. Advantageously, the soybean cultivar could be used in crosses with other, different, soybean plants to produce first generation (F<sub>1</sub>) soybean hybrid seeds and plants with superior characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another aspect, the present invention provides for single or multiple gene converted plants of soybean cultivar 3235020. The transferred gene(s) may preferably be a dominant or recessive allele. Preferably, the transferred gene(s) will confer such traits as herbicide resistance, insect resistance, resistance for bacterial, fungal, or viral disease, male fertility, male sterility, enhanced nutritional quality, and industrial usage. The gene may be a naturally occurring soybean gene or a transgene introduced through genetic engineering techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another aspect, the present invention provides regenerable cells for use in tissue culture of soybean plant 3235020. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the foregoing soybean plant, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as the foregoing soybean plant.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to the exemplary aspects and embodiments described above, further aspects and embodiments will become apparent by study of the following descriptions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the description and tables that follow, a number of terms are used. In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Allele. Allele is any of one or more alternative forms of a gene, all of which relate to one trait or characteristic. In a diploid cell or organism, the two alleles of a given gene occupy corresponding loci on a pair of homologous chromosomes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Backcrossing. Backcrossing is a process in which a breeder repeatedly crosses hybrid progeny back to one of the parents, for example, a first generation hybrid F<sub>1 </sub>with one of the parental genotypes of the F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Brown Stem Rot. This is a visual disease score from 1 to 9 comparing all genotypes in a given test. The score is based on leaf symptoms of yellowing and necrosis caused by brown stem rot. Visual scores range from a score of 9, which indicates no symptoms, to a score of 1 which indicates severe symptoms of leaf yellowing and necrosis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Cotyledon. A cotyledon is a type of seed leaf. The cotyledon contains the food storage tissues of the seed.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hypocotyl. A hypocotyl is the portion of an embryo or seedling between the cotyledons and the root. Therefore, it can be considered a transition zone between shoot and root.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Iron-Deficiency Chlorosis. Plants are scored 1 to 9 based on visual observations. A score of 9 means no stunting of the plants or yellowing of the leaves and a score of 1 indicates the plants are dead or dying caused by iron-deficiency chlorosis, a score of 5 means plants have intermediate health with some leaf yellowing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Lodging Resistance. Lodging is rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 1 indicates erect plants. A score of 5 indicates plants are lying on the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Maturity Date. Plants are considered mature when 95% of the pods have reached their mature color. The number of days is calculated either from August 31 or from the planting date.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Maturity Group. This refers to an agreed-on industry division of groups of varieties based on zones in which they are adapted, primarily according to day length or latitude. They consist of very long day length varieties (Groups 000, 00, 0), and extend to very short day length varieties (Groups VII, VIII, IX, X).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Relative Maturity (RM). The term relative maturity is a numerical value that is assigned to a soybean variety based on comparisons with the maturity values of other varieties. The number preceding the decimal point in the RM refers to the maturity group. The number following the decimal point refers to the relative earliness or lateness within each maturity group. For example, a 3.0 is an early group III variety, while a 3.9 is a late group III variety.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Oil or Oil Percent. Soybean seeds contain a considerable amount of oil. Oil is measured by NIR spectrophotometry, and is reported on an as is percentage basis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Oleic Acid Percent. Oleic acid is one of the five most abundant fatty acids in soybean seeds. It is measured by gas chromatography and is reported as a percent of the total oil content.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Palmitic Acid Percent. Palmitic acid is one of the five most abundant fatty acids in soybean seeds. It is measured by gas chromatography and is reported as a percent of the total oil content.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><i>Phytophthora </i>Tolerance. Tolerance to <i>Phytophthora </i>root rot is rated on a scale of 1 to 9, with a score of 9 being the best or highest tolerance ranging down to a score of 1 which indicates the plants have no tolerance to <i>Phytophthora. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Phenotypic Score. The Phenotypic Score is a visual rating of general appearance of the variety. All visual traits are considered in the score including healthiness, standability, appearance and freedom of disease. Ratings are scored from 1 being poor to 9 being excellent.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Plant Height. Plant height is taken from the top of soil to the top node of the plant and is measured in inches.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Pod. This refers to the fruit of a soybean plant. It consists of the hull or shell (pericarp) and the soybean seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Protein Percent. Soybean seeds contain a considerable amount of protein. Protein is generally measured by NIR spectrophotometry, and is reported on an as is percentage basis.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Pubescence. This refers to a covering of very fine hairs closely arranged on the leaves, stems and pods of the soybean plant.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) refer to genetic loci that control to some degree numerically representable traits that are usually continuously distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Regeneration. Regeneration refers to the development of a plant from tissue culture.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Seed Protein Peroxidase Activity. Seed protein peroxidase activity is defined as a chemical taxonomic technique to separate cultivars based on the presence or absence of the peroxidase enzyme in the seed coat. There are two types of soybean cultivars, those having high peroxidase activity (dark red color) and those having low peroxidase activity (no color).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Seed Yield (Bushels/Acre). The yield in bushels/acre is the actual yield of the grain at harvest.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Seeds per Pound. Soybean seeds vary in seed size, therefore, the number of seeds required to make up one pound also varies. This affects the pounds of seed required to plant a given area, and can also impact end uses.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Shattering. The amount of pod dehiscence prior to harvest. Pod dehiscence involves seeds falling from the pods to the soil. This is a visual score from 1 to 9 comparing all genotypes within a given test. A score of 9 means pods have not opened and no seeds have fallen out. A score of 5 indicates approximately 50% of the pods have opened, with seeds falling to the ground and a score of 1 indicates 100% of the pods are opened.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Single Gene Converted (Conversion). Single gene converted (conversion) plant refers to plants which are developed by a plant breeding technique called backcrossing wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of a variety are recovered in addition to the single gene transferred into the variety via the backcrossing technique or via genetic engineering.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Yield. Yield is measured in bushels of seed per acre.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">This invention is also directed to methods for producing a soybean plant by crossing a first parent soybean plant with a second parent soybean plant, wherein the first or second soybean plant is the soybean plant from cultivar 3235020. Further, both first and second parent soybean plants may be from cultivar 3235020. Therefore, any methods using soybean cultivar 3235020 are part of this invention: selfing, backcrosses, hybrid breeding, and crosses to populations. Any plants produced using soybean cultivar 3235020 as at least one parent are within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additional methods include, but are not limited to, expression vectors introduced into plant tissues using a direct gene transfer method such as microprojectile-mediated delivery, DNA injection, electroporation and the like. More preferably, expression vectors are introduced into plant tissues by using either microprojectile-mediated delivery with a biolistic device or by using <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Transformant plants obtained with the protoplasm of the invention are intended to be within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Soybean cultivar 3235020 is similar to soybean cultivar DP 5110S. While similar to soybean cultivar DP 5110 S, there are significant differences including soybean cultivar 3235020 is tolerant to glyphosate herbicide, while soybean cultivar DP 5110 S is not. Additionally, soybean cultivar 3235020 matures six days later than soybean cultivar DP 5110S.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">FURTHER EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With the advent of molecular biological techniques that have allowed the isolation and characterization of genes that encode specific protein products, scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genes, or additional, or modified versions of native, or endogenous, genes (perhaps driven by different promoters) in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner. Such foreign additional and/or modified genes are referred to herein collectively as “transgenes”. Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed and the present invention, in particular embodiments, also relates to transformed versions of the claimed variety or line.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Plant transformation involves the construction of an expression vector which will function in plant cells. Such a vector comprises DNA comprising a gene under control of, or operatively linked to, a regulatory element (for example, a promoter). The expression vector may contain one or more such operably linked gene/regulatory element combinations. The vector(s) may be in the form of a plasmid and can be used alone or in combination with other plasmids to provide transformed soybean plants using transformation methods as described below to incorporate transgenes into the genetic material of the soybean plant(s).</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Expression Vectors for Soybean Transformation: Marker Genes</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Expression vectors include at least one genetic marker operably linked to a regulatory element (a promoter, for example) that allows transformed cells containing the marker to be either recovered by negative selection, i.e., inhibiting growth of cells that do not contain the selectable marker gene, or by positive selection, i.e., screening for the product encoded by the genetic marker. Many commonly used selectable marker genes for plant transformation are well known in the transformation arts, and include, for example, genes that code for enzymes that metabolically detoxify a selective chemical agent which may be an antibiotic or an herbicide, or genes that encode an altered target which is insensitive to the inhibitor. A few positive selection methods are also known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">One commonly used selectable marker gene for plant transformation is the neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) gene which, when under the control of plant regulatory signals, confers resistance to kanamycin. Fraley et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>80:4803 (1983). Another commonly used selectable marker gene is the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin. Vanden Elzen et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol., </i>5:299 (1985).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Additional selectable marker genes of bacterial origin that confer resistance to antibiotics include gentamycin acetyl transferase, streptomycin phosphotransferase and aminoglycoside-3′-adenyl transferase, the bleomycin resistance determinant (Hayford et al., <i>Plant Physiol. </i>86:1216 (1988), Jones et al., <i>Mol. Gen. Genet., </i>210:86 (1987), Svab et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 14:197 (1990), Hille et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>7:171 (1986)). Other selectable marker genes confer resistance to herbicides such as glyphosate, glufosinate or bromoxynil (Comai et al., <i>Nature </i>317:741-744 (1985), Gordon-Kamm et al., <i>Plant Cell </i>2:603-618 (1990) and Stalker et al., <i>Science </i>242:419-423 (1988)).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Selectable marker genes for plant transformation not of bacterial origin include, for example, mouse dihydrofolate reductase, plant 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase and plant acetolactate synthase (Eichholtz et al., <i>Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. </i>13:67 (1987), Shah et al., <i>Science </i>233:478 (1986), Charest et al., <i>Plant Cell Rep. </i>8:643 (1990)).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Another class of marker genes for plant transformation requires screening of presumptively transformed plant cells rather than direct genetic selection of transformed cells for resistance to a toxic substance such as an antibiotic. These genes are particularly useful to quantify or visualize the spatial pattern of expression of a gene in specific tissues and are frequently referred to as reporter genes because they can be fused to a gene or gene regulatory sequence for the investigation of gene expression. Commonly used genes for screening presumptively transformed cells include β-glucuronidase (GUS), β-galactosidase, luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Jefferson, R. A., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. </i>5:387 (1987), Teeri et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>8:343 (1989), Koncz et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>84:131 (1987), DeBlock et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>3:1681 (1984)).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In vivo methods for visualizing GUS activity that do not require destruction of plant tissue are available (Molecular Probes publication 2908, IMAGENE GREEN, p. 1-4 (1993) and Naleway et al., <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>115:151a (1991)). However, these in vivo methods for visualizing GUS activity have not proven useful for recovery of transformed cells because of low sensitivity, high fluorescent backgrounds and limitations associated with the use of luciferase genes as selectable markers.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">More recently, a gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) has been utilized as a marker for gene expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (Chalfie et al., <i>Science </i>263:802 (1994)). GFP and mutants of GFP may be used as screenable markers.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Expression Vectors for Soybean Transformation: Promoters</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Genes included in expression vectors must be driven by a nucleotide sequence comprising a regulatory element, for example, a promoter. Several types of promoters are well known in the transformation arts as are other regulatory elements that can be used alone or in combination with promoters.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, “promoter” includes reference to a region of DNA upstream from the start of transcription and involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate transcription. A “plant promoter” is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells. Examples of promoters under developmental control include promoters that preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as leaves, roots, seeds, fibers, xylem vessels, tracheids, or sclerenchyma. Such promoters are referred to as “tissue-preferred”. Promoters that initiate transcription only in a certain tissue are referred to as “tissue-specific”. A “cell-type” specific promoter primarily drives expression in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, vascular cells in roots or leaves. An “inducible” promoter is a promoter which is under environmental control. Examples of environmental conditions that may effect transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions or the presence of light. Tissue-specific, tissue-preferred, cell type specific, and inducible promoters constitute the class of “non-constitutive” promoters. A “constitutive” promoter is a promoter that is active under most environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A. Inducible Promoters—An inducible promoter is operably linked to a gene for expression in soybean. Optionally, the inducible promoter is operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence which is operably linked to a gene for expression in soybean. With an inducible promoter the rate of transcription increases in response to an inducing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Any inducible promoter can be used in the instant invention. See Ward et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>22:361-366 (1993). Exemplary inducible promoters include, but are not limited to, that from the ACEI system which responds to copper (Mett et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:4567-4571 (1993)); In2 gene from maize which responds to benzenesulfonamide herbicide safeners (Hershey et al., <i>Mol. Gen. Genetics </i>227:229-237 (1991) and Gatz et al., <i>Mol. Gen. Genetics </i>243:32-38 (1994)) or Tet repressor from Tn10 (Gatz et al., <i>Mol. Gen. Genetics </i>227:229-237 (1991)). A particularly preferred inducible promoter is a promoter that responds to an inducing agent to which plants do not normally respond. An exemplary inducible promoter is the inducible promoter from a steroid hormone gene, the transcriptional activity of which is induced by a glucocorticosteroid hormone (Schena et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:0421 (1991)).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">B. Constitutive Promoters—A constitutive promoter is operably linked to a gene for expression in soybean or the constitutive promoter is operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence which is operably linked to a gene for expression in soybean.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Many different constitutive promoters can be utilized in the instant invention. Exemplary constitutive promoters include, but are not limited to, the promoters from plant viruses such as the 35S promoter from CaMV (Odell et al., <i>Nature </i>313:810-812 (1985)) and the promoters from such genes as rice actin (McElroy et al., <i>Plant Cell </i>2: 163-171 (1990)); ubiquitin (Christensen et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>12:619-632 (1989) and Christensen et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>18:675-689 (1992)); pEMU (Last et al., <i>Theor. Appl. Genet. </i>81:581-588 (1991)); MAS (Velten et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>3:2723-2730 (1984)) and maize H3 histone (Lepetit et al., <i>Mol. Gen. Genetics </i>231:276-285 (1992) and Atanassova et al., <i>Plant Journal </i>2 (3): 291-300 (1992)). The ALS promoter, Xba1/Ncol fragment 5′ to the <i>Brassica napus </i>ALS3 structural gene (or a nucleotide sequence similarity to said Xba1/Ncol fragment), represents a particularly useful constitutive promoter. See PCT application WO 96/30530.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">C. Tissue-specific or Tissue-preferred Promoters—A tissue-specific promoter is operably linked to a gene for expression in soybean. Optionally, the tissue-specific promoter is operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence which is operably linked to a gene for expression in soybean. Plants transformed with a gene of interest operably linked to a tissue-specific promoter produce the protein product of the transgene exclusively, or preferentially, in a specific tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Any tissue-specific or tissue-preferred promoter can be utilized in the instant invention. Exemplary tissue-specific or tissue-preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, a root-preferred promoter such as that from the phaseolin gene (Murai et al., <i>Science </i>23:476-482 (1983) and Sengupta-Gopalan et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:3320-3324 (1985)); a leaf-specific and light-induced promoter such as that from cab or rubisco (Simpson et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>4(11):2723-2729 (1985) and Timko et al., <i>Nature </i>318:579-582 (1985)); an anther-specific promoter such as that from LAT52 (Twell et al., <i>Mol.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Signal Sequences for Targeting Proteins to Subcellular Compartments</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Transport of protein produced by transgenes to a subcellular compartment such as the chloroplast, vacuole, peroxisome, glyoxysome, cell wall or mitochondrion or for secretion into the apoplast, is accomplished by means of operably linking the nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence to the 5′ and/or 3′ region of a gene encoding the protein of interest. Targeting sequences at the 5′ and/or 3′ end of the structural gene may determine during protein synthesis and processing where the encoded protein is ultimately compartmentalized.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The presence of a signal sequence directs a polypeptide to either an intracellular organelle or subcellular compartment or for secretion to the apoplast. Many signal sequences are known in the art. See, for example, Becker et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>20:49 (1992); Close, P. S., Master's Thesis, Iowa State University (1993); Knox, C., et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>9:3-17 (1987); Lerner et al., <i>Plant Physiol. </i>91:124-129 (1989); Frontes et al., <i>Plant Cell </i>3:483-496 (1991); Matsuoka et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Foreign Protein Genes and Agronomic Genes</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">With transgenic plants according to the present invention, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities. Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants which are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass. Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr, <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>114:92-6 (1981).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to a preferred embodiment, the transgenic plant provided for commercial production of foreign protein is a soybean plant. In another preferred embodiment, the biomass of interest is seed. For the relatively small number of transgenic plants that show higher levels of expression, a genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional RFLP, PCR and SSR analysis, which identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule. For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson, <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, CRC Press, Boca Raton 269:284 (1993). Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants, to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Likewise, by means of the present invention, agronomic genes can be expressed in transformed plants. More particularly, plants can be genetically engineered to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants” in <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc. Boca Raton, 1993) pages 67-88. In addition, expression vectors and in-vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Gruber et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation” in <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 89-119.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A. <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated Transformation—One method for introducing an expression vector into plants is based on the natural transformation system of <i>Agrobacterium</i>. See, for example, Horsch et al., <i>Science </i>227:1229 (1985). <i>A. tumefaciens </i>and <i>A. rhizogenes </i>are plant pathogenic soil bacteria which genetically transform plant cells. The Ti and Ri plasmids of <i>A. tumefaciens </i>and <i>A. rhizogenes</i>, respectively, carry genes responsible for genetic transformation of the plant. See, for example, Kado, C. I., <i>Crit Rev. Plant Sci. </i>10:1 (1991). Descriptions of <i>Agrobacterium </i>vector systems and methods for <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated gene transfer are provided by Gruber et al., supra, Miki et al., supra and Moloney et al., <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>8:238 (1989). See also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,055 (Townsend and Thomas), issued Oct. 8, 1996.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">B. Direct Gene Transfer—Several methods of plant transformation collectively referred to as direct gene transfer have been developed as an alternative to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A generally applicable method of plant transformation is microprojectile-mediated transformation where DNA is carried on the surface of microprojectiles measuring 1 to 4 μm. The expression vector is introduced into plant tissues with a biolistic device that accelerates the microprojectiles to speeds of 300 to 600 m/s which is sufficient to penetrate plant cell walls and membranes. Sanford et al., <i>Part. Sci. Technol. </i>5:27 (1987); Sanford, J. C., <i>Trends Biotech. </i>6:299 (1988); Klein et al., <i>Bio/Tech. </i>6:559-563 (1988); Sanford, J. C. <i>Physiol Plant </i>7:206 (1990); Klein et al., <i>Biotechnology </i>10:268 (1992). See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,580 (Christou, et al.), issued May 14, 1991 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,783 (Tomes, et al.), issued Jun. 21, 1994.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Another method for physical delivery of DNA to plants is sonication of target cells. Zhang et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>9:996 (1991). Alternatively, liposome and spheroplast fusion have been used to introduce expression vectors into plants. Deshayes et al., <i>EMBO J., </i>4:2731 (1985); Christou et al., <i>Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>84:3962 (1987). Direct uptake of DNA into protoplasts using CaCl<sub>2 </sub>precipitation, polyvinyl alcohol or poly-L-ornithine have also been reported. Hain et al., <i>Mol. Gen. Genet. </i>199:161 (1985) and Draper et al., <i>Plant Cell Physiol. </i>23:451 (1982). Electroporation of protoplasts and whole cells and tissues have also been described (Donn et al., In Abstracts of VIIth International Congress on Plant Cell and Tissue Culture IAPTC, A2-38, p 53 (1990); D'Halluin et al., <i>Plant Cell </i>4:1495-1505 (1992) and Spencer et al., <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>24:51-61 (1994)).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Following transformation of soybean target tissues, expression of the above-described selectable marker genes allows for preferential selection of transformed cells, tissues and/or plants, using regeneration and selection methods well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The foregoing methods for transformation would typically be used for producing a transgenic variety. The transgenic variety could then be crossed with another (non-transformed or transformed) variety in order to produce a new transgenic variety. Alternatively, a genetic trait that has been engineered into a particular soybean line using the foregoing transformation techniques could be moved into another line using traditional backcrossing techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move an engineered trait from a public, non-elite variety into an elite variety, or from a variety containing a foreign gene in its genome into a variety or varieties that do not contain that gene. As used herein, “crossing” can refer to a simple X by Y cross or the process of backcrossing depending on the context.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Single-Gene Conversions</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">When the term “soybean plant” is used in the context of the present invention, this also includes any single gene conversions of that variety. The term single gene converted plant as used herein refers to those soybean plants which are developed by a plant breeding technique called backcrossing wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of a variety are recovered in addition to the single gene transferred into the variety via the backcrossing technique. Backcrossing methods can be used with the present invention to improve or introduce a characteristic into the variety. The term “backcrossing” as used herein refers to the repeated crossing of a hybrid progeny back to the recurrent parent, i.e., backcrossing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more times to the recurrent parent. The parental soybean plant that contributes the gene for the desired characteristic is termed the nonrecurrent or donor parent. This terminology refers to the fact that the nonrecurrent parent is used one time in the backcross protocol and therefore does not recur. The parental soybean plant to which the gene or genes from the nonrecurrent parent are transferred is known as the recurrent parent as it is used for several rounds in the backcrossing protocol (Poehlman &amp; Sleper, 1994; Fehr, 1987). In a typical backcross protocol, the original variety of interest (recurrent parent) is crossed to a second variety (nonrecurrent parent) that carries the single gene of interest to be transferred. The resulting progeny from this cross are then crossed again to the recurrent parent and the process is repeated until a soybean plant is obtained wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent are recovered in the converted plant, in addition to the single transferred gene from the nonrecurrent parent</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The selection of a suitable recurrent parent is an important step for a successful backcrossing procedure. The goal of a backcross protocol is to alter or substitute a single trait or characteristic in the original variety. To accomplish this, a single gene of the recurrent variety is modified or substituted with the desired gene from the nonrecurrent parent, while retaining essentially all of the rest of the desired genetic, and therefore the desired physiological and morphological, constitution of the original variety. The choice of the particular nonrecurrent parent will depend on the purpose of the backcross; one of the major purposes is to add some agronomically important trait to the plant. The exact backcrossing protocol will depend on the characteristic or trait being altered to determine an appropriate testing protocol. Although backcrossing methods are simplified when the characteristic being transferred is a dominant allele, a recessive allele may also be transferred. In this instance it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired characteristic has been successfully transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Many single gene traits have been identified that are not regularly selected for in the development of a new variety but that can be improved by backcrossing techniques. Single gene traits may or may not be transgenic; examples of these traits include but are not limited to, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, resistance for bacterial, fungal, or viral disease, insect resistance, male fertility, enhanced nutritional quality, industrial usage, yield stability and yield enhancement. These genes are generally inherited through the nucleus. Several of these single gene traits are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,959,185; 5,973,234 and 5,977,445; the disclosures of which are specifically hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Tissue Culture</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Further reproduction of the variety can occur by tissue culture and regeneration. Tissue culture of various tissues of soybeans and regeneration of plants therefrom is well known and widely published. For example, reference may be had to Komatsuda, T. et al., <i>Crop Sci. </i>31:333-337 (1991); Stephens, P. A., et al., <i>Theor. Appl. Genet</i>. (1991) 82:633-635; Komatsuda, T. et al., <i>Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, </i>28:103-113 (1992); Dhir, S. et al., <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>(1992) 11:285-289; Pandey, P. et al., <i>Japan J. Breed. </i>42:1-5 (1992); and Shetty, K., et al., <i>Plant Science </i>81:245-251 (1992); as well as U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,944 issued Jun. 18, 1991 to Collins et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,200 issued Apr. 16, 1991 to Ranch et al. Thus, another aspect of this invention is to provide cells which upon growth and differentiation produce soybean plants having the physiological and morphological characteristics of soybean cultivar 3235020.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As used herein, the term “tissue culture” indicates a composition comprising isolated cells of the same or a different type or a collection of such cells organized into parts of a plant. Exemplary types of tissue cultures are protoplasts, calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that can generate tissue culture that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, flowers, seeds, pods, leaves, stems, roots, root tips, anthers, pistils and the like. Means for preparing and maintaining plant tissue culture are well known in the art. By way of example, a tissue culture comprising organs has been used to produce regenerated plants. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,959,185; 5,973,234 and 5,977,445 describe certain techniques, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Additional Breeding Methods</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">This invention also is directed to methods for producing a soybean plant by crossing a first parent soybean plant with a second parent soybean plant wherein the first or second parent soybean plant is a soybean plant of cultivar 3235020. Further, both first and second parent soybean plants can come from soybean cultivar 3235020. Thus, any such methods using soybean cultivar 3235020 are part of this invention: selfing, backcrosses, hybrid production, crosses to populations, and the like. All plants produced using soybean cultivar 3235020 as at least one parent are within the scope of this invention, including those developed from cultivars derived from soybean cultivar 3235020. Advantageously, this soybean cultivar could be used in crosses with other, different, soybean plants to produce the first generation (F<sub>1</sub>) soybean hybrid seeds and plants with superior characteristics. The cultivar of the invention can also be used for transformation where exogenous genes are introduced and expressed by the cultivar of the invention. Genetic variants created either through traditional breeding methods using soybean cultivar 3235020 or through transformation of cultivar 3235020 by any of a number of protocols known to those of skill in the art are intended to be within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The following describes breeding methods that may be used with soybean cultivar 3235020 in the development of further soybean plants. One such embodiment is a method for developing a cultivar 3235020 progeny soybean plant in a soybean plant breeding program comprising: obtaining the soybean plant, or a part thereof, of cultivar 3235020 utilizing said plant or plant part as a source of breeding material and selecting a soybean cultivar 3235020 progeny plant with molecular markers in common with cultivar 3235020 and/or with morphological and/or physiological characteristics selected from the characteristics listed in Tables 1 or 2. Breeding steps that may be used in the soybean plant breeding program include pedigree breeding, back crossing, mutation breeding, and recurrent selection. In conjunction with these steps, techniques such as RFLP-enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection (for example SSR markers) and the making of double haploids may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Another method involves producing a population of soybean cultivar 3235020 progeny soybean plants, comprising crossing cultivar 3235020 with another soybean plant, thereby producing a population of soybean plants, which, on average, derive 50% of their alleles from soybean cultivar 3235020. A plant of this population may be selected and repeatedly selfed or sibbed with a soybean cultivar resulting from these successive filial generations. One embodiment of this invention is the soybean cultivar produced by this method and that has obtained at least 50% of its alleles from soybean cultivar 3235020.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">One of ordinary skill in the art of plant breeding would know how to evaluate the traits of two plant varieties to determine if there is no significant difference between the two traits expressed by those varieties. For example, see Fehr and Walt, <i>Principles of Cultivar Development</i>, p 261-286 (1987). Thus the invention includes soybean cultivar 3235020 progeny soybean plants comprising a combination of at least two cultivar 3235020 traits selected from the group consisting of those listed in Tables 1 and 2 or the cultivar 3235020 combination of traits listed in the Summary of the Invention, so that said progeny soybean plant is not significantly different for said traits than soybean cultivar 3235020 as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental conditions. Using techniques described herein, molecular markers may be used to identify said progeny plant as a soybean cultivar 3235020 progeny plant. Mean trait values may be used to determine whether trait differences are significant, and preferably the traits are measured on plants grown under the same environmental conditions. Once such a variety is developed its value is substantial since it is important to advance the germplasm base as a whole in order to maintain or improve traits such as yield, disease resistance, pest resistance, and plant performance in extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Progeny of soybean cultivar 3235020 may also be characterized through their filial relationship with soybean cultivar 3235020, as for example, being within a certain number of breeding crosses of soybean cultivar 3235020. A breeding cross is a cross made to introduce new genetics into the progeny, and is distinguished from a cross, such as a self or a sib cross, made to select among existing genetic alleles. The lower the number of breeding crosses in the pedigree, the closer the relationship between soybean cultivar 3235020 and its progeny. For example, progeny produced by the methods described herein may be within 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 breeding crosses of soybean cultivar 3235020.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As used herein, the term “plant” includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which soybean plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, ovules, flowers, pods, leaves, roots, root tips, anthers, cotyledons, hypocotyls, stems, pistils, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">INDUSTRIAL USES</heading>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The seed of soybean cultivar 3235020, the plant produced from the seed, the hybrid soybean plant produced from the crossing of the variety with any other soybean plant, hybrid seed, and various parts of the hybrid soybean plant can be utilized for human food, livestock feed, and as a raw material in industry.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The soybean is the world's leading source of vegetable oil and protein meal. The oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil is composed of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a typical composition of 11% palmitic, 4% stearic, 25% oleic, 50% linoleic and 9% linolenic fatty acid content (“Economic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits Summary Report”, Iowa Soybean Promotion Board and American Soybean Association Special Report 92S, May 1990). Changes in fatty acid composition for improved oxidative stability and nutrition are constantly sought after. Industrial uses of soybean oil which is subjected to further processing include ingredients for paints, plastics, fibers, detergents, cosmetics, lubricants and biodiesel fuel. Soybean oil may be split, inter-esterified, sulfurized, epoxidized, polymerized, ethoxylated, or cleaved. Designing and producing soybean oil derivatives with improved functionality and improved oliochemistry is a rapidly growing field. The typical mixture of triglycerides is usually split and separated into pure fatty acids, which are then combined with petroleum-derived alcohols or acids, nitrogen, sulfonates, chlorine, or with fatty alcohols derived from fats and oils.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Soybean is also used as a food source for both animals and humans. Soybean is widely used as a source of protein for animal feeds for poultry, swine and cattle. During processing of whole soybeans, the fibrous hull is removed and the oil is extracted. The remaining soybean meal is a combination of carbohydrates and approximately 50% protein.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">For human consumption soybean meal is made into soybean flour which is processed to protein concentrates used for meat extenders or specialty pet foods. Production of edible protein ingredients from soybean offers a healthier, less expensive replacement for animal protein in meats as well as in dairy-type products.</p>
