<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The use of a pivotal coupling on a cart of the wheelbarrow type allows for a downwardly applied pressure to the user ends of the handles to tip the bucket to at least begin the dumping action of the cart. Following the initial downward pressure with the handles still elevationally displaced downward an upward lift applied to the user ends of the handles completes the dumping action of the cart. Use of multiple pivotal axises on the cart provide for an extremely efficient operation. Various enhancements are explained including locking of the orientation of the cart following the initial dump, wheel blocking to prevent rotation of the ground support wheel relative to the bucket during at least a portion of the final dumping action and stabilization enhancement to prevent lateral tipping of the cart during the final dumping action.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to carts capable of being manually manipulated by a person and manually dumped. More specifically, the invention relates to such carts, which may be dumped utilizing a combination of a downwardly applied pressure on a handle assembly and an upwardly applied pressure on the handle assembly or dumping by an upward applied pressure on the handle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous types of carts exist which have a wheel or wheels, a container and a handle assembly where the cart can be manually manipulated by a person and manually dumped. A classic example of such a cart is a wheel-barrow which typically has a single front wheel, opposing handles which extend from the front wheel rearward, support legs extending downward from the handle and a bucket fixedly attached to the top of the handles. Millions of such carts have been produced for domestic use in the United States. In use the wheelbarrow typically rests on the ground at the front wheel and the support legs when not being manipulated by a person. From this position the bucket of the wheelbarrow may be loaded. When the wheelbarrow is to be moved from one position to another the person grips the handles distal from the front wheel and raises the handles to raise the support legs off of the ground. At this point the wheelbarrow is supported by the front wheel and the person manipulating the handles. When a dumping of the contents of the bucket is desired, without regard for whether the support legs are in contact with the ground or elevated above the ground for movement of the wheelbarrow, the person raises the handles to angularly tip the wheelbarrow up. This operation is performed countless times each day by construction workers as well as casual users. Despite the fact that this operation is routinely performed it remains an awkward operation to perform. First the hands move upward while lifting the handles up in a pulling action then a transfer occurs where the person's grip on the handles shifts and then the person applies a pushing action upward to the handles. This operation is performed while balancing the weight of the wheelbarrow and the contents of the bucket across the opposing handles while stepping toward the wheel and on the single front wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various innovations have been made to wheelbarrow designs to make the above dumping operation more controllable. A first class of innovations involves increasing the stability of the front wheel by either providing for a wider wheel or providing for opposing spaced adjacent wheels. Another class of innovations involves providing unique angular arrangement of at least the grip portion of the handles. Another class of innovations is known in the art for a more controllable dumping which involve providing for a downward pressure to be applied to the handles to perform the dumping procedure while the support legs remain in contact with the ground during the entire dumping procedure. Two examples of such designs appear in U.S. Pat. No. 1,032,009 to Long in 1912 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,037,222 to Farrar in 1935. Both of these designs have leg supports, which are fixedly positioned relative to their respective front wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various deficiencies exist with the known designs for carts of the wheelbarrow type. As can be seen various attempts have been made to provide for a more controllable dumping operation of wheelbarrows. These attempts have been less efficient than desired. As such, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for a cart design, which provide for performance of a dumping operation, which may be easily, safely and comfortably performed. The present invention substantially fulfills these needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of carts, the present invention relates to a cart for easy dumping which utilizes a downward pressure applied by a user. The cart has a handle assembly, a wheel assembly, a ground contacting assembly and a pivotal coupling. The handle assembly has a user manipulation end and a distal end. The wheel assembly has a ground support wheel, which has a rotational axis. The wheel assembly also has a bucket fixedly positioned relative to the rotational axis of the ground support wheel. The ground contacting assembly contacts the ground while the cart is in a resting orientation and provides for a leveraging when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The pivotal coupling provides for a pivoting of the handle assembly relative to select portions of the cart to apply an upward pressure to the wheel assembly in close proximity to the bucket when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The upward pressure applied to the wheel assembly utilizes a cooperation between the ground contacting assembly and the pivotal coupling where the bucket is easily dumped forward away from the user manipulation end of the handle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide for a cart which may be dumped utilizing a combination of a downward push to the handle assembly followed by an upward lift to the handle assembly or by an upward thrust on the handle assembly to toss the load.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0020">The present invention relates to a system and method for tossing or ejecting a product from a cart or wheelbarrow. When the cart is moved from one position to a further position, a person grips the handles distal from the front wheel and raises the handles which raise the support legs of the cart off the ground. At this point, the cart is supported by the front wheel and the person manipulating the handles. When a person wishes to dump the contents of the bucket, the person can thrust the handles up angularly tipping the cart upward. The separation of the handle assembly and the bucket assembly occurs as the bucket assembly and its contents continue to follow the direction of the momentum over the balancing axis point of the cart ending up at the final dumping orientation. The dumping is done without regard for whether the support legs are in contact with the ground or elevated above the ground for movement of the cart.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0021">At this dumping orientation, the leveraged locking mechanism has been released and the contents have been dumped. Pulling back on the handles brings the wheel-bucket assembly back over the balancing axis point bringing the wheel-bucket assembly and the handle assembly back together.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0022">It is an object of the present invention to further provide a system and method for incline dumping of a cart or wheel-barrow at an incline, the balancing axis point of the cart and the center of gravity are closer together, making the wheel-bucket assembly easier for tipping. When a dumping of the contents of the bucket is desired, a person can thrust the handles up angularly, tipping the cart upward. The separation of the handle assembly and the wheel-bucket assembly occurs as the wheel-bucket assembly and its contents continue to follow the direction of the momentum over the balancing axis point of the cart ending up at the final dumping orientation. The dumping is done without regard for whether the support legs are in contact with the ground or elevated above the ground for movement of the cart.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0023">At this dumping orientation, the leverage locking mechanism has been released and the contents have been dumped. Pulling back on the handles brings the wheel-bucket back over the balancing axis point bringing the wheel-bucket assembly and the handle assembly back together.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0024">It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for dumping a load from a cart by pushing down the handles of the cart. Pushing down on the handles causes a leveraging to occur in the handle assembly. The front end of the handle assembly pushes up toward the rear of the wheel-bucket assembly while pushing down and pivoting on the rear ground supporting couplings. By pivoting the arm assembly up and down, this pushes down on the rear ground support couplings causing the ground support to rock back toward the rear which causes a pushing up on the forward ground support couplings located near the center of the wheel-bucket assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0025">The ground support assembly has a pressure bearing point of contact with the ground close to the center of gravity of the load and a curved bracket at the bottom that extends upward laterally toward the handles. When the curved bracket is provided a pressure bearing axis of the ground contacting assembly, it typically will move along the curve back toward the handles when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The extension of the curved bracket keeps the handles higher off the ground which also contributes in raising the cart assembly higher at the rear.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0026">During the initial downward pushing of the handles, the front end pivots upward from the ground supports' rear coupling, pushing up on the linkage coupling which connects to the cart assembly. This causes a division between the wheel-bucket assembly and the hand assembly to occur. The length of the linkage determines the expansion of the arc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0027">As the bucket tips forward after the initial pushing down on the handles, a transferring starts to occur over the axis of the wheel. The weight begins to become displaced. In the leveraged position, the displacement has made the weight lighter on the user end. The center of gravity of the load has moved toward the axis of the wheel. This combined with the downward angle of the handles make the leveraging easier for the final dumping procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0028">The present invention relates to a system and method for lifting from a dumping position. In a crouched lifting position, after the initial downward push on the handles, a person's legs will be bent, back straight, and arms extended downward holding the ends of the handles. As a person's legs are stretched out to lift the heaviest part of the load to their waist area, the weight diminishes from the load on the user side of the axis of the wheel due to the displacement of the load that crosses over the balancing axis point where the tipping takes place. This operation is performed while balancing the weight of the cart and the contents of the bucket across opposing handles on the wheel or wheels having both feet stationed on the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0029">In a standing position, after the initial lifting from a crouched position up to a person's waist area, the leverage load weight has diminished substantially due to the increased displacement of the load that crossed over the balancing axis point of the cart making it easier for a person's arms to lift the remaining part of the load over the balancing axis point to a dump position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0030">During the final dumping action, a fulcrum transfer occurs between the axis of ground bearing wheel and the nose of the wheel-bucket assembly where the displacement of the load occurs. The nose of the wheel-bucket assembly now becomes the balancing axis point for the remaining dumping procedure. At this dumping orientation, the leveraged locking mechanism has been released and the contents have been dumped. Pulling back on the handles brings the wheel-bucket assembly back over the balancing axis point bringing the wheel-bucket assembly and the handle assembly back together.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">It is an object of the present invention to be able to dump the contents of the cart in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">It is an object of the present invention to provide a latching assembly between the bucket and the handle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty, which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there is illustrated the preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">Many different carts having features of the present invention are possible. The following description describes the preferred embodiment of select features of those carts and various combinations thereof. These features may be deployed in various combinations to arrive at various desired working configurations of carts.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">Reference is hereafter made to the drawings where like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various views.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">Carts having features of the present invention provide for an easy dumping of a load utilizing a downward pressure applied by a user to a handle assembly or an upward pressure applied by a user to the handle assembly. The momentum of the load tips the hopper over the wheel axis. The carts have a handle assembly, a ground support wheel, a ground contacting assembly and a bucket. The carts have a resting orientation where the cart is in a standard configuration and where loading of the cart may readily occur as conventionally known for standard carts. The carts have a longitudinal length aligned with a straight line of travel of the cart. The carts have a forward portion and rearward portion and opposing lateral sides. Suitable cross bracing at various positions on the cart, as conventionally known in the art, may be utilized to enhance structural integrity of the cart.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a cart <b>20</b> having a handle assembly <b>22</b>, a ground support wheel <b>24</b>, a ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> and a bucket <b>28</b> and positioned in a resting orientation <b>30</b> on a ground surface <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">A method of use provides for a user to dump a cart using the steps of providing a cart having features of the present invention. Then positioning the cart in a starting position with the bucket generally level and the ground contacting assembly in contact with the ground and the ground support wheel in contact with the ground. Then applying a downward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly of the cart wherein the user manipulation end of the handle assembly moves downward and the bucket pivots upward at the rearward extremity relative to the ground contacting assembly and the bucket pivots downward at the forward extremity until the locking device locks the handle assembly in the leveraged position relative to the ground contacting assembly. Then applying an upward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly of the cart wherein the bucket angularly tips up at the rearward extremity to a dumping orientation by which point the locking device releases the handle assembly. Then moving the user manipulation end of the handle assembly of the cart downward to return the cart to the starting position. The handle assembly returns to the standard position from the leveraged position. The locking device can be in several different arrangements including ratchet, sliding, binding and telescopic.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts various steps of use of cart <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts cart <b>20</b> positioned in a starting position with bucket <b>28</b> generally level and ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> and ground support wheel <b>24</b> in contact with ground surface <b>32</b>. The change depicted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the change subsequent to the applying of a downward pressure to a user manipulation end <b>34</b> of handle assembly <b>22</b>. User manipulation end <b>34</b> of handle assembly <b>22</b> has moved downward and bucket <b>28</b> has pivoted upward at a rearward extremity <b>36</b> relative to ground contacting assembly <b>26</b>. An arcing coupling <b>38</b> has locked handle assembly <b>22</b> in a leveraged position <b>40</b> relative to ground contacting assembly <b>26</b>. The change depicted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the change subsequent to applying an upward pressure to user manipulation end <b>34</b> of handle assembly <b>22</b>. Bucket <b>28</b> has angularly tipped up at rearward extremity <b>36</b> to a final dumping orientation <b>42</b>. During at least a portion of this movement arcing coupling <b>38</b> has retained handle assembly <b>22</b> in leveraged position <b>40</b> relative to ground contacting assembly <b>26</b>. The change depicted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the change subsequent to moving user manipulation end <b>34</b> of handle assembly <b>22</b> downward to return cart <b>20</b> to the starting position. By this point arcing coupling <b>38</b> has released handle assembly <b>22</b> to return handle assembly <b>22</b> to a standard position <b>44</b> from leveraged position <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">The handle assembly has a user manipulation end for manipulation by the user and a distal end opposing the user manipulation end. The handle assembly has a standard position corresponding to the cart's resting orientation. The handle assembly may take many forms with a preferred arrangement of a pair of symmetrically disposed opposing arms positioned on opposing lateral sides of the cart.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts handle assembly <b>22</b> having user manipulation end <b>34</b> and a distal end <b>46</b> opposing user manipulation end <b>34</b>. Handle assembly <b>22</b> is depicted in standard position <b>44</b> corresponding to resting orientation <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">The ground support wheel is in contact with the ground surface during much of the use of the cart. The ground support wheel has a rotational axis about which it rotates. While a single ground support wheel is preferred it is possible to provide for multiple ground support wheels adjacently positioned and sharing a common rotational axis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts ground support wheel <b>24</b> in contact with ground surface <b>32</b>. Ground support wheel <b>24</b> has a rotational axis <b>48</b> about which it may rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">The ground contacting assembly contacts the ground while the cart is in the resting orientation and provides for leveraging means when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The ground contacting assembly has a ground contact portion, which makes contact with the ground surface during certain operations of the cart. The ground contacting assembly may take many forms but preferably will distribute the weight of the cart, and any load positioned thereon, to, or toward, the opposing lateral sides of the cart while the cart is in the resting orientation, as conventionally known for wheelbarrow type carts. The ground contact portion preferably has a curvature thereon where a rolling contact with the ground surface occurs during the initial dumping operation. When the curvature is provided a pressure-bearing axis of the ground contacting assembly typically will move along the ground contact portion when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The extension of the bracket determines the height of the handles and the tipping of the bucket.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">In certain embodiments the ground contacting assembly takes the form of a coupling assembly having a ground contact portion, which preferably will also be laterally distributed across the cart. The coupling assembly spans from the forward portion of the cart having the ground support wheel and the bucket to the rearward portion of the cart having the handle assembly. The ground contacting assembly may have a first connection portion and a second connection portion with the first connection portion connected to the forward portion, the wheel assembly, and the second connection portion connected to the rearward portion, the handle assembly. The coupling assembly may be pivotally attached to the forward portion of the cart and pivotally attached to the rearward portion of the cart. Alternatively, the coupling assembly may be pivotally attached to either the forward portion or rearward portion and fixedly attached to the opposing portion. The ground contacting assembly may extend from the rearward portion having the handle assembly and not contact the forward portion of the cart.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> contacts ground surface <b>32</b> and provides for a leveraging action to be applied by distal end <b>46</b> of handle assembly <b>22</b> relative to bucket <b>28</b> when the downward pressure is applied to user manipulation end <b>34</b>. Ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> has a ground contact portion <b>50</b>, which makes contact with ground surface <b>32</b>. Ground contact portion <b>50</b> has a curvature <b>52</b> thereto which rolls along ground surface <b>32</b> during the initial dumping operation as depicted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A pressure-bearing axis <b>54</b> moves during the movement of ground contacting assembly <b>26</b>. Ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> is a coupling assembly, which spans from a forward portion <b>56</b> to a rearward portion <b>58</b>. Forward portion <b>56</b> has ground support wheel <b>24</b> and bucket <b>28</b> while rearward portion <b>58</b> has handle assembly <b>22</b>. Forward portion <b>56</b> is also known as a wheel assembly. Ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> has a first connection portion <b>60</b> and a second connection portion <b>62</b>. First connection portion <b>60</b> and second connection portion <b>62</b> are pivotally attached to forward portion <b>56</b> and rearward portion <b>58</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">The bucket is attached to the cart relative to the ground support wheel. Preferably the bucket is fixedly positioned on the cart relative to the rotational axis of the ground support wheel. The bucket has a rearward extremity distal from the ground support wheel and a forward extremity in closer proximity to the ground support wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts bucket <b>28</b> fixedly attached to cart <b>20</b> relative to rotational axis <b>48</b> of ground support wheel <b>24</b>. Bucket <b>28</b> has rearward extremity <b>36</b> and a forward extremity <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">It is possible to provide for the bucket to pivot from a position offset from the rotational axis of the ground support wheel to provide for the bucket to contact the ground support wheel to prevent rotation thereof at select times. Preferably the forward portion of the cart forms a wheel assembly having the ground support wheel and the bucket fixedly positioned thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">At least one pivotal coupling provides for a pivoting of the handle assembly relative to select portions of the cart. The pivotal coupling provides for a pivotal axis, which laterally extends across the cart. Many structural elements may be utilized to provide for such couplings with at least two (2) laterally spaced elements preferably being deployed. In a most preferred embodiment two (2) such pivotal axises are provided in spaced relationship along the longitudinal length of the cart. In these cases the coupling assembly may be provided with a first pivotal axis connecting the coupling assembly to the forward position, the wheel assembly, and with a second pivotal axis connecting the coupling assembly to the rearward portion, the handle assembly, to provide for a pivoting of the handle assembly relative to the remainder of the cart.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depict a pivotal coupling <b>66</b> between ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> forward portion <b>56</b> and a pivotal coupling <b>68</b> between ground contacting assembly <b>26</b> and rearward portion <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">A biasing device provides for the handle assembly, in close proximity to the distal end, to apply, or cause to be applied, an upward pressure relative to the bucket when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The leveraging provides for the bucket to easily dump forward away from the user manipulation end of the handle assembly. The biasing device acts with the ground contact portion of the ground contacting assembly or coupling assembly to provide the desired leverage relative to the bucket to cause the initial tipping of the bucket where the elevational relationship of the rearward extremity of the bucket moves upward relative to the forward extremity of the bucket. The biasing device employs many different structural arrangements. A sliding engagement, an arcing engagement, and a binding engagement are several structural arrangements. When a sliding engagement is utilized a track may restrict moving components to a desired path.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depict handle assembly <b>22</b> applying an upward pressure <b>70</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, relative to bucket <b>28</b> through arcing coupling <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">A locking device provides for a locking of the handle assembly relative to the bucket in a leveraged position subsequent to the initial dumping action resulting from the application of the downward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly. Many structural arrangements may be used to provide the desired locking of the handle assembly in the elevationally displaced position. The locking device provides for selectively retaining the forward portion, the wheel assembly, in a dumping orientation relative to the rearward portion, the handle assembly, subsequent to the downward pressure being applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end sufficient to displace the forward portion, the wheel assembly, including the bucket to the dumping orientation. A locking device may be provided to lock the cart in the resting orientation if desired such as where conventional use is desired or during transport.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depict arcing coupling <b>38</b> which acts to lock handle assembly <b>22</b> in leveraged position <b>40</b> subsequent to the initial dumping action, see change from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This locking allows for handle assembly <b>22</b> to remain in leveraged position <b>40</b> during the final dumping action, see change from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">The rotational axis of the ground support wheel has a resting spacing relative to the ground contact portion of the ground contacting assembly at the ground surface when the cart is in the resting orientation. In use carts having features of the present invention operate based on one of two general principles. Under the first principle structures of the cart provide for the ground contacting assembly to remain at a uniform spacing relative to the rotational axis of the ground support wheel during the initial dumping operation. Under the second principle structures of the cart provide for the rotational axis of the ground support wheel to move toward the ground contacting assembly during the initial dumping operation. In this second more preferred arrangement the rotational axis of the ground support wheel has a dumping spacing relative to the ground contact portion of the ground contacting assembly subsequent to the downward pressure being applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end with the resting spacing greater than the dumping spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a resting spacing <b>72</b> between rotational axis <b>48</b> and pressure-bearing axis <b>54</b> of ground contact portion <b>50</b> while cart <b>20</b> is in resting orientation <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a dumping spacing <b>74</b> between rotational axis <b>48</b> and pressure-bearing axis <b>54</b> of ground contact portion <b>50</b> while cart <b>20</b> is in an initial dumping orientation <b>73</b>. It is noted that resting spacing <b>72</b> is greater than dumping spacing <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">The bucket has a center of balance positioned somewhere between the ground support wheel and the user manipulation end of the handle assembly. The center of balance is loosely determined based upon a uniform distribution of a typical load as would most likely be carried by the respective cart. The handle assembly has a leveraging position distal from the user manipulation end where the leveraging position acts upon the bucket during the initial dumping operation. Preferably the leveraging position of the handle assembly acts upon the bucket rearward, or on the user manipulation end of the handle assembly, side of the center of balance of the bucket during the applying of the downward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0077">Ground support wheel rotation blocking assembly provides for preventing rotation of the ground support wheel relative to the bucket during the applying of the upward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly. The application of upward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly occurs subsequent to the application of the downward pressure of the initial dumping action. During the application of the upward pressure the bucket angularly tips up at the rearward extremity to the dumping orientation. The ground support wheel rotation blocking assembly acts to prevent the cart from rolling during a portion of the dumping operation. Many structures are known in the art to provide for such blocking. The blocking may act upon some portion of the actual wheel or may act upon the axle bearing the wheel. A separate dedicated blocking member may be employed or a pivotal contact of the bucket with the wheel may be employed.</p>

When cart <b>20</b> is transferred to initial dumping orientation <b>73</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wheel engagement portion <b>84</b> engages ground support wheel <b>24</b> and prevents rotation thereof until cart <b>20</b> released from initial dumping orientation <b>73</b> begins to return to resting orientation <b>30</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0079">A stabilizing assembly may be positioned in close proximity to the ground support wheel to provide for contacting the ground surface in close proximity to the ground support wheel during some portion of the dumping procedure. Such an assembly may be employed to prevent the cart from rolling forward along the ground surface utilizing the ground support wheel and/or to laterally expand the contact area beyond that available by the ground support wheel to increase stability of the cart during the final dumping operation where the ground contacting assembly is raised off of the ground surface. Various arrangements may be employed including a fixed position arrangement. Preferably the stabilization assembly provides for a ground contacting portion to be elevationally displaced at least when the cart is being moved about to prevent inadvertent contact with the ground.</p>
