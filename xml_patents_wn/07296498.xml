<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to the field of bottle opener and more specifically to an attached disposable bottle opener to the conventional crimped steel bottle cap, in which suitable for brewed beers, ales and carbonated sodas.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the present days, many kinds of caps are used to the bottles. A certain type of bottle cap is used depending on type of bottle. For instance, tear off type is used for a milk and water; twist off type is used for sodas; and crimped steel bottle cap is used for beer and carbonate beverage to keep certain level of pressure of the contents. The crimped steel bottle cap needs a specialized tool, opener, which based on a leverage to remove the steel bottle cap from the bottle. Since the crimped steel bottle cap has emerged to the market, the bottle opener has become one of the important daily necessaries to the people in the house restaurant and other places. However, most people must have had inconvenient experiences with the crimped steel bottle cap without a opener at indoors, especially out doors. It must had been a harder experience to the women and elders to open the crimped steel bottle cap without using a proper opener. Furthermore, using the conventional opener makes a sharp projection to the steel bottle cap and the sharply fold bottle cap can be a factor of hazard to the people, especially to children and toddlers. They can be cut or may step on it with a bare foot. The neglected sharply bent steel cap is dangerous object to the toddlers who are apt to put a things into their mouth.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The primary object of the invention is to provide a overcome from disadvantageous practice with conventional crimped metal bottle cap. Another object of the invention is to prevent a possible hazard that sharply L shaped fold metal bottle cap. Present invention causes the crimped metal bottle cap to be opened in a safe shape. A further object of the invention is to provide people convenience. They can open crimped metal bottle caps any place at any time with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed an article of manufacture for attached bottle opener comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is attached to the crimped metal bottle cap in juxtaposition without mechanical retention or adhesive agent. It operates by ideal positions of fulcrum and resistance of a leverage for the purpose of opening the crimped metal bottle cap in safe shape with minimal efforts. Further in accordance with the invention, this device can be made in various forms using resilient plastic material.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein. It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Upon inspection of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will be seen that the preferred embodiment comprises with three functional portions of a leverage; a fulcrum portion <b>5</b>, a resistance portion <b>6</b> and effort portion <b>7</b>. The operation of the invention may be understood upon reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the user desires to open the bottle cap <b>2</b> from the bottle <b>1</b>, the user simply pulls the effort portion <b>7</b> outwardly and upwardly. Then <b>5</b> begins to fulcrum against the top wall <b>2</b>, and cause the resistance to the portion <b>6</b> to completely separate from the cap <b>2</b> from the bottle <b>1</b>. The resistance portion should hold about seven corrugations of bottle cap to get intended result. During the opening process, as the cap opens, the fulcrum gets to shift from <b>5</b> to <b>5</b><i>a</i>. As a consequence, it causes the bottle cap separates within 20′ degrees from the bottle neck by the leverage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It is evident that the conventional opener cause almost L shaped bottle cap because of the locked fulcrum which is positioned at the middle of crimped bottle cap. Thus, it is seen that a relatively small efforts required to open the crimped metal bottle cap using present invention. In this way, the preferred material is a PVC or other thermoplastic which are resilient at the temperatures. The thermosetting material penetrates into the corrugated flanges of the bottle cap during the heat sealing or induction sealing process. The manufacturer can simply apply the present invention just attaching to the conventional bottle cap. Moreover, various shape can be made within functional range. If an artistic consideration applies, the present invention can be formed as symbolically or ornamentally. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the effort portion <b>7</b> of the opener is formed as finger index to increase opening force. In accordance with the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention; and in this embodiment, the effort portion has hollow shaped figure to receive fingers. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it illustrates a third embodiment of the present invention; and in this embodiment, the effort portion has a ring shape and has impressed notch, so the user can fully insert a finger into the ring portion after bent the end of the opener. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it illustrates a forth embodiment of the present invention; and in this invention, the configuration is formed as a manner of the first embodiment with a metallic wire.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular form set forth, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
