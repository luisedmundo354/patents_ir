<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage entry of International Patent Application PCT/EP03/06058, filed Jun. 10, 2003, which claims priority to German Patent Application No. 102 25 418.4, filed Jun. 7, 2002, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a measuring apparatus for measuring of positions or movements of two objects relative to one another. In addition, the invention relates to a force and/or moment sensor which utilises such a measuring apparatus. Finally, the invention relates to a joystick which comprises the measuring apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From DE 36 11 336 C2 a force and torque sensor is known which measures all the six possible force and torque components in the Cartesian coordinate system by means of strain gauges. The apparatus consists of two spoke wheels arranged one above the other and a total of 20 strain gauges which are wired to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 36 11 337 A1 discloses an optoelectronic arrangement which can also detect six components. For this purpose, six light emitting means are arranged in a common plane at equal angular distances from one another in the interior of a plastic ball. Upstream of each light emitting means a stationary slit diaphragm is provided. The relative movements or relative positions are sensed by photosensitive detectors which are movably arranged relative to the arrangements of light emitting means and slit diaphragms. The detector axis of each detector extends orthogonally to the slit direction of the associated slit diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further documents which do not claim to be exhaustive and which show the technical background of the invention are:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 27 27 704 C3; DE 32 40 241 A1; U.S. Pat. No. 3,921,445; U.S. Pat. No. 3,628,394.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem on which the Invention is Based</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The known measuring apparatuses have only a limited measuring range. This is essentially determined by type, length, and arrangement of the spokes and strain gauges or by type and relative arrangement of the light emitting means, slit diaphragms, and light sensitive detectors, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In different applications of the measuring apparatus measurements have to be made in different force or travel measuring ranges. Thus, a plurality of small batches with corresponding components and arrangements of the components has been manufactured for the plurality of potential applications.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the basis of the state of the art, the present invention is based on the object to create a measuring apparatus for measuring positions or movements of two objects relative to one another, which can be easily adapted to different measuring ranges. The invention is further based on the object to create a force and/or moment sensor whose force/travel characteristic can be adapted to the requirements of different applications. The invention is finally based on the object to create a joystick for the input of up to six force or torque components, respectively.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Inventive Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For the solution of these objects, the invention teaches a measuring apparatus for measuring of positions or movements of two objects relative to one another, with is defined by the characteristics of claim <b>1</b>. Furthermore, it teaches a force and/or moment sensor which is defined by the characteristics of claim <b>16</b>. Finally, it teaches a joystick which is defined by the characteristics of claim <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The conversion spring means of the inventive measuring apparatus is capable of converting a spring travel or a spring rotation into a force or a moment, respectively. This force is measured by means of the force and/or moment sensor. The measuring range of the measuring apparatus may be adapted to the requirements of the application by the appropriate selection of the conversion spring means.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Construction and Development of the Inventive Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A preferred embodiment of the inventive measuring apparatus comprises a measuring spring means and a conversion spring means which are arranged in series. The spring means arranged in series connect a first assembly with a third assembly. The first assembly is connected with the one, the third assembly is connected with the other one of the two objects whose relative movements or relative positions are to be measured. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the first and/or the third assembly can also be the objects themselves. A second assembly is arranged between the two spring means connected in series. At least one optoelectronic measuring cell measures the travel length s<b>1</b> of the relative movement of the second assembly relative to the first assembly, which results from the travel length of the relative movement s<b>2</b> of the third assembly relative to the first assembly in an approximation as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>s</i>1<i>=s</i>2<i>·K</i>2/(<i>K</i>1+<i>K</i>2).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Here, K<b>1</b> is the spring constant of the conversion spring means between the first and the second assembly, and K<b>2</b> is the spring constant of the conversion spring means between the second and the third assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Even if the measuring cell is capable of measuring relative movements with travel lengths s<b>1</b> in only a limited range of values, the range within travel lengths s<b>2</b> of the relative movements between the first assembly and the third assembly can be measured, may nevertheless be set almost arbitrarily large by the suitable selection of K<b>2</b>. If the measuring cell is capable, for example, of measuring relative movements along an axis in the range from minus 2 mm to plus 2 mm, the measuring apparatus, however, is to measure relative movements between the first and the third assembly with travel lengths in the range from minus 8 mm to plus 8 mm, this can be achieved by selecting a conversion spring means with a spring constant for which applies:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K</i>2=⅓<i>·K</i>1.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the third assembly defines an inner space in which the first and the second assembly are arranged. The third assembly may, for example, form a part of the housing of the measuring apparatus. The inner space need not be enclosed. The third assembly is preferably securely connected with an object whose position relative to another object is to be determined. It is particularly preferred that the third assembly itself is said object, for example the housing of a joystick.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The conversion spring means which connects the third and the second assembly with each other preferably comprises one of the following components or combinations thereof: helical spring (assembly), moulded elastomer part, cast resin moulded part. In a preferred embodiment, the second assembly is suspended by the conversion spring means in the centre of the annulus of the third assembly. Preferably, the conversion spring means comprises three components for this purpose. The components are preferably arranged in a rotation symmetrical manner. In addition, they have preferably the same spring constant. It is particularly preferred that the components of the conversion spring means are helical springs. Moreover, the components of the conversion spring means are preferably biased.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The measuring spring means which connects the first with the second assembly preferably comprises one of the following components or combinations thereof: helical spring (assembly), moulded elastomer part, cast resin moulded part. The measuring spring, too, preferably comprises three components, and the components of the measuring spring are preferably arranged in a rotation symmetrical manner. In a preferred embodiment of the measuring apparatus the first assembly and the second assembly each comprise a printed circuit board. In this manner, the first and the second assembly can easily be provided with the elements of the measuring cells, i. e. position sensitive detectors, diaphragms, and light emitting means, as well as control electronics, if required, and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the components of the first spring means comprises at least one helical spring whose ends are securely connected with the first or the second assembly, respectively, by soldering. In this manner, the helical springs can be loaded in all directions, i. e. thrust and compression forces as well as forces acting transversely to the helical spring can be applied without the springs moving in their seats or even coming out of them. In another preferred embodiment, a component of the first spring means comprises at least one elastomer cylinder whose ends are adhesively joined with the first or second assembly, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A system which comprises the first assembly, the second assembly, the measuring spring means, and the optoelectronic measuring cells lends itself readily to series production. By selecting a suitable conversion spring means, the measuring apparatus is then adapted to the desired measuring range.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment the measuring apparatus further comprises at least one stop means which limits the movement of the first assembly relative to the second assembly. This is preferably realised by stop bolts which are firmly connected with one board. In this manner, the measuring apparatus is protected against overload. The stop bolts protrude through holes in the second assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment, the measuring apparatus comprises six optoelectronic measuring cells. In this manner, it is possible to measure relative movements and relative positions in six degrees of freedom. Three measuring cells preferably measure movements parallel to the plane of the first printed circuit board, and three measuring cells measure orthogonal movements. The optoelectronic measuring cells are preferably arranged on the circumference of a circle, particularly preferred in pairs, and preferably in a rotation symmetrical manner with respect to the centre of the circle. Measuring cells which measure the movements in the plane preferably alternate with those which measure orthogonal movements.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each optoelectronic measuring cell comprises a position sensitive detector which is arranged in the beam path of a light emitting means as well as a slit diaphragm which is arranged in the beam path of the light emitting means between the light emitting means and the position sensitive detector. The detector axis is oriented vertically to the slit direction of the slit diaphragm. Thus, only a narrow light bar is incident on the position sensitive detector downstream of the diaphragm. The slit diaphragms of the measuring cells which measure the movements in the plane extend vertically to the plane, while the slit diaphragms of the measuring cells which measure the movements orthogonal to the plane extend parallel to the plane. It is particularly preferred that the light emitting means are infrared light emitting diodes and the position sensitive detectors are position sensitive infrared detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One element of a system consisting of light emitting means, slit diaphragm, and detector and is movable relative to the two other elements. Consequently, the position of the narrow light bar on the position sensitive detector is dependent on the position of the movable element relative to the two other elements, and it is therefore possible to detect relative positions or relative movements.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, each measuring cell is assigned an own light emitting means which radiates radially towards a circular circumference. There, the position sensitive infrared detectors are arranged opposite the infrared light emitting diodes. The beam path therefore always extends in a direction originating from the centre. Due to the fact that each measuring cell is assigned an own light emitting means, the output signal of the position sensitive detectors can be utilised to control the currents of the correspondingly assigned light emitting means in such a manner that the same constant light quantity is incident on each position sensitive detector. This is advantageous in that all the six measuring systems are unaffected by temperature and aging influences as well as contamination and component tolerances over wide ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to be able to measure relative movements one component each of the system light emitting means, slit diaphragm, detector must be movable relative to the other two elements. In the preferred embodiment, the slit diaphragm in each measuring cell is arranged either on the first or on the second assembly, and the position sensitive detectors and the light emitting means are arranged together on the respective other one of the two assemblies. This is advantageous in that all electronic components can be accommodated on a single printed board.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The inventive force and/or moment sensor employs the measuring apparatus according to the present invention. Hereby, the capability is utilised that the force/travel characteristic of the force and/or moment sensor can be adjusted in wide ranges by selecting the spring constant of the conversion spring means. The travel length of the relative movement s<b>2</b> between the first and the third assembly is a function of the applied incremental force as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>s</i>2<i>=F·</i>(1<i>/K</i>1+1<i>/K</i>2).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Here, s<b>2</b> is the travel length of the relative movement between the first and the third assembly, F is to applied incremental force.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following, the operation of the measuring apparatus for measuring of positions or movements of two objects relative to one another will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The apparatus consists of a first <b>12</b>, a second <b>14</b>, and a third assembly <b>16</b> which are connected with each other via a measuring <b>18</b> and a conversion spring means <b>20</b>. The measuring spring means <b>18</b> comprises spring properties with a spring constant K<b>1</b> in the direction indicated by the straight line <b>22</b>, the conversion spring means <b>20</b> comprises spring properties with a spring constant K<b>2</b> in the same direction. If the measuring apparatus is also to be employed for the detection of travel lengths of relative movements or relative positions in other spatial directions and/or for the detection of rotary movements, then the spring means should analogously comprise spring properties in these spatial directions as well, namely essentially linear spring properties for the measurement of translations and torsion spring properties for the measurement of rotary movements. For the sake of simplicity, however, it is assumed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that only translatory movements along the direction indicated by the straight line <b>22</b> are to be measured. It is also possible to take non-linear spring characteristics into consideration. This may, however, require an increased computation expenditure in the evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second <b>14</b> and the third assembly <b>16</b> are freely movable relative to the first assembly <b>12</b>. As can be seen in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a displacement of the third assembly <b>16</b> relative to the first assembly <b>12</b> also results in a displacement of the second assembly <b>14</b> relative to the first assembly <b>12</b>. As has been explained above, the extent of the displacement s<b>1</b> is dependent on s<b>2</b> and the spring constants K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b>. The displacement s<b>1</b> is measured by an optoelectronic measuring apparatus. With K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> being known, s<b>2</b> can be determined thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to achieve the displacement, an incremental force F must be applied. In this manner, the inventive measuring apparatus <b>10</b> may also be employed as a force and/or moment sensor. The ratio between the incremental force F and the travel length of the relative movement s<b>2</b> may be adjusted by the spring constants K<b>2</b> and K<b>2</b> as has been explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the inventive measuring apparatus <b>10</b>. By means of this apparatus <b>10</b> relative positions and relative movements may be measured in all six degrees of freedom, i. e. translations in three spatial directions and rotations about these spatial directions. For this purpose, the third assembly <b>16</b> forms an annulus in whose interior the first <b>12</b> and the second assembly <b>14</b> are arranged. The second assembly <b>14</b> is suspended by the spring means <b>20</b> in the centre of the annulus <b>16</b> and is freely movable. The conversion spring means <b>20</b> consist of three biased helical springs. The helical springs are arranged circularly about the centre of the annulus and comprise an angular distance of 120° each from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The conversion spring means <b>20</b> has therefore spring properties in all three spatial directions and, moreover, acts as a torsion spring in the case of rotations about these spatial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The third assembly <b>16</b> is part of the housing of a joystick for a personal computer or a playstation. The second <b>14</b> and the first assembly <b>12</b> are printed circuit boards. The first assembly <b>12</b> is connected with the second assembly <b>14</b> by a measuring spring means <b>18</b> which consists of three helical springs one end of which is firmly soldered to the second assembly <b>14</b> and whose other end is firmly soldered to the first assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this manner, the measuring spring means <b>18</b> functions both as a linear spring means in all three spatial directions and as a torsion spring in the case of rotations about these spatial directions. The measuring spring means <b>18</b> comprises three helical springs which are arranged in a rotation symmetrical fashion at an angle of 120° from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to limit the relative movements or relative positions of the first <b>12</b> and the second assembly <b>14</b> so that any overload cannot result in damage occurring to the measuring apparatus <b>10</b> or the force and/or moment sensor, respectively, three stop means <b>24</b> in the form of stop bolts are provided. The stop bolts are securely connected with the first assembly <b>12</b> and project through holes in the second assembly <b>14</b>. The horizontal movement of the second assembly <b>14</b> relative to first the assembly <b>12</b> is determined by the diameter of the stop means <b>24</b>. The movement of the two assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> relative to one another is limited by enlargements <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> at the bolt-shaped stop means <b>24</b>. The distances of the enlargements <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> from the second assembly <b>14</b> towards the axis of symmetry of the stop bolts determine the range within which the first assembly is movable relative to the second assembly <b>14</b> in this direction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The measuring apparatus <b>10</b> is capable of measuring relative movements or relative positions of the first <b>12</b> and the second assembly <b>14</b> in six degrees of freedom, i. e. displacements in three linearly independent spatial directions and rotations also about three linearly independent spatial directions. For this purpose, three position sensitive infrared detectors <b>30</b> are provided which, together with six infrared light emitting diodes (ILEDs) <b>32</b> and six slit diaphragms form six measuring cells as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The position sensitive infrared detectors <b>30</b> are rotated relative to one another by 120° each about the axis of symmetry of a cylinder surface which is defined by a printed circuit board <b>34</b>. The ILEDs <b>32</b> are arranged in the same manner so as to be offset by 120° each about the same axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry extends orthogonally from the printed circuit board <b>38</b> of the first assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The position sensitive infrared detectors <b>30</b> are arranged in pairs of detectors <b>30</b> lying one above the other. The ILEDs <b>32</b> are arranged in the same manner as pairs if ILEDs <b>32</b> lying one above the other. Each ILED pair <b>32</b> is located between two pairs each of position sensitive infrared detectors <b>30</b>. Each pair of position sensitive infrared detectors <b>30</b> consists of a position sensitive infrared detector <b>30</b> for detecting a movement perpendicular to the plane which is defined by the printed circuit board <b>38</b> of the first assembly, and a position sensitive infrared detector <b>30</b> for detecting a movement in this plane.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In each measuring cell a slit diaphragm <b>40</b> is arranged in the beam path of the ILED upstream of the position sensitive infrared detector. The slit diaphragm comprises a narrow slit, so that only a narrow light bar is incident on the position sensitive detector <b>30</b>. The direction of the slit of the slit diaphragm <b>40</b> is oriented perpendicular to the detector axis, i. e. perpendicular to the measuring direction of the detector <b>30</b>. Due to the fact that one element of the system ILED <b>32</b>, slit diaphragm <b>40</b>, and position sensitive infrared detector <b>30</b> is movable relative to the other two elements the measuring cell can detect relative movements and relative positions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The ILEDs <b>32</b> and the position sensitive infrared detectors <b>30</b> are securely connected with the printed circuit board <b>38</b> of the first assembly via the vertical printed circuit board <b>34</b>. The printed circuit board <b>38</b> additionally accommodates further electronic components for driving the ILED <b>32</b> and for evaluating the position information of the position sensitive detectors <b>30</b>. The diaphragms <b>40</b> are firmly connected with the second assembly <b>14</b>. The slit diaphragms <b>40</b> which are assigned a pair of detectors <b>30</b> arranged one above the other are combined to a single slit diaphragm with two slits extending perpendicular to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the inventive joystick, the upper enlargements <b>28</b> of the stop means <b>24</b> simultaneously serve for the attachment of the control handle of the joystick. In this manner, the joystick is connected with the first assembly <b>12</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>10</b> for measuring of positions or movement of two objects relative to one another. The annular third assembly <b>16</b> forms a part of the housing of the joystick. In this manner, movements of the handle relative to the housing can be converted into relative movements of the first assembly <b>12</b> with respect to the third assembly <b>16</b> and thus into relative movements of the first assembly <b>12</b> with respect to the second assembly <b>14</b> and measured in the manner as described above.</p>
