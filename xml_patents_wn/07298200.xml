<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Internal voltage generators are provided, as well as methods of overdriving an internal voltage generation circuit. Embodiments of the internal voltage generator comprise a first driver for receiving an external voltage to supply an internal voltage to the internal circuit in response to an input voltage; a comparator for comparing a reference voltage with a fed-back internal voltage to generate the input voltage of the first driver; a variable pulse generating circuit responsive to an input pulse; and a second driver for dropping the input voltage of the first driver to a ground voltage in response to the variable pulse produced by the variable pulse generating circuit.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2003-68801, filed on Oct. 2, 2003, the contents of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to internal voltage generators for semiconductor devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As semiconductor memory devices become more highly integrated, the size of the chips are reduced. The reduction in chip size generally acts to lower the operating voltages. With the increasing use of semiconductor memory devices in portable systems, such as, for example, notebook computers and mobile communication equipment, extensive efforts have been made to lower the operating voltage of semiconductor chips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the tendency to smaller chip size, an internal voltage, instead of an external voltage, has generally been used as the operating voltage of the chip. An internal voltage generator for generating an internal voltage is mounted on the chip and supplies the operating voltage to an internal circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such an internal voltage generator is designed to supply a constant internal voltage. The internal voltage generator generally includes a comparator and a feedback transistor. The comparator is configured to compare a reference voltage with the internal voltage. If the internal voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the comparator outputs, for example, a high (H) signal to turn off the feedback transistor. If the internal voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the comparator outputs, for example, a low (L) signal to turn on the feedback transistor. If the feedback transistor is turned on, an external voltage is supplied that increases the internal voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, if current consumption of the internal circuit momentarily increases, a phenomenon may occur in which the internal voltage is temporarily lowered due to delays in response time of the comparator and the feedback transistor. If the internal voltage is lowered, the operating speed of the internal circuit may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, with a memory device, if the internal voltage is lowered due to high current consumption when the bit line is sensed, the sensing speed, and hence the speed of the operation, is reduced. In order to prevent this phenomenon, an external voltage may be supplied as an internal voltage by generating an overdriving pulse to momentarily increase the internal voltage. The overdriving pulse allows current to flow across the feedback transistor during a predetermined pulse period.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an internal voltage generator, which is disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 10-2001-0038817, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing how the internal voltage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> varies with application of an external voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the internal voltage generator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the operating signal PS is activated to a high (H) level, a pulse generating circuit <b>20</b> generates a pulse P<b>1</b>. An NMOS transistor MN<b>1</b> is turned on in response to the pulse P<b>1</b>. When this occurs, the voltage of node N<b>1</b> becomes the ground voltage VSS (i.e., is set to a low (L) level). When the node N<b>1</b> is set to a low (L) level, PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> is turned on, so that an external voltage VDD is supplied as an internal voltage to the internal circuit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the width of the pulse P<b>1</b> is fixed, the external voltage continues to be supplied as the internal voltage while the pulse P<b>1</b> is at a high level. As a result, the externally supplied current may exceed the current that is consumed by the internal circuit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a problem may occur in that the supplied current may exceed the consumed current, thus increasing the internal voltage.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an internal voltage generator <b>10</b> according to embodiments of the present invention. The internal voltage generator <b>10</b> may provide an internal voltage of a relatively constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the internal voltage generator <b>10</b> includes a first driver, a comparator <b>100</b>, a variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b>, and a second driver.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first driver is a circuit that receives an external voltage VDD which is supplied as an internal voltage to an internal circuit <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, the first driver comprises a pull-up transistor MP<b>1</b>. The source of the pull-up transistor MP<b>1</b> receives the external voltage VDD, the drain of transistor MP<b>1</b> is connected to the internal circuit <b>300</b>, and the gate of transistor MP<b>1</b> is electrically connected to both the comparator <b>100</b> and the second driver. The pull-up transistor MP<b>1</b> is a PMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The comparator <b>100</b> compares a reference voltage VREF with the internal voltage VINT and generates a control signal that controls the input voltage of the first driver. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the reference voltage VREF is generated from a reference voltage generator <b>400</b>, and the internal voltage VINT is fed back from the first driver. If the internal voltage VINT is lower than the reference voltage VREF, the comparator <b>100</b> generates a low (L) signal to turn on the first driver. When this occurs, the external voltage VDD is supplied as the internal voltage VINT. If the internal voltage VINT is higher than the reference voltage VREF, the comparator <b>100</b> generates a high (H) signal to turn off the first driver.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b> is responsive to an input pulse P<b>1</b>. The variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b> senses the level of the internal voltage VINT and generates an output pulse P<b>2</b>. The reference voltage VREF is generated from the reference voltage generating circuit <b>400</b> and the internal voltage VINT is fed back from the first driver.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The output pulse P<b>2</b> is a variable pulse. Thus, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the output pulse P<b>2</b> is “pulled up” to a high level when (1) the input pulse P<b>1</b> is pulled up or (2) at a time period that is delayed from the time at which the input pulse P<b>1</b> is pulled up by a predetermined time. The output pulse P<b>2</b> is “pulled down” to a low level when the internal voltage VINT becomes lower than the reference voltage VREF. A construction and operation of the variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b> will be described in detail herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second driver reduces the input voltage of the first driver to the ground voltage VSS in response to the output pulse P<b>2</b>. In the embodiment of the present invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second driver includes a pull-down transistor MN<b>1</b>. The source of pull-down transistor MN<b>1</b> receives the input voltage of the first driver, the drain of transistor MN<b>1</b> is connected to the ground voltage VSS, and the gate of transistor MN<b>1</b> is connected to the variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b>. The pull-down transistor MN<b>1</b> is an NMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operation of the internal voltage generator <b>10</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the external voltage VDD is supplied as the internal voltage VINT through the first driver. If the internal voltage VINT supplied to the internal circuit <b>300</b> drops so that it is lower than the reference voltage VREF, the comparator <b>100</b> compares the reference voltage VREF with the fed-back internal voltage to generate a low (L) signal. The low signal is input to the first driver, and the PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> is turned on to supply the external voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">During normal operations, current consumption in the internal circuit <b>300</b> may be momentarily excessive. When this happens, a phenomenon may occur in which the internal voltage is temporarily lowered due to the response time and feedback time of the comparator <b>100</b>. In addition, if the external voltage is supplied excessively, the internal voltage may be increased too much.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">This phenomenon may be avoided and an internal voltage having a relatively constant level may be provided by the variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b> receiving the pulse P<b>1</b> when the internal circuit <b>300</b> operates, and generating the variable pulse P<b>2</b>. The variable pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a high level (1) when the pulse P<b>1</b> set to a high level or (2) at a time period that is delayed from the time when the pulse P<b>1</b> is set to a high level by a predetermined time. The variable pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a low level when the internal voltage becomes lower than the reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the variable pulse P<b>2</b> is in a high (H) state, the second driver drops the input voltage of the first driver to the ground voltage VSS. When this occurs, the external voltage VDD is supplied as the internal voltage. If the internal voltage VINT becomes lower than the reference voltage VREF, the variable pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a low level and the second driver is turned off. In this manner, a stable internal voltage having a relatively constant level is supplied to the internal circuit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a circuit diagram of the variable pulse generating circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a circuit diagram of the variable pulse generating circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> depicts waveforms of the input pulse P<b>1</b> and the output pulse P<b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a graph illustrating the width W<b>2</b> of the output pulse P<b>2</b> as a function of the internal voltage, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> is a graph illustrating levels of the internal voltage as a function of the external voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the variable pulse generating circuits <b>200</b> each include a differential amplifier configured to receive the reference voltage VREF and the internal voltage VINT, a precharge unit, and an internal voltage sensing level unit. The differential amplifier includes PMOS transistors mp<b>1</b> and mp<b>2</b> and NMOS transistors mn<b>1</b> and mn<b>2</b>. The precharge unit includes PMOS transistors mp<b>3</b> and mp<b>4</b>. The internal voltage sensing level unit includes resistor R in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">First, operation of the variable pulse generating circuit <b>200</b> will be described as if the internal voltage sensing level unit was not present. When the input pulse P<b>1</b> is in a low (L) state, the PMOS transistors mp<b>3</b> and mp<b>4</b> are turned on. As such, the external voltage VDD precharges the output terminal Vout of the differential amplifier. When the output terminal Vout of the differential amplifier is precharged to a high (H) state and the input pulse P<b>1</b> is at a high level, both input terminals of the NAND gate are at high (H) levels. As a result, the output pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a high level. In other words, the output pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a high level as soon as the input pulse P<b>1</b> is set to a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the input pulse P<b>1</b> is in a high (H) state, the PMOS transistors mp<b>3</b> and mp<b>4</b> are turned off and the NMOS transistor mn<b>3</b> is turned on. If, when the input pulse P<b>1</b> is in a high (H) state, the internal voltage VINT is higher than the reference voltage VREF, the output terminal Vout of the differential amplifier is set to a low (L) state, and the output pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a low level because the two terminals of the NAND gate are in high (H) and low (L) states, respectively. As a result, the output pulse P<b>2</b> is generated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Now, an operation of the variable pulse generating circuits <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> that include the internal voltage sensing level units will be described. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the internal voltage sensing level units are implemented using resistors. The internal voltage sensing level may be formed at a voltage that is higher than the reference voltage VREF by a predetermined level (for example, 0.2 V). The predetermined level may be changed by changing the resistance level. The output pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a low level when the internal voltage VINT becomes higher than the internal voltage sensing level.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the internal voltage sensing level unit is disposed between the NMOS transistors mn<b>2</b> and mn<b>3</b> of the differential amplifier and is controlled by the resistor R. The internal voltage sensing level unit of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is disposed at both the internal voltage input terminal and the reference voltage input terminal of the differential amplifier, and is controlled by a voltage divider circuit. A switching transistor is disposed in a lower portion of the voltage divider circuit in order to reduce consumption of standby current.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a graph illustrating the width W<b>2</b> of the output pulse as a function of the internal voltage. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, if the internal voltage VINT is lower than the reference voltage VREF or the internal voltage sensing level while the input pulse P<b>1</b> is in a high (H) state, the width W<b>2</b> of the output pulse P<b>2</b> is equal to the width W<b>1</b> of the input pulse P<b>1</b>. The output pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a low level when the internal voltage VINT becomes higher than the reference voltage VREF or the internal voltage sensing level VSEN.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The variable pulse generating circuits <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> or <b>4</b>B may advantageously provide high operating speed because the output pulse P<b>2</b> is set to a high level as soon as the input pulse P<b>1</b> is set to a high level. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, however, a minimum width of the output pulse P<b>2</b> cannot become zero. The minimum pulse width of the output pulse P<b>2</b> is determined by the response time of the differential amplifier.</p>

Accordingly, an output terminal Vout of the differential amplifier is discharged to a ground voltage VSS.
