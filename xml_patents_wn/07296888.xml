<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention pertains to eyewear. More particularly, this invention relates to auxiliary frames for eyeglasses and eyeglass appliances.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,103 to Meeker discloses eyeglasses and attachable pairs of one-piece lens rim covers. According to one embodiment, a magnetic strip is provided in a groove on an inside surface of the lens rim cover. A respective lens rim on the eyeglasses is partially or entirely manufactured of magnetizable material which facilitates attachment of the lens rim covers via the magnetic band onto the rim of the eyeglasses. However, the provision of a magnetic band within a groove on a lens rim cover is relatively bulky and complex, and detracts from the aesthetic look of each lens rim cover when applied onto eyeglasses. Such problem is particularly undesirable where the eyeglasses are styled with relatively thin, low-profile lens rims.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,880 to Chao discloses a spectacle, or eyeglass, frame including a primary frame and a secondary frame having one or more magnetizable members engaged in the eyeglass frame prior to magnetizing the members. The members, engaged into the frame by excavating the frame, are then electroplated and painted such that the magnetic members are embedded in the frame. After electroplating and painting, a magnetizing machine, such as an electromagnetic machine, is used to magnetize the members within the frame so as to prevent damaging the outer appearance of the frame. However, such technique requires the excavation of holes within an eyeglass frame. The eyeglass frame comprises a substrate material, wherein the magnets are then engaged within such excavated holes. Accordingly, the resulting eyeglass frame is relatively bulky and the discrete magnets disposed therein are not always sufficiently powerful enough to retain together a primary frame and an auxiliary frame on an eyeglass frame, particularly when such eyeglass frame is utilized during rigorous activities, such as during sporting events and while running.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,568,207, 5,737,054, 5,882,101, 5,877,838, 5,883,688, and 5,883,689, all to Chao, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,012,811 to Chao, et al. variously disclose auxiliary lenses, eyeglass appliances, and eyeglass frames utilizing discrete magnets and/or hook members, clips, or flaps for fixation onto eyeglasses. However, numerous problems are still encountered with such devices; namely, such devices render the eyeglass frames relatively cumbersome and aesthetically unpleasing when affixed onto eyeglasses. Furthermore, there still remain misalignment problems and difficulties in mating and demating such eyeglass frames from a pair of eyeglasses.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there exists a need for further improved methods and apparatus for attaching auxiliary frames to primary frames, such as when attaching eyeglass frames onto eyeglasses. Particularly, there exists a need for an apparatus and method that can more easily, firmly and elegantly attach auxiliary frames to primary frames so as to present an aesthetically pleasing eyeglass device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An auxiliary frame and a primary frame/auxiliary frame eyeglass device each include a heat treated magnetic alloy to impart magnetic properties capable of affixing together an auxiliary frame and a primary frame. According to one construction, the primary frame comprises eyeglasses, and the auxiliary frame comprises a sunglass attachment. According to one construction, the heat treated magnetic alloy comprises a spinodal decomposition alloy such as an iron-chromium-cobalt alloy that is first formed into a desired object shape, then heat treated to impart desired magnetic properties to the desired object shape.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect, an eyeglass accessory frame includes an auxiliary frame. The auxiliary frame includes a heat-treated magnetic alloy. The heat-treated magnetic alloy of the auxiliary frame is configured to magnetically couple the auxiliary frame to a primary frame having magnetizable material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect, an eyeglass device includes a primary frame and an auxiliary frame. The primary frame includes magnetizable material. The auxiliary frame includes a spinodal decomposition alloy that is heat treated to magnetize at least a portion of the auxiliary frame. The magnetized portion of the auxiliary frame interacts with the magnetizable material of the primary frame to magnetically couple the auxiliary frame to the primary frame.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to yet another aspect, an eyeglass device includes a first frame and a second frame. The first frame includes magnetizable material. A second, complementary frame includes a heat-treated magnetic alloy. The magnetic alloy of the second frame interacts with the magnetizable material of the first frame to magnetically couple together the first frame and the second frame.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to even another aspect, a method is provided for forming a magnetic eyeglass appliance. The method includes: forming an accessory frame at least in part from a spinodal decomposition alloy; and heat treating the formed accessory frame to magnetize the spinodal decomposition alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to yet even another aspect, a method is provided for forming a magnetic eyeglass appliance. The method includes: providing an auxiliary frame having a spinodal decomposition alloy; and heat treating the spinodal decomposition alloy to magnetize the spinodal decomposition alloy.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws “to promote the progress of science and useful arts” (Article 1, Section 8).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Reference will now be made to a preferred embodiment of Applicant's invention. Several implementations are described below and depicted with reference to the drawings, each comprising an apparatus and method for securing an auxiliary frame to a primary frame such as when securing a sunglass attachment onto an eyeglass. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> illustrate a first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref> illustrate a second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-22</figref> illustrate a third embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-27</figref> illustrate a fourth embodiment. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-33</figref> illustrate a fifth embodiment. While the invention is described by way of several preferred embodiments, it is understood that the description is not intended to limit the invention to such embodiments, but is intended to cover alternatives, equivalents, and modifications which may be broader than the embodiments, but which are included within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an effort to prevent obscuring the invention at hand, only details germane to implementing the invention will be described in great detail, with presently understood peripheral details being incorporated by reference, as needed, as being presently understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one preferred embodiment of Applicant's invention wherein an eyeglass device is provided and identified with reference numeral <b>100</b>. Eyeglass device <b>100</b> comprises a sunglass attachment <b>102</b> that is removably affixed to eyeglasses <b>104</b> and worn by a user <b>106</b>. Sunglass attachment <b>102</b> is configured to be mated and demated from eyeglasses <b>104</b>, either while eyeglasses <b>104</b> are worn by user <b>106</b>, or while eyeglasses <b>104</b> are removed from user <b>106</b> as depicted below with reference to an alternative embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, sunglass attachment <b>102</b> comprises an auxiliary frame <b>108</b>, and eyeglasses <b>104</b> comprise a primary frame <b>110</b>. Auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is formed at least in part from a magnetic alloy and primary frame <b>110</b> is formed at least in part from a magnetizable material. According to one construction, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is formed entirely from a magnetic alloy, and primary frame <b>110</b> is formed entirely from a magnetizable material. According to other constructions, only discrete components used to form auxiliary frame <b>108</b> are formed from a magnetic alloy, and discrete components used to form primary frame <b>110</b> are formed from a magnetizable material. Cooperation between the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>110</b>, when placed together in contact or close proximity, causes auxiliary frame <b>108</b> to be magnetically coupled to primary frame <b>110</b> which frictionally couples together primary frame <b>110</b> and auxiliary frame <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">More particularly, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is constructed to have a rearmost surface (toward a user) that conforms to the frontmost surface (away from a user) of primary frame <b>110</b>, especially with respect to the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>110</b>. Preferably, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> conforms to the general shape of primary frame <b>110</b> such that good “fit up”, or substantially parallel alignment and nesting, occurs therebetween so as to provide substantially uniform contact or close positioning therebetween. Accordingly, the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> imparts magnetic attraction with the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to an alternative construction, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is formed at least in part from magnetizable material, and primary frame <b>110</b> is formed from a magnetic alloy such that complementary, substantially mating portions therebetween are formed from the magnetizable material and magnetic alloy, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to one construction, one suitable magnetic alloy comprises a spinodal decomposition alloy having properties similar to stainless steel. In one form, such spinodal decomposition alloy is manufactured in a wire form shape. One such spinodal decomposition alloy comprises an iron-chromium-cobalt magnetic alloy having relatively favorable magnetic properties. Such alloy is formed into a desired shape, utilizing the wire form alloy material, and is subsequently processed by heat treating such desirable alloy in the desired shape to impart a desired magnetic property.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Utilization of such a spinodal decomposition alloy has heretofore not been known in the construction of eyeglasses and eyewear accessories. Instead, Applicant has discovered that such spinodal decomposition alloys have previously been used in the construction of security tags for consumer products. Applicant's efforts to design a solution to the previously described prior art problems entailed an evaluation and search of materials and processing methods heretofore not previously utilized in the construction of eyeglasses and eyeglass accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One commercially available source of such a spinodal decomposition alloy is The Arnold Engineering Company, Rolled Products Division, 300 N. West Street, Meringo, Ill. 60152. The Arnold Engineering Company produces in a wire form, sells, and heat treats such a spinodal decomposition alloy under the tradename “Arnokrome 3™”. Applicant has formed a desired auxiliary frame utilizing such wire form. After forming the auxiliary frame using the spinodal decomposition alloy, the source imparts desired magnetic properties into the spinodal decomposition alloy and auxiliary frame by heat treating such alloy. Details of specific constructions for such spinodal decomposition alloy and heat treating process are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,120,704 to Anderson, and assigned to The Arnold Engineering Company. Such U.S. Pat. No. 4,120,704 is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Several other heat-treated, magnetic alloys can be utilized on a primary frame or a secondary frame to magnetically affix together the primary frame and secondary frame. U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,336 to Kaneko, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,954,519 to Inoue; U.S. Pat. No. 3,982,972 to Iwata, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,324,597 to Kamino, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,251,293 to Jin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,236,919 to Kamino; U.S. Pat. No. 4,253,883 to Jin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,311,537 to Chin, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,876 to Yamashita, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,147 to Brandis, et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,351,033 to Liu, et al. disclose various suitable alloys which can be imparted with a magnetic property, and are herein incorporated by reference. Additionally, details in the use of such alloys as applied to the non-analogous art of security markers and security tags are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,967,185 to Montean; U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,499 to Montean; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,477,219 to Zarembo, et al., herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to one construction, one suitable magnetizable material comprises steel. However, it is understood that a magnetizable material can be provided by a steel, stainless steel, or any alloy that is capable of being physically attracted to a magnetic material when brought into close proximity thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In assembly, sunglass attachment <b>102</b> and eyeglasses <b>104</b> of eyeglass device <b>100</b> are affixed together by magnetic attraction via cooperation of the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> which imparts a magnetic (and frictional) bond with the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. According to the construction depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is adapted to be removably mated and demated from primary frame <b>110</b> even while a user is wearing eyeglasses <b>104</b>. Such mating and demating is made relatively easy and reliable because the need for clips and auxiliary retaining devices has been eliminated via use of magnetic alloy in auxiliary frame <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Additionally, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is configured (as seen in front view and edge view) so as to substantially conform to the shape and dimensions of primary frame <b>110</b>. However, legs <b>123</b> are not covered by auxiliary frame <b>108</b> in this embodiment. Accordingly, a pleasing aesthetic appearance is presented in assembly by eyeglass device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, eyeglass device <b>100</b> is imparted with an appearance that leaves an observer with the impression that auxiliary frames <b>108</b> are not even present, and that an outward appearance similar to primary frame <b>110</b> is presented by eyeglass device <b>100</b>. Hence, the appearance of a traditional “add-on” or “clip-on” sunglasses attachment is eliminated through use of sunglass attachment <b>102</b> on eyeglasses <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further illustrates the rear surface of sunglass attachment <b>102</b>, and namely, auxiliary frame <b>108</b>. Preferably, the entire periphery of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is formed from magnetic alloy, wherein such rear peripheral surface about each lens mates in engagement with a leading edge of primary frame <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) so as to provide for enhanced magnetic attachment and coaction therebetween in assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the mounting of sunglass attachment <b>102</b> to the front surface of eyeglasses <b>104</b>. One suitable attachment technique is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a user is wearing eyeglasses <b>104</b>, and sunglass attachment <b>102</b> is merely placed into alignment and engaged with eyeglasses <b>104</b> to impart magnetic attraction and fixation therebetween. Optionally, sunglass attachment <b>102</b> and eyeglasses <b>104</b> can be assembled together while hand held and removed from a user, as depicted below with reference to an alternative embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sunglass attachment <b>102</b> comprises auxiliary frame <b>108</b> including a pair of auxiliary lenses <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. According to one construction, auxiliary lenses <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> each comprise a sunglass lens, such as a polarized lens. Optionally, auxiliary lenses <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> can comprise magnifying lenses, colored lenses, filter lenses, and/or bifocal lenses. Furthermore, eyeglasses <b>104</b> comprise a pair of primary lenses <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, such as a pair of ground, prescription lenses configured to correct a user's vision.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Auxiliary frame <b>108</b> further comprises a nose bridge <b>120</b> that joins together a pair of auxiliary retaining mechanisms, or lens rims, <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. Similarly, a nose bridge <b>122</b> on primary frame <b>110</b> joins together a pair of primary retaining mechanisms, or lens rims, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>. Furthermore, a pair of temple extension members, or legs, <b>123</b> extend rearwardly of primary frame <b>110</b> on opposite lateral ends. Each leg <b>123</b> pivotally supports a stud, or temple member, <b>125</b> by way of a pivot pin <b>127</b>, according to any one of a number of techniques that are presently understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, sunglass attachment <b>102</b> is affixed to eyeglasses <b>104</b> through magnetic engagement of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> when placed in conforming adjacent and nested relationship with primary frame <b>110</b>. According to one such construction, bridges <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> are not placed into physically abutting relation, and therefore do not contribute to magnetic engagement therebetween. Alternatively, bridge <b>120</b> can be formed from magnetic alloy, bridge <b>122</b> can be formed of magnetizable material, and bridges <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> can be configured to engage in assembly so as to impart magnetic attraction therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> further illustrate in side view the pre-assembled configuration (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the assembled configuration (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for sunglass attachment <b>102</b> and eyeglasses <b>104</b> of eyeglass device <b>100</b>. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrate the substantially conforming configuration of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and primary frame <b>110</b> prior to and after nested engagement therebetween, respectively. Accordingly, it is understood that a rear edge or face of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> substantially conforms to the geometry of a front edge or face on primary frame <b>110</b>. When assembled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, rear edge of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is brought into close, proximate, and substantially engaged relationship with front edge of primary frame <b>110</b> so as to impart magnetic attraction and affixation therebetween. However, it is understood that a surface finish such as paint or plating material can be optionally applied on one or more of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and primary frame <b>110</b> such that magnetic attraction occurs across the finish. Accordingly, auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is affixed onto primary frame <b>110</b> as a result of frictional engagement therebetween which is imparted by magnetic attraction between the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the rear edge of auxiliary frame <b>108</b> is shown in direct, physical abutment with the front edge of primary frame <b>110</b>. Accordingly, magnetic attraction imparts such frictional engagement therebetween sufficient to retain sunglass attachment <b>102</b> to eyeglasses <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although auxiliary frame <b>108</b> of sunglass attachment <b>102</b> is shown in direct engagement with primary frame <b>110</b>, it is understood that it is not necessary that each lens rim <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) be placed into complete circumferential engagement with primary frame <b>110</b>. Local point contacts therebetween may impart sufficient magnetic attraction. However, to enhance magnetic attraction therebetween, it is preferable but not necessary that such complete circumferential engagement be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, it is desirable to provide a maximum amount of contact surface area between auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and primary frame <b>110</b> in order to enhance magnetic attraction therebetween. However, it is understood that the amount of surface area required is only that necessary to impart sufficient retention of a sunglass attachment onto complementary eyeglasses. Accordingly, the specific degree of “fit up” and contact between auxiliary frame <b>108</b> and primary frame <b>110</b> of the sunglass attachment and eyeglasses, respectively, can vary depending upon the weight of the sunglass attachment and the degree of magnetism that has been imparted to the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of sunglass attachment <b>202</b> that is similar to sunglass attachment <b>102</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>), and that is configured for magnetic mounting onto eyeglasses <b>104</b>. However, sunglass attachment <b>202</b> comprises auxiliary frame <b>208</b> that is formed at least in part from magnetic alloy and further includes a pair of rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. Rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> each depend along a topmost edge of auxiliary frame <b>208</b> and are configured to lie atop a topmost edge of primary frame <b>110</b> in assembly. Accordingly, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> assist magnetic attraction in the retention of auxiliary frame <b>208</b> onto primary frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Such alternative embodiment is particularly desirable when a user of eyeglasses <b>104</b> is participating in rigorous physical activities such as running, playing volleyball, or any activity where shaking of eyeglasses <b>104</b> and sunglass attachment <b>202</b> is potentially likely to dislodge the sunglass attachment <b>202</b> from eyeglasses <b>104</b>. Such dislodgement is due to inertial forces that act on sunglass attachment <b>202</b> and exceed the frictional forces imparted by a magnetic attraction between auxiliary frame <b>208</b> and primary frame <b>210</b>. However, it is understood that the addition of rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> is not necessary in many applications, particularly those where rigorous exertion does not result in significant deceleration forces being applied to auxiliary frame <b>208</b> such as result from shaking and vibration, or where sufficient magnetism can be realized to impart fixation under these conditions. Accordingly, sunglass attachment <b>202</b> and eyeglasses <b>104</b> cooperate to provide an alternative embodiment eyeglass device <b>200</b> that provides enhanced retention therebetween which is particularly suited for rigorous activities and environments.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The mating and demating between sunglass attachment <b>202</b> and eyeglasses <b>104</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is further illustrated below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-15</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, auxiliary frame <b>208</b> of sunglass attachment <b>202</b> nests into magnetically engaged attachment with primary frame <b>110</b> of eyeglasses <b>104</b>. As shown in frontal view, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> are configured along the upper edges of primary frame <b>110</b> so as to minimize any deleterious effects on the overall aesthetic appearance of eyeglass device <b>200</b>. Furthermore, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> each provide a discrete shelf, or ledge, that engages along an upper surface of primary frame <b>110</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). A remaining portion of auxiliary frame <b>208</b>, excluding rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, mates in magnetically affixed physical abutment similar to the abutment shown in the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> further illustrates the construction of rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. According to one construction, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> are also constructed from a magnetic alloy, such as a spinodal decomposition alloy. Alternatively, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> are formed of a non-magnetic material, such as a non-magnetic alloy, thereby contributing to retention and alignment between auxiliary frame <b>208</b> and primary frame <b>110</b>. Hence, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> also provide accurate alignment when assembling sunglass attachment <b>102</b> into magnetic engagement with eyeglasses <b>104</b>. Accordingly, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> further provide for mechanical affixation via coaction of rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> with an uppermost edge of primary frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref> further illustrate in greater detail the relatively streamlined and unobtrusive manner in which rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> overlie primary frame <b>110</b> when sunglass attachment <b>202</b> is assembled in magnetic engagement and overlying relationship with eyeglasses <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref>, rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> completely overlie an upper edge of primary frame <b>110</b> between nose bridge <b>122</b> and each temple extension member <b>123</b>, respectively. Such substantially complete overlying of flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> along an upper edge of primary frame <b>110</b> serves to partially conceal an edge-view seam formed between auxiliary frame <b>208</b> and primary frame <b>110</b>, particularly when viewing eyeglass device <b>200</b> from above. Accordingly, additional aesthetic features are provided by rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, auxiliary retaining mechanisms <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> include rim flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, respectively, wherein individual eyepieces are retained by each auxiliary retaining mechanism <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>, respectively. According to one construction, a slit is provided in each auxiliary retaining mechanism <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> (not shown) to make the auxiliary retaining mechanism discontinuous to facilitate insertion and removal of lenses. A pair of ferrules are provided on opposite sides of such slit such that a threaded fastener is used to secure together the slit and close the auxiliary retaining mechanism, which serves to facilitate insertion, removal and retention of a lens within such auxiliary retaining mechanism. Further details of such construction are presently understood in the art and are omitted herein from this and other embodiments in order to avoid obscuring the invention at hand.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates auxiliary frame <b>208</b> of sunglass attachment <b>202</b> prior to aligned assembly with primary frame <b>110</b> of eyeglasses <b>104</b>.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates magnetic attachment of auxiliary frame <b>208</b> onto primary frame <b>110</b> so as to secure the sunglass attachment onto the eyeglasses. More particularly, the construction of rim flanges <b>134</b> is clearly seen overlying primary frame <b>110</b> to provide further additional support and alignment of auxiliary frame <b>208</b> onto primary frame <b>110</b>. Such physical overlying engagement supplements magnetic attachment provided by the magnetic alloy as used in the construction of auxiliary frame <b>208</b>. Accordingly, primary retention is imparted by the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>208</b> which imparts frictional engagement and results in magnetic attraction with the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>110</b>. Such magnetic engagement is further assured by the presence of rim flanges <b>134</b> interacting with the upper edge of primary frame <b>110</b>. Additionally, rim flanges <b>134</b> serve to further support auxiliary frame <b>208</b> atop primary frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-22</figref> illustrate a third embodiment auxiliary frame <b>308</b> that is magnetically and physically affixed to a primary frame <b>210</b> so as to form in assembly eyeglass device <b>300</b>. More particularly, an auxiliary frame <b>308</b> is constructed substantially identical to sunglass attachment <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, with the exception that a pair of outer slots <b>136</b> and a pair of inner slots <b>140</b> are formed in the rear surface of auxiliary frame <b>308</b> in order to provide interdigitating fit up with a front face of eyeglasses <b>204</b>. Eyeglasses <b>204</b> are similar to eyeglasses <b>104</b> illustrated variously in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-15</figref> and <b>23</b>-<b>27</b>. However, eyeglasses <b>204</b> include the additional features of a raised or forwardly extending leg end portion <b>144</b> that is provided on opposite ends by legs <b>223</b> and a pair of raised or forwardly extending arms <b>146</b> provided at opposite ends of bridge <b>122</b>. Raised leg end portions <b>144</b> and raised arms <b>146</b> are configured to extend forwardly of a respective, adjacent front face of primary frame <b>210</b> so as to provide interdigitating engagement with slots <b>136</b> and <b>140</b>, respectively, when assembled together as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, slot <b>136</b> of auxiliary frame <b>308</b> is sized and configured to nest in interdigitating engagement with raised leg end portion <b>144</b> as auxiliary frame <b>308</b> is brought into magnetic engagement and retention with primary frame <b>210</b>. Upon engagement-as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, slot <b>136</b> cooperates with raised leg end portion <b>144</b> to further facilitate alignment and fit up between auxiliary frame <b>308</b> and primary frame <b>210</b> when magnetically affixed therebetween. Accordingly, such interdigitating engagement further enhances the frictional retention that is imparted between auxiliary frame <b>308</b> and primary frame <b>210</b> as a result of the magnetic alloy of auxiliary frame <b>308</b> imparting magnetic affixation to the magnetizable material of primary frame <b>210</b>. Similarly, raised arms <b>146</b> engage in interdigitating relationship with slots <b>140</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) to further enhance aligned engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates attachment of auxiliary frame <b>308</b> onto primary frame <b>210</b> resulting from magnetic attraction therebetween (which causes frictional engagement), and further ensured by physical interdigitation of the slots, arms and leg end portions described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>. As was the case with the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-15</figref>, good physical abutment and fit up are preferably imparted between the magnetic alloy portions of auxiliary frame <b>308</b> and the magnetizable material portions of primary frame <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Preferably, the entire peripheral contact portion of auxiliary frame <b>308</b> is formed from a magnetic alloy such as spinodal decomposition alloy, and the entire leading contact surface of primary frame <b>210</b> is formed from a magnetizable material, such as a steel, stainless steel, or alloy that is capable of being physically attracted to a magnetic material when brought into close proximity thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates in greater detail the interlocking or interdigitating engagement provided between raised leg end portion <b>144</b> and slot <b>138</b>. It is understood that raised arms <b>146</b> similarly interdigitate with slots <b>140</b> and <b>142</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, substantially uniform and even fit up is imparted between retaining mechanism <b>130</b> of the primary frame and the auxiliary retaining mechanism <b>326</b> of the auxiliary frame. Since the auxiliary retaining mechanism <b>326</b> is frictionably engaged with the retaining mechanism <b>130</b> due to magnetic attraction therebetween, cooperation between the slots and raised arms or raised leg end portions, such as slot <b>136</b> and raised leg end portion <b>144</b>, aligns and locks together the sunglass attachment onto the eyeglass, thereby further ensuring that good fit up and magnetic attraction is imparted therebetween which enhances the magnetic retention, particularly when utilizing the resulting eyeglass device in relatively harsh environments.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-27</figref> illustrate the construction of a fourth embodiment sunglass attachment <b>402</b> that is magnetically affixed onto eyeglasses <b>104</b> (as shown in the first two embodiments) to form in assembly an eyeglass device <b>400</b>. More particularly, an auxiliary frame <b>408</b> of sunglass attachment <b>402</b> is provided with a pair of forked retention members <b>236</b>. Forked retention members <b>236</b> cooperate with legs <b>123</b> of primary frame <b>110</b> to further ensure retention of sunglass attachment <b>402</b> onto eyeglasses <b>104</b> when subjecting such eyeglass device <b>400</b> to harsh environments, such as when participating in sporting events, that are susceptible of jarring apart sunglass attachment <b>402</b> from eyeglasses <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, opposite outermost edges of auxiliary frame <b>408</b> each include a dedicated forked retention member <b>236</b> which cooperates with each leg <b>123</b> extending from primary frame <b>110</b> as auxiliary frame <b>408</b> is magnetically affixed onto primary frame <b>110</b>. When assembled together, forked retention members <b>236</b> serve to align sunglass attachment <b>402</b> onto eyeglasses <b>104</b> so as to impart optimal fit up therebetween and ensure magnetic attachment as a result thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> further illustrates the mounting and positioning of each forked retention member <b>236</b> on auxiliary frame <b>408</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-27</figref> illustrate in greater detail the enhanced retention provided by forked retention members <b>236</b> as they cooperate with eyeglasses <b>104</b> in assembly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, eyeglasses <b>104</b> are essentially identical to the first two embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-15</figref>, wherein a leg end portion <b>244</b> on each leg, or temple extension member, <b>123</b> is substantially flush with the front edge of primary frame <b>110</b>. Each forked retention member <b>236</b> is sized to wrap around a top and bottom edge of each leg end portion <b>144</b> to align auxiliary frame <b>408</b> onto primary frame <b>110</b> during mating engagement. Forked retention members <b>236</b> further maintain fit up and alignment during magnetic engagement between auxiliary frame <b>408</b> and primary frame <b>110</b>. Accordingly, such interdigitating engagement further ensures aligned, magnetized attachment of sunglass attachment <b>402</b> onto eyeglasses <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Accordingly, forked retention members <b>236</b> provide an alternative construction over that provided by the interdigitating engagement utilized in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-22</figref>, including raised leg end portions <b>144</b>, raised arms <b>146</b>, and slots <b>136</b> and <b>140</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, each forked retention member <b>236</b> includes an upper arm <b>147</b> and a lower arm <b>148</b> which are spaced apart sufficiently to receive leg end portion <b>144</b> therebetween.

Alternatively, arms <b>147</b> and <b>148</b> can be spaced apart so as to impart an interference fit with leg end portion <b>244</b> that provides additional holding power (above that provided solely by magnetic attachment) between sunglass attachment <b>402</b> and eyeglasses <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, auxiliary frame <b>408</b> is primarily affixed to primary frame <b>110</b> as a result of the magnetic attraction imparted by use of magnetic alloy in constructing auxiliary frame <b>408</b>, and utilization of a magnetizable material such as a steel alloy in constructing primary frame <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">To provide magnetic affixation, one of retention arms <b>336</b> and retention arm abutment surface <b>334</b> comprises a heat-treated magnetic alloy such as a spinodal decomposition alloy.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For the case where retention arms <b>336</b> comprise a heat-treated magnetic alloy and retention arm abutment surface <b>334</b> comprises magnetizable material, it is understood that auxiliary frame <b>508</b> and primary frame <b>310</b> might be formed from materials other than a heat-treated magnetic alloy and a magnetizable material. The same holds true for the case where retention arms <b>336</b> comprise magnetizable material and retention arm abutment surface <b>334</b> comprises a heat-treated magnetic alloy. According to such cases, magnetic attraction is imparted between sunglass attachment <b>502</b> and eyeglasses <b>304</b> based solely upon interaction between retention arms <b>336</b> and retention abutment surface <b>334</b>.
