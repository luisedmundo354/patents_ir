<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">High-strength fibers are used in many applications. For example, polymeric ropes are widely used in mooring and heavy lifting applications, including, for instance, oceanographic, marine, and offshore drilling applications. They are subjected to high tensile and bending stresses in use as well as a wide range of environmental challenges. These ropes are constructed in a variety of ways from various fiber types. For example, the ropes may be braided ropes, wire-lay ropes, or parallel strand ropes. Braided ropes are formed by braiding or plaiting bundle groups together as opposed to twisting them together. Wire-lay ropes are made in a similar manner as wire ropes, where each layer of twisted bundles is generally wound (laid) in the same direction about the center axis. Parallel strand ropes are an assemblage of bundle groups held together by a braided or extruded jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Component fibers in ropes used in mooring and heavy lifting applications include high modulus and high strength fibers such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers. DYNEEMA® and SPECTRA® brand fibers are examples of such fibers. Liquid crystal polymer (LCP) fibers such as liquid crystal aromatic polyester sold under the tradename VECTRAN® are also used to construct such ropes. Para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar® fiber, likewise, also have utility in such applications.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The service life of these ropes is compromised by one or more of three mechanisms. Fiber abrasion is one of the mechanisms. This abrasion could be fiber-to-fiber abrasion internally or external abrasion of the fibers against another object. The abrasion damages the fibers, thereby decreasing the life of the rope. LCP fibers are particularly susceptible to this failure mechanism. A second mechanism is another consequence of abrasion. As rope fibers abrade each other during use, such as when the rope is bent under tension against a pulley or drum, heat is generated. This internal heat severely weakens the fibers. The fibers are seen to exhibit accelerated elongation rates or to break (i.e., creep rupture) under load. The UHMWPE fibers suffer from this mode of failure. Another mechanism is a consequence of compression of the rope or parts of the rope where the rope is pulled taught over a pulley, drum, or other object.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various solutions to address these problems have been explored. These attempts typically involve fiber material changes or construction changes. The use of new and stronger fibers is often examined as a way to improve rope life. One solution involves the utilization of multiple types of fibers in new configurations. That is, two or more types of fibers are combined to create a rope. The different type fibers can be combined in a specific manner so as to compensate for the shortcoming of each fiber type. An example of where a combination of two or more fibers can provide property benefits are improved resistance to creep and creep rupture (unlike a 100% UHMWPE rope) and improved resistance to self-abrasion (unlike a 100% LCP rope). All such ropes, however, still perform inadequately in some applications, failing due to one or more of the three above-mentioned mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Rope performance is determined to a large extent by the design of the most fundamental building block used to construct the rope, the bundle of fibers. This bundle may include different types of fibers. Improving bundle life generally improves the life of the rope. The bundles have value in applications less demanding than the heavy-duty ropes described above. Such applications include lifting, bundling, securing, and the like. Attempts have been made to combine fiber materials in such repeated stress applications. For example, UHMWPE fibers and high strength fibers, such as LCP fibers, have been blended to create a large diameter rope with better abrasion resistance, but they are still not as effective as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The abrasion resistance of ropes for elevators has been improved by utilizing high modulus synthetic fibers, impregnating one or more of the bundles with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dispersion, or coating the fibers with PTFE powder. Typically such coatings wear off relatively quickly. Providing a jacket to the exterior of a rope or the individual bundles has also been shown to improve the rope life. Jackets add weight, bulk, and stiffness to the rope, however.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Fiberglass and PTFE have been commingled in order to extend the life of fiberglass fibers. These fibers have been woven into fabrics. The resultant articles possess superior flex life and abrasion resistance compared to fiberglass fibers alone. Heat-meltable fluorine-containing resins have been combined with fibers, in particular with cotton-like material fibers. The resultant fiber has been used to create improved fabrics. PTFE fibers have been used in combination with other fibers in dental floss and other low-load applications, but not in repeated stress applications described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In sum, none of the known attempts to improve the life of ropes or cable have provided sufficient durability in applications involving both bending and high tension. The ideal solution would benefit both heavy-duty ropes and smaller diameter configurations, such as bundles.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inventors have discovered that a relatively small weight percent of a fluoropolymer fiber added to a bundle of high strength fibers produces a surprisingly dramatic increase in abrasion resistance and wear life.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The high-strength fibers used to form ropes, cables, and other tensile members for use in repeated stress applications include ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) such as DYNEEMA® and SPECTRA® brand fibers, liquid crystal polymer (LCP) fibers such as those sold under the tradename VECTRAN®, other LCAPs, PBO, high performance aramid fibers, para-aramid fibers such as Kevlar® fiber, carbon fiber, nylon, and steel. Combinations of such fibers are also included, such as UHMWPE and LCP, which is typically used for ropes in oceanographic and other heavy lifting applications.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fluoropolymer fibers used in combination with any of the above fibers according to preferred embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (including expanded PTFE (ePTFE) and modified PTFE), fluorinated ethylenepropylene (FEP), ethylene-chlorotrif-luoroethylene (ECTFE), ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), or perfluoroalkoxy polymer (PFA). The fluoropolymer fibers include monofilament fibers, multifilament fibers, or both. Both high and low density fluoropolymer fibers may be used in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the fluoropolymer fiber typically has less strength than the high-strength fiber, the overall strength of the combined bundle is not significantly compromised by the addition of the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers (or replacement of the high strength fibers with the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers). Preferably, less than 10% strength reduction is observed after inclusion of the fluoropolymer fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fluoropolymer fibers are preferably combined with the high-strength fibers in an amount such that less than about 40% by weight of fluoropolymer fiber are present in the composite bundle. More preferable ranges include less than about 35% less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, and about 1%.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Surprisingly, even at these low addition levels, and with only a moderate (less than about 10%) reduction in strength, the composite bundles of the present invention show a dramatic increase in abrasion resistance and thus in wear life. In some cases, the ratio of break strengths after abrasion tests has exceeded 4.0, as illustrated by the examples presented below (See Table 3). Specifically, as demonstrated in Examples 1-4 below, the break force of a fiber bundle including PTFE and a high-strength fiber after a given number of abrasion testing cycles are dramatically higher than that of the high-strength fiber alone. The abrasion rates, therefore, are lower for PTFE fiber-containing composite bundles than for the same constructions devoid of PTFE fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Without being limited by theory, it is believed that it is the lubricity of the fluoropolymer fibers that results in the improved abrasion resistance of the composite bundles. In this aspect, the invention provides a method of lubricating a rope or fiber bundle by including a solid lubricous fiber to it.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fluoropolymer fibers optionally include fillers. Solid lubricants such as graphite, waxes, or even fluid lubricants like hydrocarbon oils or silicone oils may be used. Such fillers impart additional favorable properties to the fluoropolymer fibers and ultimately to the rope itself. For example, PTFE filled with carbon has improved thermal conductivity and is useful to improve the heat resistance of the fiber and rope. This prevents or at least retards the build-up of heat in the rope, which is one of the contributing factors to rope failure. Graphite or other lubricious fillers may be used to enhance the lubrication benefits realized by adding the fluoropolymer fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Any conventionally known method may be used to combine the fluoropolymer fibers with the high-strength fibers. No special processing is required. The fibers may be blended, twisted, braided, or simply co-processed together with no special combination processing. Typically the fibers are combined using conventional rope manufacturing processes known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inventors have also surprisingly found that not only does the addition of low friction polymer fibers to the synthetic rope greatly enhance fatigue life, but that the specific locations of low friction polymer fibers, tape and/or films within the rope can significantly impact the magnitude of this increase in fatigue life.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although blending of fluoropolymer fibers within ropes without particular attention to specific positioning within the rope significantly enhances fatigue life, the present inventors have discovered that specific positioning of the fluoropolymers within the rope structure offers the ability to even further enhance life.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention is illustrated. Rope <b>40</b> comprises a plurality of bundle groups <b>41</b>, each formed of bundles of fibers. Each bundle group <b>41</b> is wrapped with a low coefficient of friction fiber <b>42</b>, preferably expanded PTFE. Although each bundle group <b>41</b> is wrapped with a low coefficient of friction fiber <b>42</b> in the illustrated embodiment, any number of the bundle groups <b>41</b> could be so wrapped according to the invention, provided that at least one bundle group <b>41</b> is so wrapped. Alternatively, the bundles themselves may be wrapped with low coefficient of friction fiber <b>42</b>. The inventive rope may be made, for example using a Holly Board such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> according to methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that in enhancing fatigue life these low coefficient of friction fibers can work in a multiple of ways. This includes, but is not limited to, effectively providing a low friction wear resistant surface at key rope component interfaces, said low friction interfaces being key, while the form of the low friction material is less critical as long as the form provides persistence in the critical contact area.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The examples included herein show clearly that fluoropolymer fibers may be used to construct the low friction interface; however, other forms of fluoropolymers such as tape, film, and the like are also part of this invention. Other polymeric materials having a low coefficient of friction that are capable of being placed in the preferred positions and are capable of persistence are also contemplated as effective routes to enhanced fatigue performance. Suitable low friction polymers include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon polymers, halogen containing polymers, fluorine containing polymers, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylenechlorotrifluorethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytrifluoroethylene, blends, and copolymers, with fluorinated polymers being preferred and polytetrafluoroethylene being most preferred. The strongest fiber versions of the above polymers, with strength typically being attained by orienting the polymer in the longitudinal fiber direction, may have effective persistence under high stress conditions and therefore providing the most enhanced fatigue performance. Examples of these stronger fiber materials can be found in gel spun polyethylene and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. The low coefficient of friction fiber used herein is alternatively formed in a core-shell configuration, or is itself a composite material. It excludes woven materials however (i.e., the fiber is not part of a woven structure).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although again not wishing to be bound by theory, the low friction materials placed at key areas can act to reduce, delay, or eliminate heat generation, reduce, delay, or eliminate abrasion damage and reduce, delay, or eliminate the loss of strength in high strength fibers and rope elements that may accompany heat and abrasion and shear stresses. Reduction, delay, or elimination of compressive and shear induced damage in those high strength fibers known to be sensitive, such as in aramid fibers, is also a contemplated effect of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Since the damaging effects of friction are a function of the magnitude of the normal stress of one bundle group against another, and since the low friction materials can also lead to adjustment of the shape of the bundle groups perpendicular to the normal stress such that the area of contact between the elements is increased, the normal stress is then decreased, and therefore the damaging effects of the friction are further mediated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferred locations for these low friction materials are at interfaces between elements within the rope that are in contact with each other and move or slide relative to one another when the rope is stressed or bent.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">These elements are defined in a hierarchical scheme within the rope structure starting at the fiber level where fibers may move relative to one another, the bundle level where bundles may move relative to one another, bundle group level where bundle groups may move relative to one another, and the rope itself, where the rope may move relative to itself in a crossover or relative to other ropes in a rope system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since the amount of this low friction fiber, tape and/or film required to enhance life is minimal with respect to the volume or mass of the rope, the low friction polymer need not have high strength or modulus such that it contribute a priori to initial rope strength, a restriction that in the past has limited the choice of rope component fibers to a selection from very high strength fibers. Surprisingly, fibers that are not considered high strength fibers may be used to improve fatigue performance. The low friction sliding elements, created through placement of the low friction polymers at key locations, are better able to share load such that the tensile strength of the rope is typically higher than one would expect with the replacement of some high strength components with low strength fibers and components.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Rope performance has historically been tuned with the use of coatings applied at the fiber, bundle, bundle group, or rope levels. Coatings formulated for abrasion resistance have been reported. Many of these coatings appear to reduce abrasion damage by acting as a lubricant, facilitating bending with less abrasion damage. These coatings are applied in liquid or powder form prior to, during, or after rope manufacture. Such coatings are expected to perform in concert with the subject invention, with the potential for significant enhancement of rope performance and life, especially in bending applications. The ropes of this invention are particularly useful in a deep sea hardware delivery systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the examples presented below, abrasion resistance and wear life are tested on various fiber bundles. The results are indicative of the effects seen in ropes constructed from the bundles of the present invention, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Specifically, abrasion rate is used to demonstrate abrasion resistance. The wear life is demonstrated by certain examples in which the fiber bundles (with and without the inventive combination of fluoropolymer fibers) are cycled to failure. The results are reported as cycles to failure. More detail of the tests is provided below.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Mass Per Unit Length and Tensile Strength Measurements</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The weight per unit length of each individual fiber was determined by weighing a 9 m length sample of the fiber using a Denver Instruments. Inc. Model AA160 analytical balance and multiplying the mass, expressed in grams, by 1000 thereby expressing results in the units of denier. With the exception of Examples 6a and 6b, all tensile testing was conducted at ambient temperature on a tensile test machine (Zellweger USTER® TENSORAPID 4, Uster, Switzerland) equipped with pneumatic fiber grips, utilizing a gauge length of 350 mm and a cross-head speed of 330 mm/min. The strain rate, therefore, was 94.3%/min. For Examples 6a and 6b, tensile testing was conducted at ambient temperature on an INSTRON 5567 tensile test machine (Canton, Mass.) equipped with pneumatic horseshoe fiber grips, again utilizing a gauge length of 350 mm, a cross-head speed of 330 mm/min and, hence, a strain rate of 94.3%/min. The peak force, which refers to the break strength of the fiber, was recorded. Four samples were tested and their average break strength was calculated. The average tenacity of the individual fiber sample expressed in g/d was calculated by dividing the average break strength expressed in grams by the denier value of the individual fiber. In the case of testing composite bundles or bundle groups, the average tenacity of these samples was calculated by dividing the average break strength of the composite bundle or bundle group (in units of grams), by the weight per length value of the composite bundle or bundle group (expressed in units of denier). The denier value of the composite bundle or bundle group can be determined by measuring the mass of the sample or by summing the denier values of the individual components of the sample.</p>

The thickness of the fiber sample was then measured at 3 points along the fiber using an AMES (Waltham, Mass., USA) Model LG3600 thickness gauge. The width of the fiber was also measured at 3 points along the same fiber sample using an LP-6 Profile Projector available from Ehrenreich Photo Optical Ind. Inc. Garden City, N.Y. Average values of thickness and width were then calculated and the volume of the fiber sample was determined (D). The density of the fiber sample was calculated as follows:

Abrasion Resistance Measurement
</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The abrasion test was adapted from ASTM Standard Test Method for Wet and Dry Yarn-on-Yarn Abrasion Resistance (Designation D 6611-00). This test method applies to the testing of yarns used in the construction of ropes, in particular, in ropes intended for use in marine environments.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The test apparatus is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with three pulleys <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> arranged on a vertical frame <b>24</b>. Pulleys <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> were 22.5 mm in diameter. The centerlines of upper pulleys <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> were separated by a distance of 140 mm. The centerline of the lower pulley <b>22</b> was 254 mm below a horizontal line connecting the upper pulley <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> centerlines. A motor <b>25</b> and crank <b>26</b> were positioned as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An extension rod <b>27</b> driven by the motor-driven crank <b>26</b> through a bushing <b>28</b> was employed to displace the test sample <b>30</b> a distance of 50.8 mm as the rod <b>27</b> moved forward and back during each cycle. A cycle comprised a forward and back stroke. A digital counter (not shown) recorded the number of cycles. The crank speed was adjustable within the range of 65 and 100 cycles per minute.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A weight <b>31</b> (in the form of a plastic container into which various weights could be added) was tied to one end of sample <b>30</b> in order to apply a prescribed tension corresponding to 1.5% of the average break strength of the test sample <b>30</b>. The sample <b>30</b>, while under no tension, was threaded over the third pulley <b>23</b>, under the second pulley <b>22</b>, and then over the first pulley <b>21</b>, in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Tension was then applied to the sample <b>30</b> by hanging the weight <b>31</b> as shown in the figure. The other end of the sample <b>30</b> was then affixed to the extension rod <b>27</b> attached to the motor crank <b>26</b>. The rod <b>27</b> had previously been positioned to the highest point of the stroke, thereby ensuring that the weight <b>31</b> providing the tension was positioned at the maximum height prior to testing. The maximum height was typically 6-8 cm below the centerline of the third pulley <b>23</b>. Care was taken to ensure that the fiber sample <b>30</b> was securely attached to the extension rod <b>27</b> and weight <b>31</b> in order to prevent slippage during testing.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The test sample <b>30</b> while still under tension was then carefully removed from the second, lower, pulley <b>22</b>. A cylinder (not shown) of approximately 27 mm diameter was placed in the cradle formed by the sample <b>30</b> and then turned 180° to the right in order to effect a half-wrap to the sample <b>30</b>. The cylinder was turned an additional 180° to the right to complete a full 360° wrap. The twisting was continued in 180° increments until the desired number of wraps was achieved. The cylinder was then carefully removed while the sample <b>30</b> was still under tension and the sample <b>30</b> was replaced around the second pulley <b>22</b>. By way of example, three complete wraps (3×360°) for a fiber sample <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The only deviation from the twist direction during wrapping would arise in the case of the sample being a twisted multifilament. In this case, the direction of this twist direction must be in the same direction as the inherent twist of the multifilament fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In tests in which the test sample consists of two or more individual fibers, including at least one fiber of fluoropolymer, the following modified procedure was followed. After securing the test sample to the weight, the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers were placed side by side to the other fibers without twisting. Unless stated otherwise, the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers were always placed closest to the operator. The subsequent procedure for wrapping the fibers was otherwise identical to that outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Once the test setup was completed, the cycle counter was set to zero, the crank speed was adjusted to the desired speed, and the gear motor was started. After the desired number of cycles was completed, the gear motor was stopped and the abraded test sample was removed from the weight and the extension rod. Each test was performed four times.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The abraded test samples were then tensile tested for break strength and the results were averaged. The average tenacity was calculated using the average break strength value and the total weight per unit length value of the fiber or composite bundle sample.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one example, the abrasion test continued until the fiber or composite bundle completely broke under the tension applied. The number of cycles were noted as the cycles to failure of the sample. In this example, three samples were tested and the average cycles to failure calculated.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An ePTFE monofilament fiber was obtained (HT400d Rastex® fiber, W.L. Gore and Associates, Inc., Elkton Md.). This fiber possessed the following properties: 425 d weight per unit length, 2.29 kg break force, 5.38 g/d tenacity and 1.78 g/cc density. The LCP fiber had a weight per unit length of 1567 d, a 34.55 kg break force, and a tenacity of 22.0 g/d.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The two fiber types were combined by simply holding them so that they were adjacent to one another. That is, no twisting or other means of entangling was applied. The weight percentages of these two fibers when combined were 79% LCP and 21% ePTFE. The weight per unit length of the composite bundle was 1992 d. The break force of the composite bundle was 33.87 kg. The tenacity of the composite bundle was 17.0 g/d. Adding the single ePTFE fiber to the LCP changed the weight per unit length, break force, and tenacity by +27%, −2%, and −23%, respectively. Note that the decrease in break force associated with the addition of the ePTFE monofilament fiber was attributed to the variability of the strength of the fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">These fiber properties, as well as those of all the fibers used in Examples 2 through 8, are presented in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0139">The ropes were made using a 6×9 wire-rope construction with a load bearing core. The cross section of the rope is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The outer diameter of the ropes was 0.75 in. The break strength of this rope is approximately 48300 lbs. The ropes were assembled from Twaron type 1000, denier of 3024, and 2000 filaments (Teijin Twaron Westervoortsedijk 73 P.O. Box 9600, 6800 TC Arnhem, The Netherlands).</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0141">The “rope core bundle groups”, labeled <b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, were helically laid together from three type B bundle groups. The rope core bundle group labeled <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> was then assembled by helically laying the three rope core bundle groups together.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">The “outer bundle groups”, labeled <b>53</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, were helically laid together from three type A strands. Outer bundle groups, labeled <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, were then assembled by helically laying or closing 6 type B bundle groups around the core.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0143">The rope labeled <b>55</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> was then assembled by helically laying or closing the outer bundle groups around the rope core bundle group. The assembled rope was then enclosed by a braided polyester jacket.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0145">The rope prepared as above was then tested using the following test and conditions: Bend over sheave test, 25% breaking load (12000 lbs) of the control rope, 500 cycles/hour, 1.1 ft/sec rope speed, 4 ft stroke length, and D:d of 20.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0146">Two rope specimens were cycled to failure, 2787 and 3200 machine cycles respectively. A section of the rope called the double bend zone went on and off of the sheave twice during one machine cycle.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0152">Ropes were prepared as in Comparative Example 1 with two exceptions. One twaron bundle was omitted from each fundamental bundle groups A and B. Prior to final assembly of the rope PTFE fibers were laid or closed around the outside of the rope core bundle group and outer bundle group. To accomplish this six 500 denier (3a) or twelve 250 denier (3b) PTFE fibers were wound with one 1500 Denier Kevlar 39 yarn onto bobbins. The PTFE fibers and carrier Kevlar (Dupont, 5401 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, Va. 23234 ) were then helically laid around the outside of the respective outer bundle group or core bundle group with a 1 inch lay length.

<heading id="h-0035" level="1">Vectran Control Braid</heading>
<p id="p-0151" num="0158">Ropes were prepared from 12 equivalent bundle groups of one hundred and twenty 1500 denier Vectran T97 bundles (Kurary America Inc., 101 East 52nd Street, 26th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022). Bundle groups were assembled by paying off the vectran bundles from a creel to the first 120 holes from the center of a 237 hole holly board shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Six bundle groups were twisted in the S and six bundle groups were twisted in the Z direction. These 12 bundle groups were then braided on a 12 bundle group braider in a 2/2 regular braid at 1.18 picks/inch. The outer diameter of the finished rope measured under 100 lbs of reference tension was approximately 0.75 inches. The average break strength of the finished control ropes was 84,500 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0159">The rope prepared as above was then tested using the following test and conditions:</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0160">Bend over sheave test, 18% breaking load (15,210 lbs) of the control rope, 500 cycles/hour, 1.1 ft/sec rope speed, 4 ft stroke length, and D:d of 20. Two rope specimens were cycled to failure, 1001 and 960 cycles respectively. A section of the rope called the double bend zone went on and off of the sheave twice during one machine cycle.</p>
<heading id="h-0036" level="1">Comparative Example 4 </heading>
<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Braid Rope with PTFE Homogenously Distributed</heading>
<p id="p-0154" num="0161">Ropes were prepared as in Comparative Example 3 with the addition of PTFE fibers as described in table 3. For this example only one hundred and two vectran yarns were used with fifty four 500 denier or one hundred and eight 250 denier PTFE fibers. The PTFE fibers and vectran bundles were alternated around the circumference of a given ring of holes in the holly board. In Comparative example 4a, the 500 denier PTFE fibers were alternated to fill every third hole in the sequence vectran yarn, vectran yarn, PTFE fiber. Two ropes were tested. In Comparative examples 4b and 4c, 250 denier fibers were alternated with the vectran yarns to fill every other hole in the holly board. One rope of type 4b was tested and two ropes of 4c were tested. The outer diameters of the finished ropes measured under 100 lbs of reference tension were approximately 0.75 inches.</p>
