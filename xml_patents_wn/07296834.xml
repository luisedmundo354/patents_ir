<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a material handling tool for simultaneously handling a multitude of workpieces. The tool is powered by vacuum generated within the tool itself.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Disclosure Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The simultaneous processing of multiple workpieces presents interesting design challenges to the designers of material handling machines. These challenges are particularly mettlesome in the case of metallic and nonmetallic containers of the end-consumer types used for soft drinks and other canned and bottled goods. Such containers present a challenge to the designers of automated material handling equipment because the containers must be handled at various points during manufacturing, storage, and distribution, in both in the full and empty states. Needless to say, all handling must be done without crushing or otherwise injuring the containers. Moreover, it is frequently desirable to handle a large number of containers simultaneously so as to increase throughput on a given process line. Although fixed automation has been used to attain this goal, the lack of flexibility in terms of the ability to handle a variety of containers or other workpieces provokes the additional expense of purpose-built machinery.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Vacuum has been used to hold containers and other workpieces to end of arm tools mounted upon robot arms in the past, but such vacuum devices have not generally proven to be satisfactory because known devices generally used a single vacuum source, which if impaired, would render the entire device nonfunctional. Another problem with known vacuum devices resided in the fact that if integrity of the vacuum system were to become impaired, vacuum would be lost for the entire tool, as opposed to a portion of the tool. A tool according to the present invention solves these problems, while providing the flexibility to handle a widely differing array of workpieces, such as single serving beverage containers and packaged good of various sizes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An air powered vacuum tool for handling multiple workpieces includes a plurality of vacuum ports formed in a vacuum manifold body, and a plurality of air-powered vacuum generators operatively connected with the vacuum manifold body, such that each of the vacuum ports is provided with vacuum. As used herein, the term “workpiece” means, without limitation, either an object which must be picked up or otherwise moved by a machine, or a food or beverage container, or a grouping of objects, such as containers, and a package containing the grouping.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A plurality of pickup orifices adapted for engaging workpieces is provided in a tool according to the present invention. Each of the pickup orifices is operatively connected with at least one of the vacuum ports. The vacuum ports are formed such that at least some of the ports are not in fluid communication with all others of the ports, and at least one of the vacuum ports is formed such that it is not in fluid communication with any other of the ports. At least one of the vacuum ports is provided with vacuum by a dedicated one of the vacuum generators which provides vacuum only to a single vacuum port. In order to remove the workpieces from the vacuum tool in an expedited manner, at least one common blow-off manifold conducts high pressure air to more than one of the vacuum ports, which serves to expel the workpieces from the vacuum ports.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present air-powered vacuum tool may be mounted upon a robot such as at the end of a robot arm, or upon a transfer machine. According to another aspect of the present invention, a plurality of vacuum generators is supplied with high pressure air by a plurality of air supply manifolds mounted to a baseplate of the vacuum tool, with the air supply manifolds being isolated so that at least some of the vacuum generators may be powered selectively. This permits groups of vacuum ports to be powered, while others remain unpowered, so as to allow only a portion of the vacuum tool of the present invention to be employed. Thus, the vacuum ports may be divided into a plurality of groupings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an advantage of the present invention that multiple vacuum generators allow the present air-powered vacuum tool to operate satisfactorily even if one or more of the vacuum generators is not functioning properly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another advantage of the present invention that the use of selectively powered vacuum generators allows a portion of the present vacuum tool to be employed without the need of powering the entirety of the vacuum tool.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further advantage of the present invention considerable lifting capacity may be developed without injuring individual workpieces, particularly either empty or full drink containers.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another advantage of the present invention that an air-powered vacuum tool may be readily changed over to handle or otherwise accommodate various sizes of containers or other workpieces.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other advantages, as well as objects and features of the present invention, will become apparent to the reader of this specification.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, air-powered vacuum tool <b>10</b> is mounted upon robot arm <b>18</b>. Thus, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is an End of Arm Tool (“EOAT”). Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, air-powered vacuum tool <b>10</b> may be mounted upon a transfer machine, <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows air-powered vacuum tool <b>10</b> as having a plurality of cartons <b>24</b> attached by vacuum thereto, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a plurality of containers <b>26</b> or other workpieces attached thereto. An air-powered vacuum tool according to the present invention has been successfully tested with 580 soft drink cans accommodated on a vacuum tool having an overall dimension of about 56 ins. by 68 ins.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows that various components of air-powered vacuum tool <b>10</b> are mounted upon an upper portion of baseplate <b>28</b>. In essence, baseplate <b>28</b> functions as a platform upon which various other components of the present air-powered vacuum tool may be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moving now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the overall architecture of the present air-powered vacuum tool will be discussed. At the center of the air-powered vacuum tool <b>10</b>, mounting flange <b>16</b> provides a structure for attaching the air-powered vacuum tool to a robot, or transfer machine, or other device. Workpiece stabilizers <b>90</b> are provided at opposite ends of baseplate <b>28</b>. The purpose of workpiece stabilizers <b>90</b> is to engage stray workpieces during and immediately following a blowoff or disengagement of workpieces from vacuum tool <b>10</b>. Each of workpiece stabilizers <b>90</b> includes a rod-like element <b>90</b><i>a </i>which is pivotably attached to baseplate <b>28</b> such that elements <b>90</b><i>a </i>maybe swung down to prevent loose workpieces from toppling over when they are released from vacuum tool <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows many additional details of a configuration of an exemplary air-powered vacuum tool for handling multiple workpieces according to the present invention. In order to generate the required vacuum, high pressure air having a pressure in the range of 45 to 90 psi is provided by solenoid air supply valves <b>82</b>, which are electrically controlled, and which send air through a plurality of air lines <b>84</b> to multiple air supply manifolds <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Air supply manifolds <b>44</b> extend laterally across baseplate <b>28</b> and are divided both longitudinally and laterally. A longitudinally extending bulkhead, <b>55</b>, divides each of air supply manifolds <b>44</b> into an air supply port, <b>60</b>, and a vacuum plenum, <b>62</b>. This is shown with particularity in upper most portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which also shows a vacuum generator <b>46</b>. The plurality of vacuum generators <b>46</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> receives high pressure air from air supply port <b>60</b>. The supply air passes through a vacuum venturi section <b>54</b> of each vacuum generator <b>46</b>, wherein a vacuum is formed. This then pulls a vacuum on vacuum plenum <b>62</b>. Thereafter, the air exits from vacuum generators <b>46</b> via outlets <b>56</b>. The inventors of the present invention have determined that an air-powered, venturi vacuum generator sold under the brand name “PIAB” and having a model designation PI12-13 is satisfactory for use in an air-powered vacuum tool according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, vacuum plenum <b>62</b> communicates by vacuum transfer passages <b>66</b> to vacuum ports <b>32</b> which are formed in vacuum manifold body <b>30</b>. The vacuum manifold body, <b>30</b>, is abuttingly attached to the underside of baseplate <b>28</b>. Vacuum within vacuum ports <b>32</b> is communicated by means of a plurality of vacuum supply passages <b>70</b> to a plurality of pickup orifices <b>72</b>. The pickup orifices are formed within workpiece interface plate <b>74</b> which is attached to the underside of baseplate <b>76</b>. It has been determined the by the inventors of the present invention that the workplace interface plate <b>74</b> may be advantageously formed by high pressure water jet forming of an elastomeric plate. Pickup orifices <b>72</b> are shown as engaging cylindrical workpieces <b>80</b>, which may, for example, be either cylindrical containers, or bottle caps, or other cylindrical items. Because pickup orifices <b>72</b> are easily formed by cutting of workpiece interface plate <b>74</b>, the sizes and shapes of pickup orifices <b>72</b> may readily be changed to accommodate workpieces having a variety of sizes, shapes, and weights.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and specifically with reference to air supply manifold <b>44</b>, it is seen that each of air supply manifolds <b>44</b> has a plurality of laterally extending bulkheads <b>58</b>, which serve to isolate portion of air supply manifolds <b>44</b>. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, some of vacuum ports <b>32</b> formed in vacuum manifold body <b>30</b> are not interconnected and because of the use of bulkheads <b>58</b>, at least some of vacuum generators <b>46</b> may be dedicated to individual ones of vacuum ports <b>32</b>. This allows a tool according to the present invention to continue in operation if some of the vacuum generators become impaired or otherwise deactivated. For example, groupings of vacuum ports are shown at <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Each of vacuum port groupings <b>34</b>-<b>42</b> are independently controlled by means of air valves <b>46</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, if vacuum port groups <b>34</b>-<b>42</b> are not needed, vacuum generators <b>46</b><i>a, b, c, d </i>and <i>e </i>may be shut off from the tool's air supply by de-energizing appropriate solenoid air supply valve <b>82</b>. As noted above, vacuum manifold body <b>30</b> may advantageously be formed from elastomeric material which is water jet cut in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> additionally shows a pair of blow-off manifolds <b>86</b> which are fed by blow-off control valve <b>88</b>. Valve <b>88</b> is attached to a source of high pressure compressed air (not shown), and feeds air through lines <b>89</b> to blow-off manifolds <b>86</b>. Blow-off manifolds <b>86</b> are in communication with all of vacuum ports <b>32</b>-<b>42</b>, and when valve <b>88</b> is opened, the resulting rush of high pressure air will forcibly remove any workpieces which are resident in pickup orifices <b>72</b> of workpiece interface plate <b>74</b>. In this manner, workpiece interface plate <b>74</b> and pickup orifices <b>72</b> may be constructed so as to robustly engage workpieces, without having workpieces undesirably “hung up” or retained to interface plate <b>74</b> once tool <b>10</b> has come to a desired end location and all vacuum generators <b>46</b> have been shut off by means of air valves <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An air-powered vacuum tool according to the present invention offers a significant advantage in terms of flexibility, as compared with fixed tooling, inasmuch as the configuration of the present tool, in terms of its capability to pick up objects of varying sizes, weights and numbers, may be easily changed by removing and replacing base <b>76</b> and workpiece interface plate <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the present invention has been described in connection with particular embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that various modifications, alterations, and adaptations may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention set forth in the following claims.</p>
