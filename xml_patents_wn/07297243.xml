<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A microfabricated device employing a bridging membrane and methods for electrokinetic transport of a liquid phase biological or chemical material using the same are described. The bridging membrane is deployed in or adjacent to a microchannel and permits either ionic current flow or the transport of gas species, while inhibiting the bulk flow of material. The use of bridging membranes in accordance with this invention is applicable to a variety of processes, including electrokinetically induced pressure flow in a region of a microchannel that is not influenced by an electric field, sample concentration enhancement and injection, as well as improving the analysis of materials where it is desired to eliminate electrophoretic bias. Other applications of the bridging membranes according to this invention include the separation of species from a sample material, valving of fluids in a microchannel network, mixing of different materials in a microchannel, and the pumping of fluids.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to microchip designs for the electrokinetic manipulation of fluidic chemical and biological materials. More specifically, this invention provides a microchip device which utilizes electrokinetic forces for the transport of materials through microchannels. The microchip device of this invention includes a membrane between adjacent or intersecting microchannels for passing ionic current while inhibiting bulk fluid flow.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to facilitate the development of the biological and chemical sciences, microchip technologies are increasingly utilized to perform traditional chemical laboratory functions within a controlled microfabricated environment. These “on-chip” laboratories facilitate the precise transport and analysis of fluidic chemical and biological materials. Specifically, the decreased dimensions of the microchip devices provide integration of electronic and chemical processing technology while simultaneously yielding increased speed in analysis, reduction in reagent and/or sample consumption, and improved control in the automation of material manipulations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Microfabricated devices that integrate chemical reactions with rapid analysis time have significant applications for high-throughput drug screening, automated analysis, and clinical chemistry. Microchips are characterized by reduced analysis time and reagent consumption, ease of automation, and valveless fluid control of sub-nanoliter volumes. A variety of electrically driven separations have been performed within microchannel networks. Microchips have also been developed for controlling chemical reactions, including arrays for solid-phase chemistry, reaction wells for polymerase chain reactions, channels with immobilized enzymes for flow injection analysis, and manifolds for homogenous enzyme assays. A microfluidic device using electrokinetic mixing of the organic solvents and reagents for the formation of an azo dye has been demonstrated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ability to design and machine channel manifolds with low-volume connections renders microchips suitable for combining several steps of an analytical process on one device. Microchips that combine chemical reactions with the speed and scale of CE analysis have been demonstrated for pre- and post-separation reactions, for DNA restriction digests with fragment sizing, and for cell lysis, multiplex PCR amplification and electrophoretic sizing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Presently, chemical and biological materials are transported on microchips by way of electrokinetic techniques or an external pumping apparatus. The use of an external pumping apparatus is disfavored, however, because it demands additional hardware that is bulky and difficult to interface with the microchips. On the other hand, electrokinetic techniques, i.e., electroosmotically_induced fluid flow or electrophoretic migration of ions, are the preferred methods of manipulating biological and chemical materials on microchip devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Electroosmosis is the bulk flow of fluid due to the combined effects of an electrical double layer in the presence of an axial electrical field. See, e.g., C. L. Rice and R. Whitehead, “Electrokinetic Flow in a Narrow Cylindrical Capillary”, J. of Phys. Chem. (1965). The high density of ions in the diffuse region of the double layer are pulled electrostatically by the electric field along the walls of the channel. The layer of ions acts like a sleeve that is being pulled along the wall which adds momentum to the fluid by viscous drag. Under steady state conditions, which are reached in a microsecond timescale for the dimensions discussed herein, all fluid which is farther from the wall than the diffuse region are traveling at the same velocity. For example, water at pH 8 in a glass microchannel would travel at a velocity of ≅1 cm/s with an electric field strength of ≅1 kV/cm. Electrophoresis is the velocity imparted to an ion in_solution when exposed to an electric field. The velocity of the ion is determined by the charge of the ion, the electric field strength, the viscosity of the solvent and the hydrodynamic radius of the ion. The direction of the ion movement depends on the direction of the electric field vector and the polarity of the charge on the ion. Electrophoresis necessarily only transports charged species. Electroosmosis imparts a velocity to all ions and neutral species. Under conditions where both electroosmosis and electrophoresis are operative, the net velocity of an ion will be the vector sum of the electroosmotic and electrophoretic_velocities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Electrokinetic transport mechanisms have been highly effective for demonstrating a number of highly useful experiments as identified above. A deficiency of presently demonstrated devices is the inability to make electrical contacts directly within microchannels. Efforts have been made to make such electrical contacts using a metal film that is photolithographically deposited onto a glass substrate so as to make contact with the fluidic microchannels. Such electrodes produce electrolysis products, most notably, oxygen and hydrogen gas from water, in all cases except under very limited conditions. The formation of a gas bubble can quickly separate the fluid in a microchannel and produces a nonconducting region which hinders the electrokinetic transport mechanisms.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A microfabricated device in accordance with the present invention is described in connection with several embodiments of microchannel networks utilizing a bridging membrane that is operable to pass ionic current, but minimize bulk fluid flow or transport of larger molecules, e.g. DNA. The bridging membrane allows electrical connection to fluidic microchannels without the problems related to electrolysis. This capability enables a number of important fluidic manipulations to be realized on microfabricated structures designed for the analysis and synthesis of chemical and biochemical materials.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A device in accordance with the present invention is particularly useful in connection with the analysis or processing of materials which are affected by electrophoretic bias. For example, post electrophoretic separation derivatization of a sample with a reagent would benefit from the devices of the subject invention. Also, the microfabricated device of the present invention permits electrochemical detection schemes in which a detection cell needs to be isolated from the electric field that facilitates transport of the sample material.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A device according to this invention uses the electroosmotic phenomenon to drive fluids, but includes a bridging membrane to isolate electric fields generated in the channels of the microfabricated device. The bridging membrane permits ionic current or gas to pass but minimizes or restricts bulk fluid flow. In a first embodiment, the bridging membrane provides a connection between a first channel and a second channel carrying materials to be analyzed or processed. One application of this configuration involves using the bridging membrane in a fluidic microchip for facilitating DNA concentration enhancement.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A second embodiment includes a first channel which is filled with a polyacrylamide gel as the bridging membrane. The gel is disposed in the first channel adjacent to the second or analysis channel of the microfabricated device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A third embodiment utilizes the bridging membrane to facilitate sample loading and injection procedures such that electrochemically generated byproducts in the sample are minimized. A second application of a device according to this invention uses a bridging membrane for separating or purifying a sample material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A fourth embodiment includes a channel with a thin film electrode and a bridging membrane which facilitate the removal of electrochemically generated gas species from the microfabricated channel.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additional applications employ bridging membranes to pump liquids or gases through microchannels. A further application employs bridging membranes to effect valving in microfluidic structures. Still further applications of this invention utilize bridging membranes for generating elevated pressures in a microchannel or to effect mixing of materials in a microchannel.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Adjacent Channel Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>1</b>A, and <b>1</b>B there is shown a microfabricated device labeled <b>5</b>A in accordance with the present invention. Device <b>5</b>A is fabricated from a solid substrate material <b>10</b>. Glass is a preferred substrate material because it etches isotopically. However, silicon may be use instead because of the well developed technology permitting its precise and efficient fabrication. Also, other materials such as polymers, quartz, fused silica, sapphire, or plastics may be used. A series of microchannels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>A, <b>25</b>B, <b>30</b>A, and <b>30</b>B are formed in the top surface of the substrate <b>10</b> for facilitating the electroosmotic transport of biological and chemical materials. The microchannels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>30</b>A, and <b>30</b>B intersect at a channel junction <b>130</b>. Microchannel <b>25</b> interconnects side channels <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B adjacent to analysis microchannel <b>20</b>B. A cover plate <b>15</b> appropriately affixed over the top surface of the substrate <b>10</b> seals the microfabricated surface of device <b>5</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The microchip device <b>5</b>A is fabricated using micromachining methods known to those skilled in the art. The micromachining methods available include film deposition processes such as spin coating and chemical vapor deposition, laser fabrication or photolithographic techniques such as UV or X-ray processes, or etching methods which may be performed by either wet chemical processes or plasma processes. Preferably, the microchannels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>A, <b>25</b>B, <b>30</b>A, and <b>30</b>B are formed on substrate <b>10</b> using a positive photoresist, photomask, and UV exposure. The channels are etched into the substrate <b>10</b> in a dilute, stirred HF/NH4F bath.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Cover plate <b>15</b> is bonded to the substrate <b>10</b> over the etched microchannels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>A, <b>25</b>B, <b>30</b>A, and <b>30</b>B by hydrolyzing the surfaces, spin-coating sodium silicate or potassium silicate onto the cover plate <b>15</b>, bringing the substrate and cover plate into contact with each other, and then processing the assembly at temperatures typically ranging from about room temperature up to about 500° C. A suitable procedure is described in our copending application Ser. No. 08/645,497, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Microchip device <b>5</b>A, includes a first waste reservoir <b>35</b>, a buffer reservoir <b>40</b>, a sample reservoir <b>45</b>, a second waste reservoir <b>50</b>, and first and second side reservoirs <b>55</b> and <b>60</b>. The reservoirs are bonded to the substrate <b>10</b> over the terminal ends of micro-channels <b>30</b>A, <b>20</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>20</b>B, <b>25</b>A, and <b>25</b>B, respectively. The reservoirs of microchip device <b>5</b>A are storage cells for liquid phase biological and chemical materials. The reservoirs supply materials for fluidic transport through the microfabricated channels.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a high voltage power supply <b>125</b> is connected to the reservoirs of device <b>5</b>A to provide electric potentials thereto. A plurality of platinum wire electrodes <b>124</b> electrically connect the power supply <b>125</b> to the reservoirs of the microchip device <b>5</b>A and contact the materials contained therein. The high voltage power supply <b>125</b> may be formed from a plurality of independent voltage sources or as a single voltage source and voltage divider network with a plurality of output terminals each providing a different voltage level. The electrokinetic driving forces are created by providing a potential difference between the various reservoirs in a controlled manner. Applied potentials on electrokinetically driven microchips are typically 1-3 kV, but can be higher or lower and the desired polarity depends on the experimental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Microchip device <b>5</b>A as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> has a bridging membrane <b>65</b> (i.e., a thin electrically conductive porous glass layer) between microchannel <b>20</b>B and channel <b>25</b>. The microchip <b>5</b>A has two channels in close proximity to each other. The distance between adjacent channels will vary depending on the etch time used to form the channels in the substrate, 0-35 μm bridges are typical. In the case of glass for example, the etch is isotropic so the longer the etch the closer the two channels come to physically connecting. Also, a low temperature bonding technique is used in order to generate a thin porous layer between the cover plate <b>15</b> and the substrate <b>10</b> at the bridging membrane junction <b>65</b>. For microchip <b>5</b>A, the preferred channel separation distance between channel <b>20</b>B and channel <b>25</b> is about 6 μm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross-sectional profile of an embodiment of channels <b>20</b>B and <b>25</b>, cover plate <b>15</b>, and bridging membrane <b>65</b>. The depth and width of the channels were determined with a stylus profilometer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">There are several potential alternative methods for forming a bridging membrane between two adjacent channels such as described for device <b>5</b>A. The adjacent channels can be formed in sufficiently close proximity and the cover plate fixed to the substrate using a conventional high temperature bonding procedure. An electrical potential of sufficient strength can then be applied to the channels on opposite sides of the bridging membrane to thereby form electrical breakdown channels. Such breakdown channels provide a path for electrical conduction but have dimensions near that of the electrical double layer responsible for electroosmotic flow. Such channels are less efficient in producing electroosmotic flow and thus can act as bridging membranes. Another method of forming a bridging membrane is to directly fabricate the bridging channel(s) to have dimensions similar to the electrical double layer and thus allow electrical conduction without significant fluid conduction.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">WORKING EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, there is shown a portion of a physical embodiment of a microchannel device such as device <b>5</b>A. The device shown utilizes a porous glass layer as the bridging membrane. The analysis channel <b>20</b>B and the side channels <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b>B have been formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. Operation of device <b>5</b>A will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3B</figref>. A plug <b>42</b> of rhodamine B in a sodium tetraborate buffer is first loaded into analysis channel <b>20</b>B using a fixed volume valve arrangement in which electric potentials of 0.6, 0.8, 0, and 0.6 kV are applied to the buffer reservoir <b>40</b>, the sample reservoir <b>45</b>, the first waste reservoir <b>35</b>, and the first side reservoir <b>55</b>, respectively. (0 kV corresponds to ground potential). Electric potentials of 1.0, 0.7, 0.7, and 0 kV are then applied to the buffer reservoir <b>40</b>, sample reservoir <b>45</b>, first waste reservoir <b>35</b>, and first and second side reservoirs <b>55</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively, to provide the electrokinetic driving force for transporting the plug <b>42</b> of rhodamine B into the analysis channel <b>20</b>B. No voltage was applied to second waste reservoir <b>50</b>, thereby allowing its potential to float. The plug of rhodamine B is transported in the analysis channel <b>20</b>B by electroosmotic flow between the junction <b>130</b> and bridging membrane <b>65</b>, and by electroosmotic pressure induced in the analysis channel <b>20</b>B beyond the bridging membrane <b>65</b>. A small fraction of the rhodamine B from plug <b>42</b> moves across the bridging membrane <b>65</b> to channel <b>25</b>, but the bulk of the fluid material flows past the bridging membrane <b>65</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The velocity of the sample plug <b>42</b> was measured using a single point detection scheme. Microchip <b>5</b>A was first tested for electroosmotic flow under standard operating conditions, i.e., with no electric potential applied to the bridging membrane <b>65</b>. The buffer reservoir <b>40</b>, the sample reservoir <b>45</b>, the first waste reservoir <b>35</b>, and the second waste reservoir <b>50</b> were energized at voltages of 1.0, 0.7, 0.7, and 0 kV, respectively, to transport the sample plug along the analysis channel. No electric potential was applied to the other reservoirs. The measured electroosmotic velocity of the plug <b>42</b> in the vicinity of the bridging membrane was 1.07 mm/s. The rhodamine B concentration profile was monitored in the analysis channel <b>20</b>B at a point adjacent to the bridging membrane <b>65</b>. Graph (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the timing of the sample as it passes the bridging membrane <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To measure the velocity with the side channels <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>A, and <b>25</b>B engaged, i.e., with the bridging membrane in operation, electric potentials of 1.0, 0.7, 0.7, and 0 kV were applied to the buffer reservoir <b>40</b>, sample reservoir <b>45</b>, first waste reservoir <b>35</b>, and first side reservoir <b>55</b>, respectively. No electric potential was applied to the second waste reservoir <b>50</b> or the second side reservoir <b>60</b>. The electroosmotic velocity measured in the vicinity of the bridging membrane was 1.29 mm/s. The profile was again monitored at the bridging membrane junction <b>65</b>. Graph (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the timing of the sample as it passes the bridging membrane <b>65</b>. Graph (c) shows the timing of the same sample as obtained 10 mm downstream from the bridging membrane in a region of the analysis channel <b>20</b>B that is free of an electric field. The velocity of the rhodamine B in the analysis channel 10 mm beyond the junction was measured as 1.09 mm/s. The velocity difference corresponds to an estimated pressure generated in the analysis channel of about 0.10 bar from the use of the bridging membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pressures or vacuums that are generated using these concepts depend on the dimensions of the channels, the interfacial characteristics and the properties of the fluid. The equation below shows the pressure dependence on some of these parameters.</p>

The parameter ∈<sub>0 </sub>is the permittivity of free space, ∈ is the fluid dielectric constant, ζ is the zeta potential, E is the axial electric field strength, L is the channel length over which electrokinetic pumping is taking place, and d is the channel depth. Greater pressures can be generated by reducing the channel depth, but not without bounds. When the channel depth approaches the electrical double layer thickness, electroosmotic pumping becomes less efficient with corresponding reductions in the average fluid velocity produced for a given electrical field, as understood by those skilled in the art. The variation of fluid flow and effective pressure generation with varying channel depths and double layer thicknesses, at fixed electrical field strength or current, provides the ability to design structures that generate for different purposes as described in this application. Effective pressures that can be electrokinetically generated can be controlled with channel depth and length. In addition by making channel dimensions similar to the double layer thickness, fluid conduction can be inhibited while maintaining electrical current.
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One way to effectively reduce the channel depth or pumping depth dimension is to form a porous network of channels such as formed by the silicate bonding methods used in the working examples described hereinabove. The pore size of the bridging membrane acts as the channel depth in the equation above for the pressure P, while the many separate paths through the membrane increase the flow rate of fluid. An example of such a device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. A tee microchannel network <b>1000</b> is formed with channel segments <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b>, and <b>1003</b>. A bridging membrane <b>1004</b> is formed in channel <b>1001</b> and a second bridging membrane <b>1005</b> is formed in channel <b>1002</b>. The bridging membranes <b>1004</b> and <b>1005</b> are positioned near the intersection of the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To generate pressure in channel <b>1003</b> a voltage is applied between the entrance to channel <b>1001</b> and the entrance to channel <b>1002</b> so as to transport fluid from channel <b>1001</b> to channel <b>1002</b>. The pumping characteristics, i.e., the fluid flow rate at a given electric field strength, are different for the two membranes. Membrane <b>1004</b> is formed to provide a higher pumping rate than membrane <b>1005</b>. Under such conditions and given zero flow rate out channel <b>1003</b>, a pressure will be generated in channel <b>1003</b> corresponding to the pressure drop across membrane <b>1004</b>. Such generated pressures could be used to push a mobile phase through channel <b>1003</b> that is packed with stationary support particles while providing an electric field free region in channel <b>1003</b>. Adjusting the applied potential to reverse the direction of fluid transport will allow a vacuum to be created in channel <b>1003</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown a second working example embodied as microchip <b>5</b>B in accordance with the present invention. The working example illustrates the use of microchip <b>5</b>B for concentration enhancement of DNA using a bridging membrane incorporated into the microfluidic network formed on the chip. The microfabricated bridging membrane structure of microchip <b>5</b>B is similar in design to microchip <b>5</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described previously herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a backlit image of an actual microchip combined with a fluorescence image of the DNA material <b>208</b> concentrated in the analysis channel <b>212</b> at the bridging membrane <b>206</b> (bright spot at the bridging membrane). The concentration enhancement occurs when an electrical potential is applied between the sample channel <b>200</b> and the first side channel <b>202</b>. No electrical potential is applied to the analysis channel <b>212</b> in this case, but an electric potential of the same polarity as applied to the sample channel <b>200</b>, if applied to waste analysis channel <b>212</b>, would further assist in confining the spatial extent of the concentrated DNA sample <b>208</b> adjacent to the bridging membrane <b>206</b>. The bridging membrane <b>206</b> allows small ions to pass but prevents the larger molecules of the DNA <b>208</b> from migrating through the bridging membrane <b>206</b> in the presence of the electric field. The bridging membrane thus acts as a physical barrier through which the DNA molecules <b>208</b> cannot pass and, over time, the DNA <b>208</b> accumulates at the bridging membrane junction <b>206</b>. The amount of DNA <b>208</b> collected at the bridging membrane <b>206</b> is related to the electric field strength, the time of accumulation, and the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA <b>208</b>. In this example, the sample channel <b>200</b> is grounded, and 1 kV is applied to the second side channel <b>210</b>. The accumulation time is approximately 1 minute. The analysis and side channels, <b>212</b> and <b>202</b> respectively, are coated with covalently linked linear polyacrylamide to minimize electroosmotic flow and are filled with 3% linear polyacrylamide, a common sieving medium for DNA separations.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a fluorescence image of the double stranded DNA <b>208</b> (ΦX-174, Hae III digest) intercalated with a dye, TOPRO, and excited using an argon ion laser (514.5 nm) without backlighting of the bridging membrane connection <b>206</b>. The bright spot at the center of the image is the DNA material <b>208</b> that has been transported from the sample reservoir <b>200</b> and concentrated at the bridging membrane <b>206</b>. This technique can be used to concentrate either single or double stranded DNA. Clearly the intensity of the fluorescence is greater in the vicinity of the bridging membrane <b>206</b> than on the sample reservoir side of the analysis channel or in the analysis channel below the bridging membrane <b>206</b>. Also, with the addition of a channel to the microchip design both a constant volume or variable volume valve can be implemented to inject a sample onto the analysis channel <b>212</b> following concentration enhancement at the bridging membrane. Such a DNA concentration enhancement tool would be valuable for DNA analysis when DNA concentrations would otherwise be too low to measure using standard techniques. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that such as device is useful for other types of materials that are to be analyzed such as proteins and synthetic polymers.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of a microchip <b>6</b>A in accordance with the present invention. Microchip <b>6</b>A has side channel portions <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B and analysis channel portions <b>75</b>A and <b>75</b>B formed thereon. The side channel portions <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B intersect with analysis channel portions <b>75</b>A, <b>75</b>B of microchip <b>6</b>A. In preparing microchip <b>6</b>A, the cover plate was bonded to the substrate over the etched channels by hydrolyzing the facing surfaces, bringing them into contact with each other, and heating the assembly at 500° C. Microchip <b>6</b>A includes a side reservoir <b>80</b>, a sample reservoir <b>85</b>, a buffer reservoir <b>90</b>, and a waste reservoir <b>95</b>. The reservoirs are affixed with epoxy to the substrate at the point where the channels extend beyond the cover plate. Electrical connection between the high voltage power supply and the reservoirs is made using platinum wire connection as illustrated for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Side channel portion <b>70</b>A is filled with 10% (w/v) acrylamide that is polymerized to gel form in situ. The polymer allows ionic current to pass, but inhibits bulk fluid flow in the manner discussed above. The polymer extends to within about 1 mm of the intersection. The three remaining channel portions, <b>70</b>B, <b>75</b>A, and <b>75</b>B are filled with a buffer solution to prevent polymerization of the acrylamide in those channel portions.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, there is shown an example of a microchip similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the chip is backlit to show the microchannels and the intersection thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, shows the intersection being filled with rhodamine B buffer by applying potentials of 10 kV and 0 kV to the sample reservoir <b>85</b> and side reservoir <b>80</b>, respectively.

A small amount of rhodamine B is left in the side channel due to a small dead volume. Because of the high electrical resistance of the polymer filled channel, the utilization of the applied electric potential for the electroosmotic pumping effect is not as efficient in this example as for the embodiments described previously herein. However, polymer plugs having a lower electrical resistance could be generated using plugs of different spatial extent or conductivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Additional Embodiment and Applications</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown an arrangement for controlling sample loading and injection procedures which includes a microchip <b>6</b>B according to the present invention. Microchip <b>6</b>B includes a first buffer reservoir <b>150</b>, a second buffer reservoir <b>140</b>, a sample reservoir <b>135</b>, a first waste reservoir <b>160</b>, and a second waste reservoir <b>170</b>. A high voltage source <b>125</b> is connected to the first buffer reservoir <b>150</b>, the first waste reservoir <b>160</b>, and the second waste reservoir <b>170</b> through a voltage dividing network consisting of resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, and R<b>3</b>. A switch <b>180</b> is connected between the high voltage source <b>125</b> and the second buffer reservoir <b>140</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the high voltage source is not directly connected to the sample reservoir <b>135</b> as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Instead, electrical connectivity is made through a small channel extending between the first buffer reservoir <b>150</b> and the sample reservoir <b>135</b>. A bridging membrane <b>130</b> is formed in the microchannel between the first buffer reservoir <b>150</b> and the sample reservoir <b>135</b>. The bridging membrane <b>130</b> is formed of a free solution or a polyacrylamide gel for the purpose of minimizing any electrochemically generated products in the sample material.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">To perform injections, a variable volume valve is configured with 1.0 kV, 0.8 kV, 0.6 kV, and 0 kV applied to the second buffer reservoir <b>140</b>, first buffer reservoir <b>150</b>, first waste reservoir <b>160</b>, and second waste reservoir <b>170</b>. To inject a sample plug, the switch <b>180</b> is opened at the start of the injection period. This removes the electric potential at the second buffer reservoir <b>140</b> and continues to apply a potential to the first buffer reservoir <b>150</b>, first waste reservoir <b>160</b>, and second waste reservoir <b>170</b>. At the end of the injection period, switch <b>180</b> is closed. The injection procedure of this embodiment is essentially identical to an embodiment where the high voltage is applied directly in the sample reservoir. However, it avoids to a large extent the problems associated with the electrochemical generation of undesired products in the sample material.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A second use of a bridging membrane according to the present invention is the separation of ions and/or molecules in a sample material based upon their properties such as charge, size, or a combination thereof. The microchip is fabricated with a sample channel and a dialysis or electrodialysis channel on one or both sides of the sample channel. A preferred embodiment of this application is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. A sample channel <b>1102</b> is formed in fluid communication with a sample reservoir (not shown) and a waste reservoir (not shown). A first dialysis channel <b>1104</b> and a second dialysis channel <b>1106</b> are formed on opposite sides of the sample channel <b>1102</b>. The dialysis channels <b>1104</b> and <b>1106</b> are separated from the sample channel <b>1102</b> by bridging membranes <b>1108</b> and <b>1110</b>, respectively. A microchip embodiment of this arrangement is fabricated as described above with reference to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The sample material and dialysis buffer are transported through their respective channels using either electrokinetic transport or a hydraulic force. In addition, a potential difference can be applied between the sample and dialysis channels to cause or prevent the transport of ions through the bridging membranes <b>1108</b>, <b>1110</b> from the sample channel <b>1102</b> to the dialysis channels <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, respectively. In this manner, small ions or molecules are transported out of the sample channel for analysis or to remove them from the sample material in the sample channel <b>1102</b>. Neutral small molecules can diffuse passively through the bridging membranes <b>1108</b>, <b>1110</b> with or without an electric field present. Moreover, without a potential difference applied between the sample channel <b>1102</b> and the dialysis channels <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b>, small ions diffuse passively across the bridging membrane. The efficiency of the dialysis process in this arrangement depends on dimensions of the sample channel, the dialysis channel(s), and the bridging membrane(s), the residence time of the sample material near the bridging membrane, and the magnitude of the electric potential applied between the sample and dialysis channels.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When an electrode material is in contact with water, reduction/oxidation reactions occur at the electrode surface producing hydrogen and/or oxygen gas. This gas evolution quickly leads to macroscopic gas bubble generation and can disrupt the current and electrokinetic flow especially in channels formed in glass or quartz substrates. In a further embodiment of a microchip according to this invention for generating pressure-driven flow by electroosmotic pumping a porous substrate is used with a metal film electrode. In this arrangement the bridging membrane conducts gas phase species rather than electrical current, but still inhibits bulk fluid transport. A working example of that arrangement was demonstrated using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate and a metal film for the ground electrode in one of the microfluidic channels. The PDMS acts as a bridging membrane that facilitates the removal of electrochemically generated gas phase species from the microfluidic channel because small gas phase molecules diffuse through the PDMS more rapidly than in glass. This greater diffusion allows chips formed with a PDMS substrate to be electrically contacted using a metal electrode at any point along a channel without the problem of macroscopic gas bubble formation in such a channel. Electrically contacting a microchip channel using this method enables the creation of an electric field-free region in the channel past the electrode, and materials can be pumped through this region using the pressure generated in the electroosmotic pumping region.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To demonstrate this application, a hybrid microchip was fabricated using a PDMS substrate into which channels were molded and a glass cover plate on which metal electrodes were fabricated. The device <b>1200</b> is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The microchannel network includes a sample channel <b>1206</b>, an analysis channel <b>1208</b>, and a pair of side channels intersecting with the sample and analysis channels formed on a PDMS substrate <b>1202</b>. To form the microchannel network on the PDMS substrate <b>1202</b>, the PDMS material was polymerized in a negative silicon mold. The silicon mold was made by standard microfabrication techniques. Following polymerization, the PDMS substrate was removed from the silicon mold. A grounding electrode <b>1212</b> was formed by sputtering a chrome electrode pattern onto a glass substrate <b>1204</b>. The glass substrate <b>1204</b> and the PDMS substrate <b>1202</b> were then oxidized and sealed together. The oxidation and sealing process used a plasma cleaner of a known type. Reservoirs <b>1201</b>, <b>1203</b>, <b>1205</b>, and <b>1207</b> were formed in the PDMS substrate in fluid communication with the sample channel <b>1206</b>, the analysis channel <b>1208</b>, and the side channels, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Prior to use, the microchannels were rinsed with 1M NaOH and distilled water. This procedure was selected to minimize gas bubble formation when a large electric potential is used. Reservoir <b>1201</b> was filled with 1.0 μm diameter fluorescently labeled particles in a 20 mM SDS/10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Reservoirs <b>1203</b>, <b>1205</b>, and <b>1207</b> were filled with buffer only, i.e., no particles. After filling the reservoirs, a electric potential was applied by connecting high voltage source <b>1214</b> between reservoir <b>1201</b> and the ground electrode <b>1212</b>. No electric potential was applied to reservoirs <b>1203</b>, <b>1205</b>, or <b>1207</b>. Under these conditions, the particles were transported out of reservoir <b>1201</b> toward the ground electrode <b>1212</b>. The electroosmotic mobility of the bulk fluid was greater than the electrophoretic mobility of the anionic particles. Because the net velocity of the particles, i.e., the electroosmotic velocity of the bulk fluid minus the electrophoretic velocity of the anionic particles, was lower than the electroosmotic velocity, an increase in the average particle velocity was observed as the particles passed from the pumping region <b>1209</b> of analysis channel <b>1208</b>, over the ground electrode <b>1212</b>, and into the electric field-free region <b>1210</b> of analysis channel <b>1208</b>. Particle velocities were measured before and after the ground electrode using time-lapsed fluorescence CCD imaging, and an electric field strength of 300 V/cm in the pumping region was used. The average particle velocity in the presence of the electric field was 0.7(±0.1)mm/sec(n=21) and in the field free region was 1.9(±0.6)mm/sec(n=7). A velocity increase of 2.6 times was seen as the particles passed over the ground electrode <b>1212</b> indicating termination of the electric field by the ground electrode. The electroosmotic mobility generated in the pumping region was estimated to be 6×10<sup>−4 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/(V·s) and corresponds to typical electroosmotic mobilities for native glass surfaces. Field strengths greater than 500 V/cm were successfully applied without macroscopic bubble generation.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The bridging membrane embodiment described above suggests a simplistic method for manufacturing fluidic microchips. The fluidic channels are molded as described above or embossed into a planar substrate using an embossing tool that contains the microfluidic channel design. After fabrication of the fluidic substrate a cover plate is formed from a gas porous material similar to that described above. In addition, the electrical contacts are formed on this coverplate material using metal deposition techniques to spatially pattern electrode structures in a desired layout. Other conducting materials besides metals could be used, e.g., conducting polymers, and different deposition or patterning methods could be used such as electrochemical deposition or silk screen patterning. The substrate and coverplate with electrodes are then bonded together using any of a number of approaches including adhesive bonding, covalent bonding, noncovalent bonding, or thermal bonding. The electrode layout provides electrical contact within channels and reservoirs as necessary in addition to electrical contact with the controlling power supply unit that drives the electrokinetic fluid manipulations. In addition the substrate or coverplate could have fluid reservoirs therein. This method of microchip fabrication could be extremely rapid and inexpensive.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is another application of bridging membranes described above in a microchannel device according to this invention. The device <b>1300</b> has a substantially linear microchannel <b>1302</b> that has electrical contacts <b>1304</b>, <b>1306</b>, <b>1308</b>, and <b>1310</b> disposed at spaced-apart locations along microchannel <b>1302</b>. The distance L<sub>e </sub>between the electrical contacts is preferably fixed so that the contacts are equally spaced. However, it is not necessary to have equally spaced contacts, although such an arrangement is believed to be the most efficient design. The electrical contacts <b>1304</b>, <b>1306</b>, <b>1308</b>, and <b>1310</b> are formed of a bridging membrane as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the electrical contacts can be made using the gas permeable membrane (PDMS) and metal electrode combination described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The inlet <b>1312</b> of microchannel <b>1302</b> is adapted to access at least two different materials. Microchannel <b>1302</b> is predominantly filled with a first material <b>1314</b> that provides significant electroosmotic mobility. In operation, an electric potential is applied between electrodes <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b> to induce electrokinetic transport of the first material toward electrode <b>1306</b>. In that stage, electrodes <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> are left electrically floating. The inlet <b>1312</b> of microchannel <b>1302</b> is then brought into communication with a second material for a period of time to generate a plug of the second material <b>1316</b> that has an axial extent L<sub>p</sub>. In the preferred use of device <b>1300</b>, the second material is nonconducting or does not support electrokinetic transport. In the nonconducting case, the current through electrodes <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b> is monitored so as to detect the arrival of the plug <b>1316</b> of the second material at electrode <b>1304</b>. When a current drop is observed, an electric potential is applied between electrodes <b>1306</b> and <b>1308</b>, leaving the others electrically floating. The electrokinetic force to transport material is now induced in microchannel <b>1302</b> between electrodes <b>1306</b> and <b>1308</b>. The current through electrodes <b>1306</b> and <b>1308</b> is monitored. Upon arrival of the plug <b>1316</b> of the second material at electrode <b>1306</b> a reduction in current is detected at electrode <b>1306</b>, and the voltage is applied between electrodes <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b>, while leaving the other electrodes floating. Again, when the plug <b>1316</b> of second material arrives at electrode <b>1308</b>, a current drop occurs through that electrode. That signal resets the device so that the electrical potential is applied between electrodes <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b>, as in the initial state of operation. The maximum length of the plug <b>1316</b> of the second material is given by the following equation.

or for n=4, L<sub>p</sub>&lt;L<sub>e</sub>. The minimum distance permitted between two separate plugs of the second material is 2L<sub>e</sub>+L<sub>p</sub>. Device <b>1300</b> acts as a linear motor that is able to transport either a conducting or nonconducting material along microchannel <b>1302</b> by time dependent control of the electrical potentials applied to the series of electrical contacts <b>1304</b>, <b>1306</b>, <b>1308</b>, and <b>1310</b>.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Another application of a microfluidic device in accordance with this invention uses a plurality of bridging membrane contacts or electrodes as a pump for nonconducting liquids or gases. Such a pump uses a suitable electroosmotic liquid as a working fluid that would cycle repeatedly within the device with little if any loss. The combination of surface tension, vapor pressure, and electroosmotic forces is selected to be sufficient to withstand the pressure at the interface between the working fluid and the gas or liquid being evacuated. The maximum pumping pressure is attained when the electroosmotic flow is counterbalanced by the Poiseuille flow generated by the pressure drop, and depends on the axial electric field and the cross sections of the microchannels used. The vapor pressure of the working fluid is the ultimate limit of the vacuum that can be obtained with such a device. An embodiment of a cyclical pump utilizing this concept is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14E</figref> are schematic diagrams of a two-cycle pump <b>1400</b> that is used as a vacuum pump in accordance with this aspect of the invention. The pump <b>1400</b> has an inlet <b>1401</b> that is connected to a chamber (not shown) to be evacuated. Pump <b>1400</b> includes an exhaust port <b>1402</b> that is open to the atmosphere and two channels <b>1404</b> and <b>1406</b> leading from the inlet port <b>1401</b> to the exhaust port <b>1402</b>. Three electrodes <b>1408</b><i>a</i>, <b>1408</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1408</b><i>c</i>, preferably configured as bridging membranes, are disposed at several locations along channel <b>1404</b>. Another electrode <b>1408</b><i>d </i>of similar construction is disposed at a preselected location on channel <b>1406</b>. There is an additional electrical contact <b>1409</b> at the exhaust port <b>1402</b> that can be either a bridging membrane or another type of connection, such as a wire inserted in the exhaust opening. Electrical potentials V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b>, and V<b>5</b> are selectively applied to the electrodes <b>1408</b><i>a</i>, <b>1408</b><i>b</i>, <b>1408</b><i>c</i>, <b>1408</b><i>d</i>, and <b>1409</b>, respectively, during the operation of the pump <b>1400</b>. The following operating conditions are selected to provide the desired functionality. First, the voltage difference V<b>4</b>−V<b>5</b> between the electrical contact <b>1409</b> and electrode <b>1408</b><i>d </i>and the voltage difference V<b>1</b>−V<b>2</b> across the electrodes <b>1408</b><i>a </i>and <b>1408</b><i>b </i>are selected to produce axial electric fields in their respective channels that are sufficiently large to produce an electroosmotic pressure greater than the pressure difference between the exhaust port <b>1402</b> and inlet port <b>1401</b>. The first condition (channel <b>1406</b>) prevents the working fluid from entering the vacuum chamber during the exhaust stroke while the second condition (channel <b>1404</b>) ensures that the working fluid can be displaced from the low pressure inlet to the high pressure exhaust. As a third condition, the net electroosmotic pressure produced by the voltage difference between electrodes <b>1408</b><i>c </i>and <b>1408</b><i>b </i>(V<b>3</b>−V<b>2</b>), between electrodes <b>1408</b><i>a </i>and <b>1408</b><i>b </i>(V<b>1</b>−V<b>2</b>), and between electrodes <b>1408</b><i>c </i>and <b>1409</b> (V<b>3</b>−V<b>5</b>) is selected to ensure flow in the counterclockwise direction during the exhaust stroke. The electric potential applied to electrode <b>1408</b><i>c </i>has a value V<b>3</b> and the value of V<b>3</b> that meets this third condition is V<b>3</b><sub>high</sub>. V<b>3</b><sub>high </sub>is the value of V<b>3</b> prior to the start of the intake stroke. The spacing between electrodes and the magnitudes of the applied voltages are selected to meet the above conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The two strokes of the pumping cycle, intake and exhaust, are obtained by varying the voltage at electrode <b>1408</b><i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14E</figref>. To start the intake stroke, the voltage at electrode <b>1408</b><i>c </i>is set equal to that at the exhaust port electrode <b>1409</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. The value of V<b>3</b> at this stage is V<b>3</b><sub>low</sub>. Under that condition, the working fluid is pumped towards the exhaust port <b>1402</b> through both channels <b>1404</b> and <b>1406</b>. The fluid flow stops when the gas-fluid interface in channel <b>1404</b> reaches electrode <b>1408</b>b and the gas-fluid interface in channel <b>1406</b> reaches electrode <b>1408</b><i>d </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. Flow stops at this point because if the working fluid moved past those electrodes, the electrical conduction path in the channel would be broken and the electrical current driving the flow would be interrupted. At the end of the intake stroke, the portion of channel <b>1404</b> between the electrode <b>1408</b><i>a </i>and electrode <b>1408</b><i>b </i>is filled with gas at the pressure remaining in the vacuum chamber. Similarly, the portion of channel <b>1406</b> between the electrode <b>1408</b><i>a </i>and electrode <b>1408</b><i>d </i>is filled with gas at the pressure remaining in the vacuum chamber. The exhaust stroke is started by increasing the voltage at electrode <b>1408</b><i>c </i>to its initial value, V<b>3</b><sub>high</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. Because of the third condition identified above, the working fluid is electroosmotically pumped in a counterclockwise direction, driven by the voltage difference V<b>3</b>−V<b>2</b>, first filling channel <b>1404</b> up to electrode <b>1408</b><i>a</i>, where the interface is stopped because of the resumption of electrical current conduction between electrodes <b>1408</b><i>a </i>and <b>1408</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. The flow then continues towards the exhaust port <b>1402</b>, pushing out the entrained gas <b>1410</b>, which is now compressed to the exhaust pressure. Once electrical conduction is re-established between electrodes <b>1408</b><i>d </i>and <b>1409</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref>, the cycle can be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The pumping device according to this invention is not constrained to operate between vacuum and atmospheric pressure. Any liquid or gas that is immiscible with the working fluid and does not itself undergo electroosmotic flow can be pumped in this way. If the desired pumping speed cannot be attained at a given pressure differential with one channel, as described above, several channels could be connected in parallel between electrodes <b>1408</b><i>a </i>and <b>1409</b> to increase the capacity while maintaining the required pressure differential.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A still further application of a bridging membrane in accordance with another aspect of this invention relates to microfluidic valving. A microchannel network <b>1500</b> for implementing this application is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. A plurality of microchannels <b>1501</b>, <b>1503</b>, <b>1505</b>, and <b>1507</b> are interconnected at a common junction <b>1520</b>. Reservoirs <b>1502</b>, <b>1504</b>, <b>1506</b>, and <b>1508</b> are in fluid communication with the microchannels <b>1501</b>, <b>1503</b>, <b>1505</b>, and <b>1507</b>, respectively. Bridging membranes <b>1510</b>, <b>1512</b>, <b>1514</b>, and <b>1516</b> are disposed at preselected locations along microchannels <b>1501</b>, <b>1503</b>, <b>1505</b>, and <b>1507</b> between the reservoirs <b>1502</b>, <b>1504</b>, <b>1506</b>, and <b>1508</b>, respectively, and the common intersection <b>1520</b>. Electrical potentials are selectively applied between the reservoirs <b>1502</b>, <b>1504</b>, <b>1506</b>, and <b>1508</b> and their corresponding bridging membranes <b>1510</b>, <b>1512</b>, <b>1514</b>, and <b>1516</b>, respectively, to pump materials from the reservoirs through the fluidic microchannels.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a first mode of operation, appropriate potentials are applied between reservoirs <b>1502</b> and <b>1508</b> and bridging membranes <b>1510</b> and <b>1516</b>, respectively, to transport first and second materials from reservoirs <b>1502</b> and <b>1508</b>, respectively, through channels <b>1501</b> and <b>1507</b> into the common intersection <b>1520</b>. No potentials need be applied to reservoirs <b>1504</b> or <b>1506</b> or to bridging membranes <b>1512</b> or <b>1514</b>. The first material is transported from channel <b>1501</b> into channel <b>1503</b>, and the second material is transported from channel <b>1507</b> into channels <b>1503</b> and <b>1505</b>. The electrical potential at reservoir <b>1508</b> is then removed or lowered relative to the electrical potential at reservoir <b>1502</b>. This causes the first material to be transported into channel <b>1505</b>. The electrical potential at reservoir <b>1508</b> is then returned to its initial value to terminate the transporting of the first material into channel <b>1505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a second mode of operation, first and second materials are drawn from their respective reservoirs into the common intersection instead of being pushed as in the first mode of operation. Appropriate potentials are applied between reservoirs <b>1504</b> and <b>1506</b> and bridging membranes <b>1512</b> and <b>1514</b>, respectively, to draw the first and second materials from reservoirs <b>1502</b> and <b>1508</b>, respectively, through channels <b>1501</b> and <b>1507</b> into the common intersection <b>1520</b>. No electrical potentials need be applied to reservoirs <b>1502</b> and <b>1508</b> or to bridging membranes <b>1510</b> and <b>1516</b>. As in the first mode of operation, the first material is transported from channel <b>1501</b> into channel <b>1503</b>, and the second material is transported from channel <b>1507</b> into channels <b>1503</b> and <b>1505</b>. The electrical potential at reservoir <b>1504</b> is removed or lowered relative to the electrical potential at reservoir <b>1506</b> to transport the first material into channel <b>1505</b>. The electrical potential at reservoir <b>1503</b> is then returned to its initial value to terminate the transporting of the first material into channel <b>1505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In both the first and second modes of operation of the microchannel network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the electrical potentials at reservoirs <b>1508</b> and <b>1506</b> can be raised relative to the potentials at reservoirs <b>1502</b> and <b>1504</b> for the respective material dispensing schemes. Also, bridging membranes <b>1510</b> and <b>1516</b> or <b>1512</b> and <b>1514</b> can be connected to a common potential or ground. In the first mode of operation, reservoirs <b>1504</b> and <b>1506</b> can be combined into a single, common reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a third mode of operation, appropriate electrical potentials are applied between reservoirs <b>1502</b>, <b>1508</b>, and <b>1506</b>, and bridging membranes <b>1510</b>, <b>1516</b>, and <b>1514</b> such that first, second, and fourth materials are transported from reservoirs <b>1502</b>, <b>1508</b>, and <b>1506</b>, respectively, through channels <b>1501</b>, <b>1507</b>, and <b>1505</b>, respectively, into channel <b>1503</b>. At equilibrium, the proportions of the first, second, and fourth materials in the common intersection <b>1520</b> are constant. In a variation of this mode of operation, the transporting of the first, second, and fourth materials can be accomplished by applying an appropriate electrical potential between reservoir <b>1504</b> and bridging membrane <b>1512</b>, and having the channels <b>1501</b>, <b>1503</b>, <b>1505</b>, and <b>1507</b> dimensioned appropriately. The second material is dispensed into channel <b>1505</b> by applying appropriate potentials between reservoirs <b>1508</b>, <b>1504</b>, and <b>1506</b> and bridging membranes <b>1516</b>, <b>1512</b>, and <b>1514</b>, respectively. The dispensing of the second material into channel <b>1505</b> can be accomplished by applying an appropriate electrical potential between reservoir <b>1502</b> and bridging membrane <b>1510</b>, and having channels <b>1501</b>, <b>1503</b>, <b>1505</b>, and <b>1507</b> dimensioned appropriately. In addition, bridging membranes <b>1510</b>, <b>1512</b>, <b>1514</b>, and <b>1516</b> can be connected to a common potential or to ground.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In any of the modes of operation described for the microchannel network <b>1500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the electrical potentials can be applied between any combination of reservoirs and corresponding bridging membranes to enhance or diminish the transport of material within the respective channel or channels.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Yet another microchannel arrangement employing bridging membranes in accordance with this invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In this implementation a group of three bridging membranes <b>1601</b>, <b>1602</b>, and <b>1603</b> is used to provide mixing of materials that are supplied from a mixing tee <b>1605</b>. A first material is supplied from microchannel <b>1604</b> and a different material is supplied from microchannel <b>1606</b>. The first and second materials are electrokinetically transported through tee intersection <b>1605</b> into the mixing microchannel <b>1608</b> by applying appropriate voltages to channels <b>1604</b> and <b>1606</b> relative to channel <b>1608</b>. The bridging membranes <b>1601</b>, <b>1602</b>, and <b>1603</b> are attached to channel <b>1608</b> so as to form three spatially distinct electrical contacts or electrodes. Voltages are applied to bridging membranes <b>1601</b> and <b>1603</b> relative to bridging membrane <b>1602</b> for generating opposing electrokinetic forces on the fluid which cause circulation patterns in the transported materials similar to those indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In practice, the fluid motion is three-dimensional with the flow near the channel walls being toward bridging membrane <b>1602</b> and the flow in the center of the channel being away from bridging membrane <b>1602</b>. Materials are mixed in this fashion under either stopped flow or continuous flow conditions, i.e., the average net velocity of the materials in the channel <b>1608</b> being zero or non-zero, respectively. A series of such mixers could also be cascaded for enhanced mixing of the materials.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Several embodiments of a microfabricated device in accordance with the present invention have been described hereinabove. The microfabricated devices which utilize a bridging membrane overcome many of the limitations of the known devices. Devices constructed in accordance with the concepts of this invention permit several advantageous modes of operation. More particularly, an embodiment has been described that provides sample loading and injection with a minimum of electrochemically generated byproducts. Another embodiment of the present invention has been described that enables the transport of fluidic materials by electroosmotic forces in a channel region that is uninfluenced by an electric field. A further embodiment has been described that provides the ability to concentrate ionic species in an analysis channel. Still other embodiments of the present invention have been described which facilitate the separation or purification of sample material, that facilitate the removal of electrochemically generated gas species from the sample and transport materials, that provide either positive or negative pressure to facilitate hydraulic transport of fluidic materials, and that provide valving of fluidic materials in a microfluidic structure.</p>

There is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof.
