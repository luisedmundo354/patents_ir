<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/254,922 filed Oct. 20, 2005, which is a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 10/430,688 filed May 5, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,991,248 issued Jan. 31, 2006, where these application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to baby strollers, and more particularly, to all-terrain baby strollers that can be folded.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditionally, baby strollers have been used to push an infant slowly on a relatively hard, smooth floor or sidewalk. As a result, the strollers were made small and light. These strollers work well enough at slow speed, but are extremely unwieldy and even dangerous on rough surfaces or at higher speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">All-terrain baby strollers have been designed to overcome these problems. These strollers typically employ much larger wheels, often large bicycle tires. The stroller frame members are constructed of metal tubular stock and durable plastic frame connectors or other durable material to connect the frame members together to handle the heavy duty use they may receive. The frame connectors are used also to rotate or pivot one frame member relative to another, and are used to removably connect other frame members together.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some advanced designs of all-terrain strollers have allowed for a certain degree of folding of the all-terrain baby strollers into less than a desirable amount of compactness. In addition, conventional folding mechanisms include complications that increase cost and reduce reliability and ease of use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention resides in a folding baby stroller system and method. Embodiments include a front wheel and left and right side laterally spaced-apart front wheel supports. Each of the left and right side front wheel supports has a forward end portion and a rearward end portion. The front wheel is mounted to the forward end portion of at least one of the front wheel supports, the left and right side front wheel supports being rotatable as a unit. Further included are left and right rear wheels, and left and right side laterally spaced-apart rear wheel supports. Each of the left and right side rear wheel supports has a lower end portion and an upper end portion, the lower end portions being coupled to at least one of the left and right rear wheels. Further included are left and right side laterally spaced-apart handle members. Each of the left and right side handle members has a forward end portion and a rearward end portion with a handle portion, the left and right side handle members being rotatable as a unit. Further included are left and right side laterally spaced-apart folding assemblies. Each of the left and right side folding assemblies has a first rotatable member and second rotatable member rotatably coupled to a pivot member supported by the upper end portion of a corresponding one of the left and right side rear wheel supports for rotation about a common axis of rotation and independently rotatable relative to each other. The rearward end portion of a corresponding one of the left and right side front wheel supports is fixedly attached to the first rotatable member, and the forward end portion of a corresponding one of the left and right side handle members is fixedly attached to the second rotatable member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the present invention is embodied in an all-terrain baby stroller <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, having a foldable, tubular metal frame <b>12</b> and a transversely extending rear axle assembly <b>14</b> with a transverse, non-rotating tubular rear axle <b>15</b>. Left and right side rear wheels <b>16</b> are rotatably mounted to the ends of the rear axle assembly <b>14</b>. The forward end of the frame <b>12</b> has a single front wheel <b>18</b> rotatably mounted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The frame <b>12</b> has no base frame members extending rearwardly from the front wheel <b>18</b> to the rear axle assembly <b>14</b> as do most conventional all-terrain strollers. Instead, the frame <b>12</b> includes left and right side, downwardly and forwardly sloping front wheels frame members or supports <b>20</b>, which each extend downward from a corresponding one of left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> in a converging configuration to the front wheel <b>18</b>. A forward free-end <b>20</b><i>a </i>of each of the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b> has a plastic front wheel connector (not shown) fixedly attached thereto and a corresponding one of the left and right ends of an axle <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the front wheel <b>18</b> removably attached thereto to mount the front wheel to the stroller frame <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The front wheel supports <b>20</b> are interconnected by a foot rest <b>28</b> that spans between them toward but rearward of their forward free-ends <b>20</b><i>a </i>and that is fixedly attached to each at a position just above the front wheel <b>18</b> and just rearward of the axle <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the front wheel. As a result of the interconnection provided by the foot rest <b>28</b>, and also the front wheel <b>18</b> when attached to the left and right side front wheel connectors, the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b> form a stationary unit with respect to the left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> upon folding and unfolding of the stroller <b>10</b>, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The frame <b>12</b> also includes left and right side, upwardly and rearwardly sloping handle frame members or supports <b>24</b>, which each extend upward from the corresponding one of the left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> in a generally parallel configuration to a handle <b>26</b> extending between the left and right side handle supports. The handle <b>26</b> is covered by a foam grip. The handle supports <b>24</b> are interconnected by the handle <b>26</b> that spans between them at their rearwardmost and uppermost extension and that is fixedly attached to each.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As a result of the interconnection provided by the handle <b>26</b>, the left and right side handle supports <b>24</b> move as a unit with respect to the left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> upon folding and unfolding of the stroller <b>10</b>, as will be described in greater detail below. It is noted that in lieu of the interconnecting handle <b>26</b>, the handle supports <b>24</b> may each be provided with a handle portion at the upper end thereof such as used with umbrella style strollers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment of the invention the left and right side handle supports <b>24</b> and the handle <b>26</b> are formed as an integral unit by bending a single length of aluminum tube. The left and right side handle supports <b>24</b> are movable relative to the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b> for folding of the stroller <b>10</b> and do not together form an integrated rigid upper frame. The left and right side handle supports <b>24</b> are also movable independent from movement of the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The frame <b>12</b> also includes left and right side, downwardly and rearwardly sloping rear wheel frame members or supports <b>30</b>, which each extend downward from the corresponding one of the left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> in a generally parallel configuration to the rear axle assembly <b>14</b>. A rearward free-end <b>30</b><i>a </i>of each of the left and right side rear wheel supports <b>30</b> is fixedly attached to a corresponding one of the left and right ends of the tubular rear axle <b>15</b>. The rear wheel supports <b>30</b> are interconnected by the rear axle assembly <b>14</b> that spans between them at the rearward free-ends <b>30</b><i>a </i>thereof. As a result of the interconnection provided by the rear axle assembly <b>14</b>, the left and right side rear wheel supports <b>30</b> move as a unit with respect to the left and right folding assemblies <b>22</b> for folding and unfolding of the stroller <b>10</b>, as will be described in greater detail below. The left and right side rear wheel supports <b>30</b> are also movable relative to the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b> and the left and right side handle supports <b>24</b> for folding of the stroller <b>10</b>. Further, the left and right side rear wheel supports <b>30</b> and the rear axle assembly <b>14</b> connected thereto do not form a part of a base frame extending between the rear and front wheels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. Much of the structural strength of the stroller <b>10</b> and the interconnection of the forward wheel supports <b>20</b>, the handle supports <b>24</b>, and the rearward wheel supports <b>30</b> are provided by the centrally positioned left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b>, and not by a base frame.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment of the stroller <b>10</b>, the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b>, the left and right side handle supports <b>24</b>, and the left and right side rear wheel supports <b>30</b> are made from aluminum tube. Suitable alternative materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The left and right outward ends of the tubular rear axle <b>15</b> are open and internally threaded to receive a threaded stub axle <b>32</b> forming a part of the corresponding one of the left and right rear wheels <b>16</b>. A lock nut (not shown) when tightened against the face of the stub axle <b>32</b> locks the stub axle against loosening during usage of the stroller <b>10</b>. Alternative constructions may be used to fixedly or removably attach the rear wheels <b>16</b> to the tubular rear axle <b>15</b>, and any suitable alternative manner of mounting the rear wheels <b>16</b> to the real wheel supports <b>30</b> may be used with or without a park brake.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The frame <b>12</b> of the stroller <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in the fully unfolded state with a fabric seat <b>2</b>, fabric leg support and guard <b>3</b>. For purposes of illustration, the frame <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> without the seat <b>2</b> and the leg guard <b>3</b>. The seat <b>2</b> is suspended from the left and right side handle supports <b>24</b>, and the leg guard <b>3</b> spans between and is supported by the left and right side front wheel supports <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For the depicted implementation, user operation of the left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> will now be described. The left and right side folding assemblies <b>22</b> have the same construction, and the description below while in the singular is applicable to both. Each of the left and right rear wheel supports <b>30</b> supports an inwardly extending lever <b>34</b>, which has a predominantly vertical orientation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the frame <b>12</b> of the stroller <b>10</b> is locked in the fully unfolded position. To begin the procedure to fold the frame <b>12</b>, each of the levers <b>34</b> are pulled upward and inward as depicted by arrows R<b>1</b> to thereby put the folding assemblies <b>22</b> in an unlocked state as further explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With each of the left and right folding assemblies <b>22</b> in an unlocked state, the left and right handle supports <b>24</b>, along with the handle <b>26</b>, and the left and right forward wheel support <b>20</b>, along with the forward wheel <b>18</b>, can be rotated about the left and right folding assemblies, respectively, toward the left and right rear wheel supports <b>30</b>, respectively, as depicted by arrows R<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As stated, the forward wheel supports <b>20</b> can be moved independently from movement of the handle supports <b>24</b>. In the process of folding the frame <b>12</b>, if the forward wheel supports <b>20</b> were to be rotated about the folding assemblies <b>22</b> before rotation of the handle supports <b>24</b> about the folding assemblies, then the frame <b>12</b> would appear in a partially folded state as shown in the front elevational view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the side elevational view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In a fully folded state, both the forward wheel supports <b>20</b> and the handle supports <b>24</b> have been rotated about the folding assemblies <b>22</b> to be positioned in close proximity to the rear wheel supports <b>30</b> as shown in the side elevational view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the folding assemblies <b>22</b> includes a forward rotatable member <b>35</b>′ having a disk <b>36</b>′ with a notch <b>38</b>′ and an arm <b>40</b>′, and a rearward rotatable member <b>35</b>″ having a disk <b>36</b>″ with a notch <b>38</b>″ and an arm <b>40</b>″. The disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ and the arms <b>40</b>′ and <b>40</b>″ are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> as being part of a single formed piece; however, in other implementations the disks and arms are individual pieces that are fixedly attached together. The rotatable members <b>35</b>′ and <b>35</b>″, along with a corresponding one of the rear wheel supports <b>30</b>, are contained between left and right slotted halves of a housing <b>42</b> that allow the arms <b>40</b>′ and <b>40</b>″ to protrude outside of the housing. The inside wall of each half of the housing <b>42</b> has recess <b>42</b><i>a </i>sized and shaped such that when the two halves of the housing are positioned together, the recesses form a cavity to securely receive the upper free-end portion of the rear wheel support <b>30</b> therein. The disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ each have a central aperture <b>41</b>′ and <b>41</b>″, respectively, sized to receive a bushing <b>43</b> therethrough having a length longer than the cumulative thickness of the two disks. When the folding assembly <b>22</b> is assembled, the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ are arranged facing each other with the bushing <b>43</b> extending through the aligned apertures <b>41</b>′ and <b>41</b>″ of the disks, and this subassembly is positioned in a slot <b>30</b><i>b </i>in the enlarged, upper free-end portion of the real wheel support <b>30</b>. The slot <b>30</b><i>b </i>has a forward to rearward orientation. A central aperture <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the bushing <b>43</b> is aligned with a pair of opposing inward and outward side apertures <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the rear wheel support <b>30</b>, transverse to the orientation of the slot <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and the left and right slotted halves of the housing <b>42</b> clamp around the slotted upper free-end portion of the rear wheel support <b>30</b>. The left and right slotted halves of the housing <b>42</b> have opposing apertures <b>42</b><i>b</i>, which align with the central aperture <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the bushing <b>43</b>, such that a bolt <b>44</b> extends fully through the apertures <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the halves of the housing <b>42</b>, through the aperture <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the rear wheel support <b>30</b>, and through the central aperture <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the bushing <b>43</b>. A nut <b>44</b><i>a </i>is threaded onto the threaded end of the bolt <b>44</b> to hold the assembly together with the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ freely rotatable on the bushing <b>43</b>. With this assembly, the bolt <b>44</b> and nut <b>44</b><i>a </i>hold the left and right slotted halves of the housing <b>42</b> securely clamped together with the slots of the housing having the arms <b>40</b>′ and <b>40</b>″ extending therethrough. The arm <b>40</b>′ extends forwardly through the forward opening of the slot <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the other arm <b>40</b>″ extends rearwardly through the rearward opening of the slot <b>30</b><i>b </i>in the rear wheel support <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the folding assemblies <b>22</b> are in a fully unfolded state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ of the folding assembly are locked in place by components positioned internal to the rear wheel supports <b>30</b> including a slidably mounted head <b>50</b> with a tip <b>52</b> inserted into the notches <b>38</b>′ and <b>38</b>″ as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a cover portion <b>30</b><i>d </i>of the upper free-end portion of the rear wheel support <b>30</b> is shown removed in order to better illustrate the components of the folding assembly <b>22</b> contained therein. The cover portion <b>30</b><i>d </i>is attached to the other portion of the free-end portion of the rear wheel support <b>30</b> by a bolt <b>30</b><i>e</i>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The lever <b>34</b> is pivotally mounted to the rear wheel support <b>30</b> and the head <b>50</b> is mechanically linked to the lever <b>34</b> so that when the lever <b>34</b> is pulled upward and inward as depicted by the arrows R<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the head <b>50</b> is moved away from the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″, thereby causing the tip <b>52</b> to be retracted and disengaged from the notches <b>38</b>′ and <b>38</b>″. The disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ are then free to rotate on the bolt <b>44</b> and hence allow folding of the front wheel support <b>20</b> and the handle support <b>24</b> about the rear wheel support <b>30</b> in a clam shell movement, as will be explained in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The head <b>50</b> further includes a base <b>54</b>, which rests against one end of a spring <b>56</b>. The other end of the spring <b>56</b> rests against an internal support <b>58</b> inside the rear wheel support <b>30</b> such that the spring provides a force adequate to bias the tip <b>52</b> into an engaged state within the notches <b>38</b>′ and <b>38</b>″ of the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ when the folding assembly <b>22</b> is in the fully unfolded state. While supplying a force to the head <b>50</b> to keep the tip <b>52</b> in the notches <b>38</b>′ and <b>38</b>″, the force is not so great as to require undue force to be applied to the lever <b>34</b> by the user to retract and disengage the tip from the notches when the folding assembly is to be folded.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The internal support <b>58</b> is coupled to or may be an integral part of the rearward free-end <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the rear wheel support <b>30</b> to couple the folding assembly <b>22</b> to the rear axle assembly <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, for each of the folding assemblies <b>22</b> on the left and right sides of the stroller <b>12</b>, the front wheel support <b>20</b> is bolted onto the arm <b>40</b>′ of the forward rotatable member <b>35</b>′ using a pair of bolts <b>60</b>, and the handle support <b>24</b> is bolted onto the arm <b>40</b>″ of the rearward rotatable member <b>35</b>″ using a pair of bolts <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the fully folded state of the stroller <b>12</b>, both the front wheel support <b>20</b> and the handle support <b>24</b> are moved into close proximity to the rear wheel support <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in the fully folded state, the tip <b>52</b> of the head <b>50</b> is retracted and disengaged from the notch <b>38</b>′ of the forward rotatable member <b>35</b>′ and the notch <b>38</b>″ of the rearward rotatable member <b>35</b>″. In the fully folded state, both the front wheel support <b>20</b> and the handle support <b>24</b> are free to rotate independently of the other about the bolt <b>44</b> of the folding assembly <b>22</b> so that the notches <b>38</b>′ and <b>38</b>″ can be brought back into alignment with the tip <b>52</b> of the head <b>50</b> to consequently secure the stroller <b>12</b> into the fully folded state.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. For instance, the depicted implementation used the bolt <b>44</b> and nut <b>44</b><i>a </i>assembly to rotatably couple the forward rotatable member <b>35</b>′and the rearward rotatable member <b>35</b>″ together with a corresponding one of the rear wheel supports <b>30</b>. In other implementations, pivot members other than the bolt-nut assembly may be used, including pin assemblies. As another example, in the depicted implementation, the rear wheel supports <b>30</b> supported the bolt <b>44</b> on which the rotatable members <b>35</b>′ and <b>35</b>″ where rotably mounted. In other implementations, either the front wheel support <b>20</b> can support the bolt <b>44</b> and have the rotatable members <b>35</b>′ and <b>35</b>″ rotatably mounted thereon with the arms <b>40</b>′ and <b>40</b>″ each fixedly attached to one of the handle support <b>24</b> and the rear wheel support <b>30</b> such that the handle support and the rear wheel support fold about the front wheel support, or the handle support <b>24</b> can support the bolt <b>44</b> and have the rotatable members <b>35</b>′ and <b>35</b>″ rotatably mounted thereon with the arms <b>40</b>′ and <b>40</b>″ each fixedly attached to one of the front wheel supports <b>20</b> and the rear wheel support <b>30</b> such that the front wheel support and the real wheel support fold about the handle support. As a further example, the rotatable members <b>35</b>′ and <b>35</b>″ were depicted as including the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″, however, in other implementations the rotatable members <b>35</b>′ and <b>35</b>″ may have other shapes. As an additional example, the depicted implementation aligned the tip <b>52</b> of the spring loaded head <b>50</b> of each folding assembly <b>22</b> with the notches <b>38</b>′ and <b>38</b>″ of the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ to secure the stroller <b>12</b> into the fully folded state. In other implementations, each folding assemblies <b>22</b> can use a pin or other member that is inserted into holes in each of the disks <b>36</b>′ and <b>36</b>″ to hold the front wheel supports <b>20</b>, the handle supports <b>24</b>, and the rear wheel supports <b>30</b> in the unfolded state. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
