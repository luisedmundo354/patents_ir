<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of the invention is wireless information devices and more specifically wireless devices for automatically obtaining location based information related to machines when a wireless device is placed within proximity of the machines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many industries where electronic interfaces have been developed to facilitate monitoring or control or both system monitoring and control. For instance, in the industrial automation industry, a manufacturing plant may include several thousand different machines arranged to form a plurality of machine lines that cooperate to produce one or more products. In this case, each machine or a sub-set of machines may be equipped with an interface including a processor, some type of information output device and some type of information input device. The output device is often a display screen for displaying text, graphics, etc., and the input device is typically a keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because of the nature of industrial automation, some industrial facilities have adopted policies requiring at least some level of local or location specific interfacing and control. In industrial control, many (e.g., tens or perhaps even hundreds) machines may be positioned along a machine line so that improper performance of or damage to one machine affects operation of a large number of related downstream machines. In addition, improper machine operation, given unforeseen circumstances, may result in injury to facility employees proximate the malfunctioning machine or proximate downstream machines. In these cases, if remote control were allowed, an operator may adjust one machine believing that some other similar machine is being adjusted with unintended and potentially costly results.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an effort to avoid unintended results, most automated facilities require operators to be located adjacent or proximate a machine prior to altering machine operation. This proximity requirement is enforced by providing machine monitoring and controlling interfaces proximate associated machines. More specifically, the interfaces are typically placed in positions that enable an interface operator to observe machine operation prior to, during and after adjustment of machine operating characteristics. Here the interfacing is local despite remote or centralized processing. In this manner, an operator can essentially simultaneously observe operation of a particular machine and the information provided by an interface associated with the particular machine. This “dual viewing” capability facilitates a far more comprehensive understanding of machine conditions and enables the operator to quickly determine if control alterations have desired effects.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Requiring even basic interfaces at each machine or adjacent logically related sub-sets of machines is relatively expensive as each interface typically requires a display of some type and at least a set of control buttons or a keyboard of some type. To minimize costs many control systems are designed to provide pseudo-local or multiplexed control where one interface may be provided for several proximate machines. For instance, one interface may be provided for ten proximate machines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Multi-machine interfaces represent a tradeoff between cost and functionality. TO this end, as indicated above, unfortunately, the “dual viewing” (i.e., simultaneous view of a machine and an associated interface) capability afforded by providing interfaces as close as possible to associated machines is hampered when the number of interfaces is less than the number of machines within a facility. Thus, in the case above, where a single interface is provided for ten separate but proximate machines, the interface may not be located in an optimal position for observing operation of a sub-set of the ten machines while simultaneously viewing the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, where a single interface is provided for more than one machine, the interface has to be relatively more complex than an interface provided for a single machine. To this end, to avoid confusion and unintended changes to machine operation, it is generally accepted that an interface should only display information corresponding to a single machine or a related sub-set of machines at any given time. For example, where a single interface is provided for accessing information corresponding to and controlling ten logically related machines, if the interface were programmed to provide information and controls for two or more of the machines at one time, an interface operator may examine data corresponding to one of the ten machines believing that the examined data corresponds to another of the ten machines or worse, the operator may adjust control of one of the ten machines believing that the operator is controlling another of the ten machines.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To avoid this type of confusion and related control errors, multi-machine interfaces are typically programmed to so that information and control tools corresponding to only a single one of the machines associated with an interface are provided at any time. Thus, multi-machine interfaces generally require some type of machine selection process and corresponding tools that allow a user to select which of several machines the user wishes to interrogate and/or control and hence are more complex that single machine interfaces that can automatically provide information to an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, in the case of multi-machine interfaces there is always the possibility that an operator may inadvertently select one machine believing that the operator has selected another machine for monitoring or control. Here, as above, the possibility for an unintended and costly result is great.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Second, as in most businesses, in an automated facility, there are many different types of employees and machine access and control requirements for the employee types are very different. For instance, a janitor likely has no need to access machine information or control machine operation, a maintenance engineer will require access to certain machine information and control capabilities and a process engineer may require access to a completely different set of machine information and control capabilities. Systems have existed for a long time (e.g., password protection, biometric comparison, etc.) that can restrict information access and control to specific authorized personnel. Unfortunately, these systems generally require relatively complex and expensive interface devices (e.g., a complete keyboard or some type of biometric scanner). As indicated above, in automation most interfaces are minimized to reduce costs and hence the added security that comes with restricting access and control to those having a need to access and control are often foregone.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One solution to the above problems that has been used in the automation industry is to provide hand held devices (HHDs) to machine operators having a need to monitor and/or control facility machines. (Unless indicated otherwise all portable information devices hereinafter will be referred to as HHDs, including PDAs, laptops, etc.). Here, an HHD, as its label implies, is a relatively small and portable device that can be carried around a facility by a machine operator. The HHD is typically provided with a small display screen, a set of buttons or a full keyboard to enable information interchange, a processor, a memory and a connection cable having a distal end configured to be received by a machine port. Each facility machine is provided with a machine port for receiving the HHD cable. To link to a local machine processor, the HHD cable is plugged into the machine port and establishes a one to one match where there is no ambiguity regarding which machine an HHD user is obtaining information for.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Here, information access and control can be restricted by restricting access to the HHDs. Thus, for instance, when a maintenance engineer enters a facility to perform maintenance duties, the engineer may check out an HHD from a central HHD location for use in the facility. After the maintenance engineer has completed his duties, the engineer may be required to check the HHD back into the central HHD location. To restrict access and control differently for different personnel there may be classes of HHDs where each class allows a user a unique set of access and control privileges (i.e., a maintenance HHD may have a first set of capabilities while a process control HHD may have a second set of capabilities).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Unfortunately the HHD solution described above also has several shortcomings. First, the manual process of linking an HHD to a machine processor is time consuming, burdensome and costly. Again, while one or a small number of linking processes may not seem burdensome, where the process has to be repeated several hundred times during an operator's shift, the combined linking tasks become excessive. In addition, in this case there may be a safety risk where an HHD becomes untethered from a machine in some way. One other problem with these types of plugs in HHDs is that access ports for receiving a tether may not always be readily accessible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Second, where several hundred links may have to be made during a given day, the wear and tear on machine communication ports and HHD cable can be excessive and require either routine replacement or an extremely robust and expensive mechanical linking system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Third, despite support for some customization regarding the types of information and control provided to a facility employee by way of configuring HHDs as a function of the type of employee that will use the HHD, there is no easy way to allow an employee to customize the appearance of information and control tools provided by the HHD. For instance, one maintenance engineer may want a first set of information presented in a first format while another maintenance engineer may want the same first set of information presented in a second format completely different than the first format.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Fourth, any system that requires an HHD to be tethered to a machine in order to obtain information related to the machine or to control the machine restricts operator movement and may not allow an operator to move into particularly advantageous positions to observe machine operations. Also, in this regard, a mechanical tether is cumbersome to manipulate and therefore is bothersome.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Industries outside industrial automation have faced problems similar to those faced in industrial automation and have devised some solutions that are suitable to the respective industries. For instance, in the medical industry, it has been recognized that the ability to obtain information about a patient automatically upon entering the patients room is advantageous. In a medical facility, a process that requires a physician to manipulate a patient's arm to identify a patient ID on a wristband or the like and then enter the patient ID into an information device to obtain the patient's medical history is burdensome. The process may disturb a sleeping patient, requires that the physician come in close proximity to the patient, is subject to human error and is time consuming. The process is particularly burdensome in emergency situations where time may be of the essence.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">European patent application No. 0,992,921 (hereinafter “the '921 reference”) entitled “Computer Access Dependent On Location of Access Terminal” which was filed on Sep. 21, 1999 teaches a facility system wherein a separate wireless access point is positioned within each facility room for communicating with physician specific wireless HHDs located within the room. The '921 reference teaches that a physician identifier is stored in the HHD and, when an HHD is sensed within a room, the access point automatically obtains the physician identifier from the HHD, determines a degree of access (i.e., authorization) associated with the physician identifier, accesses information associated with the room (i.e., information associated with a patient within the room) and then transmits a sub-set of the patient information consistent with the physician's degree of access to the HHD for display.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The '921 solution works well in a facility that can easily be divided into cells separated by walls (i.e., patient rooms) and where there is only one set of information (i.e., information related to a single patient) associated with a particular cell. However, if a plurality of patients are located within a single room the '921 reference system cannot determine for which of the plurality of patients a physician seeks information. It is unclear how the '921 reference would resolve the quandary regarding which patient information to provide to a physician when more than one patient resides in a room. The '921 reference presents a problem where a physician may end up reviewing information corresponding to one patient while examining a different patient in the same room—clearly an unacceptable situation. In the context of an automated facility the '921 reference could not be used to select information corresponding to one machine out of a plurality of machines in a room for delivery to an HHD.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the '921 reference fails to teach or suggest any type of location specific equipment control. Failure to discuss equipment control is not surprising given the relatively course location resolution contemplated by the '921 reference.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, the '921 reference system and other systems of the same ilk require a relatively large number of access points to provide even the relatively coarse location resolution capabilities contemplated. System cost increases along with component count and therefore systems like the '921 reference system are relatively expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the office automation industry, U.S. Pat. No. 6,359,711 (hereinafter “the '711 patent”) which issued on Mar. 19, 2002 and is entitled “System and Method for Supporting A Worker In A Distributed Work Environment” teaches a system where, like the '921 reference, a single access point is located within each room in a facility. The '711 patent teaches that HHDs (i.e., laptop computers) used by specific users are provided with user identifiers. A system database correlates user identifiers with information related to applications that the specific users subscribe to or have authorization to use. In addition, the database also includes information related to office equipment located throughout a facility where the equipment is associated with specific applications. For instance, a word processor application may require access to a printer, a window treatment control application may require access to motorized blinds and an HVAC application may require access to a thermostat control.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When an HHD is brought into a room, the access point senses the HHD, obtains the user identifier therefrom, accesses the database to identify applications associated with the user identifier, identifies which office equipment types the identified applications must access, locates the single instance of each identified office equipment type that is closest to the access point and then creates a control link between the laptop and the identified equipment instances.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While suitable for an office environment, the '711 patent control scheme is not suitable for an industrial automation environment for several reasons. First, the '711 patent system, like the '921 reference system, relies on clearly delineated and identifiable facility cells (i.e., rooms) and a single access point in each cell. Like the '921 reference, the '921 patent system cannot determine relative proximity between the HHD and a plurality of machines located within a single room. For instance, where an HVAC control, a printer and a laptop are located in the same room, the '711 patent cannot determine if the laptop is closest to the HVAC control or the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Second, the '711 patent system teaches linking a laptop to the closest instance of each required equipment type independent of whether or not the instance is proximate the HHD. For instance, in the case of a word processor application requiring a printer, the '711 patent system locates a closest printer to an access point and enables control of the located printer irrespective of the distance between the printer and the laptop (i.e., the access point). Here, the printer may be five rooms away from the HHD and hence from the person operating the printer. This type of “blind” control is acceptable in the case of a printer application where the end results of an imperfect printing process is minimally costly. However, in the case of automated control of machinery, as indicated above, such blind control often cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Third, a system like the '711 patent system would cause confusion in an industrial control environment. To this end, while a particular user may have clearance to observe machine information corresponding to several different machine types and to control various machine types using various applications, simultaneously and automatically presenting information or controls corresponding to two or more machine types at a time would be confusing where only a single machine type can be controlled at any one time.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">What is really needed in the industrial automation environment is a system that can be used to clearly associate a wireless HHD within a facility with a single facility machine for monitoring and control. One way to accomplish this HHD-machine associating task is to identify machine zones adjacent each facility machine, determine when a wireless HHD is within one of the zones and then provide machine information to the HHD corresponding to the machine associated with the zone for presentation to the HHD user. This method of associating cannot be achieved without precise location resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">World patent application No. WO 00/50919 (hereinafter “the '919 reference”) which is titled “Method and Computer Readable Medium for Locating and Tracking a User in a Wireless Network Using a Table of Digital Data” teaches one system that can be used to relatively accurately determine location within a specific space or within a room. To this end, the '919 reference teaches a plurality of base stations or access points can be installed at locations within a facility. The access points each transmit signals of known strength to mobile HHDs within the facility. The strengths of the signals decrease as a function of distance traveled. The HHDs each receive the transmitted signals and, based on signal strengths of several of the received signals, determine the location of the HHDs within the facility.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">World patent application No. WO 02/054813 (hereinafter “the '813 reference”) titled “Location Estimation in Wireless Telecommunication Networks” teaches a location system similar to the system described in the '919 reference that relies on signal strength to determine location of a portable device within a facility. The '813 reference, however, applies a statistical model to the received signals to, supposedly, yield a far more accurate device location.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While each of the '919 reference and the '813 reference teach location determining systems that have better resolution than the room based systems described in the '921 reference and the '711 patent, it is likely that even with the increased resolution capabilities afforded by the '919 reference or the '813 reference, the location resolution requirements for a secure wireless industrial control cannot be achieved for several reasons. First, even where a signal strength based system supports relatively accurate location resolution throughout most of a facility, it may be that an unusually large number of moving metallic machines reside in certain facility areas that may introduce errors into transmitted signals thereby appreciably affecting received signal strengths. In this case, at least in areas including unusually large numbers of machines or machines having odd layouts, location position may not be accurately determined using the '919 and '813 reference systems.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Second, many industrial facilities are laid out according to space saving schemes that require adjacent machines to be juxtaposed relatively close to each other. In these cases machine zones corresponding to two or more adjacent machines may overlap so that, even a properly operating high resolution location determining system could not distinguish which machine information is sought in the overlapping region. Thus, for instance, assume that a location determining system identifies that an HHD is located in a space that is overlapped by three adjacent machine zones, here, the HHD may be provided with information corresponding to any one of the three machines corresponding to any one of the three overlapping zones.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Third, even where machine zones can be selected so that the machine zones do not overlap, many practical location determining systems may not be accurate enough to distinguish between adjacent zones. For instance, locating systems based on signal strength may only be able to distinguish general location within a room such as in which of four room regions an HHD resides or in which of sixteen equi-sized room regions an HHD resides or in which of 100 facility regions an HHD resides where each of the regions may includes several different machines.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, there may be situations where a single area is associated with more than one machine zone. For instance, a transfer line may move items along a path adjacent thirty different machines. In this case it may make sense to be able to observe information corresponding to the transfer line at any location along the line and to observe information for each machine only adjacent each machine. Similarly, it may make sense to enable an HHD user to observe a machine or machine line layout map for a facility area from any space within the area or to observe machine specific information for one or more machines proximate an HHD user's specific location within the area.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Thus, it would be advantageous to have a system that could be used to unambiguously identify a machine for which information is sought and then associate an HHD and the machine so that machine specific information is obtainable with minimal HHD operator effort.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It has been recognized that a location determining system can be combined with minimal effort from a wireless information device (WID) user to unambiguously form an association between a WID and a facility machine so that machine information can be displayed via the WID. To this end, in one embodiment of the invention the location determining system can generally determine WID location and narrow down the possible machines form within a facility region form which a user may seek information. Thereafter, the WID can present machine options to the user and enable the user to make a final and unambiguous decision regarding which machine's information to present via the WID. Once a machine is selected via the WID, the WID presents the corresponding machine information.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, one object of the present invention is to unambiguously associate a WID with a machine. This object is accomplished by employing a simple solution where the WID user elects one of several possible machines for WID-machine association.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One other object is to provide an associating system that is relatively inexpensive. To this end, the location resolution of the location determining system needn't be extremely accurate and therefore overall system cost can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another object is to minimize the effort required of a WID user in forming the association. To this end, the above embodiment of the invention only requires that the WID user make a single machine selection and thereafter machine information is automatically provided via the WID.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one aspect the inventive system may assign probabilities to each machine that is identified as a possible machine in a region form which a WID user may want information and then display machine identifiers in a manner that indicates the assigned probabilities to facilitate easy machine selection. Probabilities may be based on WID location (i.e., where the locating system can identify relative WID-machine proximities), WID identification (i.e., a maintenance WID may most likely seek information from one or two or a small number of machine types), a machine type selection made via a WID, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Probability assignments may be earmarked via different fonts, font colors, font sizes, identifier order (i.e., the most probable identifier at the top of a list), etc. In at least one embodiment the information corresponding to the machine associated with the most probable identifier may be displayed automatically along with the most probable identifier while the less probable identifiers are displayed in some less prominent manner for selection. Here, where the user wishes to elect information corresponding to a machine other than the machine corresponding to the most probable identifier, the user simply selects the corresponding identifier and the information related thereto is automatically provided.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once WID-machine association is formed and machine information is displayed, in at least one embodiment of the invention the system monitors WID location and, when the WID is removed from within a zone corresponding to the machine associated with the displayed information, the information presentation is altered by, for instance, indicating that the WID has been removed from the machine zone, removing the machine information from the display or in some other suitable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Consistent with the above, at least some embodiments of the invention include a method for identifying one of several different machines from within a facility for which information is to be presented via a wireless information device (WID), the method for use with a facility having a location identifying system capable of generally identifying WID location within the facility, the facility also including a wireless information system for transmitting information to a WID, a controller linked to the wireless information system and including a controller memory and a plurality of machines, machine information stored in the controller memory. Here, the method may comprise the steps of assigning machine identifiers to each facility machine, determining WID location within the facility, presenting machine identifiers corresponding to machines associated with the WID location to the WID user, receiving a selection indication via the WID indicating one of the visually presented machine identifiers, accessing machine information corresponding to the selected machine identifier, transmitting the accessed machine information to the WID and presenting the accessed machine information via the WID.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, some embodiments of the method include the steps of assigning machine identifiers to each facility machine, assigning machine zones to at least a sub-set of the machines within the facility where each machine zone corresponds to a space within the facility in which it is suitable for a WID user to access information for an associated machine, storing the WID identifiers and correlated machine zones in the controller memory, determining WID location within the facility, accessing the machine zones within the controller memory and identifying if the WID is within at least one machine zone, where the WID is within at least one machine zone, identifying an identifier sub-set including machine identifiers associated with each zone in which the WID currently resides, transmitting the identifier sub-set to the WID and presenting the identifier sub-set to the WID user.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, according to some embodiments the method includes determining WID location within the facility, identifying a sub-set of the facility machines proximate the WID location and presenting the machine sub-set via the WID.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Other embodiments of the invention include assigning machine identifiers to each facility machine, determining WID location within the facility, presenting a machine identifier sub-set including machine identifiers corresponding to machines associated with the WID location to the WID user and repeating steps b and c to update the presented identifier sub-set as a function of WID location.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">These and other objects, advantages and aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description. In the description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which there is shown a preferred embodiment of the invention. Such embodiment does not necessarily represent the full scope of the invention and reference is made therefore, to the claims herein for interpreting the scope of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to similar elements throughout the several views and, more specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the present invention will be described in the context of an exemplary, albeit simplified, manufacturing facility <b>10</b> that includes a rectilinear facility floor space or area <b>14</b> confined by four facility walls collectively identified by numeral <b>12</b>.

For example, machine M<b>4</b> is illustrated as having a much larger physical footprint than machine M<b>8</b> . Similarly, machine M<b>11</b> is a relatively long machine when compared to the other illustrated machines. Hereinafter, it will be assumed that machine M<b>11</b> is a transfer line. In general, machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> are spaced out within area <b>14</b> although, in some cases, machines may be positioned directly next to each other such as, for instance, machines M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> or machine M<b>11</b> and other machines M<b>7</b> , M<b>8</b> , M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>it is contemplated that each of machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> includes at least one and, in many cases, a plurality of sensing devices (not illustrated) that sense machine operating characteristics and provide signals that can be used to facilitate machine monitoring via an interface (i.e., a WID). For instance, in the case of a drilling machine, sensors may include limit switches that are tripped when a drill slide reaches various positions along a travel path, on/off switches, speed sensing switches, motor operating characteristic sensors, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition to including sensing devices, it is contemplated that most, if not all, of machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> will includes some type of control interface to facilitate control and control adjustment. For example, again, in the case of a drilling machine, drill slide stroke length may be altered, drill speed may be altered, the angle at which a drill bit enters a work piece may be altered, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, in addition to the components described above, facility <b>10</b> also includes a plurality of communication access points <b>11</b>, a system processor/controller <b>38</b>, a database <b>40</b>, at least one wireless information device (WID) <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>and a plurality of two-way data buses <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>42</b>. Unless indicated otherwise WIDs will be generally referred to by reference <b>30</b><i>a </i>hereafter. Controller <b>38</b> may be positioned within facility <b>10</b> or may be located at some remote location such as, for instance, in a separate building, in a separate room within the facility that includes area <b>14</b> or at a completely different location such as a remote campus associated with facility <b>10</b>. In addition, in many industrial environments, controller <b>38</b> will be physically associated with specific machine lines so that the controller <b>38</b> may be positioned, for instance, at the front end of a line of machines to facilitate easy access to machine operating characteristics adjacent the machines and/or to allow operating characteristics to be altered in a proximate manner. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, controller <b>38</b> is linked to each of machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> via a two-way data bus <b>34</b> that allows controller <b>38</b> to monitor machine operating characteristics as well as control machine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Controller <b>38</b> is typically a processor based workstation capable of running various types of computer programs. For instance, some programs are machine control programs that enable controller <b>38</b> to either separately control each machine M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> or, safely and precisely sequence machine operation thereby allowing relatively complex manufacturing processes to be performed in an efficient manner. In addition, other controller programs may allow controller <b>38</b> to derive various machine operating characteristics from monitored or sensed characteristics (e.g., motor voltage and current data is useful to derive stator and rotor resistance estimates, system inductances, identify harmonics, determine system torques, etc.) and to run complex algorithms to identify operating trends, alarm conditions, potentially unsafe conditions, maintenance requirements, raw material requirements and so on. Moreover, controller <b>38</b> also runs programs that facilitate data management and warehousing so that subsequent algorithms may be applied to warehoused data to identify historical operating patterns for various purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, controller <b>38</b> runs programs designed to facilitate interfacing with facility operators (e.g., maintenance personnel, process engineers, etc.) thereby providing control capabilities and system monitoring capabilities. To this end, controller <b>38</b> may include its own input and output interfacing devices such as a display screen, a keyboard, a pointing and selecting device such as a mouse or trackball or any other types of interfacing devices known in the art. Although not illustrated, other interfacing devices may be provided within facility <b>10</b> to enable monitoring and control.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Controller <b>38</b> is linked via two-way data bus <b>42</b> to data base <b>40</b>. Controller programs are stored in database <b>40</b>. In addition, data generated by controller <b>38</b> is stored in database <b>40</b> and can be accessed to allow examination of historical machine operating characteristics, real time operating characteristics and any other data generated by algorithms performed by controller <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, each information access point <b>11</b> includes a two-way wireless transceiver that, as well known in the computer arts, is capable of transmitting and receiving electromagnetic (e.g., radio or infrared) signals within an area proximate the transceiver. Wireless transceivers like access points <b>11</b> are well known in the industry and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, will not be described here in detail. For the purposes of the present invention, it should suffice to say that each transceiver <b>11</b> transmits information signals which decrease in strength as distances from the transceiver increase. In the illustrated example, six separate access points <b>11</b> are provided within area <b>14</b> and are generally equi-spaced within area <b>14</b>. Typically, access points <b>11</b> will be mounted on the ceiling within an area <b>14</b> to allow relatively unobstructed communication between an access point <b>11</b> and other devices that communicate therewith. While access points <b>11</b> are illustrated as being substantially equi-spaced within area <b>14</b>, it should be appreciated that other access point arrangements are contemplated and that, in many cases, other access point arrangements may be most suitable given specific machine layouts, the physical characteristics of each machine and machine zone layouts (described below).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Controller <b>38</b> is linked to each access point <b>11</b> via a two-way data bus <b>36</b> which allows controller <b>38</b> to receive information from the access points <b>11</b> and also allows controller <b>38</b> to provide information to each of the access points <b>11</b> for transmission within area <b>14</b>. Information received from each access point <b>11</b> is typically tagged by the access point so that controller <b>38</b> can determine which access point <b>11</b> provided the received information. This tagging may either be performed by access point <b>11</b> earmarking data packets with an access point identifier (e.g., an access point number) or, in the alternative, may be facilitated by simply providing separate hardwires from each of the access points <b>11</b> to the controller <b>38</b>. In a similar fashion, controller <b>38</b> and access points <b>11</b> are configured such that controller <b>38</b> can address information to each separate and specific access point <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, each WID (e.g., <b>30</b><i>a</i>) is generally a wireless handheld device that includes a transceiver like the transceivers that comprise access points <b>11</b> so that the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>can wirelessly transmit information and can wirelessly receive information via electromagnetic communication or some other suitable wireless communication. Thus, generally, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is equipped to communicate with any access point <b>11</b> in area <b>14</b>. It should be appreciated that, while the illustrated area <b>14</b> is relatively small, many industrial facilities may include much larger spaces such as, for instance, spaces including tens of thousands of square feet. In these cases, it is contemplated that the transmitting distance of a typical WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>will be insufficient to transmit information to all access points within a facility. In other words, while WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be able to communicate with each access point <b>11</b> within a facility, communication will be limited by signal strength capabilities and reliable transmissions will require a WID proximate access points.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To facilitate a good understanding of the present invention some phrases should be defined. To this end, unless indicated otherwise, hereinafter the phrase “access information” will be used to refer to machine operating characteristics and other machine data derived therefrom, either real time or historical. The phrase “access specification” will be used to refer to a specification that includes information that can be used by a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to present access information in a specific way (i.e., an access specification defines screen shots or presentations). Similarly, the phrase “control information” will be used to refer to information necessary to facilitate machine control. For instance, to adjust the stroke of a drill slide a WID operator must first know the current stroke limits—the current stroke settings comprise control information. In addition, the phrase “control specification” is used hereinafter to refer to a specification that includes information useable by a WID to present control information and to configure WID input devices to receive control input commands.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For instance, a control specification may associate certain WID buttons with specific control commands such as increase speed or decrease speed. In these cases the control specification may also include instructions to be displayed to a WID user that explain the button-function association. In the alternative, a control specification may define pull-down menus, control icons, touch screen buttons, etc., to be displayed via a WID screen. Here the control specification would also associate the screen selection tools with specific control functions. The screen and other types of control inputs will generally be referred to hereinafter as control tools.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, according to at least one embodiment of the present invention, sub-spaces within area <b>14</b> are earmarked or identified as machine zones associated with each of the separate machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, machines M<b>1</b>and M<b>2</b> are illustrated along with sub-spaces within space <b>14</b> (not marked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>) that are earmarked or identified as machine zones associated with each of machines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>. The machine zones associated with machines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are identified by numeral <b>43</b> and <b>47</b>, respectively and a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is illustrated as being located within zone <b>43</b>. Here it will be assumed that, ideally, information associated with machines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> is only accessible via a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>when the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is within the associated zone <b>43</b> or <b>47</b>, thus ensuring that a WID user is proximate and perhaps in a “preferred” position with respect to each of the machines when accessing information associated with the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It will also be assumed that the WID locating system is incapable of precisely locating a WID with a facility area <b>14</b> either because of inherent shortcomings in the system design or because of environmental characteristics that may cause system noise and hence locating errors. Moreover, it will be assumed that the location determining system can only narrow WID location down to within a relatively large WID position zone identified by numeral <b>49</b>. It should be appreciated that the size of zone <b>49</b> may be location dependent and, more specifically, may depend on access point layout, location specific facility characteristics (e.g., metallic members in floors, walls, ceilings, machine orientation), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, because the location determining system has relatively poor resolution capabilities, it is difficult for the location determining system to determine if the WID is within one of the small machine zones (e.g., <b>43</b> or <b>47</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>) or even to distinguish between proximate relatively small ideal machine zones. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, with WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>located in zone <b>43</b>, the system can only determine that WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is somewhere within larger zone <b>49</b> which includes each of machine M<b>1</b> zone <b>43</b> and a part of machine M<b>2</b> zone <b>47</b>. Thus, the location determining system cannot alone determine if WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located within one of the machine zones.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, according to at least one embodiment of the present invention, when machine zone ambiguity occurs, a WID user is provided tools to help resolve the ambiguity in a simple manner. For instance, in one embodiment, controller <b>38</b> identifies all machine zones (e.g., <b>43</b> and <b>47</b>) that at least in part overlap a current WID position zone <b>49</b> and provides machine identifiers corresponding to associated machines (e.g., M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> ) via the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to a user for selection. Thus, the system automatically widdles down the universe of possible machines for which information might be sought to a proximate machine subset and then requests that the WID user make an affirmative selection prior to providing machine information.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, in another embodiment, larger machine zones <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> may be specified for each of machines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, respectively. In this case, controller <b>38</b> may be programmed to assume that WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is in the middle of the WID position zone (see again zone <b>49</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>). Thereafter, as above, controller <b>38</b> identifies each of the larger machine zones (e.g., <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>) in which the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>resides and again offers zone options (e.g., associated machine identifiers for WID user selection). As illustrated, the larger zones <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> will generally surround the smaller ideal zones <b>43</b> and <b>47</b>, respectively. Also, as illustrated, the larger zones may have different sizes that depend upon machine and environmental characteristics, ideal zone size, etc. In these cases, while a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may not be within the ideal zones associated with the machines (e.g., zones <b>43</b> and <b>47</b>), by requiring an affirmative WID user selection process, ambiguity regarding which information is sought is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While described above in the context of a location determining system that has relatively poor resolution, it should be appreciated that the inventive system and method may have applications in systems that can determine location relatively accurately. In this regard, in some cases two or more “ideal” information access machine zones may overlap therefore making it essentially impossible for a controller to determine independently for which of two or more machines a WID user may seek information. For instance, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, a small and ideal control machine zone <b>33</b> is earmarked adjacent one side of machine M<b>9</b>. In addition a large but nevertheless ideal transfer line zone <b>23</b> associated with machine M<b>11</b> is illustrated where the transfer line zone <b>23</b> wholly includes control zone <b>33</b> associated with machine M<b>9</b>. In this case, when a WID (e.g., see WID <b>30</b><i>b</i>) is within zone <b>33</b> (and hence is also within zone <b>23</b>), without input from a WID user the system cannot identify and provide desired information. Here the system provides at lease two machine identifier selections corresponding to machines M<b>9</b> and M<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, one option for a WID users within an area <b>14</b>, in addition to observing machine information for a specific machine, may be to obtain area wide information such as a machine map similar to the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>or production statistics for the overall area or to observe sub-area information such as machine line layout (e.g., information for one of four machine lines within area <b>14</b>). In this case, area and sub-area zones may be specified and stored for access via controller <b>38</b> where the area and sub-area zones overlap machine zones and/or each other. For instance, an area zone in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>may correspond to entire area <b>14</b> while a sub-area zone corresponding to the machine line including machines M<b>7</b>-M<b>11</b> may include zone <b>23</b>. Here, when a WID is within the area zone or a sub-area zone, other options, in addition to location based machine identifiers that may be presented to the user for selection may include an area identifier and one or more sub-area identifiers. As indicated above, each machine zone corresponds to a small region within area <b>14</b> in which it has been deemed suitable for a system operator (e.g., maintenance engineer) to access machine operating characteristics and/or control the machine associated with a particular zone. For instance, when a system operator is within zone <b>22</b> it may be suitable for the operator to access operating characteristics corresponding to machine M<b>2</b> . Similarly, it may only be deemed suitable for an operator to control machine M<b>1</b> when the operator is physically present within zone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">While area and sub-area zones are contemplated by the present invention, in order to simplify the present explanation, unless indicated otherwise, zones will generally be referred to as machine zones (i.e., the phrase “machine zones” will be used to refer to all types of specified zones including machine zones, area zones and sub-area zones).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, four separate and large machine zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>23</b> corresponding to machines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>4</b> and M<b>1</b> are illustrated. Although not illustrated, it is contemplated that other zones would be associated with each of machines M<b>3</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b> and M<b>7</b> through M<b>10</b>. Because zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> overlap, it is difficult to schematically distinguish one zone from another. To help distinguish overlapping zones, specific points or locations within area <b>14</b> are earmarked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>with the letter “P” followed by a location specific number (e.g., P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, etc). Machine M<b>1</b> and zone <b>20</b> includes the rectilinear space defined by points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> and P<b>4</b>. Similarly, machine M<b>2</b> space <b>22</b> includes the space defined by pints P<b>5</b>, P<b>6</b>, P<b>7</b> and P<b>8</b> while machine M<b>4</b> space <b>26</b> includes the space defined by points P<b>9</b>, P<b>10</b>, P<b>11</b> and P<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, various parts of zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> overlap so that there are spaces where a location is within two zones and other spaces where a location is within all three zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>. In addition, there are also locations that are only within a single one of zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> or <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, single vertically or horizontally hatched zones (e.g., <b>26</b>) include area that are within only one of zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>, angled hatched zones (e.g., <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>) include areas within two of the zones and the vertically/horizontally hatched area <b>29</b> includes an area that is within all three of zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>. In the illustrated example, when WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located within area <b>29</b>, the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>presents/displays three machine identifier options corresponding to machines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and M<b>4</b>. Similarly, when in other locations inside one of zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> or <b>26</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>presents/displays one or two of the machine options, depending on WID location.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">An exemplary WID screen shot <b>170</b> that provides a machine identifier selection list for a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>located within space <b>29</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The screen shot <b>170</b> includes an instruction box <b>172</b> to guide the WID user in making a selection, a machine identifier list <b>174</b> that lists identifiers in ascending order (e.g., smallest identifier number first) and a user controllable selection icon <b>176</b> to select one of the identifiers in list <b>174</b>. Although only three identifiers are provided in list <b>174</b>, many more identifiers may be provided if additional machine zones overlap a specific WID location.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In cases where WID location can be determined relatively precisely and where the selection process is provided to allow a user to distinguish between overlapping zones and associated machines, it is contemplated that more than one machine zone type may be specified for a sub-set of the machines or for each of the facility machines. To this end, in at least one embodiment, two different types of machine zones are contemplated including control zones and access zones. Control zones are typically relatively small regions proximate associated machines where, when a system operator is within the control zone, the operator is in a particularly advantageous position with respect to the machine to visually observe important operating characteristics of the machine and to observe the effects on machine operation that are caused by control modification. For example, with respect to machine M<b>11</b>, the best and perhaps the only region in which to observe machine operation sufficiently during control modification may include small control zone <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">It should be appreciated that each type of machine within a facility <b>10</b> will have different physical characteristics and therefore suitable control zones will be machine type specific. For instance, while a small zone <b>24</b> corresponds to machine M<b>11</b>, the control zone corresponding to machine M<b>6</b> may include space on all sides of machine M<b>6</b>. It should also be appreciated that there may be some machines where the machine simply operates and no control zone is provided. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>machine M<b>8</b>may not be associated with a control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, zone <b>23</b> is referred to as an access zone. As its label implies, an access zone is a region in which it has been deemed suitable for a system operator to access or monitor an associated machine's operating characteristics (i.e., access information). For instance, when an operator is within zone <b>23</b> it is suitable for the operator to access operating characteristics of machine M<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As illustrated, typically, an access zone will be larger than the control zone corresponding to a single machine. For instance, access zone <b>23</b> is much larger than control zone <b>35</b> corresponding to machine M<b>11</b>. Access zones are larger than associated control zones because, generally, characteristic access or monitoring is much safer than machine control and an operator may wish to move about a machine while observing real time operating characteristics from various vantage points.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, it is contemplated that within a control zone like zone <b>35</b>, a system operator should be able to access either control information or access information or access both control and access information at the same time. Thus, for instance, in at least some embodiments of the invention, within zone <b>35</b>, an operator can access control and/or access information corresponding to machine M<b>11</b> while within zone <b>23</b> the operator can only obtain access information corresponding to machine M<b>11</b>. In control zones where both access and control information may be accessed, in some cases both types of information will be accessed simultaneously if suitable. In other cases it is contemplated that a WID operator may be provided with some type of button, selectable icon, etc., to toggle back and forth between access information and control information.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In cases where WID location cannot be determined precisely and therefore a system is incapable of determining when a WID is within a small control zone, the WID may simply provide control and access options to the WID user when appropriate (i.e., when the user is authorized to control a machine, after a specific machine identifier has been selected by the user or when the user enters a space that is associated with a single machine zone). For instance, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, assume WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>first provides a selection list screen shot like shot <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Thereafter, assuming the WID user selects the fourth machine M<b>4</b> identifier and that the WID user is authorized to access both control and access information for machine M<b>4</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>provides a second selection screen shot requiring the WID user to select either access or control information. Upon receiving either an access or control selection, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>presents the sought information. As another instance, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located within the single horizontally hatched portion of zone <b>26</b> that is only associated with machine M<b>4</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may simply skip providing the first selection screen and directly provide the access/control selection screen. Thus, here, instead of relying on the system to enforce control rules related to proximately to essentially ensure that the user is controlling an intended machine, the affirmative control selection process ensures that the WID user is aware of a current WID-machine association and corresponding control capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition to access zones and control zones, a third zone type may be associated with at least a sub-set of machines. Here, it is contemplated that, in order to establish an association with a machine and hence obtain machine information, it may be desirable to require that an operator be relatively proximate (e.g., immediately adjacent) the machine but that, after the association has been established, it may be prudent to allow the operator to access machine information at locations relatively less proximate the machine. For instance, to initially associate with a machine and obtain access information an operator may have to be within five feet of the machine and thereafter, to continue to associate with the machine the operator may have to remain in a larger area including all space within fifteen feet of the machine. The larger zone of association described here is generally referred to as a “hysteresis zone”.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Herein it will be assumed that entire area <b>14</b> comprises an access hysteresis zone for transfer line M<b>11</b>. Thus, after being located within zone <b>23</b> and associating a WID <b>30</b><i>b </i>with machine M<b>11</b>, if the WID <b>30</b><i>b </i>is removed from zone <b>23</b> and while remaining in area <b>14</b>, the access information associated with machine M<b>11</b> will continue to be displayed, in at least one embodiment, until a WID operator takes some affirmation step to either disassociate the WID and machine M<b>11</b>or to associate the WID with some other machine, area or sub-area. The hysteresis zone associated with area <b>14</b> is an “access” hysteresis zone meaning that only access information, not control information, is accessible within the zone. Control hysteresis zones are also contemplated by the present invention although none are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As indicated above, in some embodiments of the invention at least some of the hysteresis zones may include portions of machine zones or the entirety of machine zones associated with other machines. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the hysteresis zone (i.e., area <b>14</b>) associated with machine M<b>11</b> also includes the space surrounding the other machines in area <b>14</b>. This overlapping feature enables a WID user to travel among related proximate machines so that, for instance, operating characteristics corresponding to a first machine (e.g., M<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) can be observed while adjacent a second related machine (e.g., M<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>). Here, it is contemplated that in most environments overlapping hysteresis zones would be limited to access information and not control information to ensure that machine control remain localized.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In at least one embodiment of the invention no physical markers are provided within area <b>14</b> to distinguish control and access zones and instead the zones are earmarked electronically on a facility map that resembles the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>and that is stored in database <b>40</b> for access by controller <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Generally, according to the present invention and referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, controller <b>38</b> controls access and control information provided to WIDs <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>within facility <b>10</b> to ensure that machine access and control only takes place within the zones specified by the facility map stored in database <b>40</b>. To this end, according to some embodiments of the invention, when a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located within facility <b>10</b> and is turned on, controller <b>38</b>, access points <b>11</b> and WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>cooperate to determine approximate WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>location within facility <b>10</b>. Once WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>location has been approximated, controller <b>38</b> accesses the facility map in database <b>40</b> and determines if the approximated location is within one of the control or access zones corresponding to a specific machine. If the approximated location is within overlapping zones corresponding to two or more machines, areas or sub-areas, controller <b>38</b> identifies machine identifiers corresponding to the machines and provides those identifiers to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>for display. When a machine identifier selection is provided via WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>transmits the selection along with a WID identifier to an access point <b>11</b> and thereby to controller <b>38</b>. Thereafter, controller <b>38</b> accesses access and/or control information corresponding to a specific machine associated with the zone and wirelessly provides that information to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>via a proximate access point <b>11</b>. An operator can either access and monitor machine operation or, if within a control zone, may provide commands to controller <b>38</b> via proximate access points <b>11</b> to change machine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, in at least some embodiments of the invention, after access or control information has been provided to a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>within a specific zone, if the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is removed from the zone, the system determines that the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>has been removed from the zone and will limit the access or control information in some fashion. For instance, in one embodiment, when a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is removed from a control zone (e.g., <b>35</b>), the control information is simply no longer provided via the WID <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In addition, in at least one embodiment, when control information is rendered inaccessible via WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a message may be provided to the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>operator indicating that the operator has left the control zone corresponding to the associated machine. In a similar fashion, when a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is removed from an access zone, some type of informational limitation may take place, such as rendering the access information inaccessible via the WID, indicating that the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>has been removed from the access zone while still providing the access information, etc. In at least one embodiment, access information corresponding to one machine may continue to be provided by a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>until the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is taken into another machine zone. In other embodiments access information is provided as long as the WID remains within a hysteresis zone.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, a perspective view of an exemplary WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is illustrated. Other components of exemplary WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. Exemplary WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>includes, generally, a plurality of components that are mounted within a hardened plastic or metallic housing identified by numeral <b>32</b>. WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>components include a processor <b>71</b>, an input device (e.g., keyboard <b>36</b>), a display screen <b>34</b>, a speaker <b>51</b> for audio output, a transceiver <b>38</b> and a memory <b>69</b>. Processor <b>71</b> is linked to each of the input device, display screen <b>34</b>, speaker <b>51</b>, transceiver <b>38</b> and memory <b>69</b> for communication therewith. Processor <b>71</b> is equipped to run various programs for both displaying information via screen <b>34</b> and for receiving control signals and communicating those control signals to access points <b>11</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) via transceiver <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The input device may include any of several different types of input components including a typical push-button keyboard <b>36</b>, separate selection buttons <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, a rocker-type selection button <b>44</b>, and/or selectable icons that may be provided via display screen <b>34</b> such as, for instance, icons <b>45</b>. It is contemplated that, in at least one embodiment, a pointing cursor <b>46</b> may be movable about screen <b>34</b> and placed over one of the selectable icons (e.g., <b>45</b>) after which a conventional type mouse clicking action may be used to select one of the icons to cause some display or control function to occur. In other embodiments display <b>34</b> may comprise a touch screen where icons are selectable via a stylus or the tip of an operators finger.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Display screen <b>34</b> may be any type of conventional display screen suitable for a handheld device and, for example, may be equipped to display numeric information, icons, graphs such as graph <b>47</b>, bar charts, or any other type of monitoring and control information that may be associated with facility machines.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Speaker <b>51</b> is a conventional small audio output speaker which may be used for any purpose such as providing an audible indication when a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is removed from a zone, providing operating characteristics in an audible manner, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Transceiver <b>38</b> is mounted proximate the top end of housing <b>32</b>. As in the case of the transceivers that comprise access points <b>11</b>, transceiver <b>38</b> is capable of transmitting electromagnetic signals and also receiving such signals so that information can be provided to controller <b>38</b> or received from controller <b>38</b> via access points <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Memory <b>69</b> stores the programs performed by processor <b>71</b> and also, in at least some embodiments of the invention, stores a WID identifier (e.g., a WID number, a WID user identification number, etc.). It is contemplated that some WIDs <b>30</b><i>a </i>may only be configured to provide access information and, in this case, the programs stored in memory <b>69</b> may only be access type programs. Where a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is equipped with control capabilities, control programs are stored in memory <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition to enforcing zone rules for each facility machine, it is contemplated that, in at least one embodiment of the invention, controller <b>38</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) and associated system components may also be used to enforce information restriction requirements within a facility. To this end, as in many industries, in the industrial automation industry, there are many different facility employee types that have access to facility machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b>. Each of the facility employee types will typically perform specific tasks with respect to facility machines and, to that end, require specific types of information, specific information layouts and/or specific control capabilities. For instance, in the case of a maintenance engineer, the maintenance engineer may require the capability to cause machines to run through specific machining sequences that are different than sequences that a process engineer may require. In this case, it is desirable to restrict the process engineer from performing the maintenance type control sequences while enabling the maintenance engineer to perform those sequences. Similarly, often a process engineer will require the ability to modify machine control characteristics in a fashion that is different than would be required by a maintenance engineer and, to that end, the process engineer's WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be provided with certain functionality that the maintenance engineer's WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is not. Furthermore, even amongst maintenance engineers, there may be certain engineers that require greater control latitude than other engineers and, in fact, some lower level maintenance engineers may be completely restricted from machine control and only be allowed to access or monitor machine operating characteristics. Here WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>capabilities can be used to enforce facility access and control requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an authorization/preferences specification <b>39</b> that may be stored in database <b>40</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) is illustrated. Exemplary specification <b>39</b> includes six separate columns including a WID # column <b>130</b>, a machine # column <b>132</b>, an access authority # column <b>134</b>, an access specification column <b>135</b>, a control authority column <b>136</b> and a control specification column <b>138</b>. As its label implies WID # column <b>130</b> lists a separate identifier or number corresponding to each of the WIDs <b>30</b> usable within a facility <b>10</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there are <b>1</b> through XX WIDs listed in column <b>130</b> and the identifiers are numbered <b>1</b> through XX.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As its label implies, machine # column <b>132</b> includes a list of all facility machines that can either be controlled or monitored via a WID for each WID identified in column <b>130</b>. For instance, machines M<b>1</b> through MNNN are listed for WID #<b>1</b>, machines M<b>1</b>-MNNN are separately listed for WID #<b>2</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Access authority column <b>134</b> indicates, for each WID number and machine number combination in columns <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>, whether or not the WID in column <b>130</b> has access authority for the machine in column <b>132</b>. In column <b>134</b> a “Y” designator indicates at least some level of access authority while an “N” designation indicates no access authority for the particular WID- machine combination. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, WID #<b>1</b> has at least some level of access authority for machines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>7</b>, M<b>8</b> and MNNN and has no access authority for machines M<b>3</b> and M<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">For WID number and machine number combinations where at least some level of access authority is allowed, different levels of access authority are identified by a qualifying number following each “Y” designation. To this end, in the exemplary specification <b>39</b>, a “1” qualifier indicates full access authority meaning that the particular WID in column <b>130</b> can be used to access all information corresponding to the particular machine in column <b>132</b>. Higher number qualifiers such as 2, 3, 4, etc., indicate lesser levels of access authority. For example, as illustrated in row <b>142</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, WID #<b>1</b> has complete access authority for machine M<b>1</b> while, as illustrated in row by <b>140</b>, WID #<b>1</b> has a second level of access authority (i.e., Y-<b>2</b>) for machine M<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Access specification column <b>135</b> provides information that indicates how access information corresponding to a particular WID-machine combination from columns <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> should be displayed via the WID and may include, for instance, WID user preferences. For instance, two maintenance engineers may find different views of the same access information most helpful and information specifying preferred views is stored in the specification column <b>135</b>. Default access specifications are contemplated in column <b>135</b> an “LOA” designator means that an associated WID lacks authority to access access information for the associated machine (i.e., LOA=“Lack Of Authority”).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, control authority column <b>136</b> is similar to access authority column <b>134</b> and, to that end, includes “Y” and “N” designators and numerical qualifiers to indicate whether or not particular WIDs in column <b>130</b> have control authority and the degree of control authority those WIDs have over machines in column <b>132</b>. For instance, WID #<b>1</b> has a relatively low level control authority (i.e., Y-<b>4</b>) over machine #M<b>1</b>, has no control authority over machine #M<b>2</b>, no control authority over machine #M<b>3</b>, and so on. Note that with respect to at least some machines in column <b>132</b>, some WIDs in column <b>130</b> may have access authority and not have control authority. For example, see row <b>144</b> where WID #<b>1</b> has complete access authority over machine #M<b>2</b> and has no control authority over machine #M<b>2</b>. Also note that different WIDs in column <b>130</b> have different levels of access authority and control authority over the same machines. For instance, in row <b>148</b>, WID #<b>2</b> has a low level (i.e., Y=<b>8</b>) of access authority in column <b>134</b> over machine #M<b>1</b> while WID #<b>1</b> has a high level of access authority over machine #M<b>1</b>. These different authority levels reflect the different information needs of facility employees. Also note that the same WID may have a high level of access authority and a low level of control authority over a specific machine (e.g., see row <b>149</b> where WID #<b>2</b> has high level access and low level control over machine #M<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Note that it is possible that, for a specific WID, the WID may not be authorized to obtain any information with respect to certain facility machines. In this case it is contemplated that some type of indicator would be provided to the WID user via the WID indicating lack of authority.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The control specification column <b>138</b> includes sets of preferences that indicate how control information should be displayed via a WID display for particular WID types or WID users. It is contemplated that the overall system may include canned control views that can be selected by WID users and that are then used to update the control specifications in column <b>138</b>. In the alternative, it is also contemplated that, in at least some embodiments, some type of customization of views may be facilitated via either a WID <b>30</b><i>c </i>or some other type of commissioning interface such as a stationary PC, a dedicated controller <b>38</b> interface, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Access and control authority may be assigned to specific WIDs in any of several different manners. For example, it is contemplated that some facilities may include WIDs that are used by many different facility employees where, when an employee enters a facility <b>10</b>, the employee checks out an appropriate WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>from a central dispatch station. In this case, WIDs having certain capabilities would be checked out to appropriate employees. For instance, one type of maintenance WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be checked out to a particular maintenance engineer where the WID identifier (i.e., the number in column <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is associated with appropriate access authority and control authority for the particular maintenance engineer. Where a process engineer checks out a WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the process engineer would check out a WID having a WID identifier associated with monitor and control authority required by the process engineer.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the alternative, WIDs <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be personalized. For instance, personal digital assistants (PDAs) may be used as WIDs <b>30</b><i>a</i>. In this case, the WID identifier in column <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may identify a particular PDA owner.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the invention also contemplates a system wherein machine indicators are physically associated with specific machines within the facility <b>10</b> so that a WID user can correlate identifiers presented by a WID with the indicators associated with the machines to verify that information is obtained for an intended machine. Here, the indicators may be physically printed or attached to some part of the actual machines and placed in visually obvious locations for viewing. In at least one embodiment it is contemplated that the indicators may be relatively descriptive so that a WID user familiar with machine types can make an additional mental correlation between a machine on the facility floor and a machine identifier selection presented via display <b>34</b>. For instance, an indicator may include “second two foot slide drill press on machine line #<b>33</b> ” which could be visually confirmed by the WID user. Here, a displayed machine identify selection would simply include “second two foot slide drill press on machine line #<b>3</b>”.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In other embodiments the physically associated machine identifiers may simply include non-descriptive labels such as M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, etc. which, as above would be provided on or proximate associated machines. In this case, the non-descriptive indicators may be reusable in different facility locations. For instance, in most facilities it will be impossible to observe more than twenty or so machines from any specific location. Assuming a facility where no more than twenty machines are viewable from any one location, non-descript indicators M<b>1</b> through M<b>20</b> would be sufficient to provide all machine selection options for any given facility location. Here, it is contemplated that indicators M<b>1</b> through M<b>10</b> would be reusable with similarly tagged machines spatially separated so that no two similarly tagged machines could be observed from any specific facility location.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Assume a WID user wants to obtain information for machine M<b>2</b> and is in the location corresponding to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>as illustrated. In this case, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may present a machine list including machines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and M<b>4</b> to select from. The WID user observes the indicator M<b>2</b> on the specific machine M<b>2</b> for which information is sought and mentally correlates indicator M<b>2</b> with the identifier M<b>2</b> in the WID list and then makes the appropriate selection.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, one method <b>80</b> according to the present invention is illustrated. Prior to method <b>80</b> it is assumed that controller <b>38</b> and database <b>40</b> are programmed and configured to obtain machine information from each of machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> and to store that information in a correlated fashion with a list of machine identifiers (e.g., M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, etc.). Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b>, at process block <b>82</b>, machine identifiers and machine zones are assigned to each machine M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> within facility <b>10</b> during a system commissioning procedure. The commissioning procedure, in general, lays out the range of control zones, access zones and, where appropriate hysteresis zones, for each particular machine. Various commissioning procedures for identifying machine zones are contemplated. After the control, access and hysteresis, zones have been identified, an electronic map (e.g., see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) of the facility <b>10</b> including the identified zones is stored in database <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">After the machine zones have been identified and electronically stored in database <b>40</b>, when a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is turned on and is brought into a facility area <b>14</b>, the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>transmits a WID identifier or number at a specific and known signal strength to access points <b>11</b> proximate the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>at block <b>84</b>. When an access point <b>11</b> receives the transmitted signal, the access point <b>11</b> identifies the signal strength and the WID identifier and packages those two bits of information along with an access point identifier and transmits this information packet via data bus <b>36</b> to controller <b>38</b>. At block <b>86</b>, controller <b>38</b> uses the signal strengths and the access point identifiers to determine the approximate location of the specific WID within room <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Any of several different methods to determine WID location using signal strength may be used. For instance, a signal triangulation method whereby the intersection of three access point signal strength circles is used to determine location may be employed. Other statistical methods of locating are also contemplated including those described in WO 02/054813 referenced above. At block <b>86</b>, after WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>location has been precisely identified, controller <b>38</b> access the facility map in database <b>40</b> and determines in which, if any, machine zone the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As indicated above, in the present example, it is assumed that the system for locating a WID within area <b>14</b> is relatively imprecise and therefore, instead of providing a specific location within area <b>14</b>, when the location determining algorithm is performed, a WID position zone like zone <b>49</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>is identified. Thereafter, still at block <b>86</b>, controller <b>38</b> identifies the central point of the WID position zone <b>49</b> and assumes that the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located at the central point.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Continuing, at decision block <b>88</b>, controller <b>38</b> determines whether or not the assumed WID location is in a machine zone. At block <b>88</b>, where the assumed WID location is not within a machine zone, control passes to block <b>102</b> where the system causes WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to display a default message. To this end, referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in at least one embodiment, the process of displaying a default message includes transmitting a message such as “You are not currently in a machine zone” at block <b>150</b> to the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>via access points <b>11</b> and then displaying the received message at block <b>152</b> via the WID. This simple location status or guidance message reduces WID user confusion by giving some type of indication of where the WID user is with respect to the zones.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">At block <b>103</b>, controller <b>38</b> disassociates the WID from all zones. Disassociation is provided in the illustrated embodiment to ensure that, upon entering another machine zone, the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is free to associate or more properly, be associated by controller <b>38</b>, with the new zone.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after block <b>103</b>, control passes back up to block <b>84</b> where the system again determines approximate WID location within facility <b>10</b>. Thus, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is initially not within a machine zone but is moved into a machine zone, the looping process through blocks <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> eventually determines that the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is within at least one specific machine zone.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring again to block <b>88</b>, where the assumed WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>location is within a machine zone, control passes to block <b>90</b> where controller <b>38</b> determines if WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is currently associated with a specific machine zone. To this end, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>remains within one zone during consecutive passes through the process <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>or is moved from one zone directly into an adjacent zone between consecutive passes through process <b>80</b>, during the second pass through process <b>80</b>, at block <b>88</b>, the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is associated with the machine zone in which the WID resided during the first pass through process <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In this case, control passes to block <b>104</b> where controller <b>38</b> determines if the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is still in the machine zone that the WID was most recently (i.e., during the previous pass through process <b>80</b>) associated with. Here, for instance, were WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>remains in the same zone during consecutive passes through process <b>80</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>will still be in the associated machine zone and control passes to block <b>105</b>. At block <b>105</b> controller <b>38</b> causes WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to display the sub-set of machine information corresponding to the zone that the WID is associated with and control again passes back up to block <b>84</b> where the process <b>80</b> is repeated. By looping back up through block <b>105</b> instead of down through the lower blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>when the WID zone remains the same between consecutive process <b>80</b> cycles, unnecessary steps required to re-associate a WID and a machine zone are avoided. The end result is that the information displayed by WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>remains unchanged between consecutive process cycles where the WID zone is unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">At blocks <b>90</b> and <b>104</b>, where the WID is either not currently associated with a machine or is not still in a currently associated machine zone, respectively, control passes to block <b>280</b> where controller <b>38</b> determines if WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is in more than one overlapping machine zone. Where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is in two or more overlapping zones, control passes to block <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">At block <b>92</b>, controller <b>38</b> identifies a machine identifier sub-set corresponding to the overlapping machine zones in which WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located. Next, at block <b>87</b>, controller <b>38</b> transmits the identifier sub-set via access points <b>11</b> to WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>. At process block <b>89</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the sub-set of identifiers. Again, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an exemplary screen shot <b>170</b> that may be provided to display the identifier sub-set is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Continuing, at block <b>94</b>, after the identifier sub-set has been displayed for selection purposes, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>waits for a selection to be made by the WID user. At block <b>94</b>, where no selection is made, control passes again back up to block <b>84</b> where the process described above is repeated so that, if the WID is transported into a different location within area <b>14</b> which is differently associated with the machine zones, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and controller <b>38</b> can together automatically alter the identifier sub-set list presented to the WID user. Referring still to decision block <b>94</b>, if an identifier selection is received, control passes to block <b>91</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b>, at block <b>91</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>transmits the selected identifier to proximate access points <b>11</b> and thereby to controller <b>38</b>. At block <b>96</b>, controller <b>38</b> accesses machine information corresponding to the selected machine identifier and at block <b>98</b> controller <b>38</b> transmits the access machine information via access points <b>11</b> to WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>. At block <b>97</b>, controller <b>38</b> associates WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>with the machine corresponding to the selected identifier. At block <b>99</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the received machine information for the user to observe. After block <b>99</b>, control passes back up to block <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>and the process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, at block <b>280</b>, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is in a single machine zone (i.e., is located in one and only one machine zone), control passes to block <b>282</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>. In this case, in at least one embodiment, there will be no reason to present an identifier list to the WID user as there is only one machine identifier option associated with the assumed WID location. At block <b>282</b> controller <b>38</b> sets the selected identity equal to the identifier associated with the zone in which the WID currently resides. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>f </i>WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located to the left of machine M<b>4</b> as illustrated and in zone <b>26</b>, controller <b>38</b> selects the identifier associated with machine M<b>4</b>. After block <b>282</b>, control passes to block <b>96</b> where controller <b>38</b> accesses machine information and cycles through subsequent blocks <b>98</b>, <b>97</b> and <b>99</b> prior to passing control back to block <b>84</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Thus, it should be appreciated that the shortcomings associated with a low resolution WID locating system can be substantially overcome by enabling a WID user to eliminate ambiguity regarding information sought from among a plurality of proximate machines. Here, where the locating system cannot distinguish which of two machines a WID user seeks information for based solely on location, the system presents location based options for the WID user to select from. Where there is no ambiguity regarding which of several machines a user can seek information for, the system may automatically provide machine information without requiring an affirmative selection process.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to another embodiment of the invention, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, blocks <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> may be entirely eliminated so that, even where there is only one machine identifier to be included in the identifier list, the single option list is still provided and a affirmative selection step is still required prior to providing any type of machine information. Here, it should be appreciated that, as indicated above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c</i>, often the zones (e.g., <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>) used to identify if a WID is proximate a machine may be much larger than ideal machine zones (e.g., <b>43</b>, <b>47</b>). Thus, at block <b>88</b>, despite being in only one zone, the WID user may not want information corresponding to the specific machine associated with the zone in which it is assumed the WID currently resides.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a more detailed process corresponding to process block <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>is illustrated. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, when a WID is not currently associated with a machine zone or is no longer within a currently associated machine zone, control passes from either block <b>90</b> or block <b>104</b>, respectively, to block <b>121</b> where controller <b>38</b> identifies all machine identifiers corresponding to machines associated with the approximate location of WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Next, at block <b>123</b>, controller <b>38</b> accesses the authorization/preferences specification (e.g., see <b>39</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is stored in database <b>40</b> to determine whether or not the WID user (or specific WID) is authorized to obtain information corresponding to machines associated with the identified machine identifiers and whether or not the user's preferences provide any information regarding the particular machine identifiers. At block <b>125</b>, controller <b>38</b> identifies a sub-set of the machine identifiers that is consistent with the access authorization/preferences specification <b>39</b>. Control passes from process block <b>125</b> back to block <b>87</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>where the identifier sub-set is transmitted to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>for display.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Thus, the inventive system can be used to automatically enforce access and control rules by limiting the universe of selectable machine identifiers to identifiers associated with proximate machines, and for which the WID user is authorized to obtain information. Here, only identifiers corresponding to machines that a particular user or WID is authorized to obtain information for are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">According to other inventive embodiments, to avoid user confusion, controller <b>38</b> may be programmed to provide additional information to the WID regarding machine information access. For instance, according to at least one aspect, controller <b>38</b> may be programmed to identify two identifier sub-sets including a first sub-set consistent with the access authorization/preferences specification and a second sub-set inconsistent with the access authorization/preferences specification but including other identifiers corresponding to zones in which the WID currently resides. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, assume WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is located as illustrated and hence resides in all three overlapping zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>. Also assume WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is associated with a user that is authorized to access information corresponding to machines M<b>1</b> and M<b>4</b> but that is not authorized to access information corresponding to machine M<b>2</b>. Here, controller <b>38</b> would identify a first sub-set including machine identifiers M<b>1</b> and M<b>4</b> and the second sub-set including identifier M<b>2</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, in this embodiment, both the first and second sub-sets would be transmitted to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and both sub-sets would then be displayed such that only identifiers M<b>1</b> and M<b>4</b> are selectable and identifier M<b>2</b> is provided with an indication that the particular user/WID cannot access information for the second machine M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A detailed sub-process corresponding to blocks <b>92</b>, <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>where controller <b>38</b> identifies and provides two sub-sets is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, blocks <b>121</b> and <b>123</b> are similar to the identical blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> where the controller identifies machine identifiers corresponding to the assumed machine location and then accesses the access authorization/preferences specification. At block <b>354</b>, controller <b>38</b> separates the identified machine identifiers into first and second sub-sets that are consistent and inconsistent, respectively, with the authorization/preferences specification. At block <b>356</b> the two sub-sets are transmitted to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and at block <b>358</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the selectable first identifier sub-set and the unselectable second identifier sub-set.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In a similar fashion, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, one other sub-method corresponding to blocks <b>92</b>, <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>is illustrated where controller <b>38</b> separately determines whether or not access information and/or control information is accessible via a WID for each one of the identified machine identifiers. To this end, again, at after block <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, control passes to block <b>121</b> and <b>123</b> where controller <b>38</b> identifies machine identifiers corresponding to machines associated with the approximate WID location and accesses the authorization/preferences specification. At block <b>360</b>, of the machine identifiers identified, controller <b>38</b> determines if the WID has access and/or control authority for each one of the separate identifiers and then modifies the indicator list accordingly. At block <b>362</b> controller <b>38</b> transmits the identifier list including the access control indicators to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and at block <b>364</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the identifier list including the access/control authority indicators. An exemplary screen shot <b>370</b> that may be provided pursuant to the sub-process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and includes an instruction box <b>372</b>, a plurality of icons collectively identified by numeral <b>374</b> and a clarification box <b>376</b>. As above, the instruction box <b>372</b> simply provides instructions to the WID user indicating how to select options for the list which follows thereafter. Icons <b>374</b> include separate icons for each one of the machines for which the WID user can obtain information and, in some cases, may include two separate icons for each one of the machines, an access icon and a control icon. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, both an access icon and a control icon are provided for machine M<b>1</b>and only access icons are provided for machines M<b>2</b> and M<b>4</b> because, presumably, the specific WID used to provide the identifier list is not authorized to obtain control information corresponding to machines M<b>4</b> and M<b>2</b>. Consistent with this limitation, clarification box <b>376</b> indicates that the specific WID cannot obtain control information corresponding to machines M<b>4</b> and M<b>2</b> thus minimizing WID user confusion.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In addition to enforcing zone rules and monitor and control authority rules as described above, the inventive system can also be used to enforce other facility rules. For example, it may be desirable to limit control of a machine to a single WID user at any given time while allowing multiple WID users to access information corresponding to one machine at the same time. An exemplary sub-process that limits control of machines to a single WID at a time and that can be substituted for block <b>92</b>, <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this regard, after block <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>control again passes to blocks <b>121</b> and <b>123</b> where controller <b>38</b> identifies machine identifiers corresponding to machines associated with the WID location and access the authorization/preferences specification. At block <b>370</b>, of the machine identifiers identified, controller <b>38</b> determines if the WID has access and/or control authority for each of the identifiers and then modifies the identifier list accordingly. At block <b>372</b>, controller <b>38</b> determines if some other WID is currently controlling any of the machines for which the WID has control authority. At block <b>374</b>, for machines that are currently being controlled by some other WID, controller <b>38</b> indicates in the identifier list that the machine is being controlled by another WID. Continuing, at block <b>376</b>, controller <b>38</b> transmits the identifier list including the access control indicators to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and at block <b>364</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the identifier list including the access control authority indicators and any indications that other WIDs are controlling machines via the specific WID.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a screen shot <b>378</b> consistent with a system that limits control of machines to a single WID at one time is illustrated. To this end, screen shot <b>378</b> includes an instruction box <b>380</b> like the box illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, selectable icons collectively identified by numeral <b>382</b> which correspond to machine access and/or machine control selectable identifiers and a clarification box <b>384</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> except that there is no machine M<b>1</b> control identifier and, instead, clarification box <b>384</b> indicates that another WID currently has control of machine M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">One other feature contemplated by the present invention is that controller <b>38</b> may be programmed to, based on various types of information, rank machine identifiers according to the likelihood that a WID user will want to obtain information with respect to associated machines. For example, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, despite the fact that WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is illustrated as being at a location that is within each of zones <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> corresponding to machines M<b>21</b>, M<b>2</b> and M<b>4</b>, respectively, clearly, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is closest to machine M<b>4</b>. With respect to the likelihood or probability that a WID user wants to obtain information related to any of machines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> or M<b>4</b> based solely on location, it is most likely that the user of WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>will want to obtain information with respect to machine M<b>4</b>. Thus, in one embodiment, controller <b>38</b> may assign a relatively high probability to the machine M<b>4</b> identifier and lower probabilities to the machine M<b>1</b> identifier and machine M<b>2</b> identifier. Thereafter, controller <b>38</b> may transmit information to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>causing WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to display the machine identifier list in a manner that reflects the probabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an exemplary screen shot <b>180</b> including an instruction box <b>182</b> and a probability ordered machine list <b>184</b> is illustrated. Here, the instruction box <b>182</b> indicates that machine identifiers listed in list <b>184</b> are in a most likely preferred order and instructs the WID user to select one of the machine identifiers from the list <b>184</b>. As illustrated, list <b>184</b> includes machine M<b>4</b> first followed by machine M<b>1</b> and then M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Probabilities may be assigned to machine identifiers based on other than simply assumed WID location. For example, particular WID users may routinely seek access to information corresponding to certain types of machines and only rarely seek access to information corresponding to other machine types. In this case, machine identifiers corresponding to machine types that the WID user routinely seeks access to may be assigned a relatively high probability. As another example, WID users may set preferences in a specification like specification <b>39</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that indicate a preferred machine type order which could be used to set probabilities. As another example, recent historical machine access patterns may be used to set probabilities. For instance, if a particular WID user has accessed the same machine type the last 10 times a machine selection process has been performed, controller <b>38</b> may be programmed to recognize this pattern of selection and modify probabilities during a next consecutive selection process based thereon. Other probability factors are contemplated and it is also contemplated that combinations of probability factors may also be used to derive more complex weighted probability algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a probability assigning sub-process according to the present invention is illustrated that may replace blocks <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, after a machine identifier sub-set has been identified at block <b>92</b>, control passes on to the sub-process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, control first passes to block <b>127</b> where, based on access authorization preferences, WID history, WID location, and any other probability factors, controller <b>38</b> assigns a probability to each identifier in the identifier sub-set. Next, at block <b>301</b>, controller <b>38</b> transmits the identifiers and associated probabilities to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and at block <b>303</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the identifiers in a manner that is consistent with the probabilities. After block <b>303</b>, control again passes to block <b>94</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>monitors its input components to determine when an identifier selection has been made.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">While machine identifier probabilities may be expressed to a WID user by simply shuffling the machine identifier list as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, other ways of expressing the probabilities are contemplated. To this end, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, another exemplary screen shot <b>200</b> that expresses identifier probabilities is illustrated. Screen shot <b>200</b> includes an instruction box <b>202</b>, a highlighted most likely machine identifier <b>204</b> and a list of less likely or less probable machine identifiers <b>206</b>. Most likely identifier <b>204</b> is illustrated as being a different font than other identifiers in list <b>206</b>, a different size font, earmarked with a specific indication “most likely selection”, may be provided in a different color font, may blink, and so on. Here, the identifiers in list <b>206</b> are arranged according to their relative probabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">While the embodiment described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>calls for WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to transmit signals to access points <b>11</b> and controller <b>38</b> identifies WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>location, it is contemplated that a reverse process may be performed to identify WID location. To this end, controller <b>38</b> may cause each of access points <b>11</b> to periodically transmit signals from indicating access point identifiers to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>and WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>then determines WID location within facility <b>10</b> as a function of known information about the layout of access points <b>11</b>. A process <b>248</b> consistent with this alternate is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, <b>4</b><i>a </i>and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, after block <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>where zones and identifiers corresponding to each of the facility machines M<b>1</b>-M<b>11</b> have been identified, an electronic facility map consistent therewith is stored in the WID memory <b>69</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>). Thereafter, control passes to block <b>250</b> where controller <b>38</b> causes access points <b>11</b> to transmit access point identifier signals of a specific and known strength to WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>. At block <b>252</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>uses the received signals to approximate WID location and also to determine the machine zone in which the WID is located. At block <b>254</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>determines whether or not the WID is within a machine zone. Where the WID is not within a machine zone control passes to block <b>102</b> where the WID displays a default message. The default message may take any of several different forms and, in at least one embodiment, would take the form described above with respect to block <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in this regard). After block <b>102</b> control passes to block <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring again to block <b>254</b>, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is within a machine zone, control passes to block <b>256</b> where the WID processor determines whether or not the WID is currently associated with a machine zone. Where the WID is currently associated with a machine zone control passes to block <b>255</b> where the WID determines whether or not the WID is still in the associated machine zone. Where the WID is still in the associated machine zone, control passes to block <b>257</b> where the WID displays the information sub-set corresponding to the associated zone.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Referring again to block <b>256</b>, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is not currently associated with a machine zone, control passes to block <b>258</b> where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>identifies the machine identifiers proximate the WID location and at block <b>260</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the machine identifier selection list. Referring again to block <b>255</b>, where the WID is not in the associated machine zone, control passes to block <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">According to yet another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, where probabilities are assigned to each of the machine identifiers corresponding to machines proximate a WID location to indicate likelihood that a WID user at the WID location will seek information corresponding to the particular machines, in addition to providing the machine identifier selections in a manner which reflects the probabilities assigned, machine information corresponding to the highest probability identifier may automatically be provided to the WID user. This aspect of the present invention should streamline the information accessing process appreciably as, for example, in many applications, it will be likely that the WID user will select the highest probability machine identifier a majority of the time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates an exemplary screen shot <b>240</b> that automatically provides information corresponding to the highest probability machine identifier and also provides a selection list indicating other machine identifiers corresponding to machines proximate a WID user's assumed location. Screen shot <b>240</b> includes a machine information window <b>242</b> and a selection window <b>244</b>. Within machine information window <b>242</b> operating characteristics or any other suitable machine information corresponding to the most probable machine identifier is provided. In window <b>244</b>, selection instructions <b>246</b> are provided along with a probability ordered machine identifier list <b>248</b>. Here, when screen shot <b>240</b> is presented via the WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the user may simply observe the information within window <b>242</b> and perform whatever tasks are necessary while ignoring the information in window <b>244</b>. In the alternative, if the WID user wishes to obtain information corresponding to one of the less probable machine identifiers, the WID user may select one of the other identifiers in a manner described above to obtain information related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a sub-process whereby machine information corresponding to a highest probability identifier is identified and then displayed automatically as described above is illustrated. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the sub-process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is meant to replace process blocks <b>87</b> and <b>89</b>. After a machine identifier sub-set has been identified at block <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, control passes to block <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> where, based on whatever criteria has been set for assigning probabilities to identifiers, probabilities are assigned to each of the identifiers in the machine sub-set. Next, at block <b>307</b>, controller <b>38</b> accesses the highest probability information sub-set related to the highest probability identifier. Continuing, at block <b>309</b> controller <b>38</b> transmits the identifiers, associated probabilities and highest probability information to the WID <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">At block <b>311</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the highest probability identifier and associated highest probability information as well as the lower probability identifier list in a manner similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Thereafter control again passes to block <b>94</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>monitors for selection.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In this case, according to one method, as the WID user moves about the facility, if the probabilities are location dependent, controller <b>38</b> will continue to track WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>position and automatically alter the information displayed in machine information box <b>242</b> to reflect the most probable information sought. In addition, list <b>248</b> may be reshuffled or updated to reflect varying location based probabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to one other aspect of the invention, upon identifying identifiers associated with a specific WID location, controller <b>38</b> may access machine information sub-sets for each identifier and transmit the machine information sub-sets for all of the machines to the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>along with associated identifiers. Thereafter, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may provide the identifier selection list while storing the information sub-sets or may provide a screen shot similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> to automatically provide the most likely sought information sub-set along with less probable machine identifiers for selection. Where an identifier is selected, as above, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>provides the associated information sub-set from its own memory.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">An exemplary sub-method consistent with this WID information storing aspect of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> where the looping process between blocks <b>90</b> and <b>84</b> may be replaced by the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. At block <b>320</b> controller <b>38</b> assigns probabilities to identifiers. At block <b>322</b>, controller <b>38</b> accesses sub-sets of information corresponding to the identified identifiers. At block <b>324</b> the identifiers, probabilities and information sub-sets are transmitted to WID <b>30</b><i>a</i>. At block <b>324</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>stores the information sub-sets corresponding to other than the highest probability identifier in the WID memory along with correlated identifiers. At block <b>328</b>, WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the highest probability identifier along with the highest probability information as well as the lower probability identify list (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). At block <b>330</b> WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>waits for an identifier selection, where no identifier is received, control loops back to block <b>328</b>. Where one of the identifiers in the lower probability list is selected at block <b>330</b>, control passes to block <b>332</b> where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>accesses the sub-set of information corresponding to the selected identifier from memory and to block <b>336</b> where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the accessed sub-set.

After block <b>212</b>, control passes back to block <b>98</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>where the accessed information is transmitted to the WID for display. Thus, the simple process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> facilitates customization of accessed information and also can be used to enforce authorization limitations related to accessed information.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Thus, in some embodiments of the invention controller <b>38</b> employs the authorization/preferences specification <b>39</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) at least twice during a process cycle. First, controller <b>38</b> may use specification <b>39</b> to widdle down the identifier selection list to only identifiers corresponding to machines that a particular WID user can or wants to obtain information for. Second, controller <b>38</b> uses specification <b>39</b> to customize the machine information provided to a WID user after an identifier has been selected.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As indicated above, where control information is to be accessed, according to one aspect of several embodiments of the invention, an affirmative step is required whereby a WID user affirmatively elects to receive control information and to configure the user's WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to facilitate machine control. This affirming step is particularly important in cases where the WID locating system is not particularly accurate as, for example, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">One exemplary affirming sub-process which may be provided as an enhancement to the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, after machine information corresponding to a selected machine identifier has been accessed at block <b>96</b>, control passes to block <b>220</b> where processor <b>38</b> determines whether or not the accessed information is control information or simply access/or monitoring information. Where the access information is not control information at block <b>220</b>, control passes to block <b>98</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>where the access type information is transmitted to the WID for display. However, referring again to block <b>220</b>, where the information is control information, control passes to block <b>222</b> where controller <b>38</b> performs some process to require an affirmative control request from the WID user. For instance, in this regard, controller <b>38</b> may transmit a message to WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>for display to the WID user specifically requesting that the user elect control information. An exemplary screen shot <b>230</b> including an instruction box <b>232</b> and an affirming icon <b>231</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Continuing, at block <b>224</b>, the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>waits for reception of an affirmative control request wherein, for instance, the WID user may select the affirming icon <b>231</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Where no affirmative control request is received, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, control passes back up to block <b>222</b> where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>continues to display a screen shot similar to screen shot <b>230</b>. After an affirmative control request has been received at block <b>224</b>, control passes to block <b>98</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>where the control information is transmitted to the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>for display.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring-again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, an alternate default message process <b>102</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>a</i>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, at block <b>154</b>, controller <b>38</b> determines whether the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>was previously associated with a machine zone. Here, for instance, between consecutive process <b>80</b> cycles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, a WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>may have been moved from within a machine zone (e.g., <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) into another location that is not associated with a particular machine. Where the WID was previously associated with a machine zone, control passes to block <b>156</b> where controller <b>38</b> allows the WID to display the most recent monitor information corresponding to the most recently associated zone. Thus, for instance, again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, where WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>is moved from within zone <b>26</b> into an unassociated location between consecutive process <b>80</b> cycles, the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> causes WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>to continue to display the most recently displayed monitor information corresponding to machine M<b>4</b> while WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>remains in a region that is not within some other machine zone. Where the WID was not previously associated with a machine zone, control passes to block <b>158</b> where controller <b>38</b> transmits a message such as “You are not currently in a machine zone.” to the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>via proximate access points <b>11</b>. At block <b>160</b> the WID <b>30</b><i>a </i>displays the received message. After each of blocks <b>156</b> and <b>160</b> control again passes to block <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concept of the present invention. It will be appreciated that the present disclosure is intended as an exemplification of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated. The disclosure is intended to cover by the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims. For example, while not described in detail above, it should be appreciated that, in at least some embodiments, real time data may be provided to an associated WID when system criteria are met so that, for instance, a WID user within a machine zone and having a WID that is associated with the machine may be able to observe automatically updated machine operating characteristics for the particular machine. In addition, while the present invention is described generally in the context of static machine information presentation, it should be appreciated that the invention is particularly advantageous where machine information is updated routinely. In this case, it is contemplated that, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the controller would update information presented to the WID user as the machine information is updated in the memory employed by the controller and while the WID remains associated with a particular machine (i.e., as above, when the WID is removed from a zone associated with a machine, the system may restrict the information provided via the WID).</p>
