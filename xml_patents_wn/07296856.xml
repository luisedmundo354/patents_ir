<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/509,501, “Reclining Seat with-Shear Adjustment”, filed Oct. 8, 2003, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to reclining seats, and especially a seat for a wheelchair that has a reclining back. The invention relates in particular to a seat in which the seat back moves up and down, either automatically or under control of a user, as the angle of recline is adjusted, to reduce the shear between the back of the user and the seat back.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an ordinary seat with a reclining back, the seat back typically pivots about an axis that is roughly at the intersection of the frames of the seat back and the seat base. When an occupant of the seat rests against the seat back as it reclines, the occupant's torso rotates about his or her hip joints. The separation between the pivot axis about which the seat back rotates and the user's hip joint pivot axis about which the user's back rotates results in the seat back sliding upwards relative to the user's back as the seat back is reclined backwards, and downwards as the seat back is raised towards the upright position. This is known as “shear.” For most occupants, this is not a major problem. The occupant simply moves his or her torso so as to allow it to shift relative to the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, for persons of limited mobility, including many users of power wheelchairs, the necessary shift in position is less easy. There is therefore a need for a reclining seat back, especially for wheelchairs, in which the shear between the seat back and the user's back is reduced. Various solutions have been proposed, including mechanisms to bring the pivot axis of the seat back nearer to the user's hip joint pivot axis, as well as mechanisms for sliding the seat back cushion up and down relative to the seat back frame as the seat back reclines. It is believed that a novel, simple, and robust mechanism capable of translating a back support relative to a back frame would be desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. A mechanism includes a first portion and a second portion. The first portion has a support member pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame at a first connection point and coupled to the second portion at a second end. The second portion has a first end pivotally coupled to the base at a second connection point and has a second end coupled to the back support. The second portion has a length from the first end to the second end in a direction extending between the first and second connection points. The length of the second portion is variable. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base varies the length of the second portion and translates the back support relative to the back frame.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The support member may be a rigid structural member. Alternatively, the support member may be a linear actuator, and operation of which is selectively controllable, allowing the back support to translate independently of rotation of the back frame. Preferably, the back support includes a pair of tracks, and the second portion includes a linkage, having first, second, third and fourth links, each link having a first end and a second end, the first and second links being rotatably coupled to the base at their respective first ends and rotatably coupled at their second ends to the first ends of the third and fourth links, respectively, the third and fourth links being rotatably coupled at points intermediate their first and second ends, and the second ends of the third and fourth links being slidably coupled to the back support tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the back frame is coupled to the base at a first end of the back frame and rotation of the back support frame relative to the base from an upright position into a reclined position translates the back support toward the first end of the back frame. An actuator may be coupled to the base and to the back frame to rotate the back frame relative to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about the base along a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. The back support has a lower end proximate the base and an upper end distal the base. A central axis extends between the lower and upper ends. A pair of tracks is provided, each track having a longitudinal centerline symmetrically oriented at an angle relative to the back support central axis in generally a V-shaped arrangement. A linkage is formed by first, second, third, and fourth links. Each of the links has a first end and a second end. The first and second links are rotatably coupled to the base at their respective first ends and rotatably coupled at their respective second ends to the first ends of the third and fourth links. The second ends of the third and fourth links are slidably coupled to the back support tracks. A support member is pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and coupled at a second end to the linkage. An actuator is coupled to the base and to the back support frame to rotate the back support frame relative to the base. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base from an upright position into a reclined position translates the back support toward the first end of the back frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a third aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. The back support has a lower end proximate the base and an upper end distal the base. A central axis extends between the lower and upper ends. A pair of tracks is provided, wherein each track has a longitudinal centerline symmetrically oriented at an angle relative to the back support central axis in generally a V-shaped arrangement. A first actuator is coupled to the base and to the back frame to rotate the back frame relative to the base. A linkage comprises at least a first link and a second link. Each link has a first end and a second end. The first and second links are pivotally coupled together proximate their respective first ends. The first and second links are slidingly engaged with the first and second tracks, respectively, proximate their respective second ends. A second actuator is operatively coupled to the first and second links to rotate the first and second links relative to one another. A support member is pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and coupled at a second end to the linkage. Rotation of the first and second links causes the first ends to move within the first and second tracks, causing translation of the back support relative to the back frame.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet a fourth aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. A mechanism is pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and pivotally coupled to the base at a second end for rotation about a second pivot axis. The mechanism is coupled to the back support at a point intermediate the first and second ends. The mechanism has a length from the first end to the second end, with the length being variable. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base varies the length of the mechanism and translates the back support relative to the back frame.</p>

Preferably, each track of the pair of tracks has a longitudinal centerline <b>82</b>, and the tracks are symmetrically oriented at an inclination angle α relative to the back support central axis in generally a V-shaped arrangement.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the back support translation mechanism <b>90</b> is capable of movement between a first, raised position <b>92</b> corresponding to the back support upright position <b>74</b>, and a second, lowered position <b>94</b> corresponding to the back support reclined position <b>76</b>. The mechanism <b>90</b> includes a first portion <b>100</b> and a second portion <b>110</b>. The first portion <b>100</b> has a support member <b>102</b> pivotally coupled at a first end at a first connection point to the back frame <b>60</b> at the support member mount <b>68</b>. At a second end, the support member <b>102</b> is coupled to the second portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second portion <b>110</b> has a first end pivotally coupled to the base <b>40</b> at a second connection point at the linkage mount <b>46</b> through the connector <b>48</b> for rotation about a second pivot axis. The second portion <b>110</b> has a second end coupled to the back support <b>70</b>. Preferably, the second portion <b>110</b> includes a linkage <b>120</b>, having a first link <b>122</b>, a second line <b>124</b>, a third link <b>126</b> and a fourth link <b>128</b>. Each link <b>122</b>-<b>128</b> has a first end and a second end. The first and second links <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are preferably rotatably coupled to the base <b>40</b> at their respective first ends and rotatably coupled at their second ends to the first ends of the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, respectively. The third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are rotatably coupled at points intermediate their first and second ends. The second ends of the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are slidably coupled to the back support tracks <b>80</b>. Preferably, the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are coupled to the back support tracks <b>80</b> by followers <b>130</b>. The followers <b>130</b> are preferably generally disk-shaped rollers rotatably mounted to the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and received within the tracks <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With particular reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the second portion <b>110</b> has a length from the second portion first end to the second portion second end in a direction extending generally between the first and second connection points. This length is variable, with a first length L<b>1</b> (corresponding to the backrest assembly <b>30</b> being in its upright position <b>32</b>) being greater than a second length L<b>2</b> (corresponding to the backrest assembly <b>30</b> being in its reclined position <b>34</b>). As discussed below in detail, rotation of the back frame <b>60</b> relative to the base <b>40</b> varies the length of the second portion <b>110</b> and translates the back support <b>70</b> relative to the back frame <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the back support translation mechanism <b>90</b> is operated as the backrest assembly <b>30</b> moves between its upright position <b>32</b> and its reclined position <b>34</b> by the first actuator <b>140</b>. When the backrest assembly <b>30</b> is in its upright position <b>32</b>, the back support translation mechanism <b>90</b> is in its raised position <b>92</b> and the second portion <b>110</b> has a length equal to first length L<b>1</b>. As the actuator <b>140</b> retracts, rotating the back frame <b>60</b> into the reclined position <b>34</b>, the back support translation mechanism <b>90</b> is moved into the lowered position <b>94</b>, moving the second portion <b>110</b> into a position having length L<b>2</b>. The back support <b>70</b> is coupled to the second portion <b>110</b>, and the position of the back support <b>70</b> relative to the back frame <b>60</b> is directly related to the overall length of the second portion <b>110</b>. As the length of the second portion <b>110</b> shortens, the back support <b>70</b> is translated relative to the back frame <b>60</b> from its upright position <b>74</b> towards its reclined position <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as the backrest assembly <b>30</b> moves from its upright position <b>32</b> into its reclined position <b>34</b> (indicated in phantom), the back support translation mechanism <b>90</b> moves from its raised position <b>92</b> into its lowered position <b>94</b> (shown in phantom). In moving from upright position <b>32</b> into reclined position <b>34</b>, the support member <b>102</b> is moved toward the base <b>40</b>, moving the linkage <b>120</b> in a manner such that the second ends of the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, coupled to the back support tracks <b>80</b> by the followers <b>130</b>, slide upwardly away from the back support lower end <b>70</b><i>a </i>and outwardly away from the center of the back support <b>70</b>. With that movement of the third and fourth links, the back support <b>70</b> is pulled downwardly, toward the back frame lower end <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Conversely, as the backrest assembly moves from the reclined position <b>34</b> to the upright position <b>32</b>, the back support translation mechanism <b>90</b> is moved from the lowered position <b>94</b> to the raised position <b>92</b>, in turn moving the back support <b>70</b> from the reclined position <b>76</b> into the upright position <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Depending on the arrangement of the linkage <b>120</b> (in particular, relative lengths of the links <b>122</b>-<b>128</b> and positioning of the pivotal coupling between the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) and also depending upon arrangement of the tracks <b>80</b> (in particular, the inclination angle α), the linkage <b>120</b> can be made to multiply movement of the back support <b>70</b> relative to movement of the support member <b>102</b>. That is, for example, a one inch movement of the support member <b>102</b> can result in a four inch movement of the back support <b>70</b>. Adjustment of the inclination angle α, or of effective lengths of the links <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>, or of position of the position of the fulcrum between the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> can permit movement of the back support <b>70</b> to be tailored to individual users. In particular, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> may each be provided with a plurality of adjustment holes <b>132</b>, allowing the effective lengths of the third and fourth links <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> to be readily adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The support member <b>102</b> may be a rigid structural member, such as a steel rod or plate. If the support member <b>102</b> is rigid, then the back support <b>70</b> is translated only by rotation of the backrest assembly <b>30</b>. Alternatively, a linear actuator (not illustrated) may be used as the support member <b>102</b>. Unactivated, and locked at given length, the linear actuator would function identically as a rigid structural member, allowing the back support <b>70</b> to translate in response to rotation of the backrest assembly <b>30</b>. But the linear actuator could also be controlled by the user and operated independently of rotation of the backrest assembly <b>30</b> allowing the back support <b>70</b> to translate independently of rotation of the back frame <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">From this disclosure, it will be recognized that in the first preferred embodiment back support translation mechanism <b>90</b>, the second portion <b>110</b> fundamentally operates to magnify movement of the first portion <b>100</b> relative to the base <b>40</b> as the first portion <b>100</b> (and back frame <b>60</b>) rotates relative to the base <b>40</b> and to transmit that magnified motion to the back support <b>70</b>. Means other than the linkage <b>120</b> could be substituted to accomplish the result of transferring motion of the first portion <b>100</b> into motion of the back support <b>70</b>. For example, a gear system (not illustrated) could be operatively coupled to the first portion <b>100</b>, the second portion <b>110</b>, and the back support <b>70</b>, such that movement of the first portion <b>110</b> drives the gear system (not illustrated) to translate the back support <b>70</b> relative to the back frame <b>60</b>. Furthermore, the gear system could be provided with a gear ratio such that movement of the back support <b>70</b> is greater than movement of the second portion <b>110</b>. As a further alternative, if movement of the first portion <b>100</b> is sufficient, a spring device coupled directly to the back support <b>70</b> could be employed as the second portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In short, from this disclosure the person of ordinary skill in the pertinent art will recognize that any of various mechanisms pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and pivotally coupled to the base at a second end and coupled to the back support at a point intermediate the first and second ends could also be used. The mechanisms have a length from the first end to the second end, the length being variable. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base varies the length of the mechanism. The mechanism is operably coupled to the back support to translate the back support relative to the back frame as the length of the mechanism varies.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a second preferred embodiment back support translation mechanism <b>200</b> may be incorporated into the reclining seat assembly <b>10</b>, replacing the first embodiment back support translation mechanism <b>90</b>. The second embodiment back support translation mechanism <b>200</b> has a raised position <b>202</b> and a lowered position <b>204</b>, and comprises a linkage <b>210</b> having a first link <b>212</b> and a second link <b>214</b> and further comprises a second actuator <b>220</b> in addition to the first actuator <b>140</b>. The first and second links <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> each have a first end and a second end, and are preferably rotatably coupled to the support member <b>102</b> at their respective first ends and slidably coupled at their second ends to the back support tracks <b>80</b> by the followers <b>130</b>. The second actuator <b>220</b> is coupled at a first end to the first link <b>212</b> and at a second end to the second link <b>214</b> to rotate the first and second links <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> relative to one another. The second actuator <b>220</b> is thus coupled to the back support <b>70</b> through the first and second links <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, the followers <b>130</b> and the tracks <b>80</b>. The second actuator <b>220</b> is preferably electrically operated and operatively coupled to the battery <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, rotation of the first and second links <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> by the second actuator <b>220</b> causes the first ends of the links <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> to move within the first and second tracks <b>80</b>, causing translation of the back support <b>70</b> relative to the back frame <b>60</b>. The second actuator <b>220</b> may be operated independently of rotation of the backrest assembly <b>30</b>. The second actuator <b>220</b> may be selectively controllable by a user, using conventional control devices and techniques well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art of control of electromechanical devices. Preferably, operation of the second actuator <b>220</b>, to control translation of the back support <b>70</b>, is automatically coordinated with operation of the first actuator <b>140</b>, controlling rotation of the back frame <b>60</b>, such that the back support <b>70</b> is automatically moved an appropriate amount in proportion to the degree of rotation of the back frame <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Linkage <b>210</b> has a length from the first ends of links <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> to the second ends of the links <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in a direction extending generally parallel to the plane of back support <b>70</b>. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, this length is variable, with a first length L<b>1</b>′ (corresponding to the back support <b>70</b> being in its upright position <b>74</b>) being greater than a second length L<b>2</b>′ (corresponding to the back support <b>70</b> being in its reclined position <b>76</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A reclining chair having a movable back support is thus disclosed, providing novel, simple and robust mechanisms capable of translating the back support relative to a back frame. In one embodiment, movement of the back support is driven by rotation of the back frame. In a second embodiment, movement of the back support is driven by an actuator coupled to the back support by a linkage, allowing the back support to be moved independently of the back frame.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the invention has been described and illustrated with respect to the exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and additions may be made therein and thereto, without parting from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
