<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to integrated circuit devices and, more particularly, to phase locked loop integrated circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a conventional phase locked loop (PLL) device <b>101</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the PLL device <b>101</b> includes a phase detector <b>111</b>, a charge pump <b>121</b>, a voltage controller oscillator <b>131</b>, and a divider <b>141</b>. The phase detector <b>111</b> compares a phase of an external clock signal ECLK input from an external source with that of a dividing signal P<b>1</b> output from the divider <b>141</b>, detects a phase difference between the external clock signal ECLK and the dividing signal P<b>1</b>, and outputs a phase difference signal P<b>2</b>. The charge pump <b>121</b> receives the phase difference signal P<b>2</b> and outputs a pumping signal P<b>3</b>. The voltage-controlled oscillator <b>131</b> receives the pumping signal P<b>3</b> and outputs an internal clock signal ICLK. The divider <b>141</b> transmits to the phase detector <b>111</b> the dividing signal P<b>1</b> obtained by dividing the internal clock signal ICLK at a predetermined rate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The PLL device <b>101</b> performs a locking operation until a frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK is locked to that of the external clock signal ECLK. To this end, the PLL device <b>101</b> includes a load capacitor (not shown) at an output terminal of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>131</b>. The voltage controlled oscillator <b>131</b> controls the amount of electric current that flows through the load capacitor to adjust the frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Specifically, when the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, a large amount of electric current is supplied to the load capacitor such that the frequency of the internal clock signal is raised. When the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is lower than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, a small amount of electric current is supplied to the load capacitor such that the frequency of the internal clock signal is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this way, when the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, a large amount of electric current flows through the output terminal of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>131</b>, thereby increasing power consumption. When the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is lower than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, a smaller amount of electric current flows through the output terminal of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>131</b>. Thus, the internal clock signal ICLK may be greatly affected by noise, which, in turn, narrows an operating frequency range of the internal clock signal ICLK.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth therein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a phase locked loop (PLL) device <b>201</b> according to the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the PLL device <b>201</b> includes a phase detector <b>211</b>, a charge pump <b>221</b>, a voltage controller oscillator <b>231</b>, and a divider <b>241</b>. The phase detector <b>211</b> compares a phase of a signal input from an external source, (e.g., an external clock signal ECLK), with that of a dividing signal P<b>1</b> output from the divider <b>241</b>, detects a phase difference between the external clock signal ECLK and the dividing signal P<b>1</b>, and outputs a phase difference signal P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The charge pump <b>221</b> receives the phase difference signal P<b>2</b> output from the phase detector <b>211</b> and outputs pumping signals UPV and DNV. When a frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of an internal clock signal ICLK, the charge pump <b>221</b> outputs an up-pumping signal UPV. When the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is lower than that of an internal clock signal ICLK, the charge pump <b>221</b> outputs a down-pumping signal DNV. The voltage-controlled oscillator <b>231</b> receives the up-pumping signal UPV and the down-pumping signal DNV and outputs the internal clock signal ICLK. The voltage-controlled oscillator <b>231</b> includes a control signal generator <b>235</b> and an internal signal generator <b>237</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The control signal generator <b>235</b> receives the up-pumping signal UPV and the down-pumping signal DNV and outputs a first control signal Vctrlp, a second control signal Vctrln, and a variable control signal nVctrln. When the up-pumping signal UPV is activated, the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln are activated and the variable control signal nVctrln is deactivated. When the down-pumping signal DNV is activated, the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln are deactivated and the variable control signal nVctrln is activated. The control signal generator <b>235</b> will later be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The internal signal generator <b>237</b> receives the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln and the variable control signal nVctrln and generates an internal signal, (e.g., the internal clock signal ICLK). When the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln are activated, a large amount of electric current flows through an output terminal of the internal signal generator <b>237</b>, thereby raising the frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK. In this case, the variable control signal nVctrln is deactivated, thereby decreasing the amount of electric current consumed by the output terminal of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Conversely, when the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln are deactivated, a small amount of electric current flows through the output terminal of the internal signal generator <b>237</b>, thereby lowering the frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK. In this case, the variable control signal nVctrln is activated, thereby increasing the amount of electric current consumed by the output terminal of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>231</b>. The internal signal generator <b>237</b> will later be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The divider <b>141</b> receives the internal clock signal ICLK, divides the internal clock signal ICLK at a predetermined rate, and transmits the divided internal clock signal ICLK to the phase detector <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed circuit diagram of the control signal generator <b>235</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the control signal generator <b>235</b> includes the electric current source <b>311</b>, first through fourth NMOS transistors <b>321</b> through <b>324</b>, and first through fourth PMOS transistors <b>331</b> through <b>334</b>. The electric current source <b>311</b> maintains a constant sum of electric currents flowing from the first and third NMOS transistors <b>321</b> and <b>323</b> to a ground GND.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the internal signal generator <b>237</b> includes an inverting unit <b>411</b>, a load capacitor <b>421</b>, and a variable control transistor <b>431</b>. The inverting unit <b>411</b> receives the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln and the fed back internal clock signal ICLK, inverts the fed back internal clock signal ICLK in response to the first and second control signals Vctrlp and Vctrln, and outputs the internal clock signal ICLK. The inverting unit <b>411</b> includes a first control transistor <b>413</b>, an inverter <b>415</b>, and a second control transistor <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first control transistor <b>413</b> is connected between the voltage source VDD and the inverter <b>415</b>. The first control signal Vctrlp is transmitted to a gate of the first control transistor <b>413</b>. Therefore, the first control transistor <b>413</b> is activated when the first control signal Vctrlp is a low level and supplies the voltage source VDD to the inverter <b>415</b>. The first control transistor <b>413</b> is deactivated when the first control signal Vctrlp is a high level. The first control transistor <b>413</b> may be a PMOS transistor. The second control transistor <b>417</b> is connected between the inverter <b>415</b> and the ground GND. The second control signal Vctrln is transmitted to a gate of the second control transistor <b>417</b>. Therefore, the second control transistor <b>417</b> is activated when the second control signal Vctrln is a high level and supplies ground voltage to the inverter <b>415</b>. The second control transistor <b>417</b> is deactivated when the second control signal Vctrln is a low level. The second control transistor <b>417</b> may be an NMOS transistor. The inverter <b>415</b> receives and inverts the fed back internal clock signal ICLK and outputs the internal clock signal ICLK.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The load capacitor <b>421</b> and the variable control transistor <b>431</b> are connected in series at an output terminal of the inverting unit <b>411</b>. The variable control transistor <b>431</b> may be an NMOS transistor. The variable control signal nVctrln is transmitted to a gate of the variable control transistor <b>431</b>. Therefore, the variable control transistor <b>431</b> is activated when the variable control signal nVctrln is a high level and increases the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b>. The variable control transistor <b>431</b> is deactivated when the variable control signal nVctrln is a low level and decreases the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Consequently, the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b> decreases when the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK and increases when the frequency of the external signal ECLK is lower than that of the internal clock signal ICLK. In this way, the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b> varies according to the frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The overall operation of the PLL device <b>201</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>. A case where the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK will be described. The charge pump <b>221</b> activates the up-pumping signal UPV to a high level. When the up-pumping signal UPV is a high level, the first signal Vctrlp and the variable control signal nVctrln are output in a low level and the second control signal Vctrln is output in a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As the first signal Vctrlp is inactive in a low level and the second control signal Vctrln is active in a high level, the first and second control transistors <b>413</b> and <b>417</b> are activated. Thus, a large amount of electric current flows from the inverter <b>415</b> to the load capacitor <b>421</b>, thereby raising the frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK. Here, as the variable control signal nVctrln is inactive in a low level, the variable control transistor <b>431</b> is deactivated. Thus, the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b> decreases. Accordingly, the amount of electric current flowing from the inverter <b>415</b> to the load capacitor <b>421</b> decreases, and thus the amount of electric current consumed by the output terminal of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>231</b> is reduced. In this way, when the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, the amount of electric current consumed by the load capacitor <b>421</b> is reduced, thereby expanding a frequency region of the internal clock signal ICLK to a higher range. In other words, when the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, electric current output from the inverting unit <b>411</b> increases and, at the same time, the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b> decreases. Therefore, the internal clock signal ICLK becomes synchronized with the external clock signal ECLK more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, a case where the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is lower than that of the internal clock signal ICLK will be described. The charge pump <b>221</b> activates the down-pumping signal DNV to a high level. When the down-pumping signal DNV is a high level, the first signal Vctrlp and the variable control signal nVctrln are output in a high level and the second control signal Vctrln is output in a low level.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the first signal Vctrlp is active in a high level and the second control signal Vctrln is inactive in a low level, the first and second control transistors <b>413</b> and <b>417</b> are deactivated. Thus, a very small amount of electric current flows from the inverter <b>415</b> to the load capacitor <b>421</b>, thereby lowering the frequency of the internal clock signal ICLK. Here, as the variable control signal nVctrln is active in a high level, the variable control transistor <b>431</b> is activated. Thus, the capacitance of the load capacitor <b>421</b> increases. Accordingly, the amount of electric current flowing from the inverter <b>415</b> to the load capacitor <b>421</b> increases, and thus the amount of electric current consumed by the output terminal of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>231</b> increases. In this way, when the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK is lower than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, the amount of electric current consumed by the load capacitor <b>421</b> increases and the internal clock signal ICLK is less affected by noise. Therefore, a frequency region of the internal clock signal ICLK is expanded to a lower range.</p>

Thus, their description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph for comparing electric current <b>611</b> consumed by the load capacitor included in the voltage controlled oscillator <b>131</b> of the conventional PLL device <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with electric current <b>621</b> consumed by the load capacitor <b>421</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> included in the voltage controlled oscillator <b>231</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the PLL device <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the electric current <b>611</b> consumed by the conventional load capacitor is small at a low frequency and large at a high frequency. Conversely, the electric current <b>621</b> consumed by the load capacitor <b>421</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the present invention is much larger than the electric current <b>611</b> consumed by the conventional load capacitor at a low frequency and much smaller at a high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described above, a load capacitor is connected to a variable control transistor. When a frequency of an external clock signal is higher than that of an internal clock signal, an inactivated variable control signal nVctrln is transmitted to the variable control transistor. Accordingly, the variable control transistor is inactivated, thereby decreasing capacitance of the load capacitor. When the frequency of the external clock signal is lower than that of the internal clock signal, an activated variable control signal nVctrln is transmitted to the variable control transistor. Accordingly, the variable control transistor is activated, thereby increasing the capacitance of the load capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, when the frequency of the external clock signal ECK is higher than that of the internal clock signal ICLK, electric current consumed by the load capacitor decreases and, thus, the internal clock signal can be synchronized with the external clock signal more quickly. When the frequency of the external clock signal is lower than that of the internal clock signal, the electric current consumed by the load capacitor increases and, thus, the internal clock signal is less affected by noise. Accordingly, an operating frequency range of a phase locked loop device is expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, as described above, embodiments of the present invention include phase locked loop (PLL) integrated circuits having enhanced locking characteristics.

The pull-up path includes a PMOS transistor <b>413</b> and the pull-down path includes an NMOS transistor <b>417</b>.
