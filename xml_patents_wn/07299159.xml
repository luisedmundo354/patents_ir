<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods and procedures have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term sensor refers to a sensor but also refers to analog and/or digital circuitry that is required for at least initially processing the sensor output before being transmitter and/or processed by a processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment of the device, system and method of the present invention, a typically portable monitor (e.g., a Holter monitor, although other types of monitors may be used), collects physiological data from a person, typically in real time using a variety of sensors. U.S. Pat. No. 6,366,871 of Geva describes a multiple input monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Typically collected are one or more items of physiological data (such as heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, breathing rate and others), and, simultaneously, data relating to physical activity (also referred to as biophysical data), such as, for example, movement, body attitude and musculoskeletal loading. Such monitoring may occur during daily activity, outside of a doctor's office. The collected data can be, for example, recorded and/or downloaded to or transmitted to a computer, cellular phone, personal data accessory and the like for analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Physiological data correlated with person physical activity data may be useful for, for example, assessment of cardiovascular health and risk factors associated with habitual patterns of daily activity. Embodiments of the present invention may allow the collection of physiological data that is associated with simultaneous body movements of a person, along with data on such body movements.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The collected physiological data as well as data relating to the person activity can be wirelessly transmitted to short range transceivers that in turn relay the information or otherwise provide the information to long range transceiver systems such that the data eventually is sent to remote locations including remote data bases, remote medical centers and the like. Various short-range transmission standards such as but not limited to Bluetooth, WLAN, ZigB, Wi-Fi, WLAN, UWB, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The long-range transmission can be executed at real time but this is not necessarily so. Various long-range transmission networks can be utilized, such as but not limited to, LAN, Cable TV, Satellite TV, CCTV, Telephone line, GSM/GPRS, CDMA, TDMA, iTV, Internet and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The health monitor system can exchange data with a long-range transceiver such as a cellular phone, a personal data accessory PDA, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The physiological data as well as the physical activity related data can be processed by the monitor or the long-range transceiver. U.S. patent application titled “Personal health monitor and a method for health monitoring” which is incorporated herein by reference and illustrates a transceiver that also processes physiological data before transmitting it.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The health monitor system can include one or more physiological data sensor, physical activity sensor, a processor and a transceiver. These elements can be connected by wire or by wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>depicts a health monitoring system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, health monitoring system <b>100</b> includes a processing unit <b>101</b> which may be attached to, for example, a person's upper arm. Typically, processing unit <b>101</b> is of similar construction and operation to a lightweight Holter type device, with certain modifications according to embodiments of the invention, but may be of other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The air pressure arm cuff could be the blood pressure arm cuff. By attaching the processing unit <b>101</b> to The Blood pressure arm cuff <b>102</b> a very efficient health monitor system is provided. This system can even include an integration of a processing unit <b>101</b> to additional sensors that are connected to the blood pressure arm cuff <b>102</b>, thus providing a health monitor system that can be worn or removed very quickly, and does not require wires of wireless connections between a processing unit and sensors, thus reducing the cost of such a system, increasing its reliability and making it more easy to wear. This blood pressure upper arm cuff device could be also blood pressure holter for 24 hours or more. This device could be programmed via processing unit <b>101</b>, via Personal computer, Cellular phone or PDA.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Processing unit <b>101</b> may be mounted on or otherwise attached to other sensors, transceivers or devices and can be embedded within other devices. The processing unit <b>101</b> is connected, to one or more physiological data sensors. Conveniently, the processing unit <b>101</b> can be attached to an air pressure arm cuff <b>102</b>, which provides typically automatic measuring of blood pressure values. In one embodiment, air pressure arm cuff <b>102</b> includes pressure sensor <b>109</b>, measuring the air pressure in the arm cuff <b>102</b>. Additional physiological data may be corrected. Typically, processing unit <b>101</b> stores, inter alia, a series of blood pressure values signed by time; other data formats may be used and other data may be stored. Processing unit <b>101</b> need not be attached to pressure cuff <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Processing unit <b>101</b> may be connected to, for example, at least one biophysical data sensor such as accelerometer sensor <b>103</b>, typically attached to the person's wrist or lower arm, an attitude sensor <b>104</b>, typically attached to the person's chest or torso, and a foot step or ground contact sensor <b>105</b>, typically located at a persons foot, typically on the insole. These biophysical data sensors provide an indication about physical activity of the person.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In alternate embodiments, other sets of sensors and types of sensors may be used, and the sensors may be placed in other locations. Typically, the various units are connected by suitable wires, cables carrying electric signals, or by utilizing wireless links.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The accelerometer sensor <b>103</b> may be used (when placed on one position on the person's body) as a hand motion sensor, detecting particular hand moving patterns. The attitude sensor <b>104</b> may provide attitude sensing, measuring acceleration or other physical properties of the person's body (e.g., position, orientation) in, typically, three orthogonal axes. Data produced by attitude sensor <b>104</b> may allow for calculation or determination of the person's body attitude, position, or orientation, for example relative to vertical axis. In one embodiment, the foot step sensor <b>105</b> includes a strain gage sensing insole placed into the person's shoe, used to monitor the pressure of the foot; other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts a monitoring system using bi-directional wireless connections according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, system <b>100</b> includes, for example, a processing unit <b>101</b>, an arm cuff <b>102</b>, an accelerometer sensor <b>103</b>, an attitude sensor <b>104</b>, a ground contact sensor <b>105</b>, and electrodes <b>106</b> attached to the person chest. Certain of the units <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> and possibly <b>106</b> may be connected using a wireless connection. In one embodiment, each of units <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> include a transmitter <b>107</b><i>a</i>, which typically uses known Bluetooth™ standard technology to transmit the data output by such units to a receiver <b>107</b><i>b</i>, located in processing unit <b>101</b>. Typically, since processing unit <b>101</b> is mounted on or adjacent to arm cuff <b>102</b>, units <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> need not communicate wirelessly. If processing unit <b>101</b> and arm cuff <b>102</b> are otherwise located, data may be communicated between them wirelessly. Receiver <b>107</b><i>b </i>typically uses known Bluetooth™ standard technology to receive data output by the various physiological monitoring units.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The wireless connections can be utilized for conveying instructions to initiate a measurement when one of the sensors detected that an event occurs (for example raise of blood pressure or heart rate above a certain threshold), or in a periodical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Synchronization between multiple measurements can provide vital information to the person or to a doctor. By analyzing physiological data gathered from various sensors the monitoring system can determine if an event occurred, if there is a need to ask person to initiate additional measurements and/or if to transmit the data to a remote system, whether to generate an alarm signal to the person, and the like. The alarm signal can also include a request to call a certain number (for example of a remote medical center, of a doctor and the like), and can also instruct the person to perform certain acts (for example- to rest, drink, take a drug and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of various components of the monitoring system <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inflatable arm cuff <b>102</b> is connected via tubing or piping <b>202</b> to a pressure sensor <b>109</b>, a cuff-pressure regulator valve <b>204</b>, and an air pump <b>205</b>. Other known devices and systems for blood pressure monitoring may be used, having different configuration and functionality. In the system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, data may be transferred wirelessly, in one embodiment using the Bluetooth™ standard. In alternate embodiments, other wireless standards and equipment may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processing unit <b>101</b> includes a band-pass filter <b>206</b>, a processor such as micro-controller <b>209</b>, a low-pass filter <b>207</b>, a low pass filter <b>221</b>, and one or more ECG amplifiers <b>218</b>. The micro-controller <b>209</b> typically includes a built-in A/D converter (not shown), a read only memory (ROM, not shown) and random access memory (RAM, not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In alternate embodiments such components may be external to the micro-controller <b>209</b>. The micro-controller <b>209</b> may communicate with other devices such as a memory (typically a flash memory) <b>210</b>, audio amplifier <b>211</b>, speaker <b>212</b>, for transmission via phone network (e.g., PSTN), infrared (IR) transceiver <b>213</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>214</b> using, for example the Bluetooth™ standard, and an antenna <b>215</b>. Other sets of components and other combinations of components may be used. The micro-controller <b>209</b> typically processes input signals according to, for example, the control programs stored in a ROM or other memory contained within or connected to micro-controller <b>209</b> by, for example, utilizing the temporary-storage function of the RAM, and may produce a drive or control signal to control components of the processing unit <b>101</b> to, for example, perform tests. Processing unit <b>101</b> may, for example, be connected to a motor <b>208</b> and valve <b>204</b> for controlling cuff <b>102</b>. The battery power supply <b>224</b> supplies required voltages for components of the processing unit <b>101</b>. Storage methods other than a flash memory may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">On receipt by processing unit <b>101</b>, the output signal of the pressure sensor <b>109</b> (and possibly other received signals) may be processed locally, in processing unit <b>101</b>. Alternately, such signals may be processed on a remote device, for example at a doctor's office. For example, the of the pressure sensor <b>109</b> signal may be input to band-pass filter <b>206</b>, which selectively transmits a heartbeat-synchronous oscillatory component of the received pressure signal as a pulse wave signal, “PWS,” to an analog input AN<b>4</b> of micro-controller <b>209</b>. The pulse wave signal PWS typically represents the pulse wave produced from the pressed arteries of the subject's arm, propagated to the inflatable arm cuff <b>102</b> providing pressure on the arm. The pressure signal of the pressure sensor <b>109</b> may also be input to, for example, a low-pass filter <b>207</b>, which may selectively transmit a static component of the received signal, as a cuff pressure signal, “SPS,” to the analog input AN<b>3</b> of micro-controller <b>209</b>. In one embodiment, the cuff pressure signal SPS represents the change of static pressure within the inflatable arm cuff <b>102</b>. Other methods and devices for processing the output of the pressure sensor may be used, and, in alternate embodiments no processing need be performed by the local unit worn on the person.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To measure blood pressure, the micro-controller <b>209</b> may, for example, send drive signals to the motor driver <b>208</b> of air pump <b>205</b> to inflate the cuff <b>102</b> and thereby press the upper arm, and may feed drive signals to the cuff-pressure regulator valve <b>204</b> to gradually reduce the cuff pressure of the cuff <b>102</b>. The micro-controller <b>209</b> receives, during the reduction of the cuff pressure, the pulse wave signal PWS and the cuff pressure signal “CPS” from the pressure sensor <b>109</b> via the respective filters <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>. The micro-controller <b>209</b> determines, based on the received signals PWS and CPS, the systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) blood pressure values of the subject [Inventor: the following isn't clear—do you mean “using” instead of “in”?] in the known oscillometric blood pressure measuring process, respectively. The micro-controller <b>209</b> collects the SAP and DAP values in, for example, a blood-pressure (BP) memory areas of a flesh memory <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, the arm cuff <b>102</b>, air pump <b>205</b>, pressure sensor <b>109</b>, filters <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>, and micro-controller <b>209</b> cooperate with each other to provide a blood pressure Holter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Processing unit <b>101</b> can at the same time function as, for example, an ECG three-channel Holter. ECG signals capture by electrodes <b>106</b> may be input to the ECG amplifiers <b>218</b>. Analog ECG signals from the amplifiers <b>218</b> are transferred to the analog inputs of the built-in A/D converter of the micro-controller <b>209</b>. Samples of the ECG signal may be collected in the flesh memory <b>209</b>. Other numbers of signals, other sets of signals, and other types of signals, may be captured.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The processing unit <b>101</b> can be connected to additional sensors, such as but not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,366,871 of Geva. According to an embodiment of the micro-controller <b>209</b> is capable of receiving inputs from one or more physiological sensor and in response initiate a measurement of another physiological sensor. Micro-controller <b>209</b> can also initiate multiple measurements according to a predefined schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to an embodiment of the invention if a certain measurement requires human intervention, the processing unit <b>101</b> can generate a vocal request to the person to assist in said measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Data from foot step sensor <b>105</b> (which is typically placed in a person's shoe) may be used, for example, for monitoring a person's daily activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>illustrate two embodiments of possible construction of foot step sensor <b>105</b>. Other embodiments are possible. Other types of foot or step sensors may be used, not placed inside a shoe or on the foot.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, foot step sensor <b>105</b> includes, for example, strain gage transducer <b>302</b> and temperature compensated amplifier <b>303</b>.

The input data may be, for example, processed by digital signal processing program in real time and transmitted via, for example, a wireless modem to the processing unit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Certain embodiments of the invention may include a system and method for activity measurement such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,425 to Whalen and Breit, incorporated herein by reference. The 6,183,425 patent describes, inter alia, a system and method for quantifying daily activity in terms of daily history of the vertical component of the ground reaction force (GRFz). The device includes a sensor placed in a shoe which detects the contact of the foot with the ground. The time of occurrence of each significant foot-down and foot-up event may be recorded. Ground contact time may be identified as, for example, walking, running or “special” by the value of the contact-time interval and may reject a contact pair that falls outside of the known walking or running contact time to stride period relationship. The timing events may be, for example, converted to cyclic peaks of GRFz using appropriate walking and running regression equations. The system and method provide an “activity index,” reflecting walking and running energy consumption. An embodiment of the present invention may use such methods to quantify the person body activity during normal daily activity.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The data received from the sensing insole <b>105</b> is typically processed by a digital signal processing program, typically controlled by micro-controller <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">During processing, noise and spurious non-significant contacts, like foot tapping or not true gait cycles may be reduced. The signal may be compared to the high and low levels values to capture the primarily weight-bearing contacts. The times of foot contact to ground in pairs of foot-down and foot-up events may be collected sequentially, with other data, in memory <b>210</b>. This raw data of the periods of contact cycles may be, for example, downloaded to a local computer or transferred to the remote station for farther processing.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the duration of the pulse at the output of the amplifier <b>221</b>, or the minimum foot ground contact time during running which indicates a foot fall may be, for example, about 0.15 sec. Using a sampling rate of 250 samples per second (or 4 msec duration between samples), about minimum 37 samples per single pulse or foot fall is obtained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the input and output data for a sample contact period t<sub>c </sub>detection algorithm using the high and low threshold values crossing technique. Other specific values may be used, and other algorithms or processing techniques may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The attitude sensor <b>104</b> may be implemented using, for example a Triaxial Digital Accelerometer Model 2420 from Silicon Designs, Inc. The Model 2420 contains three orthogonally mounted Model 1010 integrated accelerometers. The module produces three pulse train outputs. The outputs of the sensor <b>104</b> may be connected to the counter inputs T<b>0</b>, T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> of the micro-controller <b>209</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> there is shown a coordinate set of axes X, Y and Z designating a person's body orientation with respect to the ‘horizon’ 8 as reference plane, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Rotation motions may be defined within these planes and around these axes, such as ‘pitch’ (rotation about Y in XZ plane), ‘roll’ (rotation about X in YZ plane) and ‘yaw’ rotation about Z in XY plane). Triaxial acceleration monitoring using, for example, attitude sensor <b>104</b>, may be used to provide a calculation of the center of gravity A<sub>c </sub>orientation relative to the projection of this center A<sub>p </sub>on the XY plane at a vertical position of the body and coordinate Z=0. The deviation of the person's body from a vertical position causes the changes of the output signals of the sensor <b>104</b>. These signals may be sampled and, for example, stored in the memory <b>210</b> signed by the time for synchronizing with other simultaneously monitored parameters. Further processing of the stored data may provide detection of the person body orientation (e.g., rest, moving in a horizontal plane, moving in vertical plane, rapid or incidence fall, etc.). This information, in correlation with heart rate, blood pressure and other parameters may be used to perform a person health condition analysis during person daily exercising.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The accelerometer sensor <b>103</b> may include, for example, a digital accelerometer Model 1010 from Silicon Designs, Inc. Accelerometer sensor <b>103</b> may be used for, for example, monitoring the motions of the person hand to which the inflatable arm cuff <b>102</b> is attached. Such an accelerometer may be attached at another body position, such as on the leg. The Model 1010 accelerometer produces a pulse train in which the density of pulses (number of pulses per second) is proportional to the applied acceleration. It combines in a single, miniature, hermetically sealed package a micromachined capacitive sense element and an integrated circuit that includes, for example, a sense amplifier and a sigma-delta A/D converter. It is relatively insensitive to temperature changes and gradients. The output signal of the accelerometer sensor <b>103</b> may be connected to, for example, the counter input T<b>1</b> of the micro-controller <b>209</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The data of the signal samples may be, for example, stored in the memory <b>210</b> signed by time for synchronizing with other simultaneously monitored data. Further analysis of the data downloaded to the computer may provide elimination of the spurious results of, for example, a blood pressure measurement caused by a hand moving during the measuring process. Other accelerometers or methods and systems of measuring acceleration or body movement may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>depicts a sample acceleration signal produced by processing data received from sensor <b>103</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. This acceleration signal shows changes of velocity of a person's movements. It includes oscillation and constant components. For detection of a hand's rapid movements this signal may be processed and, for example, a differential of acceleration may be calculated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows the differential of the acceleration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, according to one embodiment. The analysis of this signal may provides detection of, for example, the rapid or significant motions of the hand, such as components <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Typically, various physiologic, vital signs, physical and body orientation/activity data are collected substantially simultaneously and are recorded and/or transmitted to a remote site (e.g., a doctor's office) for analysis. Vital signs data may be analyzed in correlation with physical activity. The data collected may be, for example, time stamped, so that it can be displayed or analyzed side by side. For example, each data item may be signed by time for synchronizing with other simultaneously monitored data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Data stored in the memory <b>210</b> can be, for example, downloaded to an external computer or workstation which may include, for example, the appropriate signal analyzing and display capabilities. Various methods of data transfer may be used, for example, a wireless link (such as using the Bluetooth™ standard or a defines an infrared method such as that defined by the IrDA standard), a modem link (such as via PSTN phone network through audio communication interface), or other methods.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, the wireless transceiver module <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes a hardware chipset which includes radio, baseband, LMP and L2CAP layers for the Bluetooth™ standard.

Data flows from micro-controller <b>209</b> through wireless transceiver module <b>214</b>, through the physical radio layer to the antenna <b>215</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Transmission to a local or remote computer or workstation via, for example, a PSTN phone network may be performed using, for example, Frequency Sift Key (FSK) technology for data transfer. The modulated by data carrier frequency signal may be generated by an audio software module (not shown) and the sequence of the pulse train is driven through the audio amplifier <b>211</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the audio transducer (or speaker) <b>212</b>.</p>

According to an embodiment of the invention a measurement initiating event is responsive to a value obtained as a result of a measurement of physiological data.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is noted that the additional measurement can include measuring a physiological parameter and/or measuring biophysical data.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Stage <b>820</b> is followed by stage <b>830</b> of correlating between multiple measured physiological data to determine that a health related event has occurred and/or to determine a health condition of a person. A health related event can be a cardiac event, an abnormal raise or decrease in blood pressure, an abnormal raise or decrease in heart rate, an abnormal raise or decrease in oxygen saturation in blood, an abnormal raise or decries in glucose level in blood, event from fall detector, events from EEG sensors (sleep and/or wake up duration), event from Spiro meter sensor and the like.</p>
