<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to the field of conveyors, specifically belt conveyors. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a magnetic support roller for use in centering reinforced conveyor belts.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Preventing conveyor belts from “walking off” the drive and return drums and the intervening support rollers can be problematic. This can be particularly difficult for conveyor systems which are not prone to being centered by conventional means and which are routinely reversed. These centering problems are exacerbated for conveyor systems having short runs, i.e., where the drive roll and return roll are located close together. Having the loaded belt run high on the support rollers can not only potentially damage the belt but risk spillage of the conveyed load, as well. This difficulty can manifest itself when a lengthy conveyor belt is under load, or when running empty; in the latter case, particularly on the return run. Attempts have been made to remedy this problem by contacting the edges of the belt with stationary guide rails or rotating rollers. In either case, contacting the edge of the belt with something, whether stationary or in motion, can abrade the belt causing wear damage.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reinforced conveyor belts have steel cord in at least one lateral portion and, in most cases, both sides of the belt. These steel cords are susceptible to magnetic forces if the strength of the magnetic field is sufficient. The advent of rare-earth magnets provides an opportunity to provide a return roller with adequate magnetic field strength to influence the positioning of the belt so as to prevent this “walking off” problem. In some applications, conventional magnets have adequate force to accomplish the task. Further, in many cases, it is not necessary that each support or return roller have the magnet therein. Often, only every 3<sup>rd </sup>or 4<sup>th </sup>roller needs to be magnetized in order to provide a system for maintaining the belt centered on the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various other features, advantages, and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent after a reading of the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first embodiment of the support roller assembly of the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> generally at <b>20</b>. Support roller assembly <b>20</b> has a first roller <b>22</b> and a second identical roller <b>42</b> which underlie first edge <b>13</b> and second edge <b>15</b>, respectively, of conveyor belt <b>11</b>. Typically, conveyor belt <b>11</b> is reinforced along each edge by means having some capacity for being influenced by a magnetic field. Within the context of this specification, the phrase having magnetic properties will refer to this capacity to be magnetically influenced. In most cases, the reinforcement means comprises one or more steel cables <b>17</b> (three being shown) embedded in each edge <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> of the elastomeric body of belt <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of roller <b>22</b> (and identical roller <b>42</b>) are best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Roller <b>22</b> comprises a cylindrical sleeve <b>24</b> which forms a shell that houses at least one permanent magnet <b>30</b>. While conventional magnets will be acceptable for some applications, it is preferred that the permanent magnets be rare earth magnets because of their superior magnetic strength. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, permanent magnet <b>30</b> comprises two stacks of rare earth magnetic plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> which sandwich, and are adhesively bonded to, inner pole disk <b>33</b>. Outer pole disks <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> are also adhesively bonded to an exterior portion of plate stacks <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, and held in place by end flanges <b>38</b>. Preferably, both sleeve <b>22</b> and end flanges <b>38</b> are made of non-magnetic materials. End flanges <b>38</b> are mounted on bearings <b>39</b> which rotate on shaft <b>50</b>. A total of six (two shown) bolts <b>40</b> extend through the ordered array defined by the rare earth magnetic plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, the pole disks <b>33</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and end flanges <b>38</b> and are secured by hex nuts <b>41</b>. Both the heads of bolts <b>40</b> and the hex nuts <b>41</b> are countersunk into their respective end flanges <b>38</b>. Sleeve <b>24</b> is secured to end flanges <b>38</b> by a plurality of screws <b>51</b>. Ends of shaft <b>50</b> are mounted on L-brackets <b>52</b> which are bolted in place atop the beam <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The principles of the invention can also be applied to the return run <b>11</b>′ of conveyor belt <b>11</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Typically, the support beam <b>19</b>′ will be flat on the return run. First and second magnetic rollers <b>22</b>′ help maintain return run <b>11</b>′ centered and avoid wandering of the conveyor belt. By employing magnets <b>30</b> in roller <b>22</b>, the reinforced conveyor belt <b>11</b> is maintained centered for optimum belt wear and load safety. Most preferably, the magnets <b>30</b> are of the rare earth variety to provide superior magnetic strength properties. As noted earlier, in certain instances as few as one in three or one in four rollers on the load carrying and return runs need be equipped with magnets to achieve the desired centering of the belt <b>11</b>. It will be understood that for those belts not having steel cable reinforcement, a “reinforcement” strip of ferrous material can be added externally or internally, to one or both edges of the conveyor belt to enable application of the teachings of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various changes, alternatives, and modifications will become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art after a reading of the foregoing specification. It is intended that all such changes, alternatives, and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims be considered part of the present invention.</p>
