<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to masonry tools, and, more particularly, to tools and methods for preparing a sloped mud surface around a drain prior to setting tile or stone.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An important aspect of setting ceramic tile and stone around a drain is the process of applying “floor mud.” Floor mud is typically comprised of Portland Cement, sand and water mixed together to a semi-dry condition. The floor mud provides a surface upon which ceramic tile or stone may be set. The floor mud surface is referred to herein as the surface of floor mud, floor mud surface, or mud surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Proper construction of a floor surface with a drain into which water is to be collected presents a common challenge in building construction. Such a floor surface should be smoothly graded across its extent with sufficient and consistent inclination to facilitate water collection at the drain, while preventing unwanted pooling of water in other areas of the floor surface. Concomitantly, unduly steep and non-uniform inclinations should be avoided for aesthetic, comfort and safety reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meeting these objectives using conventional construction methods requires experience, diligence and attention to detail. Unfortunately, conventional methods of constructing such floor surfaces are time consuming, laborious and conducive to error. Typically, improvised solutions with tools that are not designed or particularly well suited for the process are utilized. In many cases, the end-products exhibit inconsistent, inferior and unacceptable properties. In such cases, the unacceptable floor mud must be removed and the process must be repeated, resulting in great loss of time, money, goodwill and possibly employment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A device and method to facilitate properly, efficiently and consistently applying floor mud to achieve the desired inclination is urgently needed. The invention is directed to fulfilling one or more of the needs and overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome one or more of the problems as set forth above, in one aspect of the invention, a device for preparing a sloped mud surface around a drain prior to setting tile or stone is provided. An exemplary device according to principles of the invention includes one or more arms (i.e., rigid arms) attached to a sleeve and rotatably supported relative to a vertical axis defined by a vertical shaft and horizontal planar base. An adjustable clamp assembly releasably secures the device to a conventional drain, which may be secured to a drainpipe by pipe threads. The bottom edge of the arm provides a straight working edge. The arm can be freely moved (i.e., rotated) around the vertical shaft degrees, counterclockwise and clockwise. As the arm rotates around the vertical shaft the working edge sweeps over the floor mud surface, spreading and leveling the surface while scraping or sweeping away excess material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sleeve and arm are rigidly attached to each other at a desired angle. The working edge of the arm is fixed at a desired acute angle a relative to the horizon, which is an important aspect for consistently creating a uniform inclined mud surface. The acute angle formed between the working edge of the arm and the horizontal base defines the incline of the floor mud surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The base provides a planar substrate to hold the shaft and clamping assembly and stabilize the device in a desired position relative to a drain and the vertical and horizontal axes. The vertical shaft is securely attached to the base and extends perpendicularly from the horizontal planar base thereby defining a vertical axis around which the arm may rotate. The vertical shaft and drain are concentric when the clamping assembly engages (i.e., grips) the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The adjustable clamp assembly is comprised of stationary supports and an adjustable support is provided on the bottom of the base. The stationary supports are positioned to contact the periphery of one half of a drain. The adjustable support is positioned to controllably exert force against the periphery of the opposite half of the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also provided is an exemplary method of operation, which entails attaching the device to a drain; ensuring the device is level; spreading floor mud; installing and adjusting arm sections; rotating the arm; and progressively lowering the elevation of the arm and repeating rotation of the arm to achieve a desired uniform inclined surface. In operation, the clamping assembly is positioned over the exposed surface of a drain with the stationary supports contacting the periphery of one half of a drain. The adjustable support is then adjusted to exert force against the periphery of the opposite half of the drain. Rotation of the knob causes corresponding rotation of the threaded actuator in the threaded aperture of the clamping support which results in linear advancement of the clamping head towards the stationary supports. The operator may then install an arm comprised of one or more sections. Spacers or other height adjustments may be utilized to ensure that the arm rests at an elevation where the working surface meets the applied floor mud. Then, the operator may rotate the arm around the shaft, either manually or employing a motorized drive. After each one or more complete rotation of the arm, the arm may be lowered such as by removing one or more spacers until the working edge comes in contact with the floor mud surface. Then, the operator may rotate the arm around the shaft again. The steps of rotation and lowering may be repeated until the bottom of the sleeve reaches the surface of the base (or any other limit defining a bottom position). Upon completion of the foregoing steps, the mud surface should exhibit the desired characteristics of a determined, uniform, consistent inclination from the drain.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to the drawings, wherein like numerals represent like features, an exemplary device to facilitate properly, efficiently and consistently applying floor mud to achieve a consistent, uniform and properly inclined floor mud surface according to principles of the invention are conceptually shown. Referring to the top perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>100</b> includes one or more arms <b>120</b> (i.e., rigid arms) attached to a sleeve <b>115</b> and rotatably supported relative to a vertical axis defined by a vertical shaft <b>110</b> and horizontal planar base <b>155</b>. An adjustable clamp assembly (discussed below) releasably secures the device <b>100</b> to a conventional drain <b>160</b>, which may be secured to a drainpipe <b>170</b> by pipe threads <b>165</b>. The bottom edge of the arm <b>120</b> provides a atraight working edge. The arm <b>120</b> can be freely moved (i.e., rotated) around the vertical shaft <b>115</b>, 360 degrees, counterclockwise and clockwise. As the arm <b>120</b> rotates around the vertical shaft <b>115</b>, the working edge sweeps over the floor mud surface, spreading and leveling the surface while scraping or sweeping away excess material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sleeve <b>115</b> and arm <b>120</b> are rigidly attached to each other at a desired angle. During proper use, the sleeve <b>115</b> is maintained in a vertical position on the shaft <b>110</b>. Consequently, the working edge of the arm is fixed at a desired acute angle α relative to the horizon. This fixed angle of the working edge is an important aspect for consistently creating a uniform inclined mud surface. The acute angle formed between the working edge of the arm <b>120</b> and the horizontal base <b>155</b> defines the incline of the floor mud surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The base <b>155</b> provides a substrate to hold the shaft <b>110</b> and clamping assembly (described below). The clamp assembly stabilizes the device in a desired position relative to a drain and the vertical and horizontal axes. The exemplary base <b>155</b> is a planar structure having an adequate size to support the shaft and clamping assembly, and adequate rigidity and strength to maintain integrity of the device <b>100</b> during use. The base <b>155</b> has means for attaching the shaft <b>110</b> and clamping assembly components. Such means may include a plurality of threaded apertures in corresponding positions. For example, a threaded aperture <b>320</b> is provided to hold the shaft <b>110</b>. Threads of the threaded aperture <b>320</b> match threads on the shaft <b>110</b>. Likewise, threaded apertures <b>325</b>, <b>330</b> are provided to hold the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, and threaded apertures <b>345</b>, <b>350</b> are provided to hold the clamping support <b>150</b> to the base <b>155</b> using a plurality of screws <b>305</b>, <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The vertical shaft <b>110</b> is securely attached to the base <b>155</b>. The shaft <b>110</b> extends perpendicularly from the horizontal planar base <b>155</b>, thereby defining a vertical axis around which the arm <b>120</b> may rotate. The vertical shaft <b>110</b> and drain <b>160</b> should be concentric, when the clamping assembly engages (i.e., grips) the drain. The shaft <b>120</b> is preferably removably mechanically attached to the base, such as by threaded engagement. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a threaded male proximal end <b>315</b> of the shaft <b>110</b> is received by a correspondingly threaded female aperture <b>320</b> in the base <b>155</b>. The distal free end <b>105</b> of the shaft preferably tapers to a somewhat rectangular cross sectional shape to facilitate installation and removal using a conventional wrench, socket, pliers or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An adjustable clamp assembly is provided to releasably secure the device <b>100</b> to a drain <b>160</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in an exemplary implementation, a clamp assembly comprised of stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b> and an adjustable support <b>145</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> is provided on the bottom of the base <b>155</b>. The stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b> are positioned to contact the periphery of one half of a drain <b>160</b>. The adjustable support <b>145</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> is positioned to controllably exert force against the periphery of the opposite half of the drain <b>160</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the stationary supports may be comprised of threaded posts <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, received in correspondingly threaded female apertures <b>325</b>, <b>330</b> in the base <b>155</b>. Illustratively, the adjustable support <b>145</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> is comprised of a clamping head <b>215</b> adapted to contact and exert force against the periphery of a drain; a clamping support <b>150</b> affixed to the base by a plurality of screws <b>305</b>, <b>310</b>; and a threaded actuator <b>220</b> with a knob <b>145</b> to facilitate turning at the proximal end, and a free end adapted for rotatable attachment to the clamping head <b>215</b> at the distal end. The threaded actuator <b>220</b> is threadedly passed through a threaded aperture in the clamping support <b>150</b>, with the distal end of the actuator <b>220</b> engaging the clamping head <b>215</b> on the drain side of the clamping support <b>150</b>. Rotation of the knob <b>145</b>, causes corresponding rotation of the threaded actuator <b>220</b> in the threaded aperture of the clamping support <b>220</b>, which results in linear advancement of the clamping head <b>215</b> towards the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, or linear movement of the clamping head <b>215</b> away from the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, depending upon the direction of rotation and threading.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Advantageously, the device <b>100</b> can be configured to accommodate various size drains. The length of the actuator <b>220</b> determines the range of clamping motion. The length of the actuator <b>220</b> in combination with the position of the clamping support <b>150</b> relative to the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b> on the base <b>155</b>, determines the size range of drains that the device can be configured to accommodate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, the clamping assembly is positioned over the exposed surface of a drain <b>160</b>, with the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b> contacting the periphery of one half of a drain <b>160</b>. The adjustable support <b>145</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> is then adjusted to exert force against the periphery of the opposite half of the drain <b>160</b>. Rotation of the knob <b>145</b>, causes corresponding rotation of the threaded actuator <b>220</b> in the threaded aperture of the clamping support <b>220</b>, which results in linear advancement of the clamping head <b>215</b> towards the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, or linear movement of the clamping head <b>215</b> away from the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, depending upon the direction of rotation and threading. Thus, the clamping assembly facilitates tightening for secure attachment to a drain <b>160</b> and loosening for removal therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a side sectional view of floor mud <b>400</b> applied with an exemplary floor mud leveling device <b>100</b> according to principles of the invention is conceptually illustrated. The clamping assembly is positioned over the exposed surface of a drain <b>160</b>, with the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b> contacting the periphery of one half of a drain <b>160</b>. The adjustable support <b>145</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> is adjusted to exert force against the periphery of the opposite half of the drain <b>160</b>, securing the device <b>100</b> in place on the drain. Preferably the base <b>155</b> is level when the clamping assembly is secured in place, so that the shaft <b>110</b> is vertical. Optionally, the base <b>155</b>may include a level indicator (e.g., a tube of liquid with a bubble configured to indicate horizontal when the bubble is centered) to facilitate determining when the base <b>155</b> is horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The exemplary arm is comprised of a plurality of sections, including a distal section <b>405</b> and a proximal section <b>120</b>, adjoined together by mechanical fasteners <b>410</b>, <b>415</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the distal section of the arm <b>405</b> forms a uniformly inclined surface of floor mud <b>400</b> into which tiles or stones will be set. The proximal section <b>120</b> of the arm forms a uniformly inclined surface of floor mud surrounding the drain <b>160</b>. The closer the distal end <b>405</b> is positioned relative to the shaft <b>110</b>, the smaller the area of floor mud <b>400</b> formed by the proximal section <b>120</b> of the arm. The vertical offset between the proximal and distal sections defines the recess formed in the floor mud <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an exploded view of an exemplary leveling arm assembly of a floor mud leveling device according to principles of the invention is conceptually shown. Mechanical fasteners comprising wing nuts <b>410</b>, <b>415</b>, washers <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>417</b> and bolts <b>413</b>, <b>418</b> are provided to secure the distal section <b>405</b> to the proximal section <b>120</b>. A plurality of holes <b>605</b>, <b>610</b> are provided in the distal section for receiving the bolts <b>413</b>, <b>418</b>. Similarly, a plurality of holes are provided in the proximal section <b>120</b> for receiving the bolts at a first elevation <b>625</b>, <b>630</b>, or for receiving the bolts at a second elevation <b>615</b>, <b>620</b>. Thus, the elevation of the working edge of the distal section <b>405</b> may readily be adjusted to accommodate particular tile, stone and preferences. Nevertheless, the invention is not limited to a proximal section <b>120</b> with holes configured for a first elevation and a second elevation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more sets of holes may be provided in the proximal section <b>120</b> for receiving the bolts, and providing one or more elevations.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>D and <b>7</b>E, a plurality of adjustable arm configurations are shown. An arm may be comprised of hinged sections <b>705</b> adapted to be selectively unfolded to achieve a desired overall length, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Alternatively, an arm may be comprised of one or more slidably extendible sections <b>710</b>, <b>730</b>, <b>735</b> adapted to be selectively extended to achieve a desired overall length, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B</figref>, <b>7</b>D, <b>7</b>E. One or more mechanical fasteners, such as a threaded bolt <b>715</b>, <b>720</b>, <b>725</b> screwed through a sleeve surrounding the slidable section in whole or in part, may be provided to lock the slidable arm into position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to the top perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>100</b> includes one or more arms <b>120</b> attached to a sleeve <b>115</b> and rotatably supported relative to a vertical axis defined by a vertical shaft <b>110</b> and horizontal planar base <b>155</b>. The sleeve <b>115</b> rotatably receives the shaft <b>110</b>. The lengthwise central axis of the sleeve <b>115</b> is aligned with the central vertical axis of the shaft <b>110</b>. The sleeve <b>115</b> may be freely moved up and down along the shaft <b>110</b>. The sleeve <b>115</b> may also freely rotate 360 degrees around the shaft <b>110</b>. The inner diameter of the sleeve is only slightly larger than the outer diameter of the shaft <b>110</b>. Although the fit should be loose enough to allow free rotation, it should be tight enough to preclude errant movement (e.g., wobbling) of the arm that could result in an appreciably inconsistent or non-uniform inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To allow greater height adjustment, the device may be equipped with adjustable sleeves. By way of example and not limitation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, an outer sleeve <b>740</b> may be provided to engage an inner sleeve that rests on the base <b>155</b>. In such an embodiment, the outer sleeve <b>740</b> may engage the inner sleeve at any vertical position along the length of the inner sleeve by tightening a bolt against the inner sleeve. In another embodiment, a parallel secondary sleeve <b>745</b> may be attached to the primary sleeve <b>115</b>, as conceptually shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>. A threaded support bolt that extends through the secondary sleeve <b>745</b> may be adjusted to support the primary sleeve <b>115</b> at a desired elevation on the shaft <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another means for height adjustment is a spacer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, one or more spacers <b>805</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>815</b> may be positioned on the shaft <b>110</b>, between the base <b>155</b> and sleeve <b>115</b>, thereby elevating the sleeve <b>115</b> and attached arm <b>120</b>. The spacers <b>805</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>815</b> may be comprised of washers or other suitable spacing devices, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An exemplary method of operation entails attaching the device to a drain; ensuring the device is level; spreading floor mud; installing and adjusting arm sections; rotating the arm; and progressively lowering the elevation of the arm and repeating rotation of the arm to achieve a desired uniform inclined surface. In operation, the clamping assembly is positioned over the exposed surface of a drain <b>160</b>, with the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b> contacting the periphery of one half of a drain <b>160</b>. The adjustable support <b>145</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> is then adjusted to exert force against the periphery of the opposite half of the drain <b>160</b>. Rotation of the knob <b>145</b>, causes corresponding rotation of the threaded actuator <b>220</b> in the threaded aperture of the clamping support <b>220</b>, which results in linear advancement of the clamping head <b>215</b> towards the stationary supports <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>. A leveling device (e.g., a spirit level) may be used and adjustments may be made to ensure that the base <b>155</b> is horizontal. Subsequently floor mud is spread around the device. The operator may then install an arm comprised of one or more sections. Spacers or other height adjustments may be utilized to ensure that the arm rests at an elevation where the working surface meets the applied floor mud. Then, the operator may rotate the arm around the shaft, either manually or employing a motorized drive. After each one or more complete rotation of the arm, the arm may be lowered such as by removing one or more spacers until the working edge comes in contact with the floor mud surface. Then, the operator may rotate the arm around the shaft again. The steps of rotation and lowering may be repeated until the bottom of the sleeve reaches the surface of the base (or any other limit defining a bottom position). Upon completion of the foregoing steps, the mud surface should exhibit the desired characteristics of a determined, uniform, consistent inclination from the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While an exemplary embodiment of the invention has been described, it should be apparent that modifications and variations thereto are possible, all of which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum relationships for the components of the invention and steps of the process, including variations in form, function and manner of operation, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.
