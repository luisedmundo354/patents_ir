<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A W plug (<b>24</b>) is formed and a W oxidation preventing barrier metal film (<b>25</b>) is formed thereon. After that, an SiON film (<b>27</b>) thinner than the W oxidation preventing barrier metal film (<b>25</b>) is formed and Ar sputter etching is performed on the SiON film (<b>27</b>). As a result, the shape of the surface of the SiON film (<b>27</b>) becomes gentler and deep trenches disappear. Next, an SiON film (<b>28</b>) is formed on the whole surface. A voidless W oxidation preventing insulating film (<b>29</b>) is composed of the SiON (<b>28</b>) film and the SiON film (<b>27</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device suitable for the manufacturing of a ferroelectric memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) is used as a non-volatile semiconductor memory. The structures of ferroelectric capacitors provided in a ferroelectric memory are broadly classified into the stack structure and the planar structure, and it is ferroelectric capacitors of planar structure that are mass-produced today.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In contrast, from requests for higher packing densities, it is demanded that capacitors of stack construction capable of reducing the cell area be put to practical use. In the stack structure, immediately under a bottom electrode of a ferroelectric capacitor there is provided a contact plug to ensure conduction with a substrate (a diffusion layer). As disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-44376, tungsten or polysilicon is generally used as the material for this contact plug. The contact resistance of a W plug is usually 2 to 3 Ω, whereas the contact resistance of a plug formed from polysilicon is 1 to 2 kΩ.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A ferroelectric memory is often mounted together with a logic circuit. For example, a security-related chip that requires certification and an IC card are examples. In a logic circuit, usually a W plug is used. Therefore, also in a simulation performed in designing a logic circuit, the resistance value of a W plug is used as a parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, to use equipment and techniques that have hitherto been used and to suppress an increase in the number of development steps and in cost, it is desirable to use a W plug as in the past in a logic part of a ferroelectric memory that is to be mounted together with a logic circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Usually, in forming a ferroelectric capacitor, various kinds of heat treatment, such as crystallization annealing and recovery annealing, are necessary for obtaining good characteristics. For example, crystallization annealing is RTA (rapid thermal annealing) at 750° C. for 60 seconds and recovery annealing is furnace annealing at 650° C. for 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, a W plug has the property of oxidizing at a very high speed and at a low temperature. When oxidation occurs in a part of a W plug once, the oxidation spreads over the whole plug. Therefore, contact defects are apt to occur and yields are apt to decrease. In order to suppress the oxidation of a W plug, it is desirable to lower the annealing temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, various kinds of annealing are required in order to improve the performance of a ferroelectric capacitor, whereas it is necessary to lower the annealing temperature to a somewhat low level in order to prevent an increase in the contact resistance of a W plug immediately under the capacitor. That is, under present circumstances, the performance of a ferroelectric capacitor and the contact performance of a W plug are in a trade-of relation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventionally, after the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor, a contact hole between a bit line of a ferroelectric memory and a substrate is formed by performing etching once. The reason why a contact hole is formed after the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor is that in a case where a contact hole is formed before the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor and a W plug is embedded, the W plug may be oxidized during the formation of the ferroelectric capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, when scaling down is promoted in the future, the aspect ratio of a contact hole increases, with the result that etching during the formation of a contact hole, embedding a glue film in a contact hole and the like become difficult.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device capable of suppressing an increase in contact resistance even when the annealing temperature is raised.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a first method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention, first, a switching element is formed on a surface of a semiconductor substrate. Next, an interlayer dielectric film that covers the switching element is formed. Subsequently, in the interlayer dielectric film, a contact hole that reaches a conductive layer of the switching element is formed. After that, a contact plug is embedded in the contact hole. Subsequently, on the interlayer dielectric film, a barrier metal film connected to the contact plug is selectively formed. Next, a first insulating film is formed on the whole surface. Subsequently, a surface slope of the first insulating film is made gentler by performing sputter etching on the first insulating film. And a ferroelectric capacitor is formed on the barrier metal film.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a second method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention, first, a switching element is formed on a surface of a semiconductor substrate. Next, an interlayer dielectric film that covers the switching element is formed. Subsequently, in the interlayer dielectric film, a contact hole that reaches a conductive layer of the switching element is formed. After that, a contact plug is embedded in the contact hole. Subsequently, on the interlayer dielectric film, a barrier metal film connected to the contact plug is selectively formed. Next, an insulating film thicker than the barrier metal film is formed on the whole surface by a high-density plasma process. And a ferroelectric capacitor is formed on the barrier metal film.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A reference example used in the process of making the present invention will be described here. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54A and 54B</figref> are each a sectional view that shows a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the reference example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54A and 54B</figref> each show a section perpendicular to the direction in which the bit lines <b>3</b> extend. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54A</figref> shows the section of a memory cell array part of a ferroelectric memory and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54B</figref> shows the section of a logic part (theoretical circuit part).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the reference example, first, a MOS transistor (not shown) provided with a source-drain diffusion layer <b>118</b> is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate (not shown). Next, a silicon oxide film <b>122</b> is formed in such a manner as to cover the MOS transistor and the silicon oxide film <b>122</b> is planarized by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) or the like. After that, by forming a contact hole that reaches each source-drain diffusion layer <b>118</b> in the silicon oxide film <b>122</b>, a plug contact part is opened. And after the formation of a glue film <b>123</b> in the contact hole, a W film is embedded by a CVD process, for example, and planarization is performed by CMP, whereby a W plug <b>124</b> is formed. Subsequently, an Ir film <b>125</b> is formed on the whole surface as a W oxidation preventing barrier metal film. After that, the Ir film <b>125</b> is patterned with using a hard mask. Subsequently, a W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b> and a capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b> are formed in this order on the whole surface, and by polishing the capacitor insulating adhesive film <b>150</b>, the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b> and the Ir film <b>125</b> by CMP, the Ir film <b>125</b> having a prescribed thickness is caused to remain and the capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b> is caused to remain on the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b>. The W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b> is, for example, a plasma SiON film and the capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b> is, for example, a TESO (tetraethylorthosilicate) film.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, a bottom electrode film <b>130</b>, a ferroelectric film <b>131</b> and a top electrode film <b>132</b> are formed in this order and a ferroelectric capacitor is formed by simultaneously patterning these films. Incidentally, the capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b> is formed to prevent the exfoliation of the bottom electrode film <b>130</b>. Subsequently, a ferroelectric memory is completed by forming an interlayer dielectric film (not shown) and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to this manufacturing method, even when high-temperature annealing is performed during the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor, the W plug <b>124</b> is not apt to be oxidized due to the Ir film (W oxidation preventing barrier metal film) <b>125</b> and the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b>. Also, concerning the contact between wirings provided in regions higher than the ferroelectric capacitors such as the bit lines and the substrate (the diffusion layer), the formation of the contact holes and the embedding of the glue films and W plugs are performed by two series of the steps. That is, the via-to-via structure is formed. Therefore, the aspect ratio of contact holes decreases and the formation of the contact holes is relatively easy even scaling down is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">However, in the manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54A and 54B</figref>, in a place where the spacing between adjacent Ir films <b>125</b> is narrow, the surface of the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b> becomes steep and a deep trench is formed. Therefore, during the formation of the capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b> this deep trench is not embedded with the capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b> and a clearance <b>151</b> remains.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">And if the polishing of the capacitor adhesive insulating film <b>150</b>, the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b> and the Ir film <b>125</b> is performed, with the clearance <b>151</b> kept, then slits and cracks occur, with the clearance <b>151</b> serving as an initiation point as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55A and 55B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, during the etching of the top electrode <b>132</b> and so on and during the removal of a hard mask used in the etching, with the slits and cracks kept, also the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>129</b> is etched via the slits and cracks and even the interlayer dielectric film <b>122</b> might be etched.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, if in this state the high-temperature annealing during capacitor formation (crystallization annealing or recovery annealing) is performed, then oxygen reaches even the W plug <b>124</b> via the interlayer dielectric film <b>122</b> and so on through the slits and cracks and the W plug is oxidized.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Therefore, in the reference example, it is difficult to obtain a high yield with suppressing an increase in contact resistance. Incidentally, even when the method disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-323821 or the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-133457, it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of slits and cracks in a ferroelectric memory as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Hence, to prevent the occurrence of slits and cracks the present inventors have devoted themselves to examinations and eventually hit upon various forms as described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> are sectional views that show, in order of step, a method of manufacturing a ferroelectric memory (semiconductor device) according to the first embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A and 13B</figref>, a well <b>12</b> is first formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>11</b> such as a silicon substrate. Subsequently, an element isolation region <b>13</b> is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b> with STI (shallow trench isolation), for example. Subsequently a gate insulating film <b>14</b>, a gate electrode <b>15</b>, a cap film <b>16</b>, a side wall <b>17</b>, a source-drain diffusion layer <b>18</b> and a silicide layer <b>19</b> are formed on the surface of the well, so that a MOS transistor (a switching element) <b>20</b> is formed. This MOS transistor <b>20</b> corresponds to a MOS transistor <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Incidentally, for each MOS transistor <b>20</b>, two source-drain diffusion layers <b>18</b> are formed for a source and a drain and one of the source-drain diffusion layers <b>18</b> is shared by two MOS transistors <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Next, a silicon oxynitride film <b>21</b> is formed on the whole surface in such a manner as to cover the MOS transistor <b>20</b>, a silicon oxide film <b>22</b> is further formed on the whole surface as an interlayer dielectric film, and the silicon oxide film <b>22</b> is planarized by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) or the like. The silicon oxynitride film <b>21</b> is formed to prevent the hydrogen degradation of the gate insulating film <b>14</b> and the like during the formation of the silicon oxide film <b>22</b>. After that, a contact hole that reaches each silicide layer <b>19</b> is formed in the silicon oxide film <b>22</b> and the silicon oxynitride film <b>21</b>, so that a plug contact part is opened. And after the formation of a glue film <b>23</b> in the contact hole, a W film is embedded by a CVD process, for example, and planarization is performed by CMP, whereby a W plug (a contact plug) <b>24</b> is formed. Subsequently, N<sub>2 </sub>plasma treatment is performed at 350° C. for 120 seconds. As the glue film <b>23</b>, for example, a stacked member composed of a Ti film having a thickness of 20 nm and a TiN film having a thickness of 50 nm is used.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, an Ir film <b>25</b> having a thickness of, for example, 450 nm is formed on the whole surface as a W oxidation preventing barrier metal film. After that, a TiN film <b>26</b><i>a </i>and a plasma TEOS film <b>26</b><i>b </i>that are used as a hard mask during patterning the Ir film <b>25</b> are formed in this order. The thickness of the TiN film <b>26</b><i>a </i>and the plasma TEOS film <b>26</b><i>b </i>are, for example, 200 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. Subsequently, the plasma TEOS film <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the TiN film <b>26</b><i>a </i>are patterned, so that a hard mask <b>26</b> is formed only in a region where a stack type ferroelectric capacitor is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, the etching of the Ir film <b>25</b> is performed with using the hard mask <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">After that, as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, a plasma SiON film (a first insulating film) <b>27</b> is formed. The thickness of the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> is, for example, 150 nm. At this point of time, a relatively steep and deep trench is present on the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> particularly in a region to which the island-like Ir film <b>25</b> stands close.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Subsequently, Ar sputter etching is performed on the plasma SiON film <b>27</b>. Concerning the conditions for Ar sputter etching, for example, for an RF power source, the source power is 1500 W (13.56 MHz) and the bias power is 1600 W (800 kHz). Also, the pressure in the chamber is 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr), the flow rate of Ar gas is 400 sccm, and the etching time is 30 seconds. As a result, after the removal of the part of the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> on the hard mask <b>26</b>, etching is completed before the part of the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> on the silicon oxide film <b>22</b> is completely removed. In this Ar sputter etching, generated residues accumulate on the part of the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> that remains at that time. And as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the surface of the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> becomes gentler gradually and the shape of the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> approaches a flat shape. Therefore, the steep and deep trench disappears from the plasma SiON film <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, a plasma SiON film (a second insulating film) <b>28</b> is formed. The thickness of the plasma SiON film <b>28</b> is, for example, 900 nm. Because at this time there is no steep and deep trench in the plasma SiON film <b>27</b>, no void is generated between the plasma SiON film <b>28</b> and the plasma SiON film <b>27</b>. A W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> that prevents the oxidation of the W plug <b>24</b> exposed in the logic part is composed of the plasma SiON films <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> (the plasma SiON films <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>), the hard mask <b>36</b> (the plasma TEOS film <b>26</b><i>b </i>and the TiN film <b>26</b><i>a</i>) and the Ir film <b>25</b> are polished by a CMP process. At this time, the remaining film thickness of the Ir film <b>25</b> and W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> after CMP is, for example, 350 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In manufacturing a ferroelectric memory, it is necessary to perform, after that, etching of a film that constitutes a ferroelectric capacitor, and removal of a hard mask used in this etching, as will be described later. And as a result of the etching and removal, the thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> will decrease by about 250 nm. Also, after the removal of the hard mask, to recover damage during etching, for example, furnace heat treatment is to be performed in an oxygen atmosphere at 650° C. for 60 minutes. At this time, it is necessary that in order to prevent the oxidation of the W plug <b>24</b>, the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> have a thickness of not less than 100 nm. Therefore, in this embodiment, to ensure that a thickness of about 100 nm remains even when the thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> decreases by about 250 nm, the remaining film thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> should be, for example, 350 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, a bottom electrode film <b>30</b>, a ferroelectric film <b>31</b> and a top electrode film <b>32</b> are formed in this order on the whole surface. For example, a stacked member composed of a 200 nm thick Ir film, a 23 nm thick PtO film and a 50 nm thick Pt film, which are formed in this order, is used as the bottom electrode film <b>30</b>. A Pb(Zr,Ti)O<sub>3 </sub>film (PZT film) having a thickness of, for example, 200 nm is used as the ferroelectric film <b>31</b>. An IrO<sub>2 </sub>film having a thickness of, for example, 200 nm is used as the top electrode film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Incidentally, before and after the formation of the bottom electrode film <b>30</b>, annealing for preventing film exfoliation is performed. For example, RTA (rapid thermal annealing) is performed in an Ar atmosphere at 750° C. for 60 seconds as the annealing. Also, after the formation of the ferroelectric film <b>31</b>, crystallization annealing is performed. For example, RTA at 600° C. for 90 seconds using Ar and O<sub>2</sub>, and RTA in an oxygen atmosphere at 750° C. for 60 seconds are performed as the annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">After the formation of the top electrode film <b>32</b>, a TiN film <b>33</b><i>a </i>and a plasma TEOS film <b>33</b><i>b </i>which are used as a hard mask during patterning the bottom electrode film <b>30</b>, the ferroelectric film <b>31</b> and the top electrode film <b>32</b> are formed in this order. Subsequently, the plasma TEOS film <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the TiN film <b>33</b><i>a </i>are patterned, so that a hard mask <b>33</b> is formed only in a region where a stack type ferroelectric capacitor is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>, a stack type ferroelectric capacitor is formed by spontaneously processing the top electrode film <b>32</b>, the ferroelectric film <b>31</b> and the bottom electrode film <b>30</b> with patterning and etching techniques using the hard mask <b>33</b> as a mask. This ferroelectric capacitor corresponds to the ferroelectric capacitor <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, the hard mask <b>33</b> is removed. As a result of the processing from the etching of the top electrode film <b>32</b>, the ferroelectric film <b>31</b> and the bottom electrode film <b>30</b> to the removal of the hard mask <b>33</b>, the thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> decreases by about 250 nm and the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> remains about 100 nm. Subsequently, to recover damage to the ferroelectric film <b>31</b> by film forming and etching processes and the like, recovery annealing is performed. At the recovery annealing, furnace annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 650° C. for 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>, an alumina film <b>34</b> is formed on the whole surface as a protective film that protects the ferroelectric capacitor from process damage. The thickness of the alumina film <b>34</b> is, for example, 50 nm. Next, furnace annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 650° C. for 60 minutes. Subsequently, an interlayer dielectric film <b>35</b> is formed on the whole surface and the planarization of the interlayer dielectric film <b>35</b> is performed by CMP. The remaining film thickness of the interlayer dielectric film <b>35</b> after the CMP is, for example, 400 nm on the top electrode film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Subsequently, by patterning and etching techniques, a contact hole that reaches the W plug <b>24</b> is formed in the interlayer dielectric film <b>35</b>, alumina film <b>34</b> and W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b>. Next, annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 550° C. for 60 minutes. Subsequently, after forming a glue film <b>36</b> in the contact hole, a W film is embedded and planarization is performed by CMP, whereby a W plug <b>37</b> is formed. As the glue film <b>36</b>, TiN having a thickness of, for example, 50 nm can be used. After that, the surfaces of the interlayer dielectric film <b>35</b> and W plug <b>37</b> are exposed to N<sub>2 </sub>plasma, for example, at 350° C. The time of this plasma treatment is, for example, 120 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Subsequently, a W oxidation preventing insulating film (not shown) is formed on the whole surface. For example, an SiON film is used as the W oxidation preventing insulating film and the thickness thereof is, for example, about 100 nm. Then., with patterning and etching techniques a contact hole that reaches the top electrode film <b>32</b> is formed in the W oxidation preventing insulating film and the interlayer dielectric film <b>35</b>. Subsequently, annealing to recover damage by etching is performed. This annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 550° C. for 60 minutes. After this annealing, the W oxidation preventing insulating film is removed by etch back.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, a lower-layer glue film <b>38</b>, a wiring material film <b>39</b> and an upper-layer glue film <b>40</b> are deposited in this order. As the lower-layer glue film, a TiN film having a thickness of, for example, 100 nm is used. As the wiring material film, an Al—Cu alloy film having a thickness of, for example, 400 nm is used. As the upper-layer glue film, for example, a stacked member composed of a Ti film having a thickness of 5 nm and a TiN film having a thickness of 70 nm is used.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Subsequently, an antireflection film (not shown) is formed on the glue film <b>40</b> and a resist film (not shown) is applied. Subsequently, the resist film is processed in such a manner as to be aligned with a wiring pattern, and the antireflection film, the glue film <b>40</b>, the wiring material film <b>39</b> and the glue film <b>38</b> are etched with using the resist film after processing as a mask. As the antireflection film, for example, an SiON film is used and the thickness thereof is, for example, about 31 nm. As a result of the etching, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> and FIGS. <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B, a wiring <b>41</b> of a prescribed plane shape that is composed of the glue film <b>40</b>, the wiring material film <b>39</b> and the glue film <b>38</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">After that, the formation of an interlayer dielectric film, the formation of a contact plug, the formation of wirings for the second and later layers, and the like are further carried out. And a cover film that is composed, for example, of a TEOS film and an SiN film is formed, so that a ferroelectric memory having a ferroelectric capacitor is completed. Incidentally, in the formation of upper-layer wirings, the wiring <b>41</b> connected to the top electrode film <b>32</b> is connected to the plate line and the wiring <b>41</b> connected to the source-drain diffusion layer <b>18</b> shared by the two MOS transistors <b>20</b> is connected to the bit line. For the gate electrode <b>15</b>, the gate electrode <b>15</b> may be the word line itself or in the upper-layer wirings, the gate electrode <b>15</b> may be connected to the word line.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described above, in the first embodiment, in forming the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> having a thickness of about 350 nm, the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> of about 150 nm is first formed and a steep trench is caused to disappear from the plasma SiON film <b>27</b> by performing Ar sputter etching, and then, the plasma SiON film <b>28</b> of about 900 nm is formed. Therefore, according to the first embodiment, the generation of voids in the W oxidation preventing insulating film <b>29</b> is prevented. As a result, it becomes possible to suppress a rise in contact resistance even when the annealing temperature is raised while preventing the occurrence of cracks and slits.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Furthermore, according to this embodiment, in the logic part, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 23B</figref>, a via-to-via contact is realized from the W plugs <b>37</b> and <b>24</b>. And the wiring <b>41</b> is connected to the source-drain diffusion layer <b>18</b> via this via-to-via contact. Because a large level difference corresponding to a ferroelectric capacitor is present in a ferroelectric memory compared to a usual logic article, the aspect ratio of the contact from the lowest-layer wiring <b>41</b> to the substrate (or a diffusion layer formed thereon) is relatively large. If in order to form the contact, a contact hole is opened by etching at once as in the conventional way, etching itself is difficult. Also, formation of a glue film is difficult. Therefore, new equipment suitable for opening such a contact hole and forming a glue film is necessary. In contrast, because etching and the formation of a glue film are relatively easy when a via-to-via hole is formed, it is possible to improve the yield of a ferroelectric memory and conventional equipments can be used as it is. Therefore, it is possible to reduce development expenses and process costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref> are sectional views that show, in order of step, a method of manufacturing a ferroelectric memory (semiconductor device) according to the second embodiment of the present invention. These figures each show a section perpendicular to the direction in which bit lines <b>3</b> extend. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A to 32A</figref> each show the section of a memory cell array of the ferroelectric memory, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24B to 32B</figref> each show the section of a logic part.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, series of processing from the formation of the well <b>12</b> to the formation of the W plug <b>24</b> are first performed in the same manner as with the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>, series of processing from the formation of the Ir film <b>25</b> to the formation of the hard mask <b>26</b> are performed in the same manner as with the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>, the etching of the Ir film <b>25</b> is performed with using the hard mask <b>26</b> in the same manner as with the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, an SiON film <b>42</b> is formed as a W oxidation preventing insulating film on the whole surface by an HDP (high density plasma) process. The thickness of the SiON film <b>42</b> is, for example, 400 nm.
