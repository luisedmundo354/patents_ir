<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a flat cable in which a plurality of extremely fine coaxial cables used for high-speed transmission are disposed parallel to each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Coaxial cables in which a core conductor is covered by a dielectric, the outer circumference of this dielectric is covered by a shielding layer composed of a conductor, and the outer circumference of this shielding layer is covered by an outer covering (jacket), are generally known, and are widely used as high-frequency transmission lines. In recent years, such coaxial cables have become increasingly fine; for example, extremely fine coaxial cables in which the diameter of the core conductor is 0.1 mm or less, and the external diameter of the coaxial cable is approximately 0.35 mm, have begun to be used in electronic devices such as compact notebook type personal computers, portable telephones and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such electronic devices, for example, a plurality of coaxial cables are used to establish electrical connections between the liquid crystal display part and main body part of a notebook type personal computer via a hinge with a small diameter, and such wiring and connections become complicated. Flat cables which are constructed by holding a plurality of coaxial cables parallel to each other in the same plane have been used as a means of establishing such complicated connections easily and securely. For instance, one example of such a flat cable is described in JP Patent Application No. 2004-27333. However, in the flat cable of this application, accurate maintenance of the pitch interval that is formed between the coaxial cables of the flat cable when the terminal treatment of the cable is performed after the flat cable is passed through a small-diameter hinge is difficult, and the terminal treatment is problematical.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, there are cases in which braided cables that are braided using a plurality of coaxial cables are used, for example, in the electrical connections between the liquid crystal display part and main body part in portable telephones and the like. Here, however, as was described above, accurate maintenance of the pitch interval that is formed between the cables when the terminal treatment of the cable is performed after the cable is passed through a small-diameter hinge is difficult, and the terminal treatment is problematical.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In portable telephones (hereafter referred to as “terminal devices”), progress has been made in reduction of the size and weight of such terminal devices, and in the increased functionality of such devices, and there is therefore a demand for complicated wiring and connections in spite of the limited space inside such terminal devices. Furthermore, in regard to the configuration of such terminal devices, in addition to the so-called folding type configuration in which a movable part on which a liquid crystal display part is formed opens and closes by pivoting about the main body part, terminal devices with a new configuration in which the movable part is attached to the main body part so that this movable part can rotate in addition to folding have appeared on the scene in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the abovementioned folding type and rotary type terminal devices, the movable part and main body part are connected via a cylindrical hinge that has a small diameter, and the liquid crystal display part and main body part are electrically connected by passing the abovementioned flat cable or braided cable through the hinge hole of the abovementioned hinge. Thus, flat cables or braided cables have come to be used in terminal devices; however, in the case of the flat cable or braided cable described in JP Patent Application No. 2004-27333, the cable is subjected to cable terminal working that accurately maintains the pitch interval between the coaxial cables in the flat cable or braided cable at a fixed value before the cable is passed through the hinge, e.g., a terminal treatment in which the respective coaxial cables are connected to the terminals of a connector or to an FPC (flexible printed circuit). If this is not done, accurate maintenance of the pitch interval after the cable has been passed through the hinge becomes difficult when the liquid crystal display part and main body part are electrically connected via the abovementioned cylindrical hinge that has a small diameter. On the other hand, if a terminal treatment is performed before the cable is passed through the hinge in order to ensure accurate maintenance of the pitch interval, the diameter of the terminal treatment part is increased, so that it becomes impossible to pass the cable through the hinge. However, it may be predicted that there will be a further diversification of terminal device configurations into various configurations in the future. On the one hand, taking into account the fact that there will be further progress in the reduction in size and weight of terminal devices, and the increased functionality of such terminal devices, the appearance of flat cables that allow the easy and secure accomplishment of complicated and difficult electrical connections, and flat cables that can ensure a uniform pitch between the coaxial cables, is to be hoped for.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention was devised in light of the various problems described above; it is an object of the present invention to provide a flat cable which is superior in terms of softness and flexibility, which can be passed through an extremely narrow through-hole, which can favorably maintain the precision of the pitch between the coaxial cables, and which allows the easy and secure accomplishment of complicated and difficult electrical connections.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the abovementioned object, the flat cable according to the invention is a flat cable which is constructed by laying a plurality of coaxial cables side by side parallel to each other, characterized in that the external diameter of the abovementioned coaxial cables is 0.15 to 0.35 mm, at least a portion of the outer circumference of each of these coaxial cables is fastened to a laminated sheet composed of a porous polytetrafluoroethylene that has a fused layer, and the cable is constructed so that this cable can pass via a through-hole with an internal diameter of 2.0 to 5.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result, in the flat cable according to the invention, since a plurality of coaxial cables are fastened to a laminated sheet composed of a porous polytetrafluoroethylene that has a fused layer, the flat cable is superior in terms of softness and flexibility, and the flat cable can be passed through even an extremely small through-hole by folding or rolling up the flat cable in the direction of length, while favorably maintaining the precision of the pitch between the coaxial cables, so that complicated and difficult electrical connections can be easily and securely accomplished. Consequently, the flat cable of the present invention can be passed through the hinge hole of a portable telephone, and can therefore be used for the electrical connections of portable telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in addition to the features described above, the flat cable according to another embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the cable has at least 20 of the abovementioned coaxial cables. As a result, the flat cable according to this embodiment of the invention can be passed through an extremely small through-hole while favorably maintaining the precision of the pitch between the coaxial cables, by folding or rolling up the flat cable, so that this flat cable can handle even electronic devices that require a higher degree of complicated wiring and connections.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, in addition to the features described above, the flat cable according to another embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the thickness of the abovementioned laminated sheet is 30 to 150 μm. Accordingly, the flat cable according to this embodiment of the invention is superior in terms of softness and flexibility, and can also be constructed so as to show favorable results in terms of durability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the flat cable according to another embodiment of the invention is further characterized in that the abovementioned fused layer is composed of a tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer. As a result, in the flat cable according to this embodiment of the invention, the abovementioned coaxial cables can be fastened to the abovementioned laminated sheet by thermal fusion; furthermore, by performing laser working on portions of the abovementioned laminated sheet following fusion fastening, it is possible to strip these portions.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">First, a typical embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram which respectively shows the coaxial cables <b>10</b> and laminated sheet <b>50</b> constituting the flat cable of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view showing flat cables <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view respectively showing the flat cable in a folded state and rolled-up state.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>, the flat cables <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the present invention are constructed by fastening a plurality of extremely fine coaxial cables disposed side by side parallel to each other at equal intervals using one or more laminated sheets <b>50</b>. First, the coaxial cables <b>10</b> and laminated sheet <b>50</b> that constitute the flat cables <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> is a sectional view showing a cross section (a section perpendicular to the axial direction, where the axial direction is the direction of extension of the coaxial cables <b>10</b>) of the coaxial cables <b>10</b>. The coaxial cables <b>10</b> are constructed as follows: namely, a dielectric layer <b>12</b> composed of an insulating material is formed on the circumference of a core conductor <b>11</b> which is constructed by twisting together a plurality of conductors (e.g., seven conductors) (with a diameter of, for example, approximately 20 μm), and a plurality of conductors are laterally wrapped around the outer circumference of this dielectric layer <b>12</b> so that a shielding layer <b>13</b> is formed. Then, an outer covering <b>14</b> composed of an insulating material is formed on the outer circumference of the shielding layer <b>13</b>. These coaxial cables <b>10</b> are cables that can be used to connect the liquid crystal display part and main body part of the abovementioned portable telephone; for example, the external diameter of the coaxial cables <b>10</b> is extremely small, i.e., approximately 0.15 to 0.3 mm. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer (hereafter referred to as “PFA”) is used as the material of the dielectric layer <b>12</b> and outer covering <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref> is a perspective view showing the laminated sheet <b>50</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(C)</figref> is a sectional view of the same (a view in the direction indicated by the arrows along the line X-X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref>). As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(C)</figref>, the laminated sheet <b>50</b> has a two-layer structure composed of a base layer <b>51</b> and a fused layer <b>52</b>. The base layer <b>51</b> is an ultra-thin sheet formed by working a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (hereafter referred to as “EPTFE”) into a band form with a thickness of 30 to 100 μm. The EPTFE can be obtained by drawing a raw-material polytetrafluoroethylene (hereafter referred to as “PTFE”), and is a fluororesin with a very fine continuously porous structure. This EPTFE is superior in terms of heat resistance, chemical resistance, weather resistance and the like; furthermore, this material is superior in terms of durability even when worked into an ultra-thin sheet with a thickness of 30 to 100 μm, and also shows abundant softness and extremely good flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fused layer <b>52</b> is formed on the side of the base layer <b>51</b> to which the coaxial cables <b>10</b> are fastened, and is a fused layer with a thickness of approximately 10 to 50 μm composed of a tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (hereafter referred to as “FEP”). The fused layer <b>52</b> composed of this FEP can easily fasten the outer covering <b>14</b> composed of the abovementioned PFA (coaxial cables <b>10</b>) and the base layer <b>51</b> composed of the abovementioned EPTFE (laminated sheet <b>50</b>) by thermal fusion. Furthermore, as a result of this fastening by thermal fusion, a portion of the laminated sheet <b>50</b> can be stripped by laser working following such fastening by thermal fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The flat cable <b>101</b> of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> is a flat cable in which a plurality of the abovementioned coaxial cables <b>10</b> are disposed side by side parallel to each other so that the spacing between the coaxial cables <b>10</b> (hereafter referred to as the “cable pitch”) is, for example, 0.4 mm, the laminated sheet <b>50</b> is disposed on the upper parts of the coaxial cables <b>10</b>, . . . , <b>10</b> from above so that the fused layer <b>52</b> is on the side of the coaxial cables <b>10</b>, and the coaxial cables <b>10</b>, . . . , <b>10</b> are fastened to the fused layer <b>52</b> by fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The flat cable <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref> is a flat cable in which the abovementioned flat cable <b>101</b> is also fastened by fusion by means of a laminated sheet <b>50</b> from the undersides of the coaxial cables <b>10</b>, . . . , <b>10</b>. Specifically, the flat cable <b>102</b> has a two-sided laminated structure in which the coaxial cables <b>10</b>, . . . , <b>10</b> are clamped by two laminated sheets <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> (in contrast, the structure of the flat cable <b>101</b> is called a “single-sided laminated structure”).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, the flat cable of the present invention may have either a two-sided laminated structure in which a plurality of coaxial cables <b>10</b> are clamped from both sides, or a single-sided laminated structure in which a laminated sheet is installed on only one side. The structure that is adopted can be arbitrarily selected in accordance with the intended use of the flat cable.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, in the flat cables <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the present embodiment, there are no particular restrictions on the number of coaxial cables <b>10</b> that are fastened by means of the laminated sheet(s) <b>50</b>. For example, in a portable telephone, a flat cable composed of approximately 20 to 50 coaxial cables is used; however, the number of coaxial cables may also be approximately 500 to 600. Furthermore, the cable pitch is likewise not restricted to 0.4 mm; this pitch can be set at a preferred cable pitch in accordance with the intended use of the flat cable and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As was described above, in the flat cables <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the present embodiment, extremely fine coaxial cables with an external diameter of approximately 0.2 to 0.3 mm are disposed side by side parallel to each other in the same plane, and are fastened by thermal fusion to one or more laminated sheets <b>50</b> composed of EPTFE. Accordingly, in the flat cables <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, a specified cable pitch can be maintained with no disturbance of the respective coaxial cables <b>10</b>, while maintaining a good flexibility. Especially in the case of the flat cable <b>101</b> which has a one-sided laminated structure, there is a high degree of freedom in the configurability of the cable, so that the flat cable <b>101</b> can easily be folded in the axial direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, or so that the flat cable <b>101</b> can easily be rolled up in the axial direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>. Furthermore, in the examples of the flat cable <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B)</figref>, the cables are in a state which is such that the laminated sheet(s) <b>50</b> envelop the plurality of coaxial cables <b>10</b> in order to hold the plurality of fastened coaxial cables <b>10</b> and prevent the respective coaxial cables <b>10</b> from becoming disordered. Thus, for example, the folded flat cable <b>101</b> or rolled-up flat cable <b>101</b> can be passed through the hinge hole <b>8</b><i>a </i>(through-hole) formed in the hinge <b>80</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Meanwhile, in the case of the abovementioned folding type or rotary type portable telephones, a hinge is used in which a hinge hole (through-hole) that has an internal diameter of approximately 3.0 to 5.5 mm and a depth of approximately 5 to 20 mm is formed. Especially in recent years, hinges have been used in which hinge holes with an internal diameter of approximately 3.0 to 4.0 mm and a depth of approximately 5 to 20 mm are formed. Furthermore, it may be predicted that the internal diameter will be reduced even further to a diameter of approximately 2.0 to 3.0 mm. As was described above, various problems arise when a conventional flat cable is passed through such a small hinge hole, so that such a passage is difficult. However, the present invention makes it possible to provide a flat cable whose configuration can easily be varied while maintaining a good flexibility by disposing extremely fine coaxial cables <b>10</b> side by side parallel to each other, and fastening these coaxial cables by thermal fusion using laminated sheet(s) <b>50</b> composed of EPTFE. As a result, the flat cable of the present invention can be passed through even the extremely small through-holes formed in the hinges used in rotary type portable telephones and the like. Accordingly, the flat cable of the present invention can also be used in rotary type portable telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, the terminal structure of the flat cable <b>101</b> of the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are plan views showing examples of the terminal structure at one end of the flat cable <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref> is a plan view (seen from the side of the laminated sheet <b>50</b>) of a flat cable <b>101</b> on which no terminal working has been performed. A plurality of coaxial cables <b>10</b> are fastened parallel to each other by thermal fusion to the back side of the laminated sheet <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the flat cable <b>101</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, a portion of the laminated sheet <b>50</b> is stripped by laser working so that a central laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>a </i>and an end-portion laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>b </i>are left, and the outer coverings <b>14</b> of the plurality of coaxial cables <b>10</b> fastened by means of the laminated sheets <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>are removed by laser working. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, the shielding layers <b>13</b> of the coaxial cables <b>10</b> whose outer coverings <b>14</b> have been removed are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The flat cable <b>101</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref> is a flat cable that is formed by subjecting the abovementioned flat cable <b>101</b><i>b </i>to a treatment that removes a portion of the shielding layer <b>13</b> so that the dielectric layer <b>12</b> of each coaxial cable <b>10</b> is exposed (hereafter referred to as “shielding cutting”).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, the use and function of the flat cable <b>101</b> of the present embodiment can be improved by performing various types of terminal treatments. In particular, in the flat cables <b>101</b><i>b </i>and <b>101</b><i>c</i>, since the end portion of the laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>b </i>holds the coaxial cables <b>10</b> in place, the precision of the pitch of the tip ends of the coaxial cables <b>10</b> can be maintained at a favorable level when the flat cable is passed through a hinge or the like. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows examples of the terminal structure; the terminal structure of the flat cable of the present invention is not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, the manner in which the flat cable <b>101</b> of the present embodiment can be used will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view showing an example of the manner in which the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c </i>can be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a plan view showing a state in which the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is passed through a hinge <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref>, a cut is formed by laser working in an arbitrary position of the laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>a </i>that remains in the center of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i>, and this flat cable can be used with a portion of the laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>a </i>stripped away along this cut (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>). In this case, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(C)</figref>, a band-form laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>f </i>may be left in an arbitrary position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> shows a state in which one end of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is passed via a through-hole <b>80</b><i>a </i>formed in the hinge <b>80</b>, with this flat cable in a folded or rolled-up state. As was described above, the laminated sheet <b>50</b> is formed from EPTFE, and is therefore superior in terms of softness and flexibility. Accordingly, the tip end of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> can be passed through even a small through-hole <b>80</b><i>a </i>formed in the hinge or the like of a terminal device, by folding or rolling up this tip end of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>. After the tip end of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> has been passed through this hinge <b>80</b>, the tip end of the flat cable may again be spread out as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>. Since the coaxial cables <b>10</b> are fastened by means of the laminated sheet <b>50</b><i>b </i>in the end part of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> as described above, the connection of the flat cable <b>101</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is easy and secure; furthermore, the precision of the pitch of the coaxial cables <b>10</b> can be favorably maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, working examples of the present invention will be described. A hinge passage test was performed using the flat cables <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b> of Working Examples 1 through 5 described below.</p>
