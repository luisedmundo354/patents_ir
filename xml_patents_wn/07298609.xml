<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-40850, filed Jun. 23, 2003, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a computer, and more particularly, to a computer in which a main board is easily attached and detached.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a computer includes a box shaped casing formed with at least one opening side, and a casing cover to cover the opening of the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM (compact disc—read only memory) drive, etc., are disposed in a front of the casing. A main board mounted with a CPU (central processing unit), a RAM (random access memory), and an expansion card such as a graphic card, a sound card, etc. are disposed on an inside wall of the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a main board can be attached onto the inside wall of the casing with various devices. For example, there is a main board supporting device disclosed in Korean Utility Model First Publication No.1998-4735, wherein the main board supporting device comprises a supporting projection protruding from a casing, a bracket to support a main board supported by the supporting projection, an elastic member allowing the bracket to slide elastically, and a guide part to guide the bracket elastically sliding by the elastic member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, a main board supporting device having a structure simpler than the conventional main board supporting device, allows a user to more easily attach the main board to and detach the main board from the casing. Further, from a manufacturer's point of view, time taken to assemble the computer is reduced and therefore the computer is improved in its productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, if a position of the main board supporting device varies according to sizes of the main board, a user can conveniently replace the main board with another one regardless of the sizes of the main board.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide a computer in which a main board is easily attached and detached.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing and/or other aspects of the present invention are achieved by providing a computer comprising a casing forming an outer appearance and having a main board attaching surface to which a main board is attached, and further comprising a main board support provided on the main board attaching surface to support the main board, the main board support comprising a holder having a lock, slidably combined to the main board attaching surface, and preventing the main board, which is attached onto the main board attaching surface, from moving; and a guide formed on the main board attaching surface at a position spaced from the main board to guide the holder, the lock being locked to the guide.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention, the holder comprises a main body having the locks respectively formed in opposite sides thereof; a first grip upwardly extended from each lock and allowing the pair of locks to move toward and away from each other; a holder provided at an end of the main body between the pair of first grips to support one edge of the main board; a second grip protruding from an upper surface of the main body at a position opposite to the holder and pushing the main body to slide; and an elongated guide hole formed on the main body between the holder and the second grip.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the invention, the guide comprises a pair of latches, which are apart from each other in accordance with the width of the holder, to which the locks of the holder are locked; and a guide projection protruding from the main board attaching surface between the pair of latches and inserted into the elongated guide hole of the holder to guide the holder slidably.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the invention, each latch is formed by bending the main board attaching surface upwardly to accommodate the edge of the main body, and the pairs of latches are plurally arranged at regular intervals along a lengthwise direction of the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the invention, the guiding projection comprises an extension protruding from the main board attaching surface, and an insert extended from the extension and having a larger diameter than that of the extension, and the elongated guide hole includes an insertion section having a larger width than that of the insert, and a moving section communicated with the insertion section and having a smaller width than that of the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the invention, the computer further comprises a combining unit to attach the main board to the main board attaching surface, wherein the combining unit includes at least one boss hole formed on the main board; and at least one boss protruding from the main board attaching surface and inserted into the boss hole.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect of the invention, the boss includes a column protruding from the main board attaching surface; a head having a diameter larger than that of the column; and a recession circumferentially formed between the column and the head, and the boss hole includes a broad section having a larger width than the diameter of the head of the boss; and a narrow section having a smaller width than the diameter of the broad section and communicated with the broad section.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>

Therefore, at an initial position in which the main board <b>20</b> is first attached to the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>, the head <b>62</b> of the boss <b>60</b> passes through the broad section <b>52</b>. Then, after the head <b>62</b> has passed through the broad section <b>52</b>, the main board <b>20</b> is slid in a direction of an arrow “A” shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, so that the recession <b>63</b> of the boss <b>60</b> is held by the narrow section <b>53</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, the main board <b>20</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is in a holding position at which the recession <b>63</b> is held by the narrow section <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The main board supporting unit includes a holder <b>30</b> to prevent the main board <b>20</b> from moving, and a guide to guide the holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The holder <b>30</b> is slidably combined to the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>, and prevents the main board <b>20</b> from moving from the holding position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the holder <b>30</b> comprises a main body <b>31</b> having a pair of locks <b>32</b> respectively formed in opposite sides thereof to be locked to a latch <b>41</b> of the guide (to be described later), a pair of first grips <b>34</b> upwardly extended from the respective locks <b>32</b> and allowing the locks <b>32</b> to move toward and away from each other, a holding part <b>35</b> provided at an end of the main body <b>31</b> between the first grips <b>34</b> to hold one edge of the main board <b>20</b>, a second grip <b>36</b> protruding from an upper surface of the main body <b>31</b> at a position opposite to the holding part <b>35</b> and pushing the main body <b>31</b>, and an elongated guide hole <b>37</b> formed on the main body <b>31</b> between the holding part <b>35</b> and the second grip <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A cutting part <b>33</b>, which allows the first grips <b>34</b> to elastically move toward and away from each other is formed in the main body <b>31</b> adjacent to the first grip <b>34</b>, thereby allowing the locks <b>32</b> to elastically move toward and away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The guide is formed on the main board attaching surface <b>6</b> at a position spaced from the main board <b>20</b>, and is employed to slidably guide the holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The guide comprises the pair of latches <b>41</b> being apart from each other corresponding to the width of the holder <b>30</b> and to which the locks <b>32</b> of the holder <b>30</b> are locked, and a guiding projection <b>42</b>. The guiding projection <b>42</b> protrudes from the main board attaching surface <b>6</b> between the latches <b>41</b> and is inserted into the elongated guide hole <b>37</b> of the holder <b>30</b> to slidably guide the holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each latch <b>41</b> is formed by cutting and bending the main board attaching surface <b>6</b> upwardly to accommodate the edges of the main body <b>31</b>. The pairs of latches <b>41</b> being apart from each other corresponding to the width of the holder <b>30</b> are plurally arranged at regular intervals along a lengthwise direction of the holder <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, three pairs of latches will be referred to as first latches <b>41</b><i>a</i>, second latches <b>41</b><i>b </i>and third latches <b>41</b><i>c </i>in sequence according to their proximity to the main board <b>20</b>. Thus, the pair of locks <b>32</b> are selectively locked to one of the pairs of latches <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>and <b>41</b><i>c </i>according to the size of the main board <b>20</b> which is to be attached to the main board attaching surface <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The guiding projection <b>42</b> comprises an extension <b>44</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, protruding from the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>, and an insert <b>43</b>, which is extended from the extension <b>44</b>, having a diameter larger than that of the extension <b>44</b>, so that the guiding projection <b>42</b> is inserted in the elongated guide hole <b>37</b> of the holder <b>30</b> and is employed in slidably guiding the holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the elongated guide hole <b>37</b> includes an insertion section <b>38</b> having a larger width than the diameter of the insert <b>43</b>, and a moving section <b>39</b>, which is communicated with the insert <b>38</b>, having a smaller width than that of the insert <b>43</b>, so that the guiding projection <b>42</b> can slide through the elongated guide hole <b>37</b>, thereby slidably guiding the holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the computer according to the present invention, a process of attaching the main board <b>20</b> onto the main board attaching surface <b>6</b> will be described hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, the main board <b>20</b> is placed on the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>, with the heads <b>62</b> of the bosses <b>60</b> passing through the boss holes <b>51</b> of the main board <b>20</b>, respectively. At this time, the main board <b>20</b> may move freely where the heads <b>62</b> of the bosses <b>60</b> have been passed through the broad section <b>52</b>, and the main board <b>20</b> is in the initial position (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a user slides the main board <b>20</b> in the direction of the arrow “A” from the initial position, so that the head <b>62</b> of the boss <b>60</b> moves to the narrow section <b>53</b> of the boss hole <b>51</b> and the recession <b>63</b> of the boss <b>60</b> is held by the narrow section <b>53</b>. At this time, the main board <b>20</b> is held on the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>, and the main board <b>20</b> is in the holding position (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a user presses the pair of first grips <b>34</b> of the holder <b>30</b> to be closer together, so that the pair of locks <b>32</b> may move closer together due to force applied by the cutting part <b>33</b>. There, the holder <b>30</b> is inserted between the pair of third latches <b>41</b><i>c </i>formed on the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>, with the insert <b>43</b> of the guiding projection <b>42</b> passing through the insertion section <b>38</b> of the elongated guide hole <b>37</b>. Then, a user pushes the holder <b>30</b> in the same direction that the main board <b>20</b> slides (the arrow direction “A” of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). There, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the insert <b>43</b>, passed through the insertion section <b>38</b> of the elongated guide hole <b>37</b>, moves to the moving section <b>39</b> until the locks <b>32</b> of the holder <b>30</b> reach the first latch <b>41</b><i>a</i>, passing through the third and second latches <b>41</b><i>c </i>and <b>41</b><i>b </i>in sequence. When the locks <b>32</b> reach the first latch <b>41</b><i>a</i>, a user releases the first grips <b>34</b>, so that the pair of locks <b>32</b> elastically returns to their original state and are respectively locked to the pair of first latches <b>41</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Thus, the holder <b>30</b> is combined to the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>. There, the holding part <b>35</b> holds one edge of the main board <b>20</b>, so that the main board <b>20</b> is firmly and immovably attached to the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In contrast, the main board <b>20</b> may be detached from the main board attaching surface <b>6</b> in the inverse order of the foregoing attaching process. First, a user presses the pair of first grips <b>34</b> of the holder <b>30</b> to be closer together, thereby releasing the locks <b>32</b> from the first latches <b>41</b><i>a</i>. In this state, the holder <b>30</b> is drawn in the opposite direction of the arrow “A” until the insert <b>43</b> reaches the insertion section <b>38</b> of the elongated guide hole <b>37</b>, and then the holder <b>30</b> is separated from the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>. When the holder <b>30</b>, preventing the main board <b>20</b> from moving, is removed, the main board <b>20</b> can be slid out of position. Therefore, when the head <b>62</b> of the boss <b>60</b> reaches the broad section <b>52</b> of the boss hole <b>51</b> by sliding the main board <b>20</b> in the opposite direction of the arrow “A”, the main board <b>20</b> may be detached from the main board attaching surface <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the case of a main board <b>20</b><i>a </i>which is larger than the main board <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in terms of a length “L”, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the main board <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be firmly attached onto the main board attaching surface <b>6</b> by the foregoing attaching process, with the locks <b>32</b> of the holder <b>30</b> being locked to the second latches <b>41</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, in the computer according to the present invention, the main board may be easily attached to and detached from the casing, so that, from a manufacturer's point of view, time taken to assemble the computer is reduced. Therefore the computer is improved in its productivity. Additionally, the components are protected from damage, which may occur while the main board is attached to or detached from the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, in the computer according to the present invention, the pairs of latches are arranged at regular intervals along the lengthwise direction, so that the locks of the holder to hold the main board can be selectively locked to the latches according to the size of the main board. Therefore, various sizes of the main board can be firmly attached to the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the present invention provides a computer, in which a main board is easily attached to and detached from a casing, so that time taken to assemble the computer is reduced and therefore the computer is improved in its productivity, components are protected from damage which may occur while the main board is attached to or detached from the casing, and various sizes of the main board can be firmly attached to the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
