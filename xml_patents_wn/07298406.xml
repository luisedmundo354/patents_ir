<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A ground referenced pixel reset circuit is disclosed. The ground referenced pixel reset circuit supplies a pixel with a reset signal such that when the reset signal is asserted high, the reset signal is at a ground referenced reset voltage independent from a supply voltage. The pixel includes a photosensor, such as a photodiode, that is coupled to a ground having a same potential as the ground of the reference voltage supply.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for digital image capture. In particular, the present method and apparatus provide for reduced row reset noise in image sensors, such as active pixel sensors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Image sensor circuits are used in a variety of different types of digital image capture systems, including products such as scanners, copiers, digital cameras, and the like. The image sensor typically includes an array of light-sensitive pixels that are electrically responsive to incident light reflected from an object or scene whose image is to be captured.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The performance of an image capture system depends, at least in part, on the sensitivity of each individual pixel in the sensor array and its immunity from noise. Pixel sensitivity relates to the ratio of a change in the pixel output voltage to the photogenerated charge in the pixel. Noise may be defined as small fluctuations in a signal that can be caused by a variety of sources. Image sensors with increased noise immunity tend to yield sharper, more accurate images in the presence of environmental and other noise.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Improving the noise immunity of each pixel permits a reduction in exposure time, which in turn allows the capture of images at a greater rate. This may allow the image capture system to better capture motion in the scene. In addition to allowing greater frame rate, greater noise immunity may also help to resolve detail in images captured under low light conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrated circuit imaging devices typically include an array of light detecting elements interconnected to generate analog signals representative of an image illuminating the device. Within such an integrated circuit, each image-sensing element contained in the integrated circuit usually contains a photosensor, such as a photodiode or phototransistor, as a light-detecting element. In one example, charge is collected or dissipated in accordance with the intensity of light illuminating the photosensor. By storing the resultant charge, an analog signal is thus generated having a magnitude approximately proportional to the intensity of light illuminating the light detecting element during an exposure interval.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">During one common mode of operation, each pixel has a photo-sensitive diode, or photodiode, that is first reset by placing a charge across the photodiode. Then, the photodiode is exposed to incident light, which causes the charge stored on the photodiode to be dissipated in proportion to the intensity of the incident light. After a predetermined time period during which the photodiode is exposed to the incident light and charge is allowed to dissipate from the photodiode (i.e., the “integration” or “exposure” time), the charge at the node of the photodiode is read out. This value is the integrated voltage and may be sampled, such as onto a capacitor, by opening a switch or by other means.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">After the charge at the node of the photodiode has been read-out, the photodiode is reset by asserting a reset signal to a reset transistor within the pixel. The amount of incident light that is detected by the photodiode is computed by subtracting the integrated voltage level from the reset voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to fluctuations in the power supply voltage, however, the reset level varies between resets. Thus, the noise present in the power supply affects the reset level. Because entire rows of photodiodes are typically reset at the same time, the noise generated tends to affect all the photodiodes in a row. This may result in each row having a different variation in noise that appears as row noise in an image. This noise may be manifest as row-wise coherent noise in an image captured by an array of pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional background information is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,133,862, 5,841,126, 6,147,846, and 5,345,266, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is desirable to have a method and apparatus of using current pixel designs to achieve improved noise performance using electrical circuitry available with standard MOS fabrication and other suitable processes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with one embodiment, a reset control circuit provides a reset signal that is independent from a supply voltage. A pixel reset line is coupled to a reference voltage source via a switch to provide a high level reset signal at the reference voltage. The reference voltage is referenced to a same ground as an anode of a photosensor, such as a photodiode, of the pixel and is independent of the supply voltage. The reference voltage may drive the reset line through an operational amplifier buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An image capture system according to one embodiment includes a pixel having a photodetector coupled to a source terminal of a reset field effect transistor (FET). A gate terminal of the reset FET is coupled to a reset line for receiving a reset signal and the drain terminal of the reset FET is coupled to a supply voltage. A reference voltage source is provided and is coupled to the reset line via a switch to selectively provide the gate terminal of the reset FET with a reset signal at the reference voltage. The reference voltage is independent of the supply voltage. The reset FET may comprise an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present apparatus and method, an operational amplifier buffer is coupled along the reset line between the reference voltage source and the gate terminal of the reset FET.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Hence, pursuant to an aspect of the present apparatus and method, because the reset signal level is independent of the supply voltage, a difference signal generated by an associated column circuit is substantially independent of variations in the supply voltage. Since the reset signal level does not substantially change between resets, noise caused by differences in reset signal level between resets is reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, a first reset signal is initially provided to a pixel, the first reset signal being equal to a reference voltage. Next, a first voltage value generated at the pixel following a light exposure interval is read, the reference voltage being independent from the supply voltage. A second reset signal is then provided to the pixel, the second reset signal being equal to the reference voltage and a second voltage value is read from the pixel. Lastly, a pixel value is generated using the first and the second voltage values.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additional details regarding the present apparatus and method may be understood by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an image capture system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The image capture system <b>100</b> includes a pixel array <b>102</b>, a row reset circuit <b>104</b>, a row decoder circuit <b>106</b>, and a column circuit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The column circuit <b>108</b> may comprise, for example, a column circuit similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,471,515, which is incorporated herein by reference, or other suitable column circuit. The column circuit <b>108</b> may also be referred to as a “sample and hold” circuit. The row decoder circuit <b>106</b> provides row signals for selecting a row of pixels for readout and may comprise a row decoder circuit similar to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,133,862 and 5,841,126. The row reset circuit <b>104</b> and the row decoder circuit <b>106</b> may share decoding logic.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pixel array <b>102</b> includes rows <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of pixels <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, respectively. Row <b>110</b> includes pixels <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B, <b>120</b>C, and <b>120</b>N. Row <b>112</b> includes pixels <b>122</b>A, <b>122</b>B, <b>122</b>C, and <b>122</b>N. Row <b>114</b> includes pixels <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B, <b>124</b>C, and <b>124</b>N. The number of rows of pixels and the number of pixels in each row may vary and the rows <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of pixels are merely illustrative of one example. The pixel array <b>102</b> may be configured in conformance with the VGA (Video Graphics Array) standard or other suitable standard.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated, pixels in a common row of pixels may share a common row line and a common reset line. For example, the pixels of row <b>110</b> share row line <b>130</b> and reset line <b>140</b>. Likewise, the pixels of rows <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> share row lines <b>132</b>, <b>142</b> and reset lines <b>134</b>, <b>144</b>, respectively. Further, each column of pixels within the pixel array <b>102</b> is connected to a common column line <b>150</b>, which electrically connects the pixels of the associated column with the column circuit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates details of the row reset circuit <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

The operational amplifier <b>208</b> receives the reference voltage via the reference line <b>204</b> at one input and the operational amplifier output voltage via a feedback line <b>210</b> at the other input. In this configuration, the operational amplifier <b>208</b> serves as a non-inverting unity gain amplifier and a reference voltage buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A switching device <b>212</b> receives the output voltage of the operational amplifier <b>208</b>. The switching device <b>212</b> selectively supplies the reference voltage to the reset lines <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> and connects the reset lines not being supplied with the reference voltage to ground. In one embodiment, the switching device <b>212</b> comprises a multiplexer, although other switching devices and switching configurations may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown, the switching device <b>212</b> includes switches <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> associated with line <b>140</b>. The switches <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> operate opposite each other so that when the switch <b>220</b> is in an open position, the switch <b>230</b> is closed and connects the reset line <b>140</b> to ground <b>240</b>. When the switch <b>220</b> is in a closed position, the switch <b>230</b> is opened such that the reset line <b>140</b> is supplied with the reference voltage, as amplified by the operational amplifier <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similarly, the switches <b>222</b> and <b>232</b> operate opposite each other so that when the switch <b>222</b> is in an open position, the switch <b>232</b> is closed and connects the reset line <b>142</b> to ground <b>242</b>. When the switch <b>222</b> is in a closed position, the switch <b>232</b> is opened such that the reset line <b>142</b> is supplied with the reference voltage, as amplified by the operational amplifier <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Likewise, the switches <b>224</b> and <b>234</b> operate opposite each other so that when the switch <b>220</b> is in an open position, the switch <b>234</b> is closed and connects the reset line <b>144</b> to ground <b>244</b>. When the switch <b>224</b> is in a closed position, the switch <b>234</b> is opened such that the reset line <b>144</b> is supplied with the reference voltage, as amplified by the operational amplifier <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, since the switching device <b>212</b> typically supplies the reference voltage to only one of the reset lines <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> at any given time, when the switch <b>220</b> closes, the switches <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> are closed and the switches <b>230</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b> are open. Similarly, when the switch <b>222</b> closes, the switches <b>230</b> and <b>234</b> are closed and the switches <b>220</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>232</b> are open. Likewise, when the switch <b>224</b> closes, the switches <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> are closed and the switches <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>234</b> are open.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The switches of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are all illustrated in open positions for convenience of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The switching device <b>212</b> is one example mechanism for supplying the reference voltage to the various reset lines <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b>. Other mechanisms may alternatively be employed. For example, a separate reference voltage source (not shown) may alternatively be provided for each of the reset lines <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in dashed lines, the row reset circuit <b>104</b> may optionally include a level shift circuit <b>209</b> and a bootstrap circuit <b>211</b> for implementations where the generated reset voltage at node <b>213</b> is bootstrapped to a level greater than or equal to the supply voltage V<sub>dd</sub>. The level shift circuit <b>209</b> may be implemented as a source follower or as a capacitive divider to shift the bootstrap voltage down to equal the reference voltage. The bootstrap circuit <b>211</b> boosts the reset voltage at <b>213</b> above the reference voltage and may be implemented, for example, as a switched capacitor circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates details of one embodiment of the pixel <b>120</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown, the pixel <b>120</b>A includes photosensor, such as a photodiode <b>302</b>, coupled to a source terminal <b>304</b> of a reset field effect transistor (FET) M<b>1</b>. The reset FET M<b>1</b> comprises an n-channel enhanced mode MOSFET. A gate terminal <b>306</b> of the reset FET M<b>1</b> is coupled to the reset line <b>140</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) and a drain terminal <b>308</b> of the reset FET M<b>1</b> is coupled to a supply voltage V<sub>dd</sub>. The cathode of the photodiode <b>302</b> is coupled to the source terminal <b>304</b> of the reset FET M<b>1</b> at a node PD and the anode of the photodiode <b>302</b> is coupled to a ground <b>310</b>. The ground <b>310</b> and the ground <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are tightly coupled at a same potential. The grounds <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, and <b>244</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may optionally also be at or near the same potential as the grounds <b>310</b> and <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The supply voltage V<sub>dd </sub>may be greater or less than the reset voltage, as received at the gate terminal <b>306</b> of the reset FET M<b>1</b>. Setting the reset voltage to be greater than the supply voltage V<sub>dd </sub>by use of, for example, a bootstrap circuit may, however, provide a more dynamic range, which may be beneficial in some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A gate terminal <b>312</b> of a second FET M<b>2</b> is coupled to the node PD. A drain terminal <b>314</b> of the FET M<b>2</b> is coupled to the supply voltage Vdd and a source terminal <b>31</b> <b>6</b>of the FET M<b>2</b> is coupled to a drain terminal <b>318</b> of a third FET M<b>3</b>. A gate terminal <b>320</b> of the FET M<b>3</b> is coupled to the row line <b>130</b>. A source terminal <b>322</b> of the FET M<b>3</b> is coupled to the column line <b>150</b>. The FETs M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b> comprise n-channel enhancement mode MOSFETs.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The other pixels of the pixel array <b>102</b> may be configured identically to the pixel <b>120</b>A. Other suitable pixel designs may alternatively be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Operation of the image capture system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At time T<sub>0</sub>, the exposure reset interval for a row <b>110</b> of pixels begins with the row reset circuit <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) supplying the reset line <b>140</b> with the ground referenced reset voltage. The reset line <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) supplies the ground referenced reset voltage to the gate terminal <b>306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the reset FET M<b>1</b>, which causes the reset FET M<b>1</b> to open. With the reset FET M<b>1</b> open, the voltage at node PD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) rises approximately to the ground referenced reset voltage minus the threshold voltage of the reset FET M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the voltage at node PD reaches the ground referenced reset voltage minus the threshold voltage of the reset FET M<b>1</b>, the reset line is pulled low (switch <b>230</b> is closed). The node PD at this point is said to be “floating.” Next, at time T<sub>1 </sub>exposing the photodiode <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to light causes charge to be collected by the photodiode <b>302</b> and the voltage at node PD begins to drop, or decrease, during the exposure time.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the duration between T<sub>0 </sub>and T<sub>1 </sub>is in the range of about 0.5-4 microseconds. An optional row pulse may begin and end just before and just after the beginning and end of the exposure reset time, respectively, for glitch cancellation purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At the end of the exposure time, the row signal is asserted high and the integrated signal is sampled by the column circuit <b>108</b>. In particular, the row line <b>130</b> is asserted high by the row decoder circuit <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and turns on the FET M<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">FET M<b>2</b> then drives the column line <b>150</b> with a level-shifted version of the voltage at node PD. As discussed below, column circuit <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) uses the level-shifted version of the voltage at node PD in determining the magnitude of the integrated signal. The integrated signal is approximately proportional to the incident light to which the photodiode <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) was exposed during the exposure time.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The voltage at node PD at time T<sub>2 </sub>is approximately equal to the ground referenced reset voltage at T<sub>1 </sub>minus the integrated signal minus the threshold voltage of the reset FET M<b>1</b>. The threshold voltage of the reset FET M<b>1</b> may be considered to be the same from reset to reset. The exposure time, or exposure interval, typically has a duration in the range of about 1-60 milliseconds, but may be of much longer or shorter duration.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sample reset interval begins at time T<b>2</b> with the row reset circuit <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) supplying the ground referenced reset voltage to the gate terminal <b>306</b> of the reset FET M<b>1</b>, causing the reset FET M<b>1</b> to turn on. With the reset FET M<b>1</b> on, the voltage at node PD increases to the ground referenced reset voltage at time T<b>3</b> minus the threshold voltage of the reset FET M<b>1</b>. The sample reset interval extends from time T<b>2</b> to time T<b>3</b> and may have a duration substantially equal to that of the exposure reset time. At time T<b>3</b>, the reset voltage is pulled to ground.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At time T<sub>4</sub>, the column circuit <b>108</b> samples the voltage of node PD shortly after time T<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The column circuit <b>108</b> may then generate a difference signal equal to the pixel reset level minus the integrated signal level where the pixel reset level is the sample taken at T<sub>4 </sub>and the integrated signal level is the sample taken at the end of the exposure time T<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the difference signal includes the signal that is proportional to the incident light plus an error term. The error term is equal to the difference in the ground referenced reset voltage during the first and second reset intervals (i.e., the exposure reset interval and the sample reset interval). Since the generated ground referenced reset voltage is the same during both the first and second reset intervals (i.e., at both T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>4</sub>), the error term is zero (or a negligible value) and the difference signal is equal to the integrated signal and is independent from the supply voltage.</p>
