<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a loading test device used for an electric loading test of an alternating-power generator and another power source, for example, and a loading device used for load stabilization of a cogeneration system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art Statement</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In facilities or buildings requiring electric power such as a factory, department store, computerized building, medical agency, commercial building, and waterworks department, stabilized electric power supply is required even in the case of electric power outage. Therefore, in such facilities, a private electric generator such as a three-phase alternating-current generator is disposed, and electric power can be supplied to the facilities by activating the private electric generator when electric power outage occurs, so that the electric power can be stably supplied even in the case of electric power outage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a private electric generator is not for regular operation. The use of such a private electric generator is limited in the case of electric power outage; in addition, the private generator is required to certainly operate at that time. Therefore, it is required to regularly conduct a loading test on regular basis in order to normally activate the private electric generator in the case of emergency such as electric power outage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a method for a loading test of this private electric generator, it is preferable to conduct the loading test by supplying the electric power generated by actually activating the private electric generator to devices (electricity consumption devices such as an interior illumination and air conditioner), which are disposed in the facilities and actually uses the electric power. However, in many cases, the loading test requires a lot of times; moreover, since some dozen times of test for turning on and off a power source of electric generator and test for rapid increase in the capacity of electric power are conducted, it is difficult to conduct the loading test by using the electricity consumption devices disposed in the facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, in fact, the loading test of the private electric generator is carried out by using a resistor or loading test device for a loading test including loading resistance having a capacity compatible with the capacity of the electric generator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A water rheostat has been widely used as the resistor included in this loading test device. In the water rheostat, electrodes are inserted in a tank comprising concrete or a wood flame, and the water rheostat adjusts the load by regulating the inserted amount or the interval between the electrodes. Generally, the water rheostat stabilizes the load while feeding with water, and also adjusts the water temperature by supplementing the vaporized water.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A loading test device <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has been conventionally know as the loading test device using such a water rheostat (for example, reference to JP-A-H08-321408).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The loading test device <b>1</b> comprises a water rheostat <b>2</b> including three cylindrical-shaped electrodes <b>2</b><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>a, </i>a cooling water supply source for supplying cooling water, and a deionizer <b>4</b> including ion-exchange resin.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The water rheostat <b>2</b> comprises a retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>in which the water is collected, and the cylindrical-shaped electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is soaked in the water M collected in the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i>This cylindrical-shaped electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>it connected to an electric generator (not shown) of a test object. The upper portion of the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is provided with an outlet head <b>2</b><i>c, </i>so that the water M in the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is maintained in a constant height.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cooling water supply source <b>3</b> is connected to the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>through a supply pipe <b>5</b>, so that the cooling water from the cooling water supply source <b>3</b> is supplied in the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i>This supply pipe <b>5</b> comprises a first pipe portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>leading from the cooling water supply source <b>3</b> directly to the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b, </i>and a second pipe portion <b>5</b><i>b </i>leading to the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>through the deionizer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the loading test is performed by the conventional loading test device <b>1</b> having the above construction, the loading test is carried out by adjusting fixed resistance of water in the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>within a predetermined range. More particularly, the fixed resistance of water M in the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b </i>is adjusted within a predetermined range by mixing the water directly supplied from the cooling water supply source <b>3</b> and the water having high fixed resistance through the purified water device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Recently, there has been an important issue of energy saving, so there has been an increasing demand for conducting electric power saving in every electric facility regardless of its scale or kind.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, in the conventional loading test device <b>1</b>, there have been some problems such as electric power loss and difficulty in an exhaust heat treatment in the water rheostat <b>2</b>. In other words, since the electric power was consumed as the heat in the water rheostat <b>2</b>, this electric power was not used, so that the electric power was wasted. Especially, the loading test has been performing in various power generating units throughout the year, so that there is a problem that the amount of electric power which is abandoned is enormous.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, there was a large problem of a treatment for the generated heat (exhaust heat treatment) in the conventional load testing device <b>1</b>. More particularly, in the load testing device <b>1</b>, because the electric power was converted into the heat in the water rheostat <b>2</b>, the temperature of water M was raised. Therefore, the increase in the water temperature of the water M was controlled by pouring a large amount of cooling water into the retention tank <b>2</b><i>b. </i>However, when the increase in the water temperature was prevented as described above, a large amount of cooling water was required; furthermore, there was a problem that the treatment of generated warm water was difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The above problem was common for the loading stabilization device for stabilizing the loading of the cogeneration system, for example. That is, in the loading stabilization device of the cogeneration system, there was a problem that the electric power was consumed as the exhaust heat.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is, therefore, the present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned problems, and objects of the present invention to use electric power consumed in a loading device used for a loading stabilization device of a cogeneration system and a loading test device of a power source, and to control burden according to an exhaust heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to solve the aforementioned problems, the present invention provides a loading device for conducting a loading test of an objective power source to be tested, comprising a rectifier connected to the objective power source to be tested and a resistor connected to the rectifier, the resistor, including a retention tank for collecting electrolyte aqueous solution and an electrode member soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution, wherein a positive electrode of direct current from the rectifier is connected to the retention tank, and a negative electrode of the direct current is connected to the electrode member, and a hydrogen collecting member forming a first space shielded from air is disposed upward in a periphery of the electrode member.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, the loading device further comprises a hydrogen storage device to store hydrogen collected by the hydrogen collecting member.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the loading device of the present invention, the hydrogen storage device includes a hydrogen storage alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the loading device of the present invention, an ion-exchange membrane member surrounding the electrode member is disposed in an outside of the hydrogen collecting member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the loading device of the present invention, a portion of the electrode member soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution is formed in a hollow net-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the loading device of the present invention, the positive electrode is connected to a side wall of the retention tank, and an oxygen collecting member forming a second space shielded from the air is provided in an upside of an inside of the side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the loading device of the present invention, the oxygen collecting member is the positive electrode including an upper wall part covering an upside of the electrolyte aqueous solution and a soaked portion which extends from the upper wall part to a lower side and soaks in the electrolyte aqueous solution.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The alternating-current generator <b>12</b> is disposed in facilities such as a factory or commercial building, for example, and operates when normal electric power transmission is cut. Therefore, the alternating-current generator <b>12</b> prevents the electric power outage of the facilities. Here, the loading device <b>10</b> is used as a loading test device for performing the loading test of the alternating-current generator <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The rectifier unit <b>14</b> comprises a plurality of rectifiers <b>14</b><i>a </i>for converting the alternating current from the alternating-current generator <b>12</b> into direct current. The plurality of rectifiers <b>14</b><i>a </i>is connected to the alternating current generator <b>12</b> through respective switching devices <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, the resistor <b>20</b> comprises a retention tank <b>22</b> in which electrolyte aqueous solution L is accumulated and an electrode tube or electrode member <b>24</b> suspending from above of the resistor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The retention tank <b>22</b> opens the upper surface thereof, and includes a bottom plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a side wall <b>22</b><i>b. </i>The electrolyte aqueous solution L is accumulated in the retention tank <b>22</b>. The retention tank <b>22</b> is provided with a liquid level detector <b>22</b><i>c </i>and a liquid temperature detector <b>22</b><i>d </i>including a floating (not shown). The liquid level and liquid temperature of the electrolyte aqueous solution L can be detected by the detectors <b>22</b><i>c, </i><b>22</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The retention tank <b>22</b> is also provided with a cooling device <b>26</b> of the electrolyte aqueous solution L and a hydration device <b>28</b> for replenishing reduced water. The hydration device <b>28</b> is provided with a deionizer <b>28</b><i>c, </i>so the fixed resistance of water can be stabilized by eliminating foreign substances of the supplied water. It is preferable for the water to be de-ionized water by this deionizer especially when extra-high voltage is applied.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the resistor <b>20</b>, the electrolyte aqueous solution L is circulated while running the radiator fan <b>26</b><i>a, </i>so the increase in the liquid temperature of the electrolyte aqueous solution L is prevented by radiating the heat of the electrolyte aqueous solution L with the radiator <b>26</b><i>c. </i>Especially, when the detection signal equal or more than a predetermined value is input to the cooling device <b>26</b>, the temperature of the electrolyte aqueous solution L is maintained lower than a predetermined value by increasing the revolutions and amount of the circulating water of the radiation fan <b>26</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The hydration device <b>28</b> comprises a supply pipe <b>28</b><i>a </i>whose one end is connected to a water supply source (not shown) and the other end is connected to the circulation pipe <b>26</b><i>a </i>and an electromagnetic valve <b>28</b><i>b </i>connected to the supply pipe <b>28</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The electromagnetic valve <b>28</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected to the liquid level detector <b>22</b><i>c, </i>and the detection signals from the liquid level detector <b>22</b><i>c </i>are input to the electromagnetic valve <b>28</b><i>b. </i>The opening and closing of the electromagnetic valve <b>28</b><i>b </i>is thereby controlled, the electrolyte aqueous solution L in the retention tank <b>22</b> can be maintained at a predetermined liquid level.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the other hand, the electrode tube <b>24</b> is made of a conductive material such as stainless steel, for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the electrode tube <b>24</b> is a hollow-cylinder shape its one part is soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution L. A plurality of electrode tubes <b>24</b> is disposed corresponding to a plurality of rectifiers <b>14</b><i>a. </i>The upper end of each electrode tube <b>24</b> is provided with a flange <b>24</b><i>a. </i>A negative (−) electrode of direct current from corresponding rectifier <b>14</b><i>a </i>is connected to each flange <b>24</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore, the electrode tube <b>24</b> operates as a cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, a hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>, which is fixed to the flange <b>24</b><i>a </i>by a bolt <b>25</b>, is provided upward in the periphery of electrode tube <b>24</b>. The hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> is made of a material having electric insulation and predetermined water resistance and heat resistance. As such a material, it is possible to choose from appropriate materials such as acrylic acid resin, epoxy resin, silicone resin, and melamine resin. If the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> is made of FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastics), it is possible to have the lightweight hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> having high heat resistance, chemical resistance, and high strength.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> is a rectangular solid shape whose lower surface is opened, and a lower end <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> is absorbed in the electrolyte aqueous solution L. Therefore a space (first space) A<b>1</b> shielded from air is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A bowl-shaped junction member <b>24</b><i>b </i>having an inverted U-section shape is provided directly on the electrode tube <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the inside of this junction member <b>24</b><i>b </i>is communicated with the space A<b>1</b> by through-holes <b>24</b><i>c </i>disposed in the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> and the flange <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, a positive (+) electrode of direct current from the rectifier <b>14</b><i>a </i>is connected to the upper end of the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the retention tank <b>22</b>. The retention tank <b>22</b> is made of a conductive material such as stainless steel, for example. Therefore, the retention tank <b>22</b> operates as anode.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The upper side of inner side of the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>is provided with an oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> of an inverted L-section shape comprising an insulating material. A lower end <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> is absorbed in the electrolyte aqueous solution L; therefore, a space (a second space) shielded from air is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> is provided with an opening for taking out oxygen <b>32</b><i>b; </i>therefore, the oxygen stayed in the space A can be stored in an oxygen storing container (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The hydrogen storage device <b>40</b> is for storing the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>generated in the resistor <b>20</b>. The hydrogen storage device <b>40</b> comprises a hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b> connected to the junction member <b>24</b><i>b </i>through an air-pipe <b>36</b> and a hydrogen dispenser unit <b>44</b> for taking out the stored hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b> includes hydrogen storage alloy (metal hydride) such as TiMnVFe, TiCrV, or NaA1H<sub>4</sub>, for example and a temperature adjusting device <b>42</b><i>a </i>for adjusting the temperature in the hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>is absorbed in the hydrogen storage alloy by lowering the temperature in the hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b> with the temperature adjusting device <b>42</b><i>a. </i>Accordingly, the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>collected by the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> can be stored in the hydrogen storage device <b>40</b> through the junction member <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the air-pipe <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The hydrogen dispenser unit <b>44</b> is appropriately provided with a compressor, flow meter, filling hose, and the like (not shown), and the stored hydrogen can be taken out by matching pressure and the like to the application.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the hydrogen storage device <b>40</b>, the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>is emitted from the hydrogen storage alloy by increasing the temperature in the hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b> with the temperature adjusting device <b>42</b><i>a, </i>and then the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>can be sent to the hydrogen dispenser unit <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, functions of the loading device <b>10</b> including the above construction will be described along a loading test method.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The alternating-current generator <b>12</b> as the objective power source to be tested disposed in, for example, a theater, factory, pump station, commercial building, or the like is connected to the rectifier unit <b>14</b> of the loading device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The appropriate number of the switching devices <b>14</b><i>b </i>is turned on in accordance with the scale and the test contents of the alternating-current generator <b>12</b>. Accordingly, electric current can be applied (turning on electricity) to the rectifier <b>14</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the number of the turned-on switching devices <b>14</b><i>b, </i>and then the electric current is applied to the electrode tube <b>24</b> corresponding to the rectifier <b>14</b> to which the current is applied. Therefore, the loading test of the alternating-current generator <b>12</b> can be carried out by using the load by the resistance of the resistor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Here, in the loading device <b>10</b>, the resistor <b>20</b> comprises the retention tank <b>22</b> for collecting the electrolyte aqueous solution L and the electrode tube <b>24</b> soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution L. The positive electrode of the direct current from the rectifier <b>14</b><i>a </i>is connected to the retention tank <b>22</b> and the negative electrode of the direct current is connected to the electrode tube <b>24</b>, so that the electrolyte aqueous solution L can be decomposed by an electric current with the resistor <b>20</b> when the loading test of the alternating-current generator <b>12</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In other words, in the loading device <b>10</b>, the retention tank <b>22</b> connected to the positive electrode of the direct current operates as the anode, and the electrode tube <b>24</b> connected to the negative electrode of the direct current operates as the cathode, so that the oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>can be generated from the retention tank <b>22</b> and hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>can be generated from the electrode tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Since the loading device <b>10</b> is provided with a plurality of electrode tubes <b>24</b>, which is connected to the negative electrodes of a plurality of rectifiers <b>14</b><i>a </i>one-on-one, the number of rectifiers <b>14</b> to be used can be appropriately selected in accordance with the scale or the test contents of the alternating-current generator <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the appropriate electric current can be applied to the electrode tube <b>24</b>, and the electrolysis of the electrolyte aqueous solution L can be carried out more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, the loading device <b>10</b> of the present invention is provided with the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b> for forming the space A<b>1</b> shielded from air in the upper side of the peripheral of the electrode tube <b>24</b>, so that the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>generated from the electrode tube <b>24</b> can be easily collected in the space A<b>1</b> by the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>, and the diffusion of heat to air can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Therefore, according to the loading device <b>10</b>, the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>can be collected by using the electric power consumed in the resistor <b>20</b>, so the electric power consumed in the resistor <b>20</b> can be used. More specifically, in the conventional loading test device, since the electric power was consumed as the heat by the water rheostat, the electric power was not used. However, in the present invention, the electric energy consumed in the water rheostat is converted in to the chemical energy, and this chemical energy can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Moreover, in the loading device <b>10</b> of the present invention, most of the electric power consumed in the resistor <b>20</b> is used for the electrolysis of the water, so that the increase of temperature of the electrolyte aqueous solution L can be controlled. Therefore, a large amount of cooling water and the like for preventing the increase in the water temperature is not required, and the exhaust heat treatment can be conducted very easy.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The hydrogen storage device <b>40</b> stores the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>collected by the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>. In other words, the temperature adjusting device <b>42</b><i>a </i>cools the hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b>; therefore, the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>supplied to the hydrogen absorption device <b>42</b> through the air-pipe <b>36</b> is stored in the hydrogen storage alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When this hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>is used, the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>stored in the hydrogen storage alloy is emitted by warming the inside of the hydrogen storage device <b>42</b> with the temperature adjusting device <b>42</b>, and the emitted hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>is supplied to an object to which the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>is supplied such as a vehicle and fuel cell thought the dispenser unit <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, if the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>generated in the resistor <b>20</b> is stored in the hydrogen storage alloy, the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>can be easily stored and also the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>can be easily emitted. Therefore, the flexibility of the utilization of the hydrogen can be improved. In addition, the hydrogen storage alloy can absorb a large amount of hydrogen in the high density, and also can be easily transported because the hydrogen storage alloy can stably store highly explosive hydrogen, so that the hydrogen storage alloy is more practicable.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Since the retention tank <b>22</b> connected to the positive electrode of the direct current from the rectifier <b>14</b><i>a </i>operates as the anode, the oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>generates from the retention tank <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, the positive electrode is connected to the side wall <b>22</b><i>b, </i>so that most of the oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>generated by the electrolysis generates from the side wall <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, in the loading device <b>10</b> of the present invention, since the upper part of the inner side of the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>is provided with the oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> forming the space A shielded from air, the oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>generated from the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>can be easily collected. The oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>stayed in the space A<b>2</b> is stored in the oxygen storage container (not shown) through the opening for taking out oxygen <b>32</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, according to the loading device <b>10</b>, the oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>generated by the electrolysis of the electrolyte aqueous solution L can be easily collected, so that the oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>can be used.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, by using the loading device <b>110</b>, the loading test can be performed not only for the alternating-current generator <b>12</b> generating the alternating-current, but also the UPS <b>13</b> and the battery <b>13</b><i>a </i>for generating the direct current.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this first application example, the hydrogen storage device <b>140</b> comprises a hydrogen storage device <b>142</b> having a hydrogen compressor <b>142</b><i>a </i>and a high pressure gas container <b>142</b><i>b </i>and a dispenser unit <b>144</b> having a pressure control device <b>144</b><i>a </i>and a filling hose <b>144</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As stated above, in this application example 1, since the loading device <b>110</b> is adopted as the permanent installation type (stationary type), it is preferable for the facility B in which the especially large alternating-current generator (objective power source to be tested) <b>12</b> and UPS (objective power source to be tested) such as a pump station and a factory are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the loading device <b>110</b>, the electric power consumed in the resistor <b>20</b> can be converted into the chemical energy by collecting the hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>, and the electric power to be consumed in the resistor <b>20</b> can be used.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, if the loading device <b>110</b> of such a permanent installation type is disposed in many facilities, amount of the electric energy, which can be used in accordance with the number of the installations, increases, contributing to curve the global warming.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since the loading device <b>110</b> supplies the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>to the hydrogen-fueled car, the global warming and air pollution can be reduced.

Moreover, it has been considered that producing the hydrogen is economically very difficult.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> comprises an upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>for covering the upper part of the electrolyte aqueous solution L and a soaked portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>extending from the upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>toward the lower part.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>is bridged between the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the retention tank <b>22</b> and the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>, and is provided with the opening for taking out oxygen <b>32</b><i>b </i>in the vicinity of the side wall <b>22</b><i>b. </i>The upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>is formed by an insulation member similar to the material of the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>is disposed between the opening for taking out oxygen <b>32</b><i>b </i>and the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>, and is fixed to the upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>by a bolt or nut BN. The soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>is made of a conductive metal material such as stainless steel, for example, and is a hollow tube shape. The lower end <b>32</b><i>a </i>is soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution L, and the portion of the soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution L is a net-like shape having many holes <b>32</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Moreover, the soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>is electrically connected to the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the retention tank <b>22</b>, and is configured to operate as the same electrode as the retention tank <b>22</b>, i.e., anode (positive electrode).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As stated above, since the ion-exchange member <b>34</b> for surrounding the electrode tube <b>24</b> is disposed in the outside of the hydrogen collecting member <b>30</b>, the hydrogen ion to be the hydrogen H<sub>2 </sub>generated from the electrode tube <b>24</b> can not penetrate the ion-exchange membrane member <b>34</b>. On the other hand, the oxygen ion to be the oxygen generated from the side wall <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the retention tank <b>22</b> and the soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>of the oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> can not penetrate the ion-exchange membrane member <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Therefore, the oxygen and the hydrogen to be generated from the water decomposed by an electric current are separated by this ion-exchange membrane member <b>34</b>, so that the hydrogen and the oxygen having high purity can be collected by preventing the mixture of the oxygen and the hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Moreover, since the portion of the electrode tube <b>24</b> soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution L is formed in a hollow net-like shape having many holes <b>29</b>, the surface area of the electrode tube <b>24</b> can be larger. Therefore, the electrolysis of water can be encouraged, and then more hydrogen can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Since the oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> comprises the upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>covering the upper portion of the electrolyte aqueous solution L and the soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>extending from the upper wall part <b>32</b><i>c </i>to the lower part and soaked in electrolyte aqueous solution L, and also operates as the positive electrode which is the same electrode as the retention tank <b>22</b>, the oxygen collecting member <b>32</b> not only collects the oxygen but also further encourages the electrolysis of water by operating as the positive electrode. Therefore, more oxygen can be generated and collected.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition, since the portion of the soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution L is formed in the hollow net-like shape having many holes <b>32</b><i>e, </i>the surface area of the soaked portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>becomes large.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As described above, the embodiment of loading device according to the present invention is described including its application examples. However, the specific structure is not limited to this embodiment. If modifications to the described embodiment are made without departing from the scope of the present invention, these are included in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, the electrode member is constructed by the electrode tube <b>24</b> in the above embodiment. The electrode tube <b>24</b> does not always have to be a tubular shape, and it can be appropriately selected.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">It may be possible for the retention tank and the electrode member to palatinate. Accordingly, the permanence of the retention tank and the electrode member can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, it is not always necessary for the water temperature gauge and level meter to be disposed. For example, in the loading device of the present invention, the calorific value is small because the electric power consumed in the resistor is used for the electrolysis of water. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the increase in the temperature of the electrolyte aqueous solution L by appropriately activating the cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to the loading device of the present invention, the resistor comprises the retention tank for collecting the electrolyte aqueous solution and the electrode member soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution. Since the positive electrode of direct current from the rectifier is connected to the retention tank and the negative electrode of the direct current is connected to the electrode member, the electrolyte aqueous solution can be decomposed by an electric current in the resistor when the loading test of the power source is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The hydrogen collecting member forming the first space shielded from air is disposed upward in the periphery of the electrode member, so that the hydrogen generated from the electrode member can be easily collected in the first space by the hydrogen collecting member.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Therefore, according to the loading device, the hydrogen can be collected by using the electric power consumed in the resistor, so the electric power can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Moreover, since the electric power consumed in the resistor is used for the electrolysis of water, most of the consumed electric power is not converted into the heat, so that the increase in the temperature of the electrolyte aqueous solution can be controlled, and the usage of cooling water can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to the loading device of the present invention, the loading device comprise a plurality of rectifiers and a plurality of electrode members corresponding to the plurality of-the rectifiers, so that appropriate current can be applied to the electrode member by arbitrarily choosing the number of rectifiers which is used in accordance with the scale or the test contents of the objective power source to be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">According to the loading device of the present invention, since the loading device comprises the hydrogen storage device for storing the hydrogen collected by the hydrogen collecting member, the hydrogen can be stored until needed, so that the flexibility of the utilization of the collected hydrogen is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">According to the loading device of the present invention, the hydrogen storage device includes the hydrogen storage alloy, so that a large amount of the hydrogen can be absorbed in the high density; moreover, the storage and emission of the hydrogen can be easily carried out. Therefore, the flexibility for utilizing the generated hydrogen can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">According to the loading device of the present invention, the ion-exchange membrane member surrounding the electrode member is disposed outside of the hydrogen collecting member, so that the oxygen and hydrogen generated from the water decomposed by an electric current by the electrode member are separated by the ion-exchange membrane member, and the mixture of the oxygen and the hydrogen can be prevented. Therefore, the hydrogen of a high degree of purity can be collected.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">According to the loading device of the present invention, since the portion of the electrode member soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution is formed in the hollow net-like shape, the surface area of the electrode member becomes large, and the electrolysis of water can be encouraged. Consequently, it is possible to obtain more hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">According to the loading device of the present invention, since the positive electrode is connected to the side wall of the retention tank, most of the oxygen generated from the retention tank operated as the anode can be generated from the side wall. Moreover, the oxygen collecting member forming the second space shielded from air is provided in the upside of the inner side of the side wall, so that the oxygen generated from the side wall can be easily collected by the oxygen collecting member.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to the loading device of the present invention, the oxygen collecting member is the positive electrode comprising the upper wall part covering the upper part of the electrolyte aqueous solution and the soaked portion extending from the upper wall part to the lower part and soaked in the electrolyte aqueous solution, so that the oxygen collecting member not only collects the oxygen, but also operates as the anode. Therefore, the electrolysis of water is further encouraged, and more oxygen can be collected.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to the loading device of the present invention, the oxygen collecting member is adopted as the same electrode as the retention tank, and the upper wall part is formed by the material similar to the material of the hydrogen collecting member, so that the oxygen collecting member operates as the anode, and more oxygen can be generated.
