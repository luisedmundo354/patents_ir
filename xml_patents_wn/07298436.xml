<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display substrate, a method of manufacturing the same, and a liquid crystal display device having the same, and more particularly, it relates to such a substrate for transreflective liquid crystal display that can attain display in both a transmission mode and a reflection mode, a method of manufacturing the same, and a liquid crystal display device having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, liquid crystal devices are demanded to have higher performance. According to spread of mobile phones and mobile electronic devices, in particular, they are strongly demanded to attain low electric energy consumption and good usability out of doors. In order to attain low electric energy consumption and good usability out of doors, a reflection liquid crystal display device has been proposed, which has a pixel electrode having light reflection capability (a reflection electrode) and attains display by reflecting outside light to make a light source device unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A thin film transistor (TFT) substrate of a reflection liquid crystal display device has a reflection electrode formed thereon with a metallic thin film having high light reflectivity. In the reflection liquid crystal display device, natural light incident thereon from the display screen side or light emitted by utilizing electricity is reflected by the reflection electrode on the TFT substrate, and the reflected light is used as a light source for liquid crystal display. The reflection electrode has an uneven surface. The uneven surface of the reflection electrode can be obtained by previously forming a light-sensitive resin layer having an uneven surface as an underlayer of the reflection electrode. The light incident from the display screen side is diffusely reflected by the uneven surface of the reflection electrode to obtain high luminance and a large viewing angle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the reflection liquid crystal display devices disclosed in JP-A-2002-221716 and JP-A-2002-296585, for example, a surface (an upper layer portion) of an overcoat layer formed with a resin material is applied to predetermined energy to make the upper layer portion be relatively cured in comparison to a lower layer portion, and then the overcoat layer is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature equal to or higher than the heat curing point thereof, whereby wrinkled unevenness is formed on the surface of the overcoat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A transreflective liquid crystal display device is also proposed, which can attain display in a transmission mode in addition to display in a reflection mode as similar to the reflection liquid crystal display device. In the transreflective liquid crystal display device, a transmission area having a transparent electrode formed with a light transmission material and a reflection area having a reflection electrode formed with a light reflection material are formed on each of pixel areas. The reflection electrode of the transreflective liquid crystal display device is formed on a resin layer having an uneven surface, as similar to the reflection liquid crystal display device. The transreflective liquid crystal display device referred herein includes a slightly transmission liquid crystal display device, which has an increased proportion of the reflection area in pixel areas to improve display luminance in a reflection mode, and a slightly reflection liquid crystal display device, which has an increased proportion of the transmission area in pixel areas to improve display luminance in a transmission mode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> is a plan view showing a constitution of a TFT substrate of a conventional transreflective liquid crystal display device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the TFT substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> on line X-X. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, a glass substrate <b>110</b> of the TFT substrate <b>102</b> has a plurality of gate bus lines <b>112</b> extending in parallel to each other in the landscape direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> (provided that only one of them is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An insulating film <b>130</b> is formed on the gate bus lines <b>112</b> on the entire surface of the substrate (which is sometimes referred to as agate insulating film, depending on the position where the film is formed).

The storage capacitor bus line <b>118</b> functions as one electrode of a storage capacitor.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The wrinkled resin layer <b>134</b> in the TFT substrate <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> is formed by the following procedures. A positive light-sensitive resin is coated on a whole surface of a glass substrate having TFTs and the like formed thereon to form a resin layer. The glass substrate is placed on an exposing stage in an exposing apparatus, and the resin layer is exposed through a photomask that shields areas to be reflection areas from light. By this, the resin layer is exposed on areas other than the reflection areas. Subsequently, the resin layer is developed to remove the resin layer in the exposed area by dissolving in a developer solution, whereby the resin layer in the non-exposed reflection areas remains as not dissolved in the developer solution. The surface of the remaining resin layer is irradiated with UV light to cure the upper layer portion of the resin layer. Subsequently, the resin layer is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature equal to or higher than the heat curing point thereof, so as to form a wrinkled resin layer having wrinkled unevenness on the surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the step of exposing the resin layer, however, the light reflected by the surface of the exposing stage is also incident on the resin layer in the reflection areas. Accordingly, the resin layer in the reflection areas is exposed and cured to such an extent that it is not dissolved in the developer solution. In general, the surface of the exposing stage has grooves formed thereon. Therefore, the intensity of the light incident on the resin layer in the reflection areas varies depending on the presence and absence of the grooves on the surface of the exposing stage, and thus, the extent of curing of the resin layer varies depending on the positions of the grooves. Accordingly, uniform wrinkled unevenness cannot be formed on the surface of the resin layer in the subsequent step to fluctuate the shape of wrinkled unevenness corresponding to the positions of the grooves on the surface of the exposing stage. Consequently, a transreflective liquid crystal display device thus manufactured has such a problem that display ununiformity corresponding to the positions of the grooves on the surface of the exposing stage is viewed upon display in a reflection mode, so as to fail to obtain an intended reflectivity and good reflection uniformity.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An insulating film (gate insulating film) <b>30</b> is formed on the gate bus lines <b>12</b> on the entire surface of the substrate.

A channel protective film type TFTs <b>20</b>, for example, are formed in the vicinities of positions where the gate bus lines <b>12</b> and the drain bus lines <b>14</b> are intersected each other.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The TFT <b>20</b> has an active semiconductor layer <b>28</b> formed with an a-Si layer on the insulating film <b>30</b>.

In this constitution, the gate bus line <b>12</b> immediately beneath the channel protective film <b>23</b> functions as a gate electrode of the TFT <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A protective film <b>32</b> is formed on the TFT <b>20</b> on the entire surface of the substrate. A wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having wrinkled unevenness on the surface thereof is formed on the protective film <b>32</b> in a reflection area of each of the pixel areas.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Separately, a transparent electrode <b>16</b> is formed on the protective film <b>32</b> in a transmission area of each of the pixel areas.

A storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> is formed on the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> for each of the pixels through the insulating film <b>30</b>. The storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> is formed with the same material as the drain bus line <b>14</b>. A light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> is also formed in parallel to the gate bus line <b>12</b> in the landscape direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> is disposed to shield the vicinity of the boundary between the reflection area and the transmission area from light, so as to prevent leakage of light caused by alignment failure of the liquid crystal in the vicinity of the boundary between the areas. The light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> is formed with the same material as the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>, and is, for example, in an electrically floating state.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The TFT substrate <b>2</b> of this embodiment has, as an underlayer of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> formed in the reflection area, light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>for shielding light incident from the back surface side of the glass substrate <b>10</b> (the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). The light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are formed with the same material as the gate bus line <b>12</b>, the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> simultaneously therewith. The light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>is disposed between the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and the gate bus line <b>12</b>. The light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected to the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and is electrically separated from the gate bus line <b>12</b>. The light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>b </i>is disposed between the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>. The light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>b </i>is electrically separated from the gate bus line <b>12</b> and is electrically connected to the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>. A large proportion of the reflection area (i.e., the area having the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> formed) is shielded from light incident from the back surface side of the glass substrate <b>10</b> by the gate bus line <b>12</b>, the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>, the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>(with portions of the drain electrode <b>21</b> and the source electrode <b>22</b>). In the area having the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> formed, the proportion of the area shielded from light incident from the back surface side of the glass substrate <b>10</b> is preferably higher, for example, 30% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The TFT <b>20</b>, the bus lines <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>, the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are formed by the photolithography process through a series of steps of semiconductor process, i.e., forming of a film, coating of a resist, exposure, development, etching, and removal of resist.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to this embodiment, in the step of patterning a positive light-sensitive resin layer for forming the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> in the reflection area, reflected light on the exposing stage in the exposing apparatus is shielded by the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b</i>, and thus the light is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area. Therefore, a heat treatment by applying energy to the surface thereof in the subsequent step provides such a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> that has uniform wrinkled unevenness formed thereon. Consequently, the reflection electrode <b>17</b> formed on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> also has uniform wrinkled unevenness to obtain a desired inclined plane distribution with good controllability. According to this embodiment, therefore, excellent reflection uniformity and stable reflectivity can be obtained to realize a transreflective liquid crystal display device having good reflection display characteristics. Furthermore, since the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are formed in the same process step as the gate bus line <b>12</b>, the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b>, no process step is added to the manufacturing method of the TFT substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A modified example of the constitution of the liquid crystal display substrate of this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a plan view showing the constitution of the vicinity of the reflection area of one pixel area of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> according to this modified example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the constitution of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> on line B-B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In this modified example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>each is divided into plural portions, and is electrically separated from the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>, as different from the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. The modified example is the same as the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> in such a standpoint that the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are formed with the same material as the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The three portions of the light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>formed between the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> are electrically separated from both the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and thus is in a floating state. The two portions of the light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>b </i>formed between the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> are electrically separated from both the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and thus is in a floating state. In this modified example, even in the case where the light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>is shorted to one of the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> due to contamination with electroconductive foreign matters or the like, the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> are not shorted to each other. Similarly, even in the case where the light shielding portion <b>60</b><i>b </i>is shorted to one of the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>, the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> are not shorted to each other. According to this modified example, therefore, the manufacturing yield of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> can be further improved, in addition to the similar effect as in the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the TFT substrate <b>2</b> according to this embodiment has, as an underlayer of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> formed in the reflection area, light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>for shielding light incident from the back surface side of the glass substrate <b>10</b> (the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). The light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>are formed with the same material as the drain bus line <b>14</b>, the drain electrode <b>21</b>, the source electrode <b>22</b> and the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> simultaneously therewith. The light shielding portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected to the drain bus line <b>14</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b> and is disposed between the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and the gate bus line <b>12</b>. The light shielding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>22</b> and the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> and is disposed between the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>. A large proportion of the reflection area (i.e., the area having the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> formed) is shielded from light incident from the back surface side of the glass substrate <b>10</b> by the gate bus line <b>12</b>, the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b>, the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> and the light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to this embodiment, in the step of patterning a positive light-sensitive resin layer for forming the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> in the reflection area, reflected light on the exposing stage in the exposing apparatus is shielded by the light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b</i>, and thus the light is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area, as similar to the first embodiment. Therefore, a heat treatment by applying energy to the surface thereof in the subsequent step provides such a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> that has uniform wrinkled unevenness formed thereon. Consequently, the reflection electrode <b>17</b> formed on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> also has uniform wrinkled unevenness to obtain a desired inclined plane distribution with good controllability. According to this embodiment, therefore, excellent reflection uniformity and stable reflectivity can be obtained to realize a transreflective liquid crystal display device having good reflection display characteristics. Furthermore, since the light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>are formed in the same process step as the drain bus line <b>14</b>, the drain electrode <b>21</b>, the source electrode <b>22</b> and the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b>, no process step is added to the manufacturing method of the TFT substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A modified example of the constitution of the liquid crystal display substrate of this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a plan view showing the constitution of the vicinity of the reflection area of one pixel area of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> according to this modified example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the constitution of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> on line D-D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In this modified example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>each is divided into plural portions, and is electrically separated from the drain bus line <b>14</b>, the drain electrode <b>21</b>, the source electrode <b>22</b> and the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b>, as different from the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. The modified example is the same as the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> in such a standpoint that the light shielding portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>are formed with the same material as the drain bus line <b>14</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The three portions of the light shielding portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>formed between the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the light leakage preventing film <b>40</b> are electrically separated from both the drain bus line <b>14</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b> and thus is in a floating state. The two portions of the light shielding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>formed between the gate bus line <b>12</b> and the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> are electrically separated from all the drain bus line <b>14</b>, the source electrode <b>22</b> and the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> and thus is in a floating state. In this modified example, even in the case where the light shielding portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>is shorted to one of the two drain bus lines <b>14</b> adjacent to each other in the landscape direction of the pixel due to contamination with electroconductive foreign matters or the like, the two drain bus lines <b>14</b> are not shorted to each other. Similarly, even in the case where the light shielding portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>is shorted to one of the drain bus line <b>14</b> and the source electrode <b>22</b> (or the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b>), the drain bus line <b>14</b> and the source electrode <b>22</b> are not shorted to each other. According to this modified example, therefore, the manufacturing yield of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> can be further improved, in addition to the similar effect as in the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A modified example of the constitution of the liquid crystal display substrate of this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a plan view showing the constitution of the vicinity of the reflection area of one pixel area of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> according to this modified example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the constitution of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> on line G-G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A liquid crystal display substrate according to a fifth embodiment of the invention and a manufacturing method thereof will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a constitution of a TFT substrate <b>2</b> according to this embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the area having a TFT <b>20</b> of a pixel formed therein is shown on the left side, a transmission area of the pixel is shown at the center, and a reflection area of the adjacent pixel is shown on the right side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the TFT substrate <b>2</b> of this embodiment has an insulating film <b>31</b> as an underlayer of agate electrode (gate bus line) <b>12</b> of the channel protective film type TFT <b>20</b>. A transparent electrode <b>116</b> is formed immediately above the glass substrate <b>10</b> in the transmission area. The surface of the transparent electrode <b>16</b> is exposed through an opening <b>27</b> where the protective film <b>32</b> and the insulating films <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> are removed. The transparent electrode <b>16</b> is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>22</b> of the TFT <b>20</b> through the reflection electrode <b>17</b>. A light shielding portion <b>63</b> is formed as an underlayer of the insulating film <b>31</b> in the reflection area. The light shielding portion <b>63</b> has such a constitution that an ITO layer <b>52</b> formed with the same material as the transparent electrode <b>16</b> and a high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> having a light shielding capability are accumulated in this order and patterned into the same shape.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A manufacturing method of the liquid crystal display substrate according to this embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 12B</figref> are cross sectional views showing the manufacturing method of the TFT substrate <b>2</b> according to this embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, an ITO layer <b>52</b> having a thickness, for example, of 70 nm and a high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> having a thickness, for example, of 100 nm are formed by sputtering directly on a glass substrate <b>10</b> as a transparent insulating substrate or after forming a protective film, such as SiO<sub>x</sub>, thereon depending on necessity. By this, an electroconductive film having a thickness of about 170 nm having the ITO layer <b>52</b> and the high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> accumulated is formed on the whole surface of the substrate. Examples of the material for forming the high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> include Ti, chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W) and alloys thereof. A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the electroconductive film and patterned by using a first photomask (or a reticle) to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. Subsequently, wet etching by using, for example, a mixed reagent of acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid, and wet etching using, for example, a reagent, such as oxalic acid, are effected by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a light shielding portion <b>63</b> is formed on at least a portion of an area to be a reflection area, and an electroconductive film (electroconductive layer) <b>54</b> having a predetermined shape is formed on an area to be a transmission area.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, by the plasma CVD process a silicon nitride film (SiN film) having a thickness, for example, of 200 nm is formed on the light shielding portion <b>63</b> and the electroconductive film <b>54</b> on the whole surface of the substrate to form an insulating film <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, an Al layer (or an Al alloy layer) <b>55</b> having a thickness, for example, of 130 nm and a high melting point metal layer (such as a Ti layer or a Ti alloy layer) <b>56</b> having a thickness, for example, of 70 nm are formed in this order by sputtering on the insulating layer <b>31</b> on the whole surface of the substrate. Consequently, an electroconductive film having a thickness of 200 nm containing the Al layer <b>55</b> and the high melting point metal layer <b>56</b> accumulated is formed. Examples of the Al alloy include those materials that are obtained by adding one or plurality of neodymium (Nd), silicon (Si), copper (Cu), Ti, W, Ta and scandium (Sc) to Al. Examples of the high melting point metal include Cr, Mo, Ta, W and alloys thereof. A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the electroconductive film and patterned by using a second photomask to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. Subsequently, dry etching using, for example, a chlorine series gas is effected by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a gate bus line <b>12</b>, a storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> (not shown in the figure) and a gate bus line terminal (not shown in the figure) are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An SiN film having a thickness, for example, of 400 nm is formed by the plasma CVD process on the gate bus line <b>12</b>, the storage capacitor bus line <b>18</b> and the gate bus line terminal on the whole surface of the substrate, so as to form an insulating film (gate insulating film) <b>30</b>. An a-Si layer having a thickness, for example, of 30 nm is then formed by the plasma CVD process on the whole surface of the insulating layer <b>30</b>. Subsequently, an SiN film having a thickness, for example, of 150 nm is formed by the plasma CVD process on the whole surface of the a-Si layer. A resist is coated by spin coating on the whole surface of the SiN film to form a resist layer. The glass substrate <b>10</b> is then exposed from the back surface side thereof by using the gate bus line <b>12</b> as a mask. Subsequently, the glass substrate <b>10</b> is exposed from the front surface side thereof by using a third photomask. The resist layer is then developed, and the resist layer in the exposed area is removed by dissolution. Consequently, a resist pattern is formed in a self aligning manner only on the area for forming the channel protective film on the gate bus line <b>12</b>. Dry etching using a fluorine series gas is then effected by using the resist pattern as an etching mask to form a channel protective film <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Immediately after cleaning the surface of the a-Si layer (removal of a spontaneous oxidized film) by using diluted hydrofluoric acid, an n<sup>+</sup>a-Si layer having a thickness, for example, of 30 nm is formed on the whole surface of the substrate by the plasma process. A high melting point metal layer (such as a Ti layer or a Ti alloy layer) <b>57</b> having a thickness, for example, of 40 nm, an Al layer (or an Al alloy layer) <b>58</b> having a thickness, for example, of 75 nm and a high melting point metal layer (such as a Ti layer or a Ti alloy layer) <b>59</b> having a thickness, for example, of 80 nm are then formed by sputtering in this order to form an electroconductive film. Examples of the high melting point metal include Cr, Mo, Ta, W and alloys thereof. It is necessary that the high melting point metal layer <b>59</b> is not removed but remains upon removing by etching the high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> in the transmission area in the subsequent process step, and therefore, the materials for forming the high melting point metal layers <b>53</b> and <b>59</b> are selected under consideration of etching selectivity thereof (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the electroconductive film and patterned by using a fourth photomask to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. The electroconductive film, the n<sup>+</sup>a-Si layer and the a-Si layer are subjected to dry etching using a chlorine series gas by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a drain electrode <b>21</b> and a source electrode <b>22</b> of the TFT <b>20</b>, an active semiconductor layer <b>28</b>, a storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> (not shown in the figure), a drain bus line <b>14</b> (not shown in the figure) and a drain bus line terminal (not shown in the figure) are formed. The channel protective film <b>23</b> functions as an etching stopper upon etching, and the a-Si layer as an underlayer thereof is not etched but remains. According to the aforementioned operations, a channel protective film type TFT <b>20</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, an SiN film having a thickness, for example, of 300 nm is formed by the plasma CVD process on the whole surface of the substrate to form a protective film <b>32</b>. A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the protective film <b>32</b> and patterned by using a fifth photomask to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. The protective film <b>32</b> (and the insulating films <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>) is subjected to dry etching using a mixed gas of a fluorine series gas and an O<sub>2 </sub>gas by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a contact hole <b>26</b> on the source electrode <b>22</b>, a contact hole (not shown in the figure) on the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> and a contact hole (not shown in the figure) on the gate bus line terminal and the drain bus line terminal are formed. Simultaneously, the protective film <b>32</b> and the insulating films <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> on the electroconductive film <b>54</b> in the transmission area are removed to form an opening <b>27</b>. Subsequently, wet etching using a mixed reagent of acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid is effected. Consequently, the high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> as an upper layer of the electroconductive film <b>54</b> exposed through the opening <b>27</b> is removed, and the ITO layer <b>52</b> as a lower layer thereof remains, so as to form a transparent electrode <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A positive light-sensitive novolak resin, for example, is coated on the whole surface of the substrate by using a spin coater or a slit coater to form a light-sensitive resin layer having a thickness, for example, of about from 0.5 to 4 μm. Subsequently, the substrate is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of 160° C. or lower. The light-sensitive resin layer is then exposed by using a sixth photomask and is developed by using an alkali developer solution, such as TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide), so as to form an overcoat (OC) layer (resin layer) having a predetermined shape. The OC layer is formed on at least a portion of the area to be the reflection area. In the exposing step for patterning, since the light shielding portion <b>63</b> is formed as an underlayer (i.e., on the side of the glass substrate <b>10</b>) of the light-sensitive resin layer, light reflected on the exposing stage of the exposing apparatus is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The OC layer is then annealed at a temperature of from 100 to 180° C. for from 0.2 to 60 minutes by using a clean oven or a hot plate. The surface of the OC layer is then irradiated with UV light having a wavelength of from 200 to 470 nm at an energy density of from 10 to 550 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>for from 5 to 300 seconds. The OC layer is then annealed by using a clean oven or the like at a temperature equal to or higher than the heat curing point thereof (from 180 to 230° C.) for about 1 hour. Consequently, a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having wrinkled unevenness on the surface thereof is formed in the reflection area (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). As described in the foregoing, in this embodiment, light reflected by the exposing stage of the exposing apparatus is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin in the reflection area, and therefore, a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having uniform wrinkled unevenness can be obtained through the subsequent UV light irradiation and heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, for example, there is such a possibility that reflected light from the exposing stage is incident through the gap between the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>and the gate bus line <b>12</b>. Therefore, there is such a possibility that the wrinkled unevenness is deformed in a partial area of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> depending on the positions of the grooves on the surface of the exposing stage and that display unevenness depending on the area proportion of the gap to the reflection area is formed. In order to prevent the phenomenon, the glass substrate <b>10</b> may be subjected to exposure from the back surface side (i.e., the lower side in the figure) under predetermined exposing conditions after patterning the OC layer and before subjecting to the heat treatment at a temperature equal to or higher than the heat curing point. Consequently, the OC layer in the area corresponding to the gap between the light shielding portions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>and the gate bus line <b>12</b> is substantially uniformly cured over all the pixels, whereby display unevenness is not viewed although no wrinkled unevenness is formed in that area through the subsequent heat treatment.</p>

A high melting point metal layer formed with Cr, Mo, Ta, W or alloys thereof may be formed instead of the Ti layer. A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the Al layer <b>17</b><i>b </i>and patterned by using a seventh photomask to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. Subsequently, dry etching using a chlorine series gas is effected by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a reflection electrode <b>17</b> is formed in the reflection area including the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. The surface of the reflection electrode <b>17</b> has a wrinkled uneven surface according to the surface of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. The reflection electrode <b>17</b> is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>22</b> through the contact hole <b>26</b>, and is electrically connected to the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> through a contact hole not shown in the figure.

According to the aforementioned process steps, the TFT substrate <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to this embodiment, in the step of patterning the positive light-sensitive resin layer for forming the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> in the reflection area, light reflected from the exposing stage is shielded by the light shielding portion <b>63</b> and the like, and thus the light is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area, as similar to the first to fourth embodiments. Therefore, a heat treatment by applying energy to the surface thereof in the subsequent step provides such a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> that has substantially uniform wrinkled unevenness formed thereon. Consequently, the reflection electrode <b>17</b> formed on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> also has substantially uniform wrinkled unevenness to obtain a desired inclined plane distribution with good controllability.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, since the light shielding portion <b>63</b> is patterned by using the same photomask (the first photomask) as the transparent electrode <b>16</b>, and the high melting point metal layer <b>53</b> on the transparent electrode <b>16</b> is removed by using the predetermined etchant after exposing through the opening <b>27</b> formed simultaneously with the contact hole <b>26</b>. In this embodiment, therefore, the light shielding portion <b>63</b> is formed by using no additional photomask, and thus no process step is added to the manufacturing method of the TFT substrate <b>2</b>.</p>

Subsequently, the substrate is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of 160° C. or lower. The light-sensitive resin layer is then exposed by using a fifth photomask and is developed by using an alkali developer solution, such as TMAH, so as to form an OC layer having a predetermined shape. The OC layer is formed on at least a portion of the area to be the reflection area. In the exposing step for patterning, since the light shielding portion <b>64</b> is formed as an underlayer (i.e., on the side of the glass substrate <b>10</b>) of the light-sensitive resin layer, light reflected on the exposing stage of the exposing apparatus is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The OC layer is then annealed at a temperature of from 100 to 180° C. for from 0.2 to 60 minutes by using a clean oven or a hot plate. The surface of the OC layer is then irradiated with UV light having a wavelength of from 200 to 470 nm at an energy density of from 10 to 550 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>for from 5 to 300 seconds. Subsequently, depending on necessity, the glass substrate <b>10</b> is exposed from the back surface side thereof. The OC layer is then annealed by using a clean oven or the like at a temperature of from 180 to 230° C. for about 1 hour. Consequently, a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having wrinkled unevenness on the surface thereof is formed in the reflection area (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). As described in the foregoing, in this embodiment, light reflected by the exposing stage of the exposing apparatus is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin in the reflection area, and therefore, a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having uniform wrinkled unevenness can be obtained through the subsequent UV light irradiation and heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A Ti layer (or a Ti alloy layer) <b>17</b><i>a </i>and an Al layer (or an Al alloy layer) <b>17</b><i>b </i>are formed by sputtering on the whole surface of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the Al layer <b>17</b><i>b </i>and patterned by using a sixth photomask to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. Subsequently, dry etching using a chlorine series gas is effected by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a reflection electrode <b>17</b> is formed in the reflection area including the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. The surface of the reflection electrode <b>17</b> on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> has a wrinkled uneven surface following the surface of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. The reflection electrode <b>17</b> is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>22</b> through the contact hole <b>26</b>, and is electrically connected to the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> through a contact hole not shown in the figure. The reflection electrode <b>17</b> is also electrically connected to the transparent electrode <b>16</b>. By the etching operation, the high melting point metal layer <b>72</b>, the Al layer <b>71</b> and the high melting point metal layer <b>70</b> of the electroconductive film <b>54</b> exposed through the opening <b>27</b> are removed, and the ITO layer <b>52</b> as the lowermost layer remains, so as to form a transparent electrode <b>16</b>.

According to the aforementioned process steps, the TFT substrate <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to this embodiment, in the step of patterning the positive light-sensitive resin layer for forming the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> in the reflection area, light reflected from the exposing stage is shielded by the light shielding portion <b>64</b> and the like, and thus the light is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area, as similar to the first to sixth embodiments. Therefore, a heat treatment by applying energy to the surface thereof in the subsequent step provides such a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> that has substantially uniform wrinkled unevenness formed thereon. Consequently, the reflection electrode <b>17</b> formed on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> also has substantially uniform wrinkled unevenness to obtain a desired inclined plane distribution with good controllability. According to this embodiment, therefore, excellent reflection uniformity and stable reflectivity can be obtained to realize a transreflective liquid crystal display device having good reflection display characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore, since the light shielding portion <b>64</b> is patterned by using the same photomask (the first photomask) as the transparent electrode <b>16</b>, as similar to the fifth and sixth embodiments.

The light-sensitive resin layer is then exposed by using a sixth photomask and is developed by using an alkali developer solution, such as TMAH, so as to form an OC layer having a predetermined shape. The OC layer is formed on at least a portion of the area to be the reflection area. In the exposing step for patterning, since the light shielding portion <b>66</b> is formed as an underlayer (i.e., on the side of the glass substrate <b>10</b>) of the light-sensitive resin layer, light reflected on the exposing stage of the exposing apparatus is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The OC layer is then annealed at a temperature of from 100 to 180° C. for from 0.2 to 60 minutes by using a clean oven or a hot plate. The surface of the OC layer is then irradiated with UV light having a wavelength of from 200 to 470 nm at an energy density of from 10 to 550 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>for from 5 to 300 seconds. Subsequently, depending on necessity, the glass substrate <b>10</b> is exposed from the back surface side thereof. The OC layer is then annealed by using a clean oven or the like at a temperature of from 180 to 230° C. for about 1 hour. Consequently, a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having wrinkled unevenness on the surface thereof is formed in the reflection area (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). As described in the foregoing, in this embodiment, light reflected by the exposing stage of the exposing apparatus is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area, and therefore, a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> having uniform wrinkled unevenness can be obtained through the subsequent UV light irradiation and heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A Ti layer (or a Ti alloy layer) <b>17</b><i>a </i>and an Al layer (or an Al alloy layer) <b>17</b><i>b </i>are formed by sputtering on the whole surface of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. A resist is then coated on the whole surface of the Al layer <b>17</b><i>b </i>and patterned by using a seventh photomask to form a resist pattern having a predetermined shape. Subsequently, dry etching using a chlorine series gas is effected by using the resist pattern as an etching mask. Consequently, a reflection electrode <b>17</b> is formed in the reflection area including the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. The surface of the reflection electrode <b>17</b> on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> has a wrinkled uneven surface following the surface of the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b>. The reflection electrode <b>17</b> is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>22</b> through the contact hole <b>26</b>, and is electrically connected to the storage capacitor electrode <b>19</b> through a contact hole not shown in the figure. By the etching operation, the high melting point metal layer <b>74</b> as an upper layer of the electroconductive film <b>54</b> exposed through the opening <b>27</b> is removed, and the ITO layer <b>52</b> as a lower layer remains, so as to form a transparent electrode <b>16</b>. Thereafter, the substrate is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of from 150 to 230° C., preferably 200° C. According to the aforementioned process steps, the TFT substrate <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">According to this embodiment, in the step of patterning the positive light-sensitive resin layer for forming the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> in the reflection area, light reflected from the exposing stage is shielded by the light shielding portion <b>66</b> and the like, and thus the light is substantially not incident on the light-sensitive resin layer in the reflection area, as similar to the first to eighth embodiments. Therefore, a heat treatment by applying energy to the surface thereof in the subsequent step provides such a wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> that has substantially uniform wrinkled unevenness formed thereon. Consequently, the reflection electrode <b>17</b> formed on the wrinkled resin layer <b>34</b> also has substantially uniform wrinkled unevenness to obtain a desired inclined plane distribution with good controllability. According to this embodiment, therefore, excellent reflection uniformity and stable reflectivity can be obtained to realize a transreflective liquid crystal display device having good reflection display characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Furthermore, since the light shielding portion <b>66</b> is patterned by using the same photomask (the second photomask) as the transparent electrode <b>16</b>, as similar to the fifth to eighth embodiments.

In this embodiment, therefore, the light shielding portion <b>66</b> is formed by using no additional photomask, and thus no process step is added to the manufacturing method of the TFT substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
