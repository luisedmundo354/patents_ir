<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A disposable sanding device is fabricated as a continuous rope-like article which is adapted for selective segmentation and application as a plurality of serially arranged disposable hand sanding devices or ropes. Each hand sanding device is formed as a generally elongated rod shaped base portion formed of lightweight material such as closed cellfoam having a relatively constant cross-section along its line of elongation. An abrasive surface is permanently applied to the external surface of the base portion via an intermediate adhesive layer. As constructed, the sanding device is operable to conform to curvilinear contours of a work piece to be sanded upon application of user induced loading against the work piece. A dispenser holds a rolled length of sanding rope and includes a cutter feature for severing pieces of sanding rope from the coil as required as well as a retainer for the free end of the coil. A tensioning hand tool holds a severed length of sanding rope for precise applications. Interconnection means is provided to concentrically position and affix opposed ends of a base portion segment.</p>

No. 7,144,314 B2, issued 5 Dec. 2006, which is a continuation-in-part of a parent application entitled “Sanding Rope and Method of Forming Same”, U.S. Ser. No. 10/860,694, filed 3 Jun. 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,997,794 B2, issued 14 Feb. 2006, and owned by the common inventor/applicant.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to hand tools and particularly to sanding devices, especially for use in wood working. More particularly still, the present invention relates to a low cost, hand-held disposable sanding device which can be easily manipulated by hand for sanding and finishing a wide variety of work piece surface shapes and configurations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Small sanding jobs and sanding jobs calling for considerable detail work or access to small confined areas will usually require the direct hand application of sandpaper of one or more suitable grit sizes. The difficulty in hand-sanding is in applying firm pressure long enough to complete the job and in applying even pressure to obtain a desired smooth and even finish. A further difficulty is to obtain efficient use of the sandpaper by not wasting any substantial portion of its surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Common sanding jobs calling for considerable detail work or access to small confined areas, or for the sanding of contoured surfaces, will often require that the surfaces be hand sanded. Therefore, hand-held sanding devices devised for this purpose consist essentially of a sanding block for holding conventional sandpaper wrapped over the block. By using a sanding block as a sandpaper holder, hand-applied sanding forces on the sandpaper can be increased and more evenly distributed. One such device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,096 to Lukianoff, wherein a generally triangularly shaped sandpaper holding device provides three different sanding surfaces and corners for accommodating a variety of sanding conditions. The sandpaper wrapped around the faces of this device is held at its ends by means of an angled slot located in one of its faces.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The difficulty with the above-mentioned prior sanding devices is the necessity of installing or wrapping a separate piece of sandpaper around the device. This installation or wrapping process presents some inconvenience to the user, and the paper, if improperly installed, is susceptible to falling off. Also, the device requires the purchase of separate sheets of sandpaper which is a further inconvenience in terms of the amount of supplies needed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sanding blocks are presently available in a variety of forms in an attempt to meet the needs of those who must sand various surfaces. Perhaps the most common sandpaper support is a block of wood from which one may move through myriad supports and into complex electric sanders. In virtually all of these items, the general purpose of the sanding block is three fold.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">First, it allows the user to apply greater pressure to the area being sanded. Secondly, it moves the user's hand away from the work surface, usually by providing a handle for the user to grasp, in order to reduce the likelihood of injuries. Thirdly, when a sanding block having a flat sanding paper supporting surface is used to sand a flat surface, the block reduces points of excessive pressure by more evenly distributing the user's force over the sandpaper supporting surface. However, when non-flat surfaces need to be sanded, difficulties often arise. The standard sanding block has a relatively large, flat sandpaper supporting surface which does not satisfactorily meet the needs of one who is sanding an irregular surface. The use of such a sanding block on an irregular surface will generally result in the user angling the block or using it in a way in which it was not intended in an attempt to conform the sanding surface to the work surface. Even with such attempts, the resultant effect is uneven sanding as generally no portion of the block will conform exactly to the area being sanded and excessive areas of pressure which will result in over sanding.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Excessive pressure points can also result in the quickened wearing of the sandpaper, such that the sanding block itself may become exposed, which, depending upon the fabrication of the sanding block, may damage the work surface. Similarly, as the user angles the sanding block in order to utilize a corner or edge of the sandpaper, a portion of the block not covered by the sandpaper may scratch the work surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an attempt to provide sanding blocks which are usable on irregular surfaces, a wide variety of devices have been developed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,557,496 to R.W. Martin discloses a metal strap to which a piece of sandpaper may be secured. The strap is then placed over a pipe or other circular type object so that a back and forth motion may be applied to sand the item. A circular piece of sandpaper is also secured over the handles which are particularly adapted for sanding the inner edges of the pipes. Other patents disclose devices such as special sandpaper holders for louver doors, U.S. Pat. No. 3,640,031 to Descant; sanding fittings, U.S. Pat. No. 3,722,150 to Pass; abrading corners and crevices as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,465,569 issued to Bates. While such devices may be suitable for their intended uses, they do not sufficiently meet the myriad surface irregularities often encountered when sanding a complex work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, an individual faced with the task of sanding a variety of irregular surfaces, must either attempt to use different types of sanding blocks, many of which still will not conform to the actual intended use, or in the alternative, those experienced in this area will use their hand in order to conform and support the sandpaper to the work piece. Attempting to enhance this latter approach are devices which either secure the sandpaper directly to the users hand or to a specialized glove.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be easily appreciated that these later approaches, while at times effective, are not reasonable alternatives when extreme precision or small detailed contours, such as in furniture finishing, are involved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention overcomes the forgoing difficulties of hand-held sanding devices by providing a hand-sized sanding device which eliminates the need for a separate sheet of sandpaper. A sanding device is particularly provided which has its own integral abrasive surfaces and which can be manufactured at a sufficiently low cost to be disposable. The invention further provides a self-contained sanding device that can be conveniently used off-the-shelf to hand sand a variety of standard, contoured or shaped surfaces, such as trim or molding surfaces, and for projecting into restricted exactly defined areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to develop a low cost (and thus disposable) hand held sanding device made of lightweight, resilient material capable of recovering its shape after being subjected to radial or axial pressures attendant its usage as a sanding device. The device has a contoured outer surface which can be deformed to match the small, intricate shapes of furniture balusters, moldings and trim. While shaped molding and trim are specifically identified as possible contoured shapes to which the sanding device of the invention can be applied, it shall be understood that the contoured surface of the device can be applied with almost any sandable surface and material.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, a disposable hand sanding device includes an elongated, generally rod shaped base portion which is constructed of lightweight resilient material such as closed cell foam or rubber and is formed with a substantially constant cross-section along its characteristic line of elongation. An abrasive outer surface layer is permanently formed on the base portion by adhering abrasive material such as silicon carbide or aluminum oxide upon an intermediate adhesive layer. This arrangement results in a hand held device which, in application, conforms to curvilinear contours of a work piece to be sanded upon application of user induced loading against the workpiece. The device is light weight, easy to use and is extremely inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As an additional feature, an elongated, non-resilient flexible cord is embedded within the base portion and extends substantially concentrically with the base portion to limit axial distension of the sanding device upon application of user induced loading. The cord, when exposed, also facilitates manual manipulation of the sanding device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a continuously formed rope-like article is provided which can be selectively cut to length for a specific sanding application. The rope-like article is maintained in a roll. Segments removed from the roll are used and then discarded. This arrangement has the advantage of continuously forming multiple “sanding ropes” in series or a succession such as by extrusion. An artisan can easily maintain the unused roll portion and sever just the length segment required for a specific sanding application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A dispenser can also be provided which maintains the continuously formed rope-like article in a rotating spool mounted on a frame member which includes a cutter and a loose end holder. This arrangement provides an extremely convenient package which facilitates removal of a length of sanding rope material from the storage roll without the necessity of using additional tools, such as a cutting device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An additional feature includes witness marks located on the outer surface of the rope-like material which are axially spaced from one another to serve as an indicator or measurement to the artisan in selecting an appropriate amount of length of material to sever. Furthermore, localized weakened areas such as perforations are provided to assist in the stripping off of a short length of base portion to expose an under laying length of inner cord to aid in the manipulation of the severed piece.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A severed length of sanding rope with its internal cord exposed at each end thereof can be employed with a hand held tool, similar to a key hole saw frame, which provides precisely controlled tensioning of the cord in application to a work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">These and other features and advantages of this invention will become apparent upon reading the following specification which, along with the drawings, describes and discloses preferred and alternative embodiments of the invention in detail.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A disposable sanding rope or device <b>10</b> is formed as a generally rod shaped base portion <b>12</b> elongated along an axis designated A-A. Base portion <b>12</b> is preferably formed from lightweight resilient material such as closed cell foam or rubber. It is contemplated that many other suitable materials such as urethane or neoprene could be substituted, however, based upon an understanding of the present invention and a given specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The outer circumferential surface of base portion <b>12</b> is substantially covered with an abrasive coating layer <b>11</b> suitably affixed to the underlying base portion <b>12</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>16</b>. Adhesive layer <b>16</b> is spray applied to base portion <b>12</b> prior to application of a suitable aggregate abrasive <b>14</b> such as coarse aluminum oxide or silicon carbide. Such materials are commercially available from the Household and Hardware Products Division of the 3M Company under a number of product names. One type of spray adhesive that can be used is “Spray Mount” No. 6065 produced by 3M Adhesives Division of the 3M Company. This construction allows momentary resilient deformation of the sanding rope <b>10</b> as it engages a work piece. Upon completion of the sanding process, the sanding rope returns to its illustrated shape. Alternatively, abrasive layer <b>14</b> could be formed of traditional sand paper which is, in turn, adhered to base portion <b>12</b> by adhesive layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A reinforcing cord <b>18</b>, formed of woven fibrous material such as cotton or nylon, extends along axis A-A within base portion <b>12</b> of sanding rope <b>10</b>. Cord <b>18</b> is flexible in the radial direction and inflexible in the axial direction and thus serves to limit axial distension of sanding rope <b>10</b> when applied against a work piece. Furthermore, cord <b>18</b> also extends axially beyond the longitudinal ends <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of base portion <b>12</b> to define grip handles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Sanding rope <b>10</b> is intended for hand sanding complex curvilinear surfaces of work pieces such as wooden furniture or moldings. Rope <b>10</b> is employed by either grasping the abrasive layer by the user's finger tips or palm of the hand and applying force against a work piece. In this manner the tactile sense of the operator's hand allows continuous variation in force applied against the work piece and thus the rate and configuration of sanding. This is useful for non-symmetrical or custom surface features.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternately, for work piece surfaces which are regular or symmetrical in at least one plane, grip handles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be held by the fingertips of the user's respective right and left hands. Insodoing, the user tensions cord <b>18</b> along axis A-A. The user then positions the abrasive surface <b>14</b> of rope <b>10</b> against a specific feature of the work piece to be sanded and alternatively pulls grip handles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> along axis A-A. This action will largely conform the local circumferential shape of the sanding rope <b>10</b> to the adjacent contour features of the work piece. As grip handles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are alternatively pulled in one direction and then another along axis A-A, the portion of abrasive layer <b>14</b> of sanding rope <b>10</b> contacting the work piece reshapes its surface. The amount of tension applied along the cord <b>18</b> will control the degree in which the abrasive layer will conform to the work piece. For example, if very little tension is applied to cord <b>18</b>, the sanding rope <b>10</b> will tend to increase its “wrap” or engagement with convex surface features of the work piece. Conversely, if the cord <b>18</b> is placed under high tension, sanding rope <b>10</b> will tend to decrease its “wrap” around convex surfaces. Accordingly, an amount of user experience and test sanding of material similar to that contained in an intended work piece will facilitate skilled use of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sanding rope <b>10</b> is illustrated in application with a work piece <b>28</b>. The work piece <b>28</b> is of relatively simple geometric form for purposes of illustration only, it being contemplated that the present invention is best applied with extremely irregular contoured surfaces. The work piece <b>28</b> is configured as a generally rectangular block of wood having an upper surface <b>30</b> with a generally rounded configuration. Sanding rope <b>10</b> is applied by draping it over upper surface <b>30</b> with cord <b>18</b> extending generally from left to right. Grip handles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are alternatively pulled leftwardly, as illustrated by arrow <b>32</b>, and then rightwardly, as illustrated by arrow <b>34</b>. As described hereinabove, the user will maintain continuous tension in cord <b>16</b> throughout this process.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3A</figref>, sanding rope <b>10</b> is being employed to form a generally saddle or crescent shaped groove <b>36</b> in upper surface <b>30</b> of work piece <b>28</b>. When subjected to very low tension forces in the direction of arrows <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, the base portion <b>12</b> of sanding rope <b>10</b> substantially maintains its nominal circular configuration. As such, only a small portion of the abrasive layer <b>14</b> adjacent the intersection of the uppermost portion of groove <b>36</b> and upper surface <b>30</b> conforms to the adjacent portion of the groove <b>36</b> at regions designated <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>. Therefore, axial manipulation of sanding rope <b>10</b> will result in removal of material at regions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3B</figref>, sanding rope <b>10</b> is illustrated as being subjected to intermediate tension forces in the direction of arrows <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. As a result, sanding rope is displaced further within groove <b>36</b> and conforms thereto at adjacent regions designated <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. Again, axial manipulation of sanding rope <b>10</b> will result in removal of material at regions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3C</figref>, sanding rope <b>10</b> is illustrated as being subjected to relatively high tension forces in the direction of arrows <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. As a result, sanding rope <b>10</b> is displaced into the bottom of groove <b>36</b> and conforms thereto at a single adjacent region <b>45</b>. Axial manipulation of sanding rope <b>10</b> will result in removal of material at region <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The various positionings of sanding rope <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C serve to illustrate how an artisan using sanding rope <b>10</b> can skillfully and precisely remove material from a complex recess in a work piece by varying the tension applied to the cord <b>18</b> of sanding rope <b>10</b>. Varying the positioning of the sanding rope <b>10</b> vis-a-vis the groove <b>36</b> causes momentary localized deformation of the base portion <b>12</b> and the abrasive coating layer <b>14</b> as well as the intermediate adhesive layer <b>16</b>. Upon removal of the sanding rope <b>10</b> from engagement with the work piece <b>28</b>, the overall shape of the sanding rope <b>10</b> will return to the generally cylindrical configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an alternative application of the sanding rope <b>10</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated. Sanding rope <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in application with a work piece <b>46</b>. As in the case of work piece <b>28</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, work piece <b>46</b> is of relatively simple geometric form for purposes of illustration only, it being contemplated that the present invention is best applied with extremely irregular contoured surfaces. The work piece <b>46</b> is configured as a generally rectangular block of wood having an upper surface <b>48</b> with a generally concave feature <b>50</b> formed therein. Sanding rope <b>10</b> is applied to work piece <b>46</b> by conforming it generally to the contours of concave feature <b>50</b> on upper surface <b>48</b> of work piece <b>46</b>. Sanding rope is maintained in its illustrated position by the artisan applying pressure, as indicated by arrow <b>52</b>, from one or more finger tips <b>54</b>. While holding sanding rope <b>10</b> in position, the artisan would apply his other hand to grasp either of the grip handles <b>24</b> or <b>26</b> and apply tension to cord <b>18</b>, as illustrated by arrows <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively. Increasing or decreasing pressure (arrow <b>52</b>) will deform the base portion <b>12</b> of sanding rope <b>10</b> and thus increase or decrease the amount of abrasive layer that is bearing against the adjacent area <b>60</b> of concave feature <b>50</b>. This will result in precisely controlled removal of material at region <b>60</b> in response to axial manipulation of sanding rope <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5A</figref>, to facilitate economical large scale production of sanding rope <b>10</b> such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it would be formed in an endless or continuous stream <b>62</b> emerging from appropriate manufacturing equipment <b>64</b>, such as an extruder, along an axis B-B. The continuous stream <b>62</b> of sanding rope preferably has a typical cross section configuration substantially identical to that described with respect to the sanding rope <b>10</b> segment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The continuous stream <b>62</b> comprises successive segments of sanding rope <b>66</b> joined end-to-end along axis B-B.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The continuous stream <b>62</b> structure consists of concentrically arranged cord <b>68</b>, base portion <b>70</b>, adhesive layer <b>72</b> and abrasive coating layer <b>74</b>. Witness marks <b>76</b> are imprinted on the outer surface of abrasive coating layer <b>74</b> at axially spaced locations there along. Weakened areas <b>78</b> such as perforations are formed at axially spaced locations as well. The witness marks are indicators of suggested locations for severing one specific sanding rope segment <b>66</b> from an immediately adjacent segment <b>66</b>. The applicant has discovered that spacing (designated “L”) between successive witness marks of eight (8″) to twelve (12″) inches results in sanding rope segments <b>66</b> of convenient length for many craft and hobby applications.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Perforations <b>78</b> are provided at a location spaced from each end of each sanding rope segment <b>66</b>. The perforations extend inwardly through abrasive coating layer <b>74</b>, adhesive layer <b>72</b> and substantially all of base portion <b>70</b>. The cord <b>68</b> is not weakened, however. The portions of the abrasive layer <b>74</b>, adhesive layer <b>72</b> and base portion <b>70</b> intermediate the (severed) witness marks <b>76</b> and a related perforation <b>78</b> are optionally removable to expose a segment of the underlying cord <b>68</b>. The applicant has discovered that the exposed cord <b>68</b> portion, i.e. the spacing (designated “D”) between each witness mark <b>76</b> and its associated perforations <b>78</b> of one (1″) to two (2″) inches results in a convenient length of exposed cord <b>68</b> for finger grasping by the artisan in application of a given sanding rope segment <b>66</b> without undue waste of material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When constructed in a continuous stream <b>62</b>, the sanding rope segments <b>66</b> of the present invention can be easily packaged and marketed in bulk or rolls. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an example roll dispenser <b>80</b> for retail sales of a substantial length (such as 10′ to 25′) is illustrated. A spool <b>82</b> dimensioned to receive and hold an extended length of sanding rope <b>84</b> (shown in phantom) is mounted for rotation on an axle <b>86</b> extending concentrically through the hub <b>88</b> of spool <b>82</b>. The lower end of axle <b>86</b> is affixed to a stop member <b>90</b> which functions to prevent relative upward displacement of the axle <b>86</b> with respect to hub <b>88</b> but allow free relative rotation between the two. Axle <b>86</b> extends upwardly above spool <b>88</b> and through a frame member <b>92</b>, terminating in a second stop member <b>94</b>. Stop member <b>94</b> is affixed to both the uppermost end of axle <b>86</b> and frame member <b>92</b>, and prevents relative downward displacement of the axle <b>86</b> with respect to hub <b>88</b>. Thus, frame <b>92</b>, axle <b>86</b>, and stop members <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> comprise one rigid, fixed assembly. Spool <b>82</b> (and any sanding rope <b>84</b> carried thereon) is free to rotate about axle <b>86</b> but is restrained from relative axial displacement with respect to the remainder of roll dispenser <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Frame member <b>92</b> of roll dispenser <b>80</b> extends radially outwardly beyond spool <b>82</b> and terminates in a cutter/retainer portion <b>96</b>. Cutter/retainer portion <b>96</b> serves as an integrated tool for conveniently severing one or more sanding rope segments <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) as required. Subsequently, the free end <b>111</b> of the extended length of sanding rope <b>84</b> remaining on spool <b>82</b> is retained in its illustrated position to prevent inadvertent uncoiling of the extended length of sanding rope <b>84</b> remaining on the spool <b>82</b>. Cutter/retainer portion defines a generally “V” shaped cutter <b>98</b> defining converging sharpened edges <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>. A pocket <b>104</b> formed in the cutter <b>98</b> adjacent the point of closest approach of edges <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> is dimensioned to receive the cord <b>68</b> of a sanding rope segment <b>66</b> being severed from the remaining length of sanding rope <b>84</b> remaining on the spool <b>82</b>. Thickened guide walls <b>106</b>.<b>108</b> and <b>110</b> coact with cutting edges <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> and pocket <b>101</b>, respectively, to precisely guide the segment of sanding rope <b>66</b> being severed to ensure a clean perpendicular cut occurs. Cutter/retainer portion <b>96</b> also defines a necked opening <b>112</b> dimensioned to enable the user to press fit the free end <b>111</b> of the extended length of sanding rope <b>84</b> remaining on the spool <b>82</b> during storage.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an alternative configuration of the sanding rope <b>10</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated. A sanding rope <b>114</b>, illustrated in typical cross-section, comprises a base portion <b>116</b>.formed in a generally square or rectangular configuration. The outer circumferential surface of base portion <b>116</b> is substantially covered by an abrasive coating layer <b>118</b> which is affixed to the base portion <b>116</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>120</b>. A reinforcing cord <b>122</b>, formed of woven fibrous material extends axially through the base portion <b>116</b>. The sanding rope <b>114</b> provides multiple flat normally disposed surfaces and intermediate sharp corners suitable for certain sanding requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another alternative configuration of the sanding rope described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated. A sanding rope <b>124</b>, illustrated in typical cross-section, comprises a base portion <b>126</b> formed in a generally triangular configuration. The outer circumferential surface of base portion <b>126</b> is substantially covered by an abrasive coating layer <b>128</b> which is fixed to the base portion <b>126</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>130</b>. A reinforcing cord <b>132</b> formed of woven fibrous material extends axially through the base portion <b>126</b>. The sanding rope <b>126</b> provides three acutely angled flat surfaces <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> intersected by intermediate corner edges <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Each surface <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> has a significantly different grit size or coarseness characteristic. Furthermore, each surface <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> carries unique visible or tactile indicia indicative of its relative degree of coarseness.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the case of this embodiment of the invention, the indicia comprise single, dual and treble sets of axially extending brightly colored stripes <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. Alternatively, numerical grit or coarseness ratings could be provided on each side surface <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> as an aid to the artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, still another alternative embodiment configuration of the sanding rope described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. is illustrated. A sanding rope <b>152</b>, illustrated in typical cross-section, comprises a base portion <b>154</b> formed in a generally hour glass configuration. The outer circumferential surface of base portion <b>154</b> is substantially covered by an abrasive coating layer <b>156</b> which is fixed to the base portion <b>154</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>158</b>. A reinforcing cord <b>160</b> formed of woven fibrous material extends axially through the base portion <b>154</b>. The top surface <b>162</b> of sanding rope <b>152</b> has an axially extending concave recess <b>164</b> formed therein. Recess <b>164</b> has a characteristic relatively constant radius designated by arrow “R<b>1</b>”. Likewise, the bottom surface <b>166</b> of sanding rope <b>152</b> has an axially extending concave recess <b>168</b> formed therein. Recess <b>168</b> has a characteristic relatively constant radius designated by arrow “R<b>2</b>”. It is contemplated that R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> may be dimensionally the same or, alternatively, substantially varied. Side walls <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> of sanding rope <b>152</b> are illustrated as being substantially flat. However, they could be formed as concave, convex or otherwise curvilinear surfaces to suit any number of varied sanding jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a further alternative embodiment configuration of the sanding rope described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated. A sanding rope <b>174</b>. illustrated in typical cross-section. comprises a base portion <b>176</b> having an exterior surface which is continuously curvilinear in shape. The outer circumferential surface of base portion <b>176</b> is substantially covered by an abrasive coating layer <b>178</b> which is fixed to the base portion <b>176</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>180</b>. Two reinforcing cords <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> formed of woven fibrous material extend axially through the base portion <b>176</b>. Cords <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> are parallel and fall upon an imaginary plane designated “P-P”. Sanding rope <b>174</b> is asymmetrical in overall shape to define convexly curved surfaces of varying radius. Specifically, the upper left hand portion of base portion <b>176</b> defines a region <b>186</b> of relatively small varying radius designated by arrow <b>188</b>. The upper right hand portion of base portion <b>176</b> defines a region <b>190</b> of intermediate varying radius designated by arrow <b>192</b>. The bottom portion of base portion <b>176</b> defines a region <b>194</b> of relatively large varying radius designated by arrow <b>196</b>. Cord <b>182</b> extends through the portion of base portion <b>176</b> adjacent region <b>186</b> and cord <b>184</b> extends through the portion of base portion <b>176</b> adjacent region <b>190</b>. Cords <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> provide enhanced control of sanding rope <b>174</b> when regions <b>186</b> and <b>190</b>, respectively, are being employed in a sanding operation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When both cords <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> are subjected to tensioning by an artisan in application, sanding rope becomes relatively inflexible within plane P-P, thus proving another measure of control.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 11A</figref>, a tensioning tool <b>198</b> suitable for use with the sanding rope <b>10</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated. Tool <b>198</b> can be applied in circumstances where extremely precise control of sanding rope <b>10</b> is required to effect sanding of a workpiece with curvilinear features having section which is straight in at least one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Tensioning tool <b>198</b> is similar in some cosmetic respects to a conventional key-hole saw. Tool <b>198</b> is formed from relatively stiff drawn steel wire that is square or round in cross-section. The wire is bent to form a handle portion <b>200</b> integrally formed with a generally “U” shaped bow frame <b>202</b>. Bow frame <b>202</b> consists of a base portion <b>204</b> and two legs <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> extending there from in cantilever fashion. Legs <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> extend downwardly, terminating in sanding rope clamping assemblies <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Clamping assemblies <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> are substantially identical. Accordingly, the detailed structure of only one will be described herein for the sake of brevity. Clamp assembly <b>212</b> includes an annular ring <b>214</b> defining a through bore <b>216</b>. Through bore <b>216</b> of ring <b>214</b> registers with a similarly dimensioned and aligned through bore <b>218</b> formed in leg <b>208</b> near the free end thereof. Legs <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are generally parallel and are spaced to receive the sanding rope <b>10</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In application, grip handle or cord segment <b>26</b> of sanding rope <b>10</b> is threaded rightwardly through bores <b>218</b> and <b>216</b>, extending slightly there beyond. A set screw <b>220</b> which is threadably engaged within a bore <b>222</b> in ring <b>214</b> normal to and communicating with bore <b>216</b>, is then tightened to secure grip handle <b>26</b> in its illustrated position. The process is then repeated wherein grip handle <b>24</b> is secured to leg <b>206</b> via clamp assembly <b>210</b>. As a final step, the free ends of legs <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are momentarily forcibly sprung towards one another. Set screw <b>220</b> is loosened and grip handles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are pulled in opposed directions (tensioned). Finally, set screw <b>220</b> is retightened. This arrangement results in bow portion <b>202</b> of tool <b>198</b> acting to maintain a predetermined level of tension in sanding rope <b>10</b>. Thereafter, sanding rope is employed in its intended manner by the artisan grasping and manipulating the tool <b>198</b> by its handle <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an extended length of a sanding device or sanding rope <b>250</b> has first and second opposed ends <b>252</b> and <b>254</b>, respectively, interconnected by a fastener <b>256</b> to form a continuous loop, shown generally at <b>258</b>. Except as denoted herein below, the sanding rope <b>250</b> is constructed substantially as described herein above with respect to the embodiments of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. In one embodiment, the fastener <b>256</b> releasably engages the ends <b>252</b> and <b>254</b> of sanding rope <b>250</b>, whereby loop <b>258</b> can be easily adjusted, reconfigured, repaired or replaced as required. As will become apparent herein below, fastener <b>256</b> also serves to precisely axially align ends <b>252</b> and <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Loop <b>258</b> is dressed over two spaced pulleys <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> carried for rotation upon axles <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>, respectively, which, in turn, are carried by appropriate bearing assemblies and support structure (not illustrated). A tensioner (not illustrated) can be provided to prevent slack within loop <b>258</b>. Axle <b>264</b> is fixed for rotation with pulley <b>260</b> by an interlocking key <b>268</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Loop <b>258</b> can be rotated (with pulleys <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>) either manually by a hand crank (not illustrated) or by a motorized mechanism such as an electric motor (not illustrated). The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is intended for low speed, low force applications and provides a fixed radius zone for sanding tangent to the o.d. of each of the pulleys <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>. The pulleys <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> can be of the same or differing diameters as required by a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a broken, sectioned portion of pulley <b>260</b> with an overlaying segment of sanding rope <b>250</b> is illustrated. As described herein above, sanding rope <b>250</b> is constructed with a soft, foam-like generally rod shaped base portion <b>270</b>, which is substantially of constant cross-section along its axial line of elongation. An abrasive outer coating or layer <b>272</b> is applied to the outer peripheral surface of base portion <b>270</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>274</b>. The abrasive layer <b>272</b> covers substantially the entire circumferential surface of the sanding rope <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Sanding rope <b>258</b> is divided into a plurality of discrete abrasive surface regions <b>276</b> separated by outwardly opening annular recesses or neck regions <b>278</b>. The abrasive surface regions <b>276</b> and intermediate neck regions <b>278</b> form a repeating pattern to facilitate usage of the sanding rope <b>250</b>, as well as inexpensive manufacturing by simple extrusion process. Such construction materially adds to the overall flexibility of the sanding rope <b>250</b>, allowing it to be draped over work pieces or pulleys of relatively small diameter without concern for deformation of the abrasive layer <b>272</b>. This aspect of the invention permits sanding of extremely intricate workpiece features. Preferably, the axial length of the individual abrasive regions <b>276</b> and recesses/necks remain constant. The specific dimensions of the abrasive surface regions <b>276</b> are selected as a function of the diameter of the sanding rope <b>250</b> as well as the intended application, material to be sanded, rate of sanding, and the like. The axial dimension of the neck regions are preferably kept to a minimum, but must be able to adapt to the minimum sanding radius contemplated for the specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To maximize overall flexibility of sanding rope <b>250</b>, neck regions <b>278</b> extend radially through abrasive layer <b>272</b> and adhesive layer <b>274</b>, exposing the relatively softer base portion <b>270</b>. In the relaxed condition wherein successive abrasive surface regions <b>276</b> are in axial alignment, the average circumferential width (W-ave.) remains substantially constant. When sanding rope <b>250</b> is dressed over a pulley or workpiece, the outer portion of each neck region <b>278</b> is locally distended under tension to momentarily assume a maximum axial dimension (W-max.). Simultaneously, the inner portion of each neck region <b>278</b> is locally compressed to momentarily assume a minimum axial dimension (W-min.).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the structural detail and operation of fastener <b>256</b> is illustrated. Fastener <b>256</b> is a clam shell type design made of injection molded plastic or other suitable material. Fastener <b>256</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and comprises upper and lower half portions, <b>280</b> and <b>282</b>, respectively, joined by a living hinge <b>284</b>. Symmetrically facing, semi-cylindrical upper and lower axial passageways <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are centrally formed within fastener <b>256</b>. Sharpened barbs <b>290</b> are integrally formed with upper half portion <b>280</b> and extend into upper passageway <b>286</b>. An axial stop member <b>292</b> is integrally formed with lower half portion <b>282</b> and extends into lower passageway <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In application, ends <b>252</b> and <b>254</b> of sanding rope <b>250</b> define the axially outwardly extending stub ends of an elongated, non-resilient, flexible cord <b>294</b> which extends through the center of base portion <b>270</b> of sanding rope <b>250</b> throughout its entire length. The stub ends of cord <b>294</b> are dressed within passageways <b>296</b> and <b>298</b> from opposite ends of fastener <b>256</b> until the stub ends of cord <b>294</b> abut each side of stop member <b>292</b>. Thus positioned, upper and lower half portions <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> are rotated into the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, whereby a self-engaging latch arm <b>296</b> integrally formed within upper half portion <b>280</b> snap-engages a mating engagement surface <b>298</b> formed within lower half portion <b>282</b>. Thus positioned, barbs <b>290</b> pierce into cord <b>294</b> to affect the closure of the loop <b>258</b> (refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) and allow the application of axial tension forces there through.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The outer circumferential surface of fastener <b>256</b> is preferably covered by an abrasive layer <b>300</b> and an intermediate adhesive layer <b>302</b> to enhance the overall sanding effect of the sanding rope <b>250</b> when configured in a loop <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an alternative design fastener <b>304</b> is applied to join two opposed ends <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> of a length of sanding rope <b>310</b>. As described herein above, sanding rope <b>310</b> has an elongated non-resilient, flexible cord <b>312</b> axially disposed within a base portion <b>314</b> formed of relatively soft, compressible material such as foam or rubber. The outer peripheral surface of base portion <b>314</b> is substantially covered by an abrasive layer <b>316</b> bonded to base portion <b>314</b> by an intermediate adhesive layer <b>318</b>. Axially spaced circumferential recesses or neck regions <b>320</b> define outer abrasive surface regions <b>322</b> there between. Ends <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> of sanding rope <b>310</b> have rope stubs <b>324</b> and <b>326</b>, respectively, extending axially there from.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, fastener <b>304</b> is formed of two opposed frustu-conical body portions <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> formed of stamped metal, molded plastic or other suitable material. Body portion <b>328</b> is associated with rope end <b>306</b>, opening rightwardly as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The small diameter, lefthandmost end of body portion <b>328</b> forms an opening <b>332</b> to receive rope stub <b>324</b>. Axially reversed barbs <b>334</b> integrally formed with body portion <b>328</b> permit rope stub <b>324</b> to be manually displaced rightwardly with respect to body portion <b>328</b>, but check any relative leftward displacement. A knot <b>336</b> formed in rope stub <b>324</b> provides additional design robustness and ensures against inadvertent release of rope stub <b>324</b> from body portion <b>328</b> of fastener <b>304</b>. An axially offset keyhole opening <b>338</b> formed in body portion <b>328</b> permits knot <b>336</b> to be pre-formed and assembled by passing it through keyhole opening <b>338</b>. A radially outwardly directed circumferential flange <b>340</b> is integrally formed at the righthandmost end of body portion <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Body portion <b>328</b> is assembled with end <b>306</b> of sanding rope <b>310</b> by the following steps. First, rope stub <b>324</b> is dressed axially away from end <b>306</b> and through keyhole opening <b>338</b>. While manually gripping rope stub <b>324</b>, body portion <b>328</b> is oriented concentrically with rope end <b>306</b> and pushed leftwardly therein, resiliently deforming the soft base portion <b>314</b> until the flange <b>340</b> is substantially aligned with rope end <b>306</b>. Thereafter, rope stub <b>324</b> is radially displaced from keyhole <b>338</b> into opening <b>332</b> and released. The natural resilience of the base portion <b>314</b> material will urge body portion <b>328</b> rightwardly, thereby causing the barbs <b>334</b> to bite into the cord <b>312</b>. Finally, knot <b>336</b> is formed in rope stub <b>324</b> with care being taken that the knot <b>336</b> is fully disposed within body portion <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Body portion <b>330</b> is associated with rope end <b>308</b>, opening leftwardly as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Body portion <b>330</b> is largely a mirror image of body portion <b>328</b>, including an axial opening <b>342</b> in the small diameter righthandmost end thereof. Axially reversed barbs <b>344</b> are integrally formed with body portion <b>330</b> and permit rope stub <b>326</b> to be manually displaced leftwardly with respect to body portion <b>330</b> but check any rightward withdrawal of rope stub <b>326</b> from opening <b>342</b>. A knot <b>346</b> formed in rope stub <b>326</b> provides additional robustness of the design as described herein above. An axially offset keyhole opening (not illustrated) formed in body portion <b>330</b> facilitates assembly as described herein above. A radially outwardly directed circumferential flange <b>348</b> is integrally formed at the lefthandmost end of body portion <b>330</b>. Four circumferentially equally spaced snap engagement members <b>350</b> extend axially leftwardly from flange <b>348</b> and are integrally formed with body portion <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Body portion <b>330</b> of fastener <b>304</b> is assembled with end <b>308</b> of sanding rope <b>310</b> substantially as described herein above with respect to body portion <b>328</b> and end <b>306</b>, with care being taken to align the flange <b>348</b> of body portion <b>330</b> with the end <b>308</b> of sanding rope <b>310</b> and the knot <b>346</b> being fully disposed within body portion <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A final assembly step involves manual axial alignment of the ends <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> and axially pressing them together. Insodoing, snap engagement members <b>350</b> serve to guide the flange <b>340</b> of connector body portion <b>328</b> until engagement occurs as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The concentric positioning of flanges <b>340</b> and <b>348</b> ensures precise alignment of the rope ends <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. Finally, having the flanges <b>340</b> and <b>348</b> aligned with their respective rope ends <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, respectively, causes to minimize the resultant axial gap between ends <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. This configuration results in extremely precise sanding by the sanding rope <b>310</b> as well as an aesthetically pleasing appearance, wherein the point of interconnection of sanding rope ends is not apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an alternative method of forming sanding rope <b>352</b> is illustrated. Rather than co-forming the completed article, as in the case of the embodiment described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> herein above, a resilient foam or rubber base portion <b>354</b> is pre-formed with flexible cord <b>356</b> disposed therein. A layered composite consisting of an abrasive layer <b>358</b>, a first adhesive layer <b>360</b>, a carrier layer <b>362</b> and a second adhesive layer <b>364</b> is prepared in strip form and adhesively applied to base portion <b>354</b> in a spiral orientation extending along axis C-C. Suitable gaps <b>366</b> are formed between adjacent edges of the composite overlayment <b>368</b>. The gaps enhance overall flexibility of sanding rope <b>352</b> as do the neck regions <b>278</b> of the sanding rope <b>250</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref> herein above. Although a single strip <b>368</b> is illustrated, it is contemplated that two or more parallel stripe could be substituted.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, sanding rope <b>370</b> could be formed in a continuous loop without the use of mechanical fasteners <b>256</b> and <b>304</b> described herein above by substituting a suitable weldment or bond <b>372</b> joining opposed ends <b>374</b> and <b>276</b> of sanding rope <b>370</b>. It is contemplated that the weldmentfbond would affix the base portions <b>378</b>, rather than the inner cord <b>380</b> or the outer abrasive layer <b>382</b> and adhesive layer <b>384</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the application of a continuous loop of sanding rope <b>386</b> constructed in accordance with the teachings herein on a band saw like apparatus <b>388</b> is illustrated. Sanding rope <b>386</b> is dressed over two vertically spaced pulleys <b>390</b> and <b>392</b>. The upper pulley <b>390</b> is mounted to freely rotate about an axis, while the lower pulley <b>392</b> is rotated by an electric motor <b>394</b> through a suitable drive apparatus <b>396</b>. A work table <b>398</b> is suspended between the pulleys <b>390</b> and <b>392</b>. A clearance hole <b>400</b> in work table <b>398</b> serves to guide the sanding rope <b>386</b> passing downwardly there through. A workpiece <b>402</b> can be conveniently manipulated upon the top surface of the work table <b>398</b> to perform precise continuous sanding operations. It is contemplated that some form of tensioner or device for adjusting the vertical spacing between pulleys <b>390</b> and <b>392</b> will be required to avoid undue slack in sanding rope <b>386</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the application of a continuous loop of sanding rope <b>404</b> constructed in accordance with the teachings herein on a drum table sander like apparatus <b>406</b> is illustrated. Sanding rope <b>404</b> is mounted on a pulley shaped spindle <b>408</b>, which, in turn, is carried on an output shaft <b>410</b> of an electric motor-transmission drive mechanism <b>412</b> for rotation about axis D-D. Motor-transmission drive mechanism <b>412</b> is disposed within a housing <b>414</b> defining a horizontal work surface <b>416</b> on the top surface thereof. The output drive shaft <b>410</b> extends upwardly through an opening <b>418</b> in the work surface <b>416</b> dimensioned to position the spindle and sanding rope <b>404</b> vertically adjacent work surface <b>416</b>. A workpiece <b>420</b> can be conveniently manipulated upon work surface <b>416</b> of sander apparatus <b>406</b> to perform precise continuous sanding operations. Sander apparatus <b>406</b> can be of the type which maintains the spindle <b>408</b> and sanding rope <b>404</b> at a fixed vertical orientation with respect to the work surface <b>416</b> as it rotates about axis D-D or, alternatively, of the type that selectively axially reciprocates the spindle <b>408</b> and sanding rope <b>404</b> through a range of motion reflected by arrow <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a sanding rope <b>424</b> is illustrated in application with a workpiece such as a furniture baluster <b>426</b>. It is contemplated that the invention is best applied with extremely irregular contoured surfaces. Sanding rope <b>424</b> is applied by draping it over a surface contour of the baluster <b>426</b> requiring sanding with cords <b>428</b> oriented in a generally parallel orientation normal to the axis E-E of the baluster <b>426</b>. Cords <b>428</b> serve as grip handles, which are alternately pulled rightwardly, as illustrated by arrows <b>430</b>. As described hereinabove, the user will maintain continuous tension in cord <b>428</b> throughout the sanding process. For this type of application, it is contemplated that the sanding rope <b>424</b> will be of relatively small overall diameter and define a large number of discrete abrasive surface regions <b>432</b> interspaced by neck regions <b>434</b> to ensure maximum flexibility.</p>
