<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to disk drives, and in particular to a disk drive with a cover including a formed-in-place gasket with a cross-sectional cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The typical hard disk drive includes a head disk assembly (HDA) and a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) attached to a disk drive base of the HDA. The head disk assembly includes the disk drive base, a cover, at least one magnetic disk, a spindle motor for rotating the disk, and a head stack assembly (HSA) that includes a transducer head supported by a slider for reading and writing data from and to the disk.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cover is engaged with the disk drive base with a plurality of screws. Adequate sealing of the cover and the disk drive base is critical in order to maintain a controlled internal environment of the disk drive. To facilitate sealing a gasket may be disposed between the cover and the disk drive base. A conventional gasket may take the form of a solid bead of an elastomer material disposed generally about a periphery of the cover. The material may be dispensed upon the cover in a liquid form that is subsequently cured. This results in the gasket having a solid generally circular cross section. The screws must be highly torqued so as to compress the gasket in order to achieve an adequate seal. There is a need in the art for an improved gasket configuration for use with a disk drive in comparison to the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a disk drive. The disk drive includes a disk drive base and a cover engaged with the disk drive base. The disk drive further includes a formed-in-place gasket disposed between the disk drive base and the cover. The formed-in-place gasket is formed of a cured elastomer having a cross-sectional cavity for allowing the formed-in-place gasket to compress upon engagement of the cover and the disk drive base.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to various embodiments, the formed-in-place gasket may be formed upon the cover. The formed-in-place gasket may be formed of a UV cured material. The formed-in-place gasket may be formed of a urethane acrylate material or a silicon material for examples. The cross-sectional cavity may be a closed cavity. The cross sectional cavity may be an open cavity. The cross-sectional cavity may be generally C-shaped. The formed-in-place gasket may include a cover side and a base side with the cross-sectional cavity being disposed between the cover and base sides, and the cover side may be disposed adjacent the cover with the base side disposed adjacent the disk drive base.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cover for use with a disk drive. The cover includes the formed-in-place gasket as described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating preferred embodiments of the present invention only, and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> illustrate a disk drive including a formed-in-place gasket in accordance with aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is depicted an exploded perspective view of a disk drive <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. In the embodiment shown, the disk drive <b>10</b> includes a head disk assembly (HDA) <b>12</b> and a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) <b>14</b>. The head disk assembly <b>12</b> includes a housing which may include a disk drive base <b>16</b> and a cover <b>18</b> that collectively house magnetic disks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Each magnetic disk <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> contains a plurality of tracks for storing data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The head disk assembly <b>12</b> further includes a spindle motor <b>24</b> for rotating the magnetic disks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> about an axis of rotation <b>26</b>. The head disk assembly <b>12</b> further includes a head stack assembly <b>28</b> that rotates between limited positions about a pivot axis <b>30</b>. The head stack assembly <b>28</b> includes a plurality of actuator arms, the lowermost one of which being denoted <b>32</b>. A plurality of air bearing sliders, the lowermost one being denoted <b>34</b>, are distally supported by the actuator arms <b>32</b> respectively adjacent the disks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Each air bearing slider <b>34</b> includes a transducer head for reading and writing data from and to the disks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided the disk drive <b>10</b>. The disk drive <b>10</b> includes the disk drive base <b>16</b> and the cover <b>18</b> engaged with the disk drive base <b>16</b>. The cover <b>18</b> includes a cover main body <b>36</b> with top and bottom sides <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> there are respectively depicted enlarged top and bottom plan views of the cover <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The disk drive <b>10</b> further includes a formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> disposed between the disk drive base <b>16</b> and the cover <b>18</b>. The formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> is formed of a cured elastomer having a cross-sectional cavity <b>44</b> for allowing the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> to compress upon engagement of the cover <b>18</b> and the disk drive base <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a portion of the cover <b>18</b> and the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> as seen along axis <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As an example of a method for forming the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b>, there is depicted an enlarged perspective view of a nozzle tip <b>46</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The nozzle tip <b>46</b> includes a dispensing port <b>48</b> and a UV light source <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of the nozzle tip <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The nozzle tip <b>46</b> is depicted dispensing an elastomer <b>52</b> from the dispensing port <b>48</b> upon a portion of the bottom side <b>40</b> of the cover <b>18</b>. The formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> may be formed of a UV cured material. In this regard, upon being dispensed from the nozzle tip <b>46</b>, the UV light source <b>50</b> may be used to selectively cure the exposed portion of the elastomer <b>52</b> to form the cross-sectional cavity <b>44</b>. This allows the elastomer <b>52</b> to have integrity of shape to maintain the cross-sectional cavity <b>44</b> while also being in a liquid or semi-liquid form facilitating placement and adhesion to the cover <b>18</b>. Subsequently, the dispensed elastomer <b>52</b> may be entirely cured to complete the forming of the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As such, the term formed-in-place refers to the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> being formed at a location in relation to the cover <b>18</b> and/or the disk drive base <b>16</b> where the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> is intended to be disposed during installation. As the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> is to be disposed between the disk drive base <b>16</b> and the cover <b>18</b>, being disposed upon either the disk drive base <b>16</b> or the cover <b>18</b> would be appropriate. In the example shown, the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> is formed upon the cover <b>18</b>. This would be in contrast to being separately formed such as a molded piece of material that is first formed and then attached. In this regard, the formed-in-place manufacturing technique is considered to be relatively more economically efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> may be formed of a urethane acrylate material or a silicon material for examples. Additionally, other materials and techniques used to form the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> may be chosen from those which are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> there is depicted the enlarged cross-sectional view of the portion of the cover <b>18</b> and the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shown in a flipped configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the portion of the cover <b>18</b> and the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as shown in relation to a portion of the disk drive base <b>16</b> with the cover <b>18</b> installed. As is shown, the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> is compressed. In this regard, such compression is in a direction between the cover <b>18</b> and the disk drive base <b>16</b> for sealing the interface therebetween. It is contemplated that fasteners, such as screws, may be used to engage the cover <b>18</b> to the disk drive base <b>16</b>. Thus, a torquing of the screws would compress the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> with the cross-sectional cavity <b>44</b> collapsing or at least partially collapsing upon itself.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cross-sectional cavity <b>44</b> may be an open cavity. As depicted, the cross-sectional cavity <b>44</b> may be generally C-shaped. In this regard, a C-shape is observed when a cross-sectional cut is made lateral to the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b> and viewed longitudinally along the formed-in-place gasket <b>42</b>.
