<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fluid filter, a drain mechanism thereof, a draining jig used in the fluid filter and a draining method of the fluid filter. The present invention more particularly relates to a fluid filter, a drain mechanism thereof, a draining jig used in the fluid filter and a draining method of the fluid filter, in which a heated fluid is not splashed on a worker at a time of discharging the fluid such as a time of exchanging an element, and can maintain a high reliability in sealing a drain hole for a long time period while inhibiting dusts or the like from being mixed from an external portion at a time of normal use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention can be widely used, for example, in an oil filter for filtering foreign materials, abraded powders, carbon and the like mixed in an oil lubricating an internal combustion engine, a fuel filter and a field relevant thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, as a fluid filter, there has been generally known, for example, an element replacement type fluid filter in which a filter element is replaced at a time when a filter media is clogged after a predetermined time has passed and reaches a service life.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a drain mechanism of the element replacement type fluid filter, there has been known, for example, a structure in which a drain member (a drain plug <b>15</b>) is screwed with a drain hole formed in a cap (a lower case <b>12</b>) (refer to a patent document 1). Accordingly, it is possible to detach the drain member from the drain hole by loosening the drain member so as to leave open the drain hole prior to separating the case and the cap by canceling the engagement between both the elements, thereby discharging a residual oil in an inner portion of the housing from the drain hole.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this case, in the fluid filter for filtering an engine oil for a vehicle, an engine is frequently warmed up at a time of replacing the filter element, and the oil is in a heated state.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the conventional drain mechanism, discharging the residual oil at a time of replacing the filter element is performed by detaching the drain member from the cap. In other words, at the same time when the drain member is loosened, and a sealing of a seal member (a packing <b>15</b><i>a</i>) for the drain member is cancelled, discharging the residual oil is started. As a result, there is generated a disadvantage that the heated residual oil overflows during a detaching operation of the drain member, and is splashed on hands of the worker.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently, as the conventional drain mechanism of the fluid filter for solving the problem mentioned above, there has been known, for example, a structure in which a tubular drain pipe member (a drain plug <b>15</b>) having a drain passage (a center hole <b>15</b><i>g </i>and a window hole <b>15</b><i>f</i>) is screwed with a drain hole formed in a cap (a lower case <b>12</b>) (refer to a patent document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The drain passage of the drain pipe member and the inner portion of the housing are sealed by a pair of seal members (the packing <b>15</b><i>g</i>) attached to an outer periphery of the drain pipe member, at a time of normally using the fluid filter. Further, when replacing the filter element, the sealing of the upper seal member is cancelled by loosening the drain pipe member, the drain passage of the drain pipe member and the inner portion of the housing are communicated with each other, and the residual oil within the housing is discharged via the drain passage.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the residual oil is discharged via the drain passage of the drain pipe member in the manner mentioned above, it is possible to prevent the oil in the middle of the discharging from being splashed on the hands of the worker.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this case, when the seal of the upper seal member is cancelled by loosening the drain pipe member, the seal of the lower seal member is maintained, so that the residual oil does not leak out from the other portions than the drain passage of the drain pipe member at a time of discharging the residual oil.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-104408</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, in the drain mechanism of the conventional fluid filter, since the drain pipe member is formed in the hollow shape and is structured such as to have the drain passage, dusts or the like such as sediments or mud or the like is mixed into the inner portion of the cap through the drain passage of the drain pipe member from the external portion, during a normal use of the fluid filter, so that it is hard to secure a reliability of seal in the drain hole achieved by the seal member.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As mentioned above, the present invention is made by taking the actual condition mentioned above into consideration, and an object of the present invention is to provide a drain mechanism of a fluid filter in which a heated fluid is not splashed on a worker at a time of discharging the fluid such as a time of exchanging an element, and can maintain a high reliability in sealing a drain hole for a long time period while inhibiting dusts or the like from being mixed from an external portion at a time of normal use.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A drain hole <b>15</b> having a female screw <b>15</b><i>a </i>formed in an inner periphery thereof is provided in a center of the bottom portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the cap <b>3</b>. Further, an O-ring <b>17</b> (exemplified as a seal member) is attached to a lower end portion of the bottom portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the cap <b>3</b> so as to surround the drain hole <b>15</b>. Further, an annular cap projection portion <b>18</b> (exemplified as an engaged portion) is provided in an upper end portion of the bottom portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the cap <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, a description will be given of the drain mechanism <b>7</b>. The drain mechanism <b>7</b> is basically provided, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, with a metal drain bolt <b>20</b> (exemplified as a drain member), a metal valve member <b>21</b> and a spring <b>11</b> (exemplified as an elastic means). The drain bolt <b>20</b> has a plug portion <b>22</b> having a male screw <b>22</b><i>a </i>formed therein, and a flange portion <b>23</b> connected to a lower portion of the plug portion <b>22</b>. Further, when engaging a male screw <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the drain bolt <b>20</b> with the female screw <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the drain hole <b>15</b> so as to screw the drain bolt <b>20</b> into the drain hole <b>15</b>, the flange portion <b>23</b> of the drain bolt <b>20</b> is pressure contacted against the O-ring <b>17</b> and the drain hole <b>15</b> is sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The valve member <b>21</b> is formed in a socket shape as a whole, and has a contact portion <b>25</b> brought into contact with an outer peripheral surface of the cap projection portion <b>18</b>. The contact portion <b>25</b> of the valve member <b>21</b> is normally brought into contact with the cap projection portion <b>18</b> on the basis of the energizing force of the spring <b>11</b>, and the drain hole <b>15</b> is sealed by metal. Accordingly, even in a state in which the drain bolt <b>20</b> is detached from the drain hole <b>15</b>, only a small amount of residual oil within the housing <b>4</b> is flowed out to the outer portion from the drain hole <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(2) Structure of Draining Jig</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Next, a description will be given of the draining jig <b>30</b>. The draining jig <b>30</b> is made of a synthetic resin and is formed in a tubular shape as a whole, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The draining jig <b>30</b> has a pipe-shaped portion <b>31</b> having both ends opened, an engaging portion <b>32</b> provided in an upper end portion of the pipe-shaped portion <b>31</b> and having an outward bulged shape, and a socket-shaped flange portion <b>33</b> provided in an intermediate portion of the pipe-shaped portion <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the pipe-shaped portion <b>31</b>, there is formed a drain passage <b>35</b> constituted by a center hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>(exemplified as a center passage), and a plurality of slits <b>35</b><i>b </i>(exemplified as a communication passage) notched from an upper end of the center hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>toward a lower side. Further, the engaging portion <b>32</b> can be engaged with and disengaged from the cap projection portion <b>18</b> accompanying with an elastic deformation generated by the slits <b>35</b><i>b</i>, and can fix the draining jig <b>30</b> to the cap <b>3</b> and cancel the fixing. Further, the flange portion <b>33</b> of the draining jig <b>30</b> is pressure contacted with the O-ring <b>17</b> of the cap <b>3</b> so as to be sealed, under a state in which the draining jig <b>30</b> is fixed to the cap <b>3</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(3) Operation of Oil Filter</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, a description will be given of an operation of the oil filter <b>1</b>. At a time when the oil filter <b>1</b> is normally used, the drain bolt <b>20</b> is mounted to the drain hole <b>15</b> of the cap <b>3</b> via the O-ring <b>17</b>, and the drain hole <b>15</b> is sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, at a time of replacing the filter element <b>5</b>, the O-rings <b>9</b> and <b>17</b> and the like, the worker first loosens the drain bolt <b>20</b> and detaches the drain bolt <b>20</b> from the drain hole <b>15</b>. At this time, since the contact portion <b>25</b> of the valve member <b>21</b> is brought into contact with the cap projection portion <b>18</b> on the basis of the energizing force of the spring <b>11</b> so as to be sealed by metal seal, the residual oil within the housing <b>4</b> does not flow out to the outer portion from the drain hole <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thereafter, the worker inserts the draining jig <b>30</b> to the drain hole <b>15</b>, and pushes up the valve member <b>21</b> by the upper end surface of the engaging portion <b>32</b> against the energizing force of the spring <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the seal of the drain hole <b>15</b> achieved by the valve member <b>21</b> is cancelled, and the residual oil within the housing <b>4</b> is discharged to the outer portion via the slits <b>35</b><i>b </i>and the center hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>in the draining jig <b>30</b>. In this case, the engaging portion <b>32</b> of the draining jig <b>30</b> is engaged with the cap projection portion <b>18</b> by inserting the draining jig <b>30</b> to the drain hole <b>15</b> accompanying with the elastic deformation, and the draining jig <b>30</b> is fixed to the cap <b>3</b>. Further, in this fixed state, the flange portion <b>33</b> of the draining jig <b>30</b> is pressure contacted with the O-ring <b>17</b> provided in the bottom portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the cap <b>3</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thereafter, the worker pulls out the cap <b>3</b> from the draining jig <b>30</b> at a time when the residual oil within the housing <b>4</b> is discharged, and loosens the cap <b>3</b> by using an attaching and detaching jig (not shown) so as to separate the cap <b>3</b> from the case <b>2</b>, whereby a replacing work of the filter element <b>5</b>, the O-rings <b>9</b> and <b>17</b> and the like is performed.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(4) Effect of Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As mentioned above, in accordance with the present embodiments, since the drain bolt <b>20</b> is screwed with the drain hole <b>15</b> and the drain hole <b>15</b> is completely closed at a time when the oil filter <b>1</b> is normally used, the dusts such as the sediment, the mud and the like are not mixed into the inner portion of the housing <b>4</b> via the drain hole <b>15</b> from the external portion, and it is possible to maintain a high sealing reliability of the O-ring <b>17</b> for a long time period. Further, at a time of replacing the element, since the residual oil is discharged by using the draining jig <b>30</b> prior to the separating work between the case <b>2</b> and the cap <b>3</b>, it is possible to prevent the heated oil from being splashed on the worker at a time of discharging the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, in accordance with the present embodiment, since the draining jig <b>30</b> can be fixed to the cap <b>3</b> and cancelled the fixing on the basis of the attaching and detaching work between the engaging portion <b>32</b> of the draining jig <b>30</b> and the cap projection portion <b>18</b>, it is possible to fix the draining jig <b>30</b> to the cap <b>3</b> at a time of discharging the oil, and it is possible to improve a workability thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, in accordance with the present embodiment, since the flange portion <b>33</b> of the draining jig <b>30</b> is pressure contacted with the O-ring <b>17</b> of the cap <b>3</b> so as to seal, in a state in which the draining jig <b>30</b> is fixed to the cap <b>3</b>, it is possible to more securely prevent the fluid from flowing out to the outer portion from the other portions than the drain passage <b>35</b> of the draining jig <b>30</b> at a time of discharging the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this case, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments mentioned above, and can be applied to variously modified embodiments within the scope of the present invention in correspondence to various objects and applications. In other words, in the embodiments mentioned above, the structure is made such that the oil is discharged to the oil receiving plate or the like placed below the draining jig <b>30</b> from the lower end opening of the draining jig <b>30</b>, however, the structure is not limited to this. For example, the structure is made such that a connection portion <b>37</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) having an outward bulged shape and provided in the lower end portion of the draining jig <b>30</b> is connected to one end of an oil discharging hose (not shown), and the oil is discharged via the hose. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the oil from being scattered at a time of discharging the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, in the embodiments mentioned above, the draining jig <b>30</b> is exemplified as a jig having an exclusive use of draining, however, the structure is not limited. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the structure may be made such that a draining jig <b>42</b> is integrally provided in an attaching and detaching jig <b>38</b> for attaching and detaching the cap <b>3</b> with respect to the case <b>2</b> so as to structure the draining jig. Accordingly, it is possible to discharge the oil and the separate the cap <b>3</b> from the case in accordance with a series of works.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, in the embodiment mentioned above, the metal seal caused by the contact between the contact portion <b>25</b> of the valve member <b>21</b> and the cap projection portion <b>18</b> is employed, however, the structure is not limited to this. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an internal seal may be achieved by an O-ring <b>41</b> attached to the valve member <b>40</b>.</p>
