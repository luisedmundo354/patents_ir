<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plasma display panels and methods of driving such panels are known in the art. Plasma display panels are matrix devices comprising individual cells defined by the intersection of rows and columns. The structure of a panel <b>1</b> as known from EP 0 762 373 is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a front view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>are a detailed perspective view and a side view, respectively, of a single cell <b>2</b>. The panel comprises a front plate <b>3</b>, made of a transparent material, and a back plate <b>4</b>. A first set of parallel address electrodes <b>5</b> a<b>1</b>, a<b>2</b>, a<b>3</b>, . . . , an, an+1 . . . are located in a direction perpendicular to the first direction on the back plate. Barrier ribs <b>6</b>, located parallel to the address electrodes <b>5</b>, also on the back plate <b>4</b>, perform the function of separating cells <b>2</b> from neighboring columns. A second set of electrodes comprises common electrodes <b>7</b> and scan electrodes <b>8</b>. These electrodes are located on the front plate <b>3</b>, facing the address electrodes <b>5</b> on the back plate <b>4</b>. The common electrodes <b>7</b> are in this example divided into two groups, that is c<b>1</b> and c<b>2</b>. The scan electrodes <b>8</b> s<b>1</b>, s<b>2</b>, s<b>3</b> . . . are separately addressable. Said second set of electrodes is oriented in a first, in this figure the horizontal direction, which is substantially orthogonal to the address electrodes <b>5</b>. Phosphors <b>9</b> deposited on the back plate <b>4</b> perform the function of converting ultraviolet light UV, produced by a gas discharge GD between a common electrode <b>7</b> and a scan electrode <b>8</b>, into visible light VL. Light of the desired color, e.g. red, green, blue, is produced by selecting different types of phosphors <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common electrodes and scan electrodes known in the art may be formed of a metallic part <b>10</b> and a transparent part <b>11</b>. The metallic part <b>10</b> ensures the conduction of the current flowing through the electrode. Via the conductive transparent part <b>11</b> the voltages applied to the electrode are present across the desired areas of the cells <b>2</b>. The transparent parts <b>11</b> may be made of a thin layer of metal oxides (ITO).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On display of successive picture frames on such a plasma display panel <b>1</b>, a frame is divided into an odd field and a subsequent, even field. Odd rows, i.e. rows between electrodes c<b>1</b> and s<b>1</b>, c<b>2</b> and s<b>2</b>, c<b>1</b> and s<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, produce light during an odd field, and even rows, i.e. rows between electrodes s<b>1</b> and c<b>2</b>, s<b>2</b> and c<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, produce light during an even field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In known plasma display panels, each column requires one address electrode. A VGA display, comprising 640 columns, requires 1920 address electrodes (one for each color). Increasing the picture resolution by adding columns further increases the number of address electrodes and, therefore, the cost of the panel and the associated driving electronics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the invention to provide a plasma display panel with a reduced number of electrodes, thus reducing costs while enabling a good peak brightness, nevertheless.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the invention to provide a plasma display panel device having a plasma display panel with a reduced number of electrodes and which enables a good peak brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention provides a plasma display panel as defined in claim <b>1</b>. An address electrode extends over more than one column, covering at least a part of a cell in a first column in one row, and at least a part of a cell in another column in the row immediately below, no other address electrode extending over the cell immediately below the first cell, nor over the cell immediately above the second cell. The number of address electrodes is thereby reduced by half with respect to a plasma display panel of the known type. The number of column drivers is also reduced by a factor of two, so the total cost reduction is substantial. The plasma display panel appears as a checkerboard, where one cell out of every two cells is addressable. In addition in a plasma display panel in accordance with the invention each cell has a neighbor-cell of the same color, on the same address electrode but in an neighboring column and in a neighboring row. The term neighboring is used to indicate that a column or row does not have to be next to another column, respectively row, but that a few other columns, respectively rows may be positioned inbetween. The term adjacent is used to indicate that there are no other columns rows inbetween two adjacent columns, respectively two adjacent rows.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This allows the plasma display panel to be used in combination with a driving circuit for addressing the cells in sub-fields, which circuit is arranged such that in at least one of the sub-fields said neighboring cells are addressed simultaneously. Two cells (in different columns and in different rows) can now be addressed simultaneously, which reduces the address time and thereby increases the sustain time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The plasma display panel device in accordance with the invention comprises a plasma display panel as defined in claim <b>1</b> and has a driving circuit which is arranged such that in at least one of the sub-fields said neighboring cells are addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For matrix display panel types as described above, the generation of light cannot be modulated in intensity so as to create different levels of gray scale, as is the case for CRT displays. On said matrix display panel types, gray levels are created by modulating in time: for higher intensities, the duration of the light emission period is increased. The luminance data are coded in a set of sub-fields, each having an appropriate duration or weight for displaying a range of light intensities between a zero and a maximum level. Different combinations of sub-fields result in different grey levels. Such a sub-field decomposition, described here for grey scales, will also apply hereinafter to the individual colors of a color display.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to reduce the time necessary for displaying a frame, a multiple row addressing method may be applied. In this method, more than one, usually two, neighboring and preferably adjacent rows are simultaneously addressed, thereby receiving and displaying the same data.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This so-called double-line addressing method (when two lines are simultaneously addressed) effectively allows for more time for light emission and/or speed-up of the addressing of a frame, because each frame requires less addressing actions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to reduce loss of resolution, while still gaining time, line doubling can be done for only some sub-fields. The resulting Partial Line Doubling (PLD) will then give less loss in resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Within the framework of the invention both line doubling as well as PLD are possible; preferably, however, PLD is performed, that is, preferably for a number of least-significant bits.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment the common electrodes and scan electrodes comprise a conductive, preferably metallic part and a set of transparent parts. These transparent parts are formed in such a way as to allow discharges in one out of every two cells of the panel, that is, in a checkerboard fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The transparent parts may be made of areas of a thin layer of metal oxide (ITO). In a further preferred embodiment the common electrodes and scan electrodes have transparent parts made of areas of a thin metal grid. This has the advantage that the production of the conductive, preferably metallic part and the transparent parts of an electrode may be performed in a single process step.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Address electrodes formed as straight strips underneath one out of every two barrier ribs are especially easy to produce and are also robust. The layout of the transparent parts in a checkerboard fashion ensures that only the desired cells produce light.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Zigzag address electrodes may reach cells in adjacent columns in each successive row and still remain narrow. Narrow electrodes have the advantage of a reduced capacitance and, therefore, require less power. The period of the zigzag electrodes may encompass two or more rows. The address electrodes may even be formed in diagonals across the whole height of the panel. Zigzag electrodes have the additional advantage that they only cover cells where a discharge is desired, thereby reducing the risk of spurious discharges.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The transparent parts of common electrodes and scan electrodes may extend slightly over the cell immediately above, or below, in the same column. The discharge space is thereby extended further in the vertical direction. This increases the part of the surface of the panel that produces light, and thereby increases the brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The transparent parts may extend over only part of the width of a cell. The capacity of the electrodes is thereby reduced, and the currents required to drive the panel are reduced accordingly. The transparent parts may have a wider portion near the gap. This improves the quality of a discharge occurring between said pair of transparent parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The two transparent parts may extend side by side, the gap between said two transparent parts extending vertically over said cell. The surface gas discharge between said two transparent parts occurs over an increased gap length and is thereby improved.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The address electrodes may comprise an extension extending substantially over the gap. This extension increases the coverage of the address electrodes to the desired cells. These extensions may be applied to straight address electrodes as well as to zigzag address electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment the barrier ribs have a shape forming enlarged cells used for producing light, i.e. forming active cells, and cells of reduced width remaining unlit, i.e. inactive cells. The ratio of light producing area to unlit area is thereby increased, and the brightness of the panel is significantly improved. Address electrodes in this embodiment may be of the straight type or of the zigzag type. The cells of reduced width may be reduced to nil area or nearly nil area.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The transparent parts of the common and scan electrodes may be formed as continuous strips. The production cost of the panel is thereby reduced. No precise alignment in the horizontal direction of the front plate with respect to the back plate is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">By having columns at an angle different from 90° with respect to the first direction, a pattern of cells may be obtained, wherein all cells in a column are of a same color. This is easier to manufacture as in a column between two barrier ribs only one color of phosphor has to be applied.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B have already been described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A plasma display panel <b>12</b> with a standard phosphor pattern is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and a plasma display panel <b>12</b> according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Common electrodes <b>7</b> C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> and, alternating therewith, scan electrodes <b>8</b> S<b>1</b>,S<b>2</b>,S<b>3</b> extend in a horizontal direction. Address electrodes <b>5</b> A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b> are formed as strips on the back plate for one out of every two columns. Barrier ribs <b>6</b> are formed on the back plate, one out of every two barrier ribs <b>6</b> being formed above an address electrode <b>5</b>. The widths of the address electrodes <b>5</b> and of the barrier ribs <b>6</b> are such that an address electrode <b>5</b> A<b>1</b> . . . A<b>4</b> appears on both sides of the barrier rib <b>6</b>. Common electrodes <b>7</b> and scan electrodes <b>8</b> comprise transparent parts <b>11</b> extending over one out of every two cells <b>2</b> in a checkerboard fashion. The voltage applied to an address electrode <b>5</b> during the addressing phase is thus applied to two neighboring cells of a row being scanned. The transparent parts of the common electrodes <b>7</b> and the scan electrodes <b>8</b> being scanned ensure that a write discharge occurs only in the cell being covered by transparent parts <b>11</b> and not in the neighboring cell. The address electrode <b>5</b> A<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be considered as the fusion of the address electrodes <b>5</b> a<b>1</b> and a<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the address electrode <b>5</b> A<b>2</b> as the fusion of a<b>3</b>, a<b>4</b> etc. . . . The voltage to be applied to the electrode A<b>1</b> is the one applied to a<b>1</b> during the scanning of odd rows, and the one applied to a<b>2</b> during the scanning of even rows.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows how the odd common electrodes <b>7</b> C<b>1</b> are connected to a single driver, and the even common electrodes <b>7</b> C<b>2</b> are connected to another single driver. Each scan electrode <b>8</b> S<b>1</b>,S<b>2</b>,S<b>3</b>,S<b>4</b>,S<b>5</b> is connected to a single driver.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">This novel layout for Plasma Display Panels (PDPs) reduces the required number of address electrodes by a factor of two. The number of column drivers is also reduced by a factor of two, so the total cost reduction is substantial. This holds for both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. However, when combining a standard phosphor pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> with Partial Line Doubling (PLD), the image quality will not be optimal. As the pattern of cells with a different color, for example, red, green and blue as indicated by the respective letters R, G and B is considerably shifted between two adjacent rows, partially line doubling would result in image quality reduction when applied to two adjacent rows. In this case it would be more appropriate to apply PLD to, for example, two subsequent even rows or two subsequent odd rows. However, as the distance between two such rows is larger there will be some reduction of image quality, when applying PLD. If no PLD would be applied, then the resulting relatively large address time implies that less time is available for light output, thus leading to a lower peak brightness. In a plasma display panel in accordance with the invention, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, each cell has a neighbor cell with the same color, on the same address electrode but in an adjacent column and in an adjacent row, whereas when standard phosphor pattern lay-outs are used, neighboring cells in adjacent rows have a different color. Using the standard phosphor pattern each cell has a neighboring cell of a different color, i.e. along a addressing electrode the sequence of cells is R-G-R-G-R and B-R-B-R-B and G-B-G-B-G. In a plasma display panel in accordance with the invention the phosphor elements along an addressing electrode are arranged as R-R-G-G-R-R etc. Thus, each cell has a neighbor cell of the same color on the same-address in an adjacent column and in an adjacent row (rows are also called lines). This allows a reduction of the time-required for addressing the cells by applying PLD or Bit Line Repeat (BLR). As example of pairs of cells to which PLD may be applied, several pairs R<b>1</b>,R<b>2</b>; G<b>1</b>,G<b>2</b>; and B<b>1</b>,B<b>2</b> are indicated, an ellips being drawn around a pair R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows different periods during a frame time. Plasma Display Panels consist of cells in three primary colors; red green and blue. These cells are either on or off. To display multiple gray levels, the principle of pulse-width modulation is used. The total frame time is divided into a number of so-called subfields. These subfields are of different duration. In each subfield a cell is either on or off. Different gray levels can be formed by selecting an appropriate combination of subfields to emit light All cells in the entire screen behave in the same way; per subfield it is decided for each cell whether it should emit light. These cells are now addressed on a line-at-a-time basis, on the vertical address electrodes, the information is set for the first line. Then a pulse is applied to the horizontal electrodes to actually address the first line. Subsequently, the information on the address electrodes is changed to depict the second line, etc. Because of this principle, the addressing of an entire panel takes quite some time.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows all parts of a single frame time; the black rectangles stand for the erasing periods, the gray triangles for the addressing periods and the white rectangles for the sustaining periods. Addressing takes quite some time, that is, usually some 60-70% of the total frame time. Light is emitted only in the sustain phases. It can also be seen that a reduced addressing time leaves more time available for sustaining, i.e. light emission. The present invention allows for such a reduction of the addressing time since each cell has a neighboring cell of the same color on the same addressing electrode in a neighboring row.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6G</figref> show different realizations of the transparent parts <b>11</b> of the electrodes in a plasma display panel according to the invention. In the realization of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the transparent parts <b>11</b> extend partly over the cell immediately above or below. The light-producing area is thereby enlarged, and the brightness is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B to 6E</figref> show embodiments where the address electrodes <b>5</b> extend over only part of the width of a cell. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the narrow address electrodes <b>5</b> have a wider part near the gap <b>13</b>. All embodiments shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6D to 6G</figref> allow an increase of the length of the gap <b>13</b>. The surface gas discharge between the scan electrodes <b>8</b> and the common electrodes <b>7</b> is thereby improved.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show embodiments wherein the address electrodes <b>5</b> have a zigzag shape. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the vertical periodicity of the zigzag is two rows, whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> it is four rows. Other realizations are also possible, including the case where the address electrodes <b>5</b> are straight lines extending diagonally from the top to the bottom of the panel, provided that one out of every two cells of the panel is traversed by an address electrode <b>5</b> in a checkerboard fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the address electrodes <b>5</b> comprise extensions <b>14</b>. These extensions <b>14</b> partly cover one out of every two cells with transparent parts <b>11</b>, and preferably also the gap <b>13</b> area between the two transparent parts <b>11</b>. The principal part of the address electrodes <b>5</b> may then be narrower and even be completely covered by the barrier ribs <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a preferred embodiment of the invention. The barrier ribs <b>6</b> are formed in such a shape that the columns have widths varying between a first width and a second width. Odd columns have the larger width <b>15</b> over odd rows, and the smaller width <b>16</b> over even rows, and even columns have the larger width over even rows and the smaller width over odd rows. The panel <b>12</b> thus has the overall structure of a honeycomb. The address electrodes <b>5</b> are in this exemplary embodiment straight vertical strips. The larger column width, the smaller column width and the width of the address electrodes <b>5</b> are such that only the cells where light production is desired are partly covered by the address electrodes <b>5</b>. The narrower cells are not covered by an address electrode <b>5</b>. The transparent parts <b>11</b> may then extend also over cells where no light production is desired and be formed as simple straight strips along the length of the scan electrodes and the common electrodes. This embodiment has the advantage of a much higher brightness. The common electrodes and scan electrodes may also be formed by a set of horizontal thin lines linked by vertical lines, thereby forming strips of a metallic thin grid.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When applying the invention to a RGB display, a pixel, i.e. the combination of a red cell, a green cell, and a blue cell, has the shape of a triangle in the examples shown. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, when considering a pair of rows, one finds a first RGB triangle having its top facing down, followed by an adjacent triangle having its top facing up. This gives the a so-called delta-nabla structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> explicitly shows two such triangles.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it will be understood that modifications thereof within the scope of the principles outlined above will be evident to those skilled in the art; therefore, the invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments but is intended to encompass such modifications. The horizontal and vertical directions may be interchanged. Although the invention has been described with reference to a color display using three colors (red, green blue), the invention may be applied to displays using other color combinations. The invention is embodied in each new characteristic and each combination of characteristics. Any reference signs do not limit the scope of the claims. The word “comprising” does not exclude the presence of other elements than those listed in a claim. Use of the word “a” or “an” preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to good advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For the sake of clarity, the drawings show a limited number of rows and columns. The invention, however, applies to plasma display panels having larger numbers of rows and columns. The ‘column direction’ is herein for the sake of clarity described as the ‘vertical direction’ and the ‘row or line direction’ as the horizontal direction. The examples shown in previous figures have delta-nabla structures; the invention is, however, not restricted to such structures only. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows and example in which the phosphor elements are arranged such that phosphor elements of one color are arranged in parallel diagonal lines; in this example the pixels form rectangles, one of which is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The barrier ribs <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are positioned under an angle of substantially 90<sup>0 </sup>with respect to the first direction. The barrier ribs <b>6</b> may also be positioned under an angle different from 90° with respect to the first direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The advantage compared to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is that in a column between two barrier ribs <b>6</b> phosphor of only one color is present, which is easier to manufacture. The different colors are indicated with the letters R, G, B.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows another embodiment of the invention, having barrier ribs <b>6</b> positioned under an angle. Again, between two barrier ribs <b>6</b> phosphor of only one color is present. However, compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> the address electrodes A<b>1</b> . . . A<b>4</b> extend via a zigzag shape in a direction substantially perpendicular to the common electrodes C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>. This embodiment provides again a delta-nabla pixel structure as indicated with two triangles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Yet another embodiment with barrier ribs <b>6</b> positioned under an angle, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Each of the address electrodes A<b>1</b> . . . A<b>4</b> extends over two cells of a same color in two successive odd rows as well as over two cell of a same color (which color may be different from the color of the two cells in the odd rows) in two successive odd rows. This address electrode structure is easy to manufacture. PLD may be applied by simultaneously addressing pairs of successive even rows or pairs of successive odd rows.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Finally <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates schematically a plasma panel display device in accordance with the invention. The plasma panel display device <b>17</b> comprises a plasma display panel <b>1</b> and a driving circuit (<b>22</b>), in this example comprising an address driver (<b>19</b>), a y-driver (<b>20</b>), an X-driver (<b>21</b>) and a control circuit (<b>18</b>) coupled to the drivers. The driving circuit <b>22</b> is-arranged such that Partial Line Doubling (PLD) or line doubling or Bit Line Repeat (BLR),is performed, i.e. in or for at least one of the sub-fields, said neighboring cells (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>; G<b>1</b>,G<b>2</b>; B<b>1</b>,B<b>2</b>) being addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">‘Plasma display panel device’ encompasses within the framework of the invention any device having the mentioned elements, whether it is a TV set having a plasma display panel and driving circuits separate from the display panel, or a module comprised of a display panel to which a driving circuit is attached or physically coupled or integrated or any other type of device.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The invention can be summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The invention relates to an AC plasma display panel (<b>12</b>) of the surface discharge type, and more specifically to the structure of the address electrodes (<b>5</b>) of said panel and of the phosphor elements, and to a display panel device comprising such a panel. According to the invention, only one address electrode (<b>5</b>) is used for one out of every two columns. Scan electrodes (<b>8</b>) and common (<b>7</b>) electrodes may comprise transparent parts (<b>11</b>). These parts (<b>11</b>) may extend over one out every two cells in a checkerboard fashion. In a preferred embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the columns may have alternating wide (<b>15</b>) and narrow (<b>16</b>) cells (<b>2</b>). Furthermore, each cell has a neighbor-cell of the same color, on the same address electrode but in an adjacent column and in an adjacent row. The display panel device comprises a driving circuit (<b>22</b>) for addressing the cells arranged such that in at least some of the sub-fields said neighboring cells are addressed simultaneously.</p>
