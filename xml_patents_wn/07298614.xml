<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Several chassis-based, modular computer systems target server-based applications, such as the IBM BladeCenter™ computer systems. Currently, such server-based computer systems limit support for telephone company (telco) style interfaces, thereby limiting the integration of server-based platforms with the processing of telephony data. Currently, these same server-based computer systems limit support for front panel input/output (I/O) due to air filter placement and lack of defined cut-outs in a standards-based way to support front panel I/O. In addition, there is a need, not found in the prior art, to support redundancy and switching of telco traffic within server-based chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a need, not met in the prior art, to allow server-based computer systems to receive and process telephony data through telco I/O interfaces in the rear side of the chassis. Accordingly, there is a significant need for an apparatus that overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art outlined above.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following representative descriptions of the present invention generally relate to exemplary embodiments and the inventor's conception of the best mode, and are not intended to limit the applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description is intended to provide convenient illustrations for implementing various embodiments of the invention. As will become apparent, changes may be made in the function and/or arrangement of any of the elements described in the disclosed exemplary embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For clarity of explanation, the embodiments of the present invention are presented, in part, as comprising individual functional blocks. The functions represented by these blocks may be provided through the use of either shared or dedicated hardware, including, but not limited to, hardware capable of executing software. The present invention is not limited to implementation by any particular set of elements, and the description herein is merely representational of one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Software blocks that perform embodiments of the present invention can be part of computer program modules comprising computer instructions, such control algorithms that are stored in a computer-readable medium such as memory. Computer instructions can instruct processors to perform any methods described below. In other embodiments, additional modules could be provided as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A detailed description of an exemplary application is provided as a specific enabling disclosure that may be generalized to any application of the disclosed system, device and method for an interposer module in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> representatively illustrates a computer system <b>100</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Conventional subrack-based, modular computer systems <b>100</b> have slots for the insertion of payload modules <b>106</b> that add functionality to the computer system <b>100</b>. Payload modules <b>106</b> are designed to plug directly into the backplane of a chassis <b>101</b>. These payload modules <b>106</b> may include processors, memory, storage devices, wireless communication modules, and the like. Carrier modules are payload modules that are designed to have one or more mezzanine modules plugged into them to add even more modular functionality to the computer system <b>100</b>. Mezzanine modules differ from payload modules in that mezzanine modules are not coupled to physically connect directly with the backplane, whereas payload modules function to physically directly connect with the backplane.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The computer chassis <b>101</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a front side <b>112</b> and a rear side <b>114</b> opposite each other. The front side <b>112</b> is disposed to accept a plurality of payload modules <b>106</b>, while the rear side <b>114</b> includes a plurality of switch slots <b>102</b>, each disposed to accept a switch module <b>103</b>. In an embodiment, switch module <b>103</b> may act as a central switching hub with any number of payload modules <b>106</b> coupled to switch module <b>103</b> to form star, dual-star or mesh network. For example, a switch module <b>103</b> may be a central switching hub in a switched fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The computer chassis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be an IBM BladeCenter™ chassis, which may accommodate up to fourteen payload modules via the front side <b>112</b> and include four switch slots <b>102</b> on the rear side <b>114</b>. The IBM BladeCenter™ chassis is primarily a server-based blade chassis, where each payload module <b>106</b> may include multiple two-way servers for use in an Enterprise environment. In the prior art, the IBM BladeCenter™ chassis does not include adequate support for I/O in the front side <b>112</b> because of the position of the blowers (for cooling) and the lack of defined, standards-based cut-outs for I/O interfaces in and around the air filter. Also in the prior art, the IBM BladeCenter™ chassis does not include telephone company (telco) I/O on the rear <b>114</b> of the computer chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, any of plurality of switch slots <b>102</b> is disposed to accept interposer module <b>104</b> in place of a switch module, where the interposer module <b>104</b> functions as a carrier card and allows the coupling of a mezzanine module (not shown for clarity) to the backplane of the chassis. In an embodiment, the mezzanine module may have an I/O interface to allow telephony data to be received by chassis and be processed within the chassis by one or more payload modules <b>106</b>. In an embodiment, two of the switch slots <b>102</b> may have switch modules <b>103</b> in place, while another two switch slots <b>102</b> each have an interposer module <b>104</b> in place as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> representatively illustrates a computer system <b>200</b> in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment shown, computer system <b>200</b> includes a chassis <b>201</b> having a midplane <b>205</b> type backplane, where the midplane <b>205</b> includes a first side <b>208</b> and a second side <b>210</b> opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, chassis <b>201</b> may have a front side <b>212</b> with one or more payload slots <b>213</b>, each coupled to receive a payload module <b>206</b> inserted via the front side <b>212</b>, where the payload module <b>206</b> connects directly to the first side <b>208</b> of the midplane <b>205</b>. In an embodiment, the form factor of payload modules <b>206</b> are 7U, where as known in the art, “U” and multiples of “U” can refer to the length or depth of a payload module <b>206</b>. In an embodiment, “U” can measure approximately 1.75 inches. This is not limiting of the invention as payload modules <b>206</b> may have any form factor and be within the scope of the invention. Chassis <b>201</b> may also have a rear side <b>214</b> with one or more switch slots <b>202</b>, each designed to receive a switch module <b>203</b> inserted via the rear side <b>214</b>, where switch module <b>203</b> connects directly to the second side <b>210</b> of the midplane <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Chassis <b>201</b> is illustrated in plan view with payload modules <b>206</b> mounted vertically, while switch modules <b>203</b> and interposer modules <b>204</b> are mounted horizontally. This is not limiting of the invention as the payload modules <b>206</b>, switch modules <b>203</b> and interposer modules <b>204</b> may be mounted in any horizontal or vertical combination and be within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, chassis <b>201</b> may be an IBM BladeCenter™ chassis as is known in the art. Switch modules <b>203</b> may be the hub, and payload modules <b>206</b> the blades, of a switch fabric <b>250</b> operating on midplane <b>205</b>. In an embodiment, switch fabric <b>250</b> may be implemented by using one or more of a plurality of switch fabric network standards, for example and without limitation, InfiniBand™, Advanced Switching, Serial RapidIO™, FibreChannel™, Ethernet™, Gigabit Ethernet, PCI Express™, Hypertransport™, and the like. Switch fabric <b>250</b> is not limited to the use of these switch fabric network standards and the use of any switched fabric network standard is within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, midplane <b>205</b> comprises plurality of packet-based links capable of transmitting packet-based signals from/to payload modules <b>206</b>, switch modules <b>203</b> and interposer modules <b>204</b>. As an example of an embodiment, each of plurality of packet-based links can comprise two 100-ohm differential signaling pairs per channel. Each channel can use high-speed serialization/deserialization (SERDES) and <b>8</b><i>b</i>/<b>10</b><i>b </i>encoding at speeds up to 3.125 Gigabits per second (Gb/s). This is not limiting of the invention, as each channel may use encoding speeds in excess of 3.125 Gb/s.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The chassis <b>201</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, particularly a BladeCenter™ chassis, has switch slots <b>202</b> that will each accommodate a mezzanine module <b>220</b>. In an embodiment, mezzanine module <b>220</b> may be a Common Mezzanine Card (CMC) having a CMC form factor. CMC form factor, including mechanical dimensions, electrical specifications, and the like, are known in the art and set forth in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard P1386. A particular example of an embodiment of mezzanine module <b>220</b> is a PCI mezzanine card (PMC) as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, mezzanine module <b>220</b> may be an Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) module. The Advanced Mezzanine Card Base Specification (PICMG® AMC.0 RC1.0 and subsequent versions) defines the AMC module including electrical specifications and form factors. AMC modules can be single-width, double-width, full-height, half-height modules or any combination thereof as defined by the AMC specification.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Since there are subtle differences between chassis <b>201</b> and switch slot <b>202</b> designed to accept a switch module <b>203</b>, particularly a BladeCenter chassis, an interposer module <b>204</b> is coupled to bridge the differences and act as an adapter and map the mezzanine module <b>220</b> to the switch slot <b>202</b>. The differences may include connector style, power supply and Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) events (such as power up/down, hotswap, and the like).</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">ATM is short for Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a network technology based on transferring data in cells of a fixed size. The small, constant cell size allows ATM equipment to transmit video, audio, and computer data over the same network, and assure that no single type of data hogs the line. ATM creates a fixed channel, or route, between two points whenever data transfer begins. This differs from TCP/IP, in which messages are divided into packets and each packet can take a different route from source to destination.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, telco I/O interface may include BNC or TNC type connectors. BNC is short for Bayonet Neill Concelman connector that is a type of connector used with coaxial cables such as the RG-58 A/U cable. The basic BNC connector is a male type mounted at each end of a cable. This connector has a center pin connected to the center cable conductor and a metal tube connected to the outer cable shield. A rotating ring outside the tube locks the cable to any female connector. TNC stands for Threaded Neill Concelman and is designed as a threaded version of the BNC. The TNC series features screw threads for mating. TNC are miniature, threaded weatherproof units with a constant 50Ω impedance and they operate from 0-11 GHz. There are two types of TNC connectors: Standard and Reverse Polarity. Reverse polarity is a keying system accomplished with a reverse interface, and ensures that reverse polarity interface connectors do not mate with standard interface connectors.</p>
