<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an in-vehicle speaker mounting structure for mounting a speaker on a vehicle such as an automobile.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, speakers for outputting sound reproduced by an in-vehicle audio system represented by such as an in-vehicle radio and an in-vehicle CD player are mounted on doors and/or a rear parcel shelf inside the passenger compartment of an automobile. A general mounting structure for mounting such speakers on an automobile will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates an example of a conventional in-vehicle speaker mounting structure and shows a case where a speaker unit <b>120</b> is mounted on a door panel <b>104</b> of an automobile. An opening <b>105</b> is formed in the door panel <b>104</b> for mounting the speaker unit <b>120</b> thereon, and four set holes <b>119</b> are formed around this opening <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A grommet <b>102</b> into which a screw <b>103</b> is screwed is fit in each set hole <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When mounting this speaker unit <b>120</b> on the door panel <b>104</b> (hereinafter, this work is also referred to simply as “mounting work”), an operator aligns screw holes <b>120</b><i>a </i>formed in the speaker unit <b>120</b> with the grommets <b>102</b> installed in the set holes <b>119</b>, and passes screws <b>103</b> through the screw holes <b>120</b><i>a </i>for screwing into the grommets <b>102</b> while holding a state in which the speaker unit <b>120</b> is disposed in the opening <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the conventional in-vehicle speaker mounting structure, troublesome and complicated operations are needed to mount the speakers on the vehicle body, resulting in an increase in man-hours for operations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There have been proposed in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structures, and one example is disclosed in JP-A-2001-169374.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the technique disclosed in the JP-A-2001-169374, a speaker unit <b>101</b> is fixed to a speaker unit mounting plate <b>160</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Namely, when mounting the speaker unit <b>101</b> on the speaker unit mounting plate <b>160</b>, the speaker unit <b>101</b> is inserted into a mounting opening <b>170</b> from a front side of the speaker unit mounting plate <b>160</b>. As this occurs, engagement pieces <b>140</b> protruding from a plurality of locations on a rear side of the speaker unit <b>101</b> and an abutment piece <b>150</b> also protruding from a single location on the rear side of the speaker unit <b>101</b> are inserted into engagement piece inserting cut-outs <b>180</b><i>a </i>and an abutment piece inserting cut-out <b>190</b><i>a </i>which are all formed in the speaker unit mounting plate <b>160</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Then, in this state, the speaker unit <b>101</b> is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow Z. As a result, the respective engagement pieces <b>140</b> are guided along inclined portions <b>180</b><i>b </i>for engagement with engagement piece engagement portions <b>180</b><i>c</i>, respectively, whereby the speaker unit <b>101</b> is fixed to the speaker unit mounting plate <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, as a result of the rotation of the speaker unit <b>101</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow Z, the abutment piece <b>150</b> moves from the abutment piece inserting cut-out <b>190</b><i>a </i>to an abutment piece locking cut-out <b>190</b><i>b </i>for engagement therewith via a locking portion <b>190</b><i>c </i>which is a stepped portion. Thus, even when the speaker unit is attempted to be rotated in a reverse direction (a direction reverse to the direction indicated by the arrow Z), the abutment piece <b>150</b> comes into abutment with the locking portion <b>190</b><i>c </i>to thereby prohibit the reverse rotation of the speaker unit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the rotational-mount type speaker disclosed in the JP-A-2001-169374, however, in order to prevent the ingress of rain water and/or dust into the interior of the speaker unit <b>101</b> and an inner part of a door panel <b>201</b> from a gap between the speaker unit <b>101</b> and the door panel <b>201</b>, a tight adhesion needs to be provided between the speaker unit <b>101</b> and the door panel <b>201</b> to provide waterproof and dust proof functions. This requires a strong torque to be applied to the speaker unit <b>101</b> when the speaker is mounted on the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this case, although it is not impossible for workers to manually rotate the speaker unit <b>101</b>, on production lines for mass production, speaker units <b>101</b> have to be mounted on a number of automobiles, and this has caused a problem that the manual mounting work of speakers forces the workers to bear tremendously excessive work load.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention was made in view of the problem and an object of the invention is to provide an in-vehicle speaker mounting structure which can provide good workability at the time of mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure including: a speaker unit having a claw portion and a jig inserting hole; and a panel member on which the speaker unit is mounted, the panel member having a slit, wherein the claw portion is inserted into the slit and the speaker unit is rotated in a circumferential direction so as to mount the speaker unit on the panel member.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure according to an embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a speaker unit (a rotational-mount type speaker unit) <b>1</b> mainly includes a speaker main body <b>11</b>, and a speaker housing (hereinafter, also referred to simply as a “housing”) <b>12</b> adapted for holding the speaker main body <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">This speaker main body <b>11</b> includes a cap <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, a cone (a vibration plate) <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, an edge <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, a damper <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, a voice coil <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>, a plate <b>1</b>-<b>6</b>, a magnet <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> and a yoke <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>. These components constituting the speaker main body <b>11</b> are generally known and therefore the description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, the housing <b>12</b> is integrally molded from a resin, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, three claw portions <b>13</b> are provided on a rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> for fixing the speaker unit <b>1</b> to a door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a substantially triangular opening <b>4</b> is formed in the door inner panel <b>3</b> on which the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted, and three slits <b>5</b> are formed around the perimeter of the opening <b>4</b> at positions corresponding to the claw portions <b>13</b>. The claw portions <b>13</b> and the slits <b>5</b> are formed at intervals of <b>120</b> degrees relative to the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, firstly, the respective claw portions <b>13</b> on the housing <b>12</b> are inserted into the slits <b>5</b>, and thereafter, the housing <b>12</b> is rotated in a clockwise direction (a direction indicated by an arrow R<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) as viewed from a front side <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>12</b>, whereby the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> is fixed to the door inner panel <b>13</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To described in more detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the opening <b>4</b> is formed into a substantially triangular shape which is smaller than an outside diameter of the speaker housing <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, this opening <b>4</b> has three straight sides <b>41</b>, and the substantially triangular opening is formed by connecting ends of the respective straight sides <b>41</b> via curves (for example, arcs) <b>42</b>. A reason why the opening <b>4</b> is formed into the substantially triangular shape will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a flange <b>44</b> is formed on the periphery of the opening <b>4</b> by bending an edge portion of the opening <b>4</b> substantially at right angles. The rigidity of the opening <b>44</b> is attempted to be increased by this flange <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, a first slit <b>5</b>A, a second slit <b>5</b>B and a third slit <b>5</b>C are disposed around an outer circumference of the substantially triangular opening <b>4</b> in the vicinity of the three straight portions <b>41</b> thereof. Note that these first slit <b>5</b>A, second slit <b>5</b>B and third slit <b>5</b>C may be described as the “slit <b>5</b>” when they are designated collectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> is bent toward the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>. The claw portion <b>13</b> includes the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>and an arm portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>which connects the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>with the housing <b>12</b>. The claw portion <b>13</b> is formed such that the cross section thereof becomes a substantially L shape and that the width B<b>1</b> of the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>is greater than the width B<b>2</b> of the arm portion <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The slit <b>5</b> into which the claw portion <b>13</b> is inserted includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, an inserting portion <b>51</b> through which the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> is allowed to pass and a fixing portion <b>52</b> which communicates with the inserting portion <b>51</b> and through which only the arm portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is allowed to pass.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When work for mounting the speaker unit on the door inner panel <b>3</b> (hereinafter, also referred to simply as “mounting work”) is carried out, firstly the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> is inserted into the inserting portion <b>51</b>, and thereafter, the housing <b>12</b> is rotated clockwise so that the arm portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is caused to slide into the fixing portion <b>52</b>. Thus, the speaker unit <b>1</b> is firmly mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b> through engagement of the claw portion <b>13</b> with the slit <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">To describe this by taking the first slit <b>5</b>A for example, since the width W<b>1</b> of a gap of the fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> is made to be a minimum width required for the passage of the arm portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>having the width B<b>2</b>, the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>having the width B<b>1</b> which is wider than the width B<b>2</b> of the arm portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is not allowed to pass through the gap of the fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> whose width is W<b>1</b>. Namely, even if the speaker unit <b>1</b> is attempted to be pulled out with the arm portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>having been moved into the fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, the distal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> is not allowed to pass through the gap having the width W<b>1</b> of the fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>. Consequently, the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> is fixed in a vertical direction relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiment, the claw portion <b>13</b> and a rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> are constructed to be brought into press contact with each other by a restoring force of a lower cushion <b>2</b> (which will be described later) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>, whereby the speaker unit <b>1</b> can be fixed firmly not only in the vertical direction but also in a circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this construction, however, in the event that the door inner panel <b>3</b> expands or contracts due to change in temperature, contact surfaces of the claw portion <b>13</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b> are caused to rub against each other, and as a result, a squeak might be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Similarly, when vibrations and impacts generated when the vehicle is running are transmitted to the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the contact surfaces of the claw portion <b>13</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b> might cause to rub against each other to thereby generate a squeak.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In particular, the cone <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> of the speaker main body <b>11</b> echoes with a squeak so generated, and the squeak is then transmitted to the interior of the passenger compartment to thereby make passengers in the passenger compartment feel uncomfortable. Thus, there is caused a problem of how to reduce or eliminate the squeak.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In order to reduce or eliminate a squeak, it is effective to reduce a friction force generated between the claw portion <b>13</b> and the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner pane <b>3</b>. On the other hand, as has been described above, in order to firmly mount the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b> by bringing into a strong press contact with the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>, a friction force required for this purpose needs to be left.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, in this embodiment, irregularities are formed on a surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> which is brought into contact with the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> so as to reduce the contact area of the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> with the surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b>, whereby a desired amount of friction force is reduced. A concept of this idea is schematicly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Namely, in the event that minute irregularities are formed on the surface <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b>, the contact area between the surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> and the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> is reduced, and in the event that the door inner panel <b>3</b> expands or contracts due to a change in temperature, or in the event that vibrations and impacts generated while the vehicle is running are transmitted to the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> slides on the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> appropriately, thereby making it possible to reduce or eliminate the generation of a squeak. In addition, since the irregularities so formed are minute, there is caused no risk that the contact area is reduced more than required, thereby making it possible to eliminate a risk that the friction force is lost which is required to firmly mount the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Note that while the construction is adopted in this embodiment in which the irregularities are formed on the surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b>, another construction may be adopted in which the irregularities are formed on the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>. Namely, the irregularities may only have to be formed on at least either the surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> which is brought into abutment with the door inner panel <b>3</b> or the side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> which is brought into abutment with the claw portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To form the minute irregularities, an grain finish process is effective which is a processing method for forming a cloth mark effect or a wood grain effect on the surface of a resin or metallic molded piece. In addition, as another method, an etching process is also an effective processing method in which the surface of a resin or a metal is chemically or electrically etched to form minute irregularities thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, clips <b>17</b> are formed on an outer circumferential surface <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the housing <b>12</b> for holding or fixing a cable (not shown) for supplying power to the speaker unit <b>1</b> or a cable (not shown) for transmitting a speech signal to the speaker unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The clip <b>17</b> is fixed to the outer circumference of the housing at one end (a proximal end) thereof, and the other end thereof is constructed as an open end (a distal end). In addition, the distal end of the clip <b>17</b> is formed into a wedge shape. Thus, a cable can easily be inserted between the clips <b>17</b> and the outer circumference of the housing <b>12</b> by providing the clips <b>17</b> so constructed, thereby making it possible to fix the cable securely. In addition, there is no risk that the cable is caused to flutter after installation, thereby making it possible to firmly prevent the interference of the cable with other components.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The reason why the opening <b>4</b> is formed not circular but triangular will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An object of the formation of the triangular opening is to approach the claw portions <b>13</b> to the flange <b>44</b> as close as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">This is because the surface strength becomes high in the vicinity of the flange <b>44</b>, and because the surface strength is deteriorated as it goes farther away from the flange <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the event that the opening <b>4</b> is circular, however, there is a limitation on a processing technique for approaching the entirety of the slits <b>5</b> to a general flange which is provided along the circular opening, and since the general flange and the slits have to be spaced apart by a slight distance from each other, the mounting rigidity of a speaker has not been able to be enhanced sufficiently. In addition, while it would have been possible to devise a countermeasure in which the required surface strength for a panel member is ensured by making the open area of the opening smaller, there has been a demand that the opening area be made as large as possible in consideration of the acoustic properties of the speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Namely, in the event that the opening <b>4</b> is circular, the rotational locus of the claw portions <b>13</b> on the housing <b>13</b> and the outer circumference of the circular opening of the circle become concentric with each other, and the rotational locus of the claw portions <b>13</b> and an edge portion of the circular opening become parallel with each other. Thus, no matter how the housing <b>12</b> is rotated, there is no possibility that the claw portions <b>13</b> are allowed to approach the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this embodiment, however, since the opening <b>4</b> is formed into the substantially triangular shape, an imaginary line which is an extension from the rotational locus of the claw portions <b>13</b> intersects with the opening <b>4</b>. In other words, when the housing <b>12</b> is rotated, the claw portions <b>13</b> approach the flange <b>44</b> provided along the edge portion of the opening <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this embodiment, the inserting portion <b>51</b> is formed at a position where the distance between the straight side <b>41</b> and the rotational locus becomes maximum. In mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b>, when the housing <b>12</b> is rotated after the claw portions <b>13</b> are inserted into the inserting portions <b>51</b>, the claw portions <b>13</b> are allowed to approach the edge portion or the flange <b>44</b> of the opening <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Then, the mounting rigidity of the speaker unit <b>1</b> can be enhanced by bringing the claw portions <b>13</b> into engagement with the door inner panel <b>3</b> in the vicinity of the flange <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As has been described heretofore, according to the in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure, by forming the opening <b>4</b> not circular but substantially triangular, not only can the speaker mounting rigidity be enhanced sufficiently but also the loss of the acoustic properties of the speaker can be prevented by securing the required opening area.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, in the event that an insertion guide <b>29</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is provided on a rear side <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>12</b>, there is provided a further advantage that mounting work of the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door panel <b>3</b> can easily be implemented. The mounting work with the insertion guide <b>29</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The respective claw portions <b>13</b> on the housing <b>12</b> which are to be inserted into the respective slits <b>5</b> are formed inwardly of the outer circumference of the speaker housing <b>12</b>. Namely, when the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the slits <b>5</b> are situated inwardly of the outer circumference of the speaker housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, when mounting the housing <b>12</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, since the worker has to perform the mounting work while he or she cannot see the positions of the claw portions <b>13</b> provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b>, it is difficult for him or her to accurately insert the claw portions <b>13</b> into the slits <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">To cope with this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cylindrical insertion guide <b>29</b> is provided closer to the center of the housing <b>12</b> than the three claw portions <b>13</b>. The height of the insertion guide <b>29</b> is made to become higher than those of the respective claw portions <b>13</b>, and the yoke <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>, the magnet <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> and the plate <b>1</b>-<b>6</b>, which constitute the speaker <b>11</b>, are mounted in the interior of the insertion guide <b>29</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic front view of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and describing aligning work which is to be carried out when mounting the speaker housing <b>12</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>. As shown in the figure, when mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, part of the insertion guide <b>29</b> is caused to slide along the side of the triangular opening <b>4</b>, whereby the entirety of the insertion guide <b>29</b> is inserted into the opening <b>4</b> in an ensured manner. In other words, as shown by dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, only one part of the insertion guide <b>29</b> is inserted into the opening <b>4</b>, and the other part of a circumferential surface of the insertion guide <b>29</b> is in contact with the left side of the substantially triangular opening <b>4</b>. Then, when a force is applied to the insertion guide <b>29</b> upwardly (refer to an arrow M in a dashed line), the insertion guide <b>20</b> naturally moves upwardly along the left side of the triangular opening <b>4</b> to finally be inserted in to the opening <b>4</b> in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the housing <b>12</b> is rotated in this state, the plurality of claw portions <b>13</b> are inserted into the inserting portions <b>51</b> of their corresponding nearest slits <b>5</b>, respectively, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> comes to be mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, since the insertion guide <b>29</b> is made higher than the claw portions <b>13</b> along the full circumference thereof, even if the insertion guide <b>29</b> is inserted into the opening <b>4</b> from any direction, the insertion guide <b>29</b> naturally comes into contact with any of the sides of the substantially triangular opening <b>4</b>, and therefore, the worker does not have to pay attention to the direction in which the insertion guide <b>29</b> is inserted into the opening <b>4</b> in performing mounting work of the speaker unit <b>1</b>, thereby making it possible to enhance the working efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The insertion guide <b>29</b> also functions as a waterproofing cover, and therefore, there is no need to provide an additional waterproofing cover to thereby suppress the number of components. This contributes to the increase in productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Incidentally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 16</figref>, working recesses <b>20</b> are formed in the housing <b>12</b>, and when mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the worker is expected to rotate the housing while utilizing these working recesses <b>20</b> to hold the housing <b>12</b>. The plurality of working recesses <b>20</b> for use in such an event are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 16</figref>, and mounting work of the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b> using the work recesses <b>20</b> will be described below with reference to those drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a front view showing a front side of the housing <b>12</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic horizontal cross section of the speaker housing <b>12</b> and shows a working recess for mounting or a mount working recess, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> are drawings each showing a case where a general tool is inserted into the mounting work recess, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a drawing showing a case where the general tool is inserted into a working recess for removing or a removal working recess.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each working recess <b>20</b> is formed by depressing the outer circumferential surface of the housing <b>12</b> in a direction toward the center of the housing <b>12</b>. The plurality of working recesses <b>20</b> are provided at four positions which are symmetrical relative to the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>. Additionally, a jig inserting hole <b>30</b> is provided at an inner part of each working recess <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The working recesses <b>20</b> include mount working recesses <b>20</b>A having a mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A at inner parts thereof and removal working recesses <b>20</b>B having a removing jig inserting hole <b>30</b>B at inner parts thereof. The mount working recess <b>20</b>A and the removal working recess <b>20</b>B are disposed adjacent to each other. Hereinafter, the mount working recesses <b>20</b>A and the removal working recesses <b>20</b>B may also be described as the working recesses <b>20</b> when they are designated collectively. Similarly, the mounting jig inserting holes <b>30</b>A and the removing jig inserting holes <b>30</b>B may also be described as the removing jig inserting holes <b>30</b> when they are designated collectively.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, although they will be described in detail later, a protruding member <b>34</b>A provided on an edge portion of the mount working recess <b>20</b>A and a protruding member <b>34</b>B provided on an edge portion of the removal working recess <b>20</b>B may also be described as protruding members <b>34</b> when they are designated collectively.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The constructions of the working recesses <b>20</b> and the jig inserting holes <b>30</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since the working recesses <b>20</b> are holes that are used mainly for the worker to hold the housing <b>12</b> securely, recesses need to be formed which are suitable for the worker to grip the housing. This is because the worker needs to hold the housing <b>12</b> securely with his or her hand when aligning the housing <b>12</b> with the door inner panel <b>3</b> accurately in order to insert the plurality of claw portions <b>13</b> provided on the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> into the slits <b>5</b> formed in the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With these working recesses <b>20</b> provided as has been described above, the worker can rotate the housing <b>12</b> basically without using a tool. However, the worker needs to mount several speaker units <b>1</b> continuously on a production line, and in the event that the worker is required to rotate housings <b>12</b> manually, the worker will have to bear tremendously excessive work load, and hence the working efficiency will be deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">To cope with this, on the production line, it has been desired to reduce the work load of the worker by using any type of tool to rotate the housings <b>12</b>. In particular, in the in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure according to the invention, a large magnitude of torque is required to rotate the housing <b>12</b> (the reason for this will be described later). Thus, it has been an important issue to find a means for using a tool to apply a large magnitude of torque to the housing. In addition, in the event that the tool so used is a general tool such as a screwdriver <b>10</b> or the like, no special tool is needed, and the availability of tools can desirably enhanced at low costs.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Consequently, the housing <b>12</b> needed to be constructed so as to allow the insertion of such a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">From the aforesaid background, not only a “shape that is easy to be gripped by the worker” but also a “shape that allows a tool and a jig to be fitted therein” have been required for the housing <b>12</b>. In order to fulfill these two requirements, it was conceived to provide separately holes into which the finger of the worker can be inserted and holes in which the tool can be fitted, but with this construction, the number of working processes in the production of housings <b>12</b> is increased, and costs required for working as well as working time are in turn increased undesirably.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Then, the invention is constructed such that the working recesses <b>20</b> into which the finger of the worker can be inserted are provided in the housing <b>12</b>, and furthermore, such that the working recesses <b>20</b> each have the jig inserting hole <b>30</b> at the inner part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The working recess <b>20</b> and the jig inserting hole <b>30</b> will be described in detail below by taking the mount working recess <b>20</b>A and the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A for example.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A is provided at the inner part of the mount working recess <b>20</b>A, and a general tool such as a screwdriver <b>106</b> is fitted in this mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, so that, when mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, a large torque is easily applied to the housing <b>12</b> to thereby rotate the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, this mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A is used when rotating the housing <b>12</b> in a forward direction (in a clockwise direction) relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a second side wall <b>32</b>A, a protruding portion <b>33</b>A and a first side wall <b>35</b>A are provided inside the mount working recess <b>20</b>A, and the protruding member <b>34</b>A which protrudes radially outwardly is provided on the edge of the opening of the mount working recess <b>20</b>A which is situated on a second wall <b>32</b>A side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A tangent line L<b>1</b> to the outer circumference of the housing <b>12</b> is illustrated by a double-dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The first side wall <b>35</b>A is provided in such a manner as to intersect with the outer circumferential tangent line L<b>1</b> substantially at right angles and to extend from the outer circumferential surface <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the housing <b>12</b> toward the center thereof. In addition, while the second side wall <b>34</b>A is also provided in such a manner as to extend from the outer circumferential surface <b>12</b><i>c </i>to the center of the housing <b>12</b>, the second side wall <b>32</b>A inclines slightly toward the first side wall <b>35</b>A on a center side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an imaginary extension L<b>2</b> of the second side wall <b>32</b>A has a distance S from the center O at a point where it approaches the center O as close as possible. Namely, the second side wall <b>32</b>A is formed in such a manner as to be offset relative to the radial direction toward the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The jig inserting hole <b>30</b> is also provided within the working recess <b>20</b> at the same angle as that of the imaginary extension L<b>2</b>, and is formed, as with the second side wall <b>32</b>A, in such a manner as to be offset relative to the radial direction toward the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>. This construction is adopted in order to avoid the interference with the magnet <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> which exists in the vicinity of the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the protruding portion <b>33</b>A is formed by a vertical side <b>33</b>A-a protruding substantially perpendicularly from the first side wall <b>35</b>A into the mount working recess <b>20</b>, and a tool inserting hole side wall <b>37</b><i>a </i>is provided in such a manner as to extend in parallel with the second side wall <b>32</b>A from a vertex of the protruding portion <b>33</b>A toward a deepest part of the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A (which is also a deepest part of the mount working recess <b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the three claw portions <b>13</b> on the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> are inserted into the first slit portions of the corresponding slits <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b>, respectively, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a tool such as the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A. Thereafter, when a force F<b>1</b> is applied downwardly to a rear end portion <b>106</b><i>c </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b>, a portion of the screwdriver <b>106</b> in the vicinity of a distal end <b>106</b><i>a </i>thereof is brought into contact with the tool inserting hole side wall <b>37</b>A (refer to a point C<b>1</b> indicated by a cross), and the housing <b>12</b> is rotated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the clockwise direction about the center O of the housing <b>12</b> by a torque T<b>1</b> applied using the point C<b>1</b> as a fulcrum, whereby the claw portions <b>13</b> on the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> slide from the inserting portions <b>51</b> to the fixing portions in the slits <b>5</b>, respectively, the speaker unit <b>1</b> being thereby fixed to the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic view showing a case where the screwdriver <b>106</b>, which is a general tool (a jig), is fitted in the removal working recess <b>20</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The removal working recess <b>20</b>B is formed into an axially symmetrical shape with the aforesaid mount working recess <b>20</b>A with respect to a line indicated by a dashed line L<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the detailed description of the construction thereof will be omitted here. In the removal working recess <b>20</b>B, reference character B, instead of A, will be imparted to constituent elements corresponding to those of the mount working recess <b>20</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When removing the speaker unit <b>1</b> from the door inner panel <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the removal working recess <b>20</b>B and a force F<b>2</b> is applied thereto upwardly. Then, a portion of the screwdriver <b>106</b> in the vicinity of the distal end <b>106</b><i>a </i>thereof is brought into contact with a protruding portion <b>33</b>B by a side <b>106</b><i>b </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b> (refer to a point C<b>3</b> indicated by a cross), and a portion of a second side wall <b>32</b>B in the vicinity of the edge of the opening and a protruding member <b>34</b>B are brought into press contact with the screwdriver <b>106</b> by a torque T<b>2</b> applied using the point C<b>3</b> as a fulcrum. Then, the housing <b>12</b> to which the torque T<b>2</b> is applied rotates about the center O of the housing <b>12</b> in a counterclockwise direction, and the three claw portions <b>13</b> situated on the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> then slide from the fixing portions <b>52</b> to the inserting portions <b>51</b> of the corresponding slits <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b>, respectively, the speaker unit <b>1</b> being thereby put in a state in which the speaker unit <b>1</b> is allowed to be pulled to be removed from the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Namely, when the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door <b>3</b> as has been described above, the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A, and in contrast, when the speaker unit <b>1</b> has already been mounted on the door panel <b>3</b>, the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the removing jig inserting hole <b>30</b>B. However, despite the intention of the worker to mount the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, there may be anticipated a risk that the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the removing jig inserting hole <b>30</b>B, or, in contrast to this, despite the intention of the worker to remove the speaker unit <b>1</b> from the door inner panel <b>3</b>, there may be anticipated a risk that the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A. Even in such the case, the in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure according to the invention is constructed so as to deal with those anticipated risks properly. How the anticipated risks are properly dealt with will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the screwdriver <b>106</b> is inserted into the mount working recess <b>20</b>A in which the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A is formed and the force F<b>2</b> is applied thereto in an upper leftward direction, the portion of the screwdriver <b>106</b> in the vicinity of the distal end portion <b>106</b><i>a </i>thereof is brought into contact with the protruding portion <b>33</b>A (refer to the point C<b>2</b> indicated by the cross), and then, the rear end portion <b>106</b><i>c </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b> rotates about this contact point in the counterclockwise direction as indicated by an arrow M<b>2</b> indicated by a dashed line, while the distal end portion <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b> rotates about the point C<b>2</b> which functions as a rotational axis in an opposite direction to the direction indicated by the arrow M<b>2</b>, whereby the screwdriver <b>106</b> goes out of the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A. When the force F<b>2</b> continues to be applied to the rear end portion <b>106</b><i>c </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b>, the distal end portion <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b> goes out of the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and finally, the screwdriver <b>106</b> automatically goes out of the mounting jig inserting hole <b>30</b>A completely.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Namely, since the force F<b>2</b> so applied does not act on the housing <b>12</b>, the housing <b>12</b> cannot be removed from the door panel <b>3</b>. When mounting or removing the speaker unit <b>1</b> on or from the door inner panel <b>3</b> using a general tool such as the screwdriver <b>106</b>, the housing <b>12</b> is constructed not to be rotated without using the jig inserting hole <b>30</b> suited to the purpose of the work to be done.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In addition, since the screwdriver <b>106</b> automatically comes out of the jig inserting hole <b>30</b>, the worker can be informed that he or she has inserted the screwdriver <b>106</b> into the wrong jig inserting hole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the event that the screwdriver <b>106</b> is erroneously inserted into the working recess <b>20</b>B having the removing jig inserting hole <b>30</b>B despite the worker's intention to mount the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, a similar action in principle to that of the example described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> will be performed, and therefore, the description thereof will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Since the worker can securely hold the speaker unit <b>1</b> with the fingers inserted into the working recesses <b>20</b> as described above by providing the same working recesses <b>20</b> when mounting or removing the speaker unit <b>1</b> on or from the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the provision of the working recesses <b>20</b> contributes to the enhancement of the workability. In addition, the worker can easily hold the housing <b>12</b> with both the hands by providing the respective working recesses <b>20</b> at the symmetrical positions relative to the center of the speaker unit <b>1</b>, whereby the workability can be enhanced further. Also, since the mount working recess <b>20</b>A and the removal working recess <b>20</b>B are disposed adjacent to each other, the worker can easily insert his or her fingers into the mount working recesses <b>20</b>A (the working recesses <b>20</b>) and the removal working recesses <b>20</b>B (the working recesses <b>20</b>), the workability being thereby enhanced further.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, the speaker unit can easily be rotated using a general tool such as the screwdriver by providing the jig inserting holes <b>30</b>. In particular, even in a case where a large torque is required to rotate the speaker unit <b>1</b>, the worker can produce a large torque with a small force, whereby the workability can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In particular, since the jig inserting holes <b>30</b> are provided at the deeper parts of the working recesses <b>20</b>, most of the openings and the inner sides of the working recesses <b>20</b> can be commonly used, and the number of holes which are formed in the housing <b>12</b> can be reduced. In addition, this can prevent the reduction in strength of the housing <b>12</b>, and reduce the number of working processes in the production of housings <b>12</b>, whereby the working costs and time can also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, by providing the protruding member <b>34</b> on the edge portion of the opening of the working recess <b>20</b>, even in the event that the speaker unit <b>1</b> is rotated using a general tool such as the screwdriver <b>106</b>, a case can be avoided where the screwdriver <b>106</b> presses against the edge portion of the opening to damage the same.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition, the worker can hook his or her finger on this protruding member <b>34</b> when holding the housing <b>12</b> with his or her hands, whereby the workability can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a special tool <b>50</b> for rotating the housing <b>12</b> may be used. In this case, when distal end portions <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the special tool <b>50</b> are both inserted into the working recess <b>20</b> with a rear end portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>of the special tool <b>50</b> being rotated in the clockwise direction, the housing <b>12</b> can easily be rotated, whereby the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>. When the rear end portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>of the special tool <b>50</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction, the housing <b>12</b> can easily be rotated in the counterclockwise direction, whereby the speaker unit <b>1</b> can easily be removed from the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Thus, the worker can produce a large torque with a small force, and the workability in mounting and removing the speaker unit <b>1</b> is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition, such a special tool <b>50</b> can be mounted on a distal end of the arm of a robot placed along the production line, whereby automatic rigging can also be dealt with.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Incidentally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a lower cushion <b>2</b> (a seal member) is interposed between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the housing <b>12</b>. This lower cushion <b>2</b> is formed of a compressive resilient body such as sponge and rubber and ensures the closure of a gap between the housing <b>12</b> and the surface of the door inner panel <b>3</b> despite the provision of the minute irregularities on the surface of the door inner panel <b>3</b>. Thus, the lower cushion <b>2</b> is provided to prevent the ingress of dust and water from the gap. In addition, the lower cushion <b>2</b> also functions to absorb shocks and vibrations produced and transmitted to the door inner panel <b>3</b> while the vehicle is running so that the shocks and vibrations so produced are not transmitted to the speaker unit <b>1</b> as they are.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In order to enhance the dustproofness and waterproofness by the lower cushion <b>2</b>, a rate at which the lower cushion <b>2</b> is compressed between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the housing <b>12</b> (a rate of compression) needs to be increased. However, in the event that the rate of compression is increased, a frictional force generated between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the lower cushion <b>2</b> and a frictional force generated between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the housing <b>12</b> are both increased.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the conventional speaker unit <b>106</b> adopting the screw mounting method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, since the conventional speaker unit <b>106</b> is not rotated relative to the door panel, when the seal member is interposed between the conventional speaker unit <b>106</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the rate of compression of the seal member only has to be increased simply. However, in the present embodiment, since the speaker unit <b>1</b> is rotated relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b> so as to be mounted thereon, in the event that the rate of compression of the lower cushion <b>2</b> (the seal member) is increased too high, the workability in mounting is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Namely, in the embodiment, while the lower cushion <b>2</b> is securely compressed between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the housing <b>12</b>, the frictional force produced between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the housing <b>12</b> needs to be suppressed. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a rib (a projection) <b>45</b> is provided along the full circumference of a portion in the vicinity of the edge portion on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b>. A cross-sectional shape of this rib <b>45</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a drawing showing a cross section taken along the line Q-Q in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which is an elevation of the rear side of the housing <b>12</b>. The cross section of the rib <b>45</b> is formed into a substantially triangular shape. The rib <b>45</b> raises from the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> with a distal end <b>45</b><i>a </i>thereof being a vertex. This rib <b>45</b> constitutes a member which ensures the rotational properties of the housing <b>12</b> relative to the door inner panel <b>13</b> even while enhancing the rate of compression of the lower cushion <b>2</b> when holding to compress the lower cushion <b>2</b> between the housing <b>12</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The compressed lower cushion <b>2</b> expands the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> by its restoring force which is a force expanding outwardly. Due to this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the housing <b>12</b> is firmly fixed in the circumferential direction, as well as in the vertical direction relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b>, with the surfaces <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portions <b>13</b> being brought into press contact with the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a double-ended arrow g<b>1</b> and a double-ended arrow g<b>2</b> denote distances of gaps between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the housing <b>12</b>, respectively. The gap g<b>2</b> is set to be wider than the gap g<b>1</b>, and the lower cushion <b>2</b> is compressed to be held within these gaps g<b>1</b> and g<b>2</b>, or between the housing <b>12</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When mounting the housing <b>12</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, as has been described above, the three claw portions <b>13</b> existing on the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> are inserted into the first slit portions of the corresponding slits <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b>, respectively. As this occurs, the lower cushion <b>2</b> provided between the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b> is compressed sufficiently by the rib <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the lower cushion <b>2</b>, only a rate of compression at a portion of the lower cushion <b>2</b> which is held between the rib vertex <b>45</b><i>a </i>and the door inner panel <b>3</b> (hereinafter, also referred to as a “first compression rate P<b>1</b>”) is increased locally, and on the other hand, a rate of compression of the remaining portion of the lower cushion <b>2</b> which is held between the rear side of the housing <b>12</b> except for the rib <b>45</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b> (hereinafter, also referred to as a “second compress rate P<b>2</b>”) becomes lower than the first compression rate P<b>1</b>. Namely, the expansion of the gap g<b>1</b> can compress the lower cushion <b>2</b> sufficiently by the provision of the rib <b>45</b>, whereby the waterproofness is enhanced, whereas the frictional force generated between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b> is suppressed due to the gap g<b>2</b> between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the housing being larger than the gap g<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">According to the construction as has been described heretofore, water and dust which attempt to intrude between the housing <b>12</b> and the door inner panel <b>3</b> from the outer circumference of the housing are firmly captured by the lower cushion <b>2</b>. At the same time, when the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, since the housing <b>12</b> rotates smoothly relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the deterioration in workability can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the height of the vertex <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the rib <b>45</b> may be constructed to vary according to the distance from the claw portions <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">This is because, when the lower cushion <b>2</b> is compressed between the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> and the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>, while the lower cushion <b>2</b> attempts to expand by the restoring force thereof, since portions in the vicinity of the claw portions <b>13</b> can resist the restoring force, the gap g<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> becomes substantially constant. However, since a portion in the vicinity of a point where a line illustrated by a dashed line L<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> intersects with the rib <b>45</b> situated away from the claw portions <b>13</b>, a gap wider than the gap g<b>1</b> may be generated by the restoring force of the lower cushion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Due to this, a construction may be adopted in which the height of the rib vertex <b>45</b><i>a </i>is slightly higher at the other locations than the vicinity of the claw portions <b>13</b>. With this construction, when the restoring force of the lower cushion <b>2</b> is caused to act, the gap g<b>1</b> which is the distance between the rib vertex <b>45</b><i>a </i>and the door inner panel <b>3</b> can be made substantially constant, and hence the rate of compression P<b>1</b> of the lower cushion <b>2</b> at the gap g<b>1</b> can be made substantially constant.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">By this construction, the waterproofness can be enhanced by the lower cushion <b>2</b>, whereas the frictional force generated between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> can be suppressed appropriately, whereby not only can the rotational performance of the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> be ensured but also the workability can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Incidentally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a contact surface (hereinafter, also referred to as a “claw portion surface”) <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b> which comes into contact with the door inner panel <b>3</b> is constructed so as to have two contact surfaces having different heights. The door inner panel <b>3</b> is formed by bringing two plates having different thicknesses into contact with each other. According to the embodiment, even in the event that the thickness of the panel varies depending on locations thereof, the speaker unit <b>1</b> is allowed to be firmly mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">One of the two contact surfaces of the claw portion <b>13</b> is a thin contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> which is used when the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b> is thin, and the other is a thick contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> which is used when the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b> is thick. Namely, a difference in level is provided in the contact surface of the claw portion <b>13</b> so that the heights of the respective contact surfaces differ from each other, whereby, even in the event that the thickness of the door inner panel <b>13</b> varies, the housing <b>12</b> is allowed to be firmly mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>. Note that a “claw portion contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>” may also be used when the two thin contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> and thick contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> are designated collectively.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A perspective view of the claw portion <b>13</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In the contact portion <b>13</b>, the thin contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> has a height h<b>2</b> and is provided on an outer circumferential side of the housing <b>12</b>, whereas in the claw portion <b>13</b>, the thick contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> has a height h<b>1</b> and is provided on a center side of the housing <b>12</b>. In addition, slopes <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b><i>a </i>are formed on front edges in a mounting direction of the thin contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> and the thick contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b>, respectively. These slopes <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b><i>a </i>are provided so as to allow the claw portion contact surface <b>13</b> of the claw portion <b>13</b> which is inserted into the silt <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b> to slide smoothly from the inserting portion <b>51</b> to the fixing portion <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As has been described above, in the event that the plurality of heights are provided for the claw portion contact surfaces <b>13</b><i>c</i>, the configuration of the slit <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>5</b> needs to be formed in such a manner as to match the thicknesses of the door inner panel <b>3</b>. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a schematic view of the vicinities of the opening <b>4</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b>, and shows a state as viewed from the front side <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the first slit <b>5</b>A, the second slit <b>5</b>B and the third slit <b>5</b>C being provided on the perimeter of the opening <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The first slit <b>5</b>A and the third slit <b>5</b>C are made up of the inserting portion <b>51</b> and the thin-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, respectively. The second slit <b>5</b>B is made up of the inserting portion <b>51</b> and the thick-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>2</b>. Namely, the configurations of the first slit <b>5</b>A and the third slit <b>5</b>C are identical, whereas only the second slit <b>5</b>B has a configuration which differs from those of the first slit <b>5</b>A and the third slit <b>5</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The difference will be described here by comparing the first slit <b>5</b>A with the second slit <b>5</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A curvature R<b>1</b> of a center side arc of the thin-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> formed in the first slit <b>5</b>A is constructed to become larger than a curvature R<b>2</b> of a center side arc of the thick-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> formed in the second slit <b>5</b>B, and the configurations of the first slit <b>5</b>A and the second slit <b>5</b>B are substantially the same except for this difference in curvature. As a result, a gap W<b>1</b> in the thin-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> in the first slit <b>5</b>A becomes narrower than a gap W<b>2</b> in the thick-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> in the second slit <b>5</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Thus, the gap W<b>1</b> in the first slit <b>5</b>A is constructed so as to differ from the gap W<b>2</b> in the second slid <b>5</b>B to thereby deal with the construction in which the thickness of the door panel <b>3</b> is made to differ at a position where the first slit <b>5</b>A is situated from a position where the second slit <b>5</b>B is situated. Namely, the thickness of the door panel <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> differs across a boundary line B indicated by a chain line, and the thickness of the right door panel is denoted by t<b>1</b>, whereas the thickness of the left door panel by t<b>2</b>, the thickness t<b>1</b> of the right door panel being formed to be thinner than the thickness t<b>2</b> of the left door panel.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Incidentally, the door inner panel <b>3</b> in this embodiment which is made up of the members having the different thicknesses is produced using a technique referred to as a tailored blank. The tailored blank means a technique for laser welding together plates having different thicknesses or formed of different materials before pressing so as to promote the reduction in vehicle weight or modularization.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The thin-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> having the height hi is set at a height which is suitable for the panel having thickness t<b>1</b>, and the thick-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> having the height h<b>2</b> is set at a height which is suitable for the panel having the thickness t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Since the claw portion contact surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>and the slit <b>5</b>A are constructed as has been described heretofore, when mounting the housing <b>12</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the claw portion <b>13</b> provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> is inserted into the inserting portion <b>51</b> in the first slit <b>5</b>A, and thereafter, when the claw portion <b>13</b> slides into the thin-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> by the rotation of the housing <b>12</b>, only the thin-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> of the claw portion <b>13</b> comes into contact with a portion (an area indicated by α on the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> which is situated closer to the center than the thin-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">At the same time, the claw portion <b>13</b> is inserted into the inserting portion <b>51</b> in the second slit <b>5</b>B, and when the claw portion <b>13</b> slides into the thick-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> in association with the rotation of the housing <b>12</b>, only the thick-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> of the claw portion <b>13</b> comes into contact with a portion (an area indicated by β) in the vicinity of the center side of the thick-plate fixing portion <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> on the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. This is because since the thin-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> whose height is higher than that of the thick-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> of the claw portion <b>13</b> falls into an area indicated by γ in the gap W<b>2</b> in the second slit <b>5</b>B, as a result, only the thick-plate contact surface <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> is allowed to come into contact with the door panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">By this construction, the claw portion <b>13</b> and the second slit <b>5</b>B are brought into engagement with each other in the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Since the configuration of the third slit <b>5</b>C is identical to that of the first slit <b>5</b>A and the inserting and sliding operations of the claw portion <b>13</b> are identical to those of the first slit <b>5</b>A, the description of the third slit <b>5</b>C will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Since the claw portions <b>13</b> and the slits <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b> are constructed as has been described heretofore, even in the event that the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b> which is the object of the mounting of the speaker unit <b>1</b> differs locally, the speaker unit <b>1</b> can be mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b> which is the tailored blank by providing the plurality of surfaces having the different heights on the surfaces <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portions <b>13</b> provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> and varying the configurations of the slits <b>5</b> formed in the door inner panel <b>3</b> for insertion of the claw portions <b>13</b> according to the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Namely, even in the event that the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b> differs locally, since there is no need to change types of housings <b>12</b>, the design costs of housing can be reduced, and since there is no need to provide a plurality of production lines of housing <b>12</b>, a certain advantage can be provided. In the mounting work of the speaker unit <b>1</b>, since the housing <b>12</b> of one type only has to be mounted irrespective of the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the working efficiency can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">While the case is described here where the thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b> changes using the tailored blank technique, even in a case where mounting is made relative to door inner panels having different thicknesses due to a difference in model and grade, it is possible to deal with the case similarly, and this equally contributes to the enhancement in working efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Incidentally, a schematic front view of a conventional door inner panel <b>104</b> as viewed from the inside of the passenger compartment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The side of the conventional door inner panel <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> may also be described as a door inner panel front side <b>104</b><i>a</i>, whereas a rear side of the door inner panel <b>104</b> may also be described as a door inner panel rear side <b>104</b><i>b</i>. In addition, since constituent components of the door inner panel <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> to which no reference numerals are imparted are general, the description thereof will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">A conventional speaker <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is mounted on the conventional door panel <b>104</b> at a portion in the vicinity of a lower end thereof. In the conventional door panel <b>104</b>, a water drain hole <b>116</b> is provided on a lower side of an opening <b>105</b> into which the speaker <b>120</b> is inserted. This conventional water drain hole <b>116</b> will be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a conventional door schematicly showing a cross section taken along the line D-D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The conventional door <b>112</b> is mainly made up of a door outer panel <b>114</b> provided on an external side of a vehicle and the aforesaid door inner panel <b>104</b>, and devices such as a side window glass <b>108</b> that can be raised, a window regulator (not shown), a door latch (not shown), a door lock sensor (not shown), a lighting wiring harness (not shown) are installed within a door interior spade <b>112</b><i>a </i>which is a space between the door outer panel <b>114</b> and the door inner panel <b>104</b>. Since these devices are general ones, the description thereof will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In addition, a weather strip <b>117</b> is provided at an upper end of the door outer panel <b>114</b> and at an upper end of the door inner panel <b>104</b>, respectively, and the weather strips <b>117</b> so provided are brought into press contact with sides of the side window glass <b>108</b>, respectively, to thereby prevent the ingress of water and dust into the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a</i>. However, it is very difficult to prevent the actual ingress of water and dust into the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a</i>. For example, in the case of water, there may be a case where water naturally enters the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>when the side window glass <b>108</b> is raised and/or lowered when it rains.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Water that has entered the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>flow downwardly by gravity and is then discharged to the outside of the door <b>112</b> through a water discharge hole <b>115</b> which is a hole provided at a lowest portion of the door <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">However, holes (component fitting openings) denoted by reference numerals <b>118</b>, <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> are formed in the door inner panel <b>104</b>, and there may occur a case where water that has entered the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>enters the interior of the vehicle through these holes (component fitting openings) <b>118</b>, <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>. In the case of a vehicle which is specified as having no speaker installed therein, the opening <b>105</b> which functions as a speaker fitting opening also becomes a hole through which the water that has entered the door interior space attempts to enter the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">A butyl seal <b>109</b> and a waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> affixed to the surface of the door by the butyl seal <b>109</b> prevent the ingress of the water that has entered the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>into the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> is affixed by the butyl seal <b>109</b> (a sealing agent) to the surface of the door inner panel <b>104</b> which is situated on a passenger compartment side. In addition, the waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> is designed to be interposed between the door inner panel <b>104</b> and a door trim <b>107</b>. In addition, when the speaker <b>120</b> is mounted on the door inner panel <b>104</b>, a cut is given in the waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> at a portion corresponding to the opening <b>105</b> so that the speaker <b>120</b> can be fitted in the opening <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Namely, should the water that has entered in the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>attempt to enter the interior of the vehicle, the water attempting to do so is dammed up by the waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> and the butyl seal <b>109</b>. Thereafter, the water flows downwardly by gravity between the waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> and the front side <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>104</b>. Then, the water is returned to the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>from the water drain hole <b>116</b> which is the hole situated at the lowest position among the holes formed in the door inner panel <b>104</b>, and is finally discharged to the outside of the door <b>112</b> through the water discharge hole <b>115</b> in the door <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">However, there is caused by the formation of the water drain hole <b>116</b> a problem that a limitation is imposed on a lowest limit position where the speaker <b>120</b> is installed. Namely, the volume of the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is not so large, and, there is a shortage of a space for installation of devices, in particular, from the vicinity of a central portion to an upper portion of the door interior space <b>112</b><i>a </i>in which the window regulator, the door latch, the door lock sensor and the lighting wiring harness, which are all not shown, are provided. Due to this, the speaker <b>120</b> is provided on the door <b>112</b> at as low a position as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">However, since the aforesaid water drain hole <b>116</b> needs to be the hole which is formed in the door panel <b>104</b> at the lowest position in view of the functional nature thereof, the opening <b>105</b> in which the speaker <b>120</b> is fitted needs to be provided above the water drain hole <b>116</b>, and at the same time, the water drain hole <b>116</b> needs to be provided a certain distance away from the opening <b>105</b> in view of the acoustic properties thereof, as well as a problem associated with the strength. Due to this, there is a limitation on the installation of the speaker <b>120</b> on the door inner panel <b>104</b> at lower positions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Furthermore, abnormal noise is generated when the waterproofing sheet <b>110</b> vibrates at the portion where the cut is imparted due to sound generated from the speaker <b>120</b>. This noise is so-called beat noise, and the generation of such noise needs to be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">To attain this, in the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the third slit <b>5</b>C which is provided below the opening <b>4</b> and is situated at the lowest position among the three slits <b>5</b> is constructed so as to also function as the aforesaid water drain hole.

In addition, water entering inwardly of the vehicle through a component fitting hole <b>27</b>, the second water drain hole <b>31</b> and the opening <b>4</b> is dammed up by the waterproofing sheet <b>26</b> and the butyl seal <b>25</b> and the flows downwardly by gravity between a front side <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the waterproofing vinyl <b>26</b>. The water enters again the door interior space <b>18</b><i>a </i>passing through the third slit <b>5</b>C which is the hole located at the lowest position among the plurality of holes formed in the door inner panel <b>3</b> and which is located lower than the opening <b>4</b> and is finally discharged to the outside of the door <b>18</b> from the water discharge hole <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Namely, the third slit <b>5</b>C also functions as a water drain hole (hereinafter, also occasionally described as a “first water drain hole”) <b>23</b> which is a hole for use in returning water existing between the front side <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the waterproofing vinyl <b>26</b> to the door interior space <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Due to this, since there is no need to provide a special water drain hole in the vicinity of the lower end of the door <b>18</b> as in the case with the conventional water drain hole <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, even in the event that the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the installation position of the speaker unit <b>1</b> can be set lower than the conventional example.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In addition, in the event that the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door panel <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the lower butyl seal <b>25</b> is provided along a lower edge of the second water drain hole <b>31</b>, and water which enters inwardly of the vehicle through the component fitting hole <b>27</b> or the like is dammed up by the water proofing sheet <b>26</b>B and the butyl seal <b>25</b>, then, flows downwardly by gravity between the front side <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the waterproofing vinyl <b>26</b>B, passes through the second water drain hole <b>31</b> to enter again the door interior space <b>18</b><i>a </i>and is finally discharged from the water discharge hole <b>22</b> to the outside of the door <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, since the side of the third slit <b>5</b>C on the outer circumferential side thereof is formed into an arc-like shape which protrudes downwardly, water that has flowed between the front side of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the waterproofing vinyl <b>26</b> naturally collects at a lower end of the arc-like shape, whereby the water so collecting is allowed to smoothly flow into the door interior space <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, since there is no case where the opening <b>4</b> is closed with the waterproofing vinyl <b>26</b>B, even when the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, there is no need to impart a cut in the waterproofing vinyl which is the case with the conventional example. Due to this, the generation of beat noise can be prevented that would otherwise be generated by the waterproofing vinyl in which the cut is so imparted.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Since the in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure according to the first embodiment of the invention is constructed as has been described heretofore, the following functions and advantages can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Firstly, in mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, the worker aligns the three claw portions <b>13</b> provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> with the three slits provided in the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">As this occurs, the worker cannot see the positions of the claw portions <b>13</b> provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> due to the outer circumference of the housing <b>12</b>, and, equally, the worker cannot see the positions of the slits <b>5</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b>. Due to this, while whether or not the respective claw portions <b>13</b> have been inserted in to the corresponding slits <b>5</b> is determined through the sensation from the hands, since the insertion guide <b>29</b> is provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> according to the invention, the worker only has to pay attention to inserting part of the insertion guide <b>29</b> into the opening <b>4</b> which is formed into the substantially triangular shape in the door inner panel <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the necessity of vertical and horizontal alignments of the speaker unit <b>1</b> relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b> being thereby obviated.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Then, as shown by the solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with the insertion guide <b>29</b> being fitted in the opening <b>4</b> in the door inner panel <b>3</b> completely, when the housing <b>12</b> is rotated in an appropriate direction with the housing <b>12</b> being pressed against the door inner panel <b>3</b> lightly, the claw portions <b>13</b> are inserted into the inserting portions <b>51</b> of the slits <b>5</b> in a natural fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Consequently, the worker can easily insert the claw portions <b>13</b> provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> into the slits <b>5</b> formed in the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In addition, in the event that this insertion guide <b>29</b> is made to function as a waterproofing cover, since the number of components can be reduced, the production costs of housings <b>12</b> can be suppressed. Moreover, the number of man-hours required for the production of housings <b>12</b> can be reduced to thereby reduce time required for the production.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In this state, the lower cushion <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is compressed between the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> and the front side <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>. Namely, the surfaces <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portions and the door inner panel <b>3</b><i>b </i>are brought into press adhesion to each other by virtue of the restoring force of the lower cushion so compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">While the work is expected to rotate the speaker unit <b>1</b> of the rotational locking type relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b> in the clockwise direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is normally difficult to rotate the speaker unit <b>1</b> due to the frictional force generated between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">According to the invention, however, the rib <b>45</b> having the substantially triangular cross section is provided on the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> along the full circumference of the housing <b>12</b>, and the lower cushion <b>2</b> is strongly pressed against the door inner panel <b>3</b> only by the portion of the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> in the vicinity of the rib <b>45</b>, while the lower cushion <b>2</b> is weakly pressed against by the other portions of the rear side <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>12</b> than the rib <b>45</b>. Due to this, the frictional force between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> is not increased more than required and hence does not interrupt the mounting work of the speaker unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In addition, since the lower cushion <b>2</b> is compressed sufficiently at the portion thereof which corresponds to the rib <b>45</b>, the ingress of water and dust between the door inner panel <b>3</b> and the lower cushion <b>2</b>, and between the lower cushion <b>2</b> and the housing <b>12</b> can be prevented in an ensured fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, since the two heights are provided for the surface <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portion <b>13</b>, even in the event that the door panel <b>3</b> whose thickness differs for the respective claw portions <b>13</b> is used, the speaker unit <b>1</b> can be mounted on the door inner panel <b>3</b> without altering the specification of the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In particular, the door inner panel <b>3</b> formed using the tailored blank is effective, and even when mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel of this kind, the worker does not have to pay attention to thickness of the door inner panel <b>3</b> but only has to carry out the mounting work of the speaker unit <b>1</b> using the housing <b>12</b> of the single kind, this contributing the enhancement of the workability.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Then, the worker rotates the speaker unit <b>1</b> relative to the door inner panel <b>3</b> to mount the former on the latter. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the worker inserts the screwdriver <b>106</b> from the outer circumferential surface <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the housing <b>12</b> into the working recess <b>20</b> and then the jig fitting hole <b>30</b> provided in the inner part of the working recess <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Thereafter, the torque T<b>1</b> is generated relative to the vicinity of the protruding member <b>34</b> on the housing <b>12</b> by applying the force F<b>1</b> to the rear end portion <b>106</b><i>c </i>of the screwdriver <b>106</b>. Then, the housing <b>12</b> is rotated about the housing center O in the clockwise direction as indicated by the arrow R<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Namely, since the worker can rotate the housing <b>12</b> of the speaker unit <b>1</b> with the small force F<b>1</b>, the workability in mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In addition, in this case, substantially the same effect can be obtained even if the housing <b>12</b> is rotated not with the general tool such as the screwdriver <b>106</b> but with the special tool <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Additionally, in the invention, since the aforesaid frictional force is reduced appropriately by providing the minute irregularities on the surfaces <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portions <b>13</b>, the generation of abnormal noise can be reduced or prevented which is attributed to the expansion and contraction of the door inner panel <b>3</b> and vibrations and shocks generated while the vehicle is running. Note that the irregularities may be formed no on the surfaces <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portions <b>13</b> but on the rear side <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the door inner panel <b>3</b> with which the surfaces <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the claw portions <b>13</b> are brought into contact.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In addition, in the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, since the third slit <b>5</b>C in which the claw portion <b>13</b> of the housing <b>12</b> is fitted can be made to function as the water drain hole, the installation position of the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b> can be lowered to the vicinity of the lower end of the door inner panel <b>3</b>, whereby the space inside the door (the space denoted by the reference numeral <b>18</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) can be used effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Additionally, since other devices are rarely installed in the vicinity of the opening <b>4</b> in the door interior space <b>18</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>, the worker does not have to pay attention to avoiding the interference with the devices installed in the door interior space <b>18</b><i>a </i>when mounting the speaker unit <b>1</b> on the door inner panel <b>3</b>, and therefore, this can contribute to the enhancement in workability of the speaker unit <b>1</b> mounting work.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Note that the invention is not limited to the embodiment and other modifications made thereto but may be implemented in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">For example, the speaker unit <b>1</b> is mounted on the panel member <b>3</b> so that they are formed into an assembly, which may then be assembled to a frame work of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In addition, in the embodiment, while the speaker unit <b>1</b> is described as being installed in the door of the vehicle, the invention may be applied to a case where the speaker is mounted on the rear parcel shelf. In this case, the rear parcel shelf corresponds to the panel member. Additionally, it goes without saying that the invention can by applied to a case where the speaker is mounted on any other places than the door and the shelf.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Thus, as has been described in detail heretofore, according the in-vehicle speaker rotational mounting structure of the invention, when the general tool such as the screwdriver is inserted into the jig inserting hole with the small force being applied thereto, the speaker housing can be rotated with a large torque.</p>
